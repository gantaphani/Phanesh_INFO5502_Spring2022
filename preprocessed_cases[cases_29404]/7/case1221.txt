mark warsco the trustee is the trustee in bankruptcy for presidential,presidential.he filed this suit against preferred technical group ptg to avoid an alleged preference made to ptg by presidential holdings,llc.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment in the district court the district court granted ptg motion and denied the trustee.the trustee now appeals.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings.
backgrounda.facts 
in,presidential purchased million worth of assets from ptg.presidential executed an unsecured,subordinated promissory note for million in connection with this transaction the note.the principal amount of the note subsequently was reduced to million.
thereafter,presidential began experiencing financial difficulties.monument capital partners,monument,a junior secured creditor of presidential,was dissatisfied with presidential management,and it contacted hans rau,an entrepreneur,to see if rau was interested in purchasing presidential assets.rau apparently accepted monument invitation and formed llc for the express purpose of acquiring presidential assets.
at some point during the negotiations between presidential and llc,ptg became involved in the discussions,although the exact nature and extent of its involvement are not perfectly clear from the record.the asset purchase agreement apa that memorialized the agreement between presidential and llc had a clause that conditioned the transaction on receipt of consent agreements containing releases and waivers from certain parties.ptg apparently was among these parties it sent a letter dated april,to representatives of presidential and monument in which it stated that it would not sign the consent agreement unless we ptg are compensated on an equitable basis for the existing notes we hold against presidential,
on april,ptg sent monument a follow up letter with regard to the presidential sales agreement and subsequent conversations between monument and ptg and with presidential.in this letter,ptg agreed to sign the required consent agreement if,at the time of closing,the parties agree to pay ptg the amount of to cover its outstanding note and accrued interest thereon.id.lastly,ptg stated that,i f the purchase agreement can be modified to include the payment to ptg,then we can move forward on this transaction.id.
john weingardt,the president of presidential,submitted two affidavits in which he explained the nature of ptg involvement in the negotiations.in his first affidavit,weingardt stated that ptg negotiated with presidential and the entities that financed the sale to llc for a share of the proceeds from the sale of presidential assets to llc,at.in his second affidavit,weingardt clarified that,despite these initial negotiations,such a transaction never occurred.instead,llc purchased the note from ptg,and ptg did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of presidential assets,at.
although llc eventually agreed to purchase the note from ptg for,it conditioned its purchase of the note on its ability to purchase presidential assets.similarly,it conditioned its purchase of presidential assets on its ability to purchase the note from ptg for or less.both rau and weingardt submitted affidavits in which they explained that the that llc paid to ptg for the note was not,and was not intended to be,part of the purchase price for presidential assets the payment to ptg did not reduce the amount of debt presidential owed on the note,and presidential did not exercise any control over how,when,or if ptg was paid for the note.
llc offered three reasons for why it wished to purchase the note from ptg.first,llc planned to reduce the principal amount of the note by and to apply this amount toward the purchase price it paid for presidential assets.second,llc thought its purchase of the note would be advantageous to those of presidential creditors with which it expected to do business in the future,which did not include ptg.llc believed that,if it could purchase the note from ptg,presidential other unsecured creditors would recover fifty cents on the dollar in the event presidential declared bankruptcy,whereas ptg received only cents on the dollar for the note.third,llc wanted to secure a place as presidential largest unsecured creditor so as to occupy a position of influence during a potential bankruptcy proceeding,at.
the apa that governed the sale of presidential assets to llc defined the purchase price for the assets as million in cash plus the book value of the liabilities llc assumed plus of debt forbearance on the note llc would purchase from ptg at the time of closing plus a post closing payment pcp of.the total purchase price was subject to an adjustment the amount of the adjustment depended on the value of presidential working capital at the time of closing if presidential working capital was less than,the amount of the adjustment would be less the value of the working capital.the adjustment would be due from presidential to llc,and it would take the form of a decrease in the aggregate amount of the pcp.similarly,if presidential working capital was more than,the amount of the adjustment would be the value of the working capital less.the adjustment would be due from llc to presidential,and it would take the form of an increase in the aggregate amount of the pcp.
the transactions between the parties were consummated on may.the closing cash statement reveals that llc had on hand in cash at the time of closing.of that cash,was wired to national city bank was wired to monument and was wired to ohmite manufacturing company.the total value of these three wires was million.additionally,was wired to extruded metals and was wired to weingardt last but not least,was wired to ptg.the combined value of all these disbursements is,which was less than the total amount of cash on hand.the record provides no indication of what the parties did with this additional cash.
presidential never received its pcp.the value of presidential working capital apparently was less than,although the record does not reveal the degree to which it came up short.the resulting adjustment,however,was large enough to wipe out the entire pcp,so that presidential never received any portion of the 
within one month of the sale of presidential assets to llc,an involuntary bankruptcy petition under chapter was filed against presidential.the money presidential received as a result of the asset sale was sufficient to pay only presidential secured creditors.presidential unsecured creditors received nothing from the bankruptcy estate,instead of the fifty cents on the dollar llc initially thought the asset sale would provide them.the only unsecured creditor to receive any payment was ptg,which received the llc had paid it for the note.the trustee filed this action against ptg to avoid that payment as a preference.
b.earlier proceedings 
the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment in the district court.the court held that the trustee had failed to prove that the payment to ptg was a preference therefore,it granted ptg motion and denied the trustee.according to the district court,the trustee case was lacking in two critical respects.the first shortcoming was that the trustee was unable to demonstrate that the payment to ptg was a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property.see b.the district court did not believe that the payment to ptg was part of the purchase price llc paid to presidential for its assets.as a result,llc independent decision to purchase the note from ptg did not deprive the bankruptcy estate of property it would have had if not for the transfer.because the trustee was unable to demonstrate that llc payment to ptg somehow depleted the bankruptcy estate,he had not established that the payment was an interest of the debtor in property.thus,the district court held that summary judgment was proper on this basis alone.
nevertheless,the district court went on to address a second aspect of the trustee case that,in its view,also served as an alternative basis for summary judgment in favor of ptg.the district court did not believe that the trustee demonstrated that the payment to ptg was for or on account of an antecedent debt owed by presidential.see b.the key inquiry for the district court on this issue was how ptg applied the payment it received from llc.the district court did not believe that the that ptg received from llc reduced the amount of debt presidential owed to the holder of the note instead,llc payment to ptg merely worked a substitution of creditors.thus,the payment was not for an antecedent debt,making summary judgment in favor of ptg appropriate on this ground as well.
discussiona.standard of review 
the trustee appeals the district court entry of summary judgment in favor of ptg.we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,and we view the record and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in favor of the trustee,the nonmovant in this case.see in re smith,cir.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.the nonmovant must show through specific evidence that a triable issue of fact remains on issues on which he bears the burden of proof at trial.see celotex catrett,d.the nonmovant may not rest upon mere allegations in the pleadings or upon conclusory statements in affidavits it must go beyond the pleadings and support its contentions with proper documentary evidence.chemsource,hub group,cir.with these standards in mind,we turn to the merits of this case.
a trustee may avoid certain preferential transfers made from the debtor estate before the debtor declared bankruptcy.see b.the trustee power to avoid preferential transfers is designed to further the bankruptcy code central policy of equality of distribution c reditors of equal priority should receive pro rata shares of the debtor property.begier irs,d.additionally,by preventing the debtor from favoring certain creditors over others and by ensuring an equal distribution,the preference provision helps reduce the incentive to rush to dismember a financially unstable debtor.in re smith,at.
a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property is preferential,and therefore avoidable,if it was made to or for the benefit of a creditor,was for or on account of an antecedent debt,was made while the debtor was insolvent,was made on or within days before the date of the filing of the petition,and allowed the creditor to receive more than it otherwise would have.see b.ptg concedes that most of these elements are met in this case the only elements at issue are whether the payment to ptg constituted a transfer of an interest of presidential in property and whether the transfer was for or on account of an antecedent debt.the trustee bears the burden of proving each of these elements.see boberschmidt soc y bank in re jones,cir.
interest of the debtor in property 
a transfer is only preferential if what was transferred constituted an interest of the debtor in property.the bankruptcy code definition of a transfer is expansive,barnhill johnson,d,and encompasses every mode,direct or indirect,absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary,of disposing of or parting with property or with an interest in property.in the typical preference action,the debtor itself transfers something of value to a particular creditor.as the explicit language of the bankruptcy code makes clear,however,the transfer need not be made directly by the debtor indirect transfers made by third parties to a creditor on behalf of the debtor may also be avoidable under the code.see dean davis.mere circuity of arrangement will not save a transfer which effects a preference from being invalid as such.this case requires us to determine whether llc payment to ptg is avoidable as an indirect transfer of an interest of the debtor in property.
p roperty of the debtor subject to the preferential transfer provision is best understood as that property that would have been part of the estate had it not been transferred before the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings.begier,at.internal quotation marks omitted.courts considering this element of the preference provision have focused on whether the transfer diminished the debtor estate see,buckley,in re interior wood prods,cir in re smith,at mandross peoples banking in re hartley,cir.when a third party pays a creditor of the debtor after having purchased the debtor assets,the fundamental question in determining whether that payment was property of the debtor is whether the funds used to make the payment were part of the purchase price for the assets.see,in re interior wood,at mordy chemcarb,in re food catering housing,cir.if the funds the third party used to pay the creditor were consideration for the debtor sale of its assets,then those funds would have been part of the debtor estate and would have been available for distribution had they not been transferred to the creditor.on the other hand,if the funds used to pay the creditor were not part of the sale price for the debtor assets,then it is unlikely that the payment diminished the debtor estate.instead,the transaction between the third party and the creditor likely was an independent transaction that did not affect the property in the debtor estate available for distribution.
in those cases in which courts have held that a preference was given in the context of an asset sale,there is a fairly direct,traceable link between the consideration given for the debtor assets and the funds used to pay the creditor.for instance,a debtor may sell its assets to a third party,and,as part of the purchase agreement,the third party may agree to assume the debtor liabilities.when the third party subsequently pays a creditor of the debtor,courts have allowed the bankruptcy trustee to recover the payment as a preference.see in re food catering,at sommers burton in re conard,cir.in such cases,the third party assumption of the debtor debt is consideration for the sale of the debtor assets.see in re food catering,at.the debtor effectively transferred to the creditor its right to receive a portion of the sale price equal to the amount of the debt.see in re conard,at.the result is the same when,instead of transferring the money directly to the creditor,the third party deposits the money into an escrow account over which the debtor has no control.see in re interior wood,at.nor does the result change when the third party,rather than the debtor,specifies which creditor will receive the funds paid into the escrow account.see feltman bd.of county comm rs of metro.dade county in re maduro florida.
in contrast to this line of cases are those situations in which two separate transactions occur.see,crews shopping ctr.equities,in re sneakers sports grill.in in re sneakers,the parties entered into a purchase agreement in which a third party agreed to purchase the debtor assets.however,the third party conditioned the purchase on its ability to obtain for a new lease from the debtor landlord,who was also a creditor of the debtor.see id.at.the third party negotiated an agreement with the landlord in which it paid in exchange for a lease and various equipment.see id.at.the trustee in bankruptcy filed suit to recover of that payment as a preference because the debtor owed the landlord that amount in back rent.the court refused to allow the trustee to avoid the payment because there was no evidence that the otherwise would have gone to the debtor.see id.at.instead,the parties testified that the payment to the landlord was not connected to the asset sale,that the was never to go to the debtor,and that the third party financed each transaction from its own funds.see id.at.based on these facts,the court held that the debtor did not have an interest in the because the asset sale and the agreement with the landlord were independent transactions.the payment to the landlord therefore did not affect the debtor estate.see id.at.
in this case,there is no connection similar to an clause between llc payment to ptg and the purchase price for pre
