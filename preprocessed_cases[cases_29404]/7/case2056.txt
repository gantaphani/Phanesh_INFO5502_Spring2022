introduction 
under federal bankruptcy law,the discharge of liability for an unliquidated,contingent or unmatured claim can bar a suit to collect a debt,a,d a in this case,martin flores,according to the first amended complaint,was exposed to asbestos in while performing construction work in a store operated by defendant,kmart corporation.on january,defendant and affiliates filed chapter bankruptcy petitions.in re kmart.on april,the bankruptcy court made findings of fact and conclusions of law and entered an order confirming defendant first amended joint reorganization plan the reorganization plan.in re kmart.the april,order discharged all known and unknown claims against defendant.in support of its demurrer,defendant sought judicial notice of parts of the april,reorganization plan.there is no evidence flores or his family had any notice of the and bankruptcy proceedings.on some unspecified date,flores sustained malignant mesothelioma.the first amended complaint does not allege when flores became aware he was ill.there is no evidence flores identity or illness was reasonably ascertainable by defendant prior to the april,approval of the reorganization plan.on june,flores died of malignant mesothelioma.plaintiffs filed a wrongful death action on december.plaintiffs are flores wife,rachel flores,and their two children,adrian and christian.
defendant contends the april,order approving the reorganization plan and discharge order bars flores family from recovering damages resulting from his alleged asbestos exposure.the parties posit two controlling issues.first,defendant argues that the unliquidated,contingent or unmatured damage claims were discharged by the april,approval of the reorganization plan and discharge order.second,plaintiffs argue the discharge order violates their fourteenth amendment due process rights as there is no evidence they received notice of the potential approval of the reorganization plan.we need not resolve the first a discharge occurred on april.but we do resolve the due process issue.based on the limited record provided by defendant,we conclude that,consistent with fourteenth amendment due process principles,the april,approval of the reorganization plan can not discharge plaintiffs claims.thus,the trial court demurrer dismissal,which is premised on the conclusion the reorganization plan is enforceable against plaintiffs,must be reversed.
we emphasize the narrow nature of our ruling.we merely hold defendant has failed to demonstrate,at the demurrer stage,that the april,approval of the reorganization plan bars all of the first amended complaint claims.and we reach our decision based on the limited record of bankruptcy proceedings provided by defendant.

notice findings 
as will be noted,at issue here is the sufficiency of the proof of notice to plaintiffs of the contemplated confirmation of the reorganization plan and discharge order.the bankruptcy court made two findings relevant to the notice issue.in the reorganization plan,the bankruptcy court found that notice of the confirmation hearing was provided by publication,the debtors published the confirmation hearing notice in the wall street journal national edition,the new york times national edition and usa today national edition on march,additionally,in the reorganization plan,the bankruptcy court found in connection with known claimants due,adequate and sufficient notice of the disclosure statement and plan and of the confirmation hearing,along with all the deadlines for voting on or filing objections to the plan,has been given to all known holders of claims in accordance with the procedures set forth in the solicitation procedures order.the disclosure statement,original plan,ballots,solicitation procedures order,confirmation hearing notice,unimpaired creditors notice,notice of nonvoting status,the unsecured creditors committee solicitation statement with respect to the original plan,and the financial institution committee solicitation statement with respect to the original plan were transmitted and served in substantial compliance with the solicitation procedures order and the bankruptcy rules,and such transmittal and service were adequate and sufficient.adequate and sufficient notice of the confirmation hearing and the other bar dates and hearings described in the solicitation procedures order was given in compliance with the bankruptcy rules and the solicitation procedures order,and no other or further notice is or shall be required.

demurrer opposition 
plaintiffs argued the bankruptcy orders did not discharge their asbestos claim which is a unique tort because asbestos injuries are normally latent the absence of notice of the bankruptcy proceedings does not satisfy due process standards when the claimant injuries have not manifested and without manifestation,an asbestos claimant would either lack knowledge of the injury or could not be identified as a victim.plaintiffs argued defendant notice of the contemplated reorganization plan was inadequate.plaintiffs argued notice by publication was inadequate to provide reasonable notice to potential asbestos claimants of the proposed reorganization plan.and,plaintiffs argued there were no provisions in the confirmation order addressing potential asbestos claimants.plaintiffs asserted the trial court should apply the fair contemplation analysis utilized by the ninth circuit court of appeals.under the fair contemplation law,no discharge may occur if the claimant could not reasonably contemplate the existence of the claim prior to the debtor reorganization.according to plaintiffs,the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over their claims against defendant,which are outside the bankruptcy estate.as can be noted,plaintiffs expressly asserted enforcement of the april,reorganization plan would violate their due process rights.
reply to opposition 
in reply,defendant asserted plaintiffs can not dispute that federal bankruptcy law provides that an asbestos claim arises at the moment of contact the notice was adequate as a matter of law it was not required to comply with standards requiring a trust to administer asbestos claims that manifest due to the latent nature of mesothelioma and it has had no pending asbestos litigation.defendant further argued the bankruptcy court had exclusive jurisdiction over the interpretation,implementation and scope of its order plaintiffs remedy against defendant was to file an action for a determination and adjudication of whether the claims are discharged in bankruptcy court plaintiffs are required to secure an order lifting the bankruptcy court injunction order before proceeding with this action and in article xiv of the reorganization plan,jurisdiction was retained to adjudicate questions about the existence,nature and scope of the discharge.defendant presented no new judicially noticeable materials in connection with the reply.
e.the trial court ruling 
the trial court ruled that,because defendant was not being sued as a manufacturer or producer of asbestos products,the trust issues were not pertinent.rather,defendant was being sued on various premises liability theories.the trial court ruled defendant premises liability obligations to creditors had been resolved by the bankruptcy court.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.rt ja this timely appeal followed.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
the supreme court has defined our task as follows on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend,the standard of review is well settled.we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citations.further,we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but do not assume the truth of contentions,deductions,or conclusions of law.citations.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse.city of dinuba county of tulare cal th,d,people ex rel.lungren superior court cal th,d.
in order for the demurrer to be sustained,the first amended complaint and the judicially noticeable reorganization plan must demonstrate plaintiffs claims are in fact barred by the bankruptcy court discharge order.casterson superior court th,d a demurrer based on an affirmative defense will be sustained only where the face of the complaint discloses that the action is necessarily barred by the defense.crosstalk productions,jacobson th,d a demurrer based on an affirmative defense can not properly be sustained where the action might be barred by the defense,but is not necessarily barred.see mckenney purepac pharmaceutical th,d t he issue before us is whether the allegations of that pleading,in conjunction with other matters that may be judicially noticed demonstrate that all possible recovery by plaintiff is barred by the defense of federal preemption.discharge in bankruptcy of a cause of action asserted in state court litigation is a defense.in re pavelich,discharge in bankruptcy is a recognized defense under state law forman scott d.harrell hoagland d,d ischarge in bankruptcy is a special defense and it must be pleaded.if it is unclear whether the reorganization plan and discharge order are enforceable against plaintiffs,the demurrer must be overruled.stormedia superior court cal th,d,fn.when judicial notice is taken of a document,however,the truthfulness and proper interpretation of the document are disputable.williams southern california gas th,d j udicial notice of matters upon demurrer will be dispositive only in those instances where there is not or can not be a factual dispute concerning that which is sought to be judicially noticed.in cruz county of los angeles d,the court of appeal explained in a case where judicial notice was sought of a practice of mailing rejection notices a ssuming for purposes of argument that respondent customary practice in respect of mailing notices of rejection constituted an official act,of which judicial notice might be taken citation,there was not incontrovertibly contained therein the fact that such practice had been followed in the present instance.on the contrary,it was the very dispute over that fact which occasioned the request for judicial notice of the practice.accordingly,and because it was inappropriate at that stage of the proceedings to resolve the factual issue involved,it was error for the trial court to sustain respondent demurrer.
jurisdiction 
defendant argues no state court has jurisdiction to determine whether the debts were discharged.according to defendant the issue of the application of the april,findings and orders should have been resolved by the bankruptcy court.and defendant argues the bankruptcy court retained exclusive jurisdiction to interpret the breadth and scope of the discharge order.generally,state and federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction to decide whether a claim within a discharge order is a discharged debt.b t he district courts shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.in re pavelich,supra,at s tate courts have the power to construe the discharge and determine whether a particular debt is or is not within the discharge.in re siragusa cir,in re franklin.thus,a state court may consider the applicability of a bankruptcy discharge when it is raised as a defense to an action.local loan hunt.the effect of the discharge in bankruptcy is a matter to be determined by any court in which the discharge may be pleaded.in re mcghan cir,in re gruntz cir,in re lenke.
