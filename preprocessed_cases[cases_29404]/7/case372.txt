the action giving rise to this appeal was commenced in the united states district court for the southern district of new york cedarbaum,by official committee of the unsecured creditors of color tile,color tile committee,as assignee of the bankruptcy estate of color tile,against coopers lybrand,llp coopers,an accounting firm that provided auditing and consulting services for color tile and its controlling shareholders.the services were provided in connection with a merger and acquisition transaction the transaction and a public debt offering that was used to finance the transaction.the gravamen of the claims asserted against coopers is that it breached the fiduciary duties it owed to color tile,as well as the terms and conditions of its consulting agreement with color tile,by failing to disclose to color tile board of directors all material information pertaining to the transaction.color tile committee alleges that the transaction would not have taken place had these disclosures been made.the district court dismissed the claims for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract set forth in the second amended complaint upon a finding that,under texas law,the complaint failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted because the facts pled therein demonstrated as a matter of law the affirmative defense of in pari delicto.the district court subsequently denied a motion filed by color tile committee to reconsider the dismissal of the second amended complaint in light of the district court decision to grant partial summary judgment in favor of certain other defendants and for leave to file a third amended complaint.
on appeal,color tile committee principally argues that the district court erred in dismissing its second amended complaint on the pleadings because the defense of in pari delicto had not been established as a matter of law.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of the district court,although we decline to embrace the entirety of the district court analysis of texas law with respect to the in pari delicto defense.
background 
the facts forming the basis for this litigation are set forth in two comprehensive published opinions written by the district court,see official comm.of unsecured creditors of color tile,investcorp,d color tile i official comm.of unsecured creditors of color tile,investcorp,d color tile ii,familiarity with which is assumed.we therefore summarize below only those facts and proceedings relevant to the present appeal.
events leading up to the district court proceedings 
before it ceased operations,color tile was a delaware corporation,headquartered in fort worth,texas,that was a large specialty retailer of floor covering products.since approximately,color tile was a portfolio company of the investcorp group,an affiliation of investment entities engaged in the business of acquiring control of companies by investing its own funds as well as the funds of its wealthy foreign investors.the investcorp group was a client of coopers,which had performed the due diligence on color tile before color tile was acquired by the investcorp group and which had been retained as color tile outside auditor after the investcorp group acquired color tile.
in,the investcorp group attempted to make color tile a more attractive candidate for an initial public offering by arranging for color tile to acquire the assets of american blind factory abf,a,company headquartered in michigan that sold blinds and wallpaper through direct response marketing and retail stores.through a series of complicated m a transactions,color tile through a subsidiary eventually acquired abf assets and certain of its liabilities in late.the total cost of the transaction to color tile was approximately million.to finance the transaction,the investcorp group arranged for color tile to raise million in a public bond offering.the proceeds from this offering were used to pay the purchase price and transaction costs of the transaction and to retire certain preexisting color tile bank debt that its lenders required color tile to pay down before they would consent to the transaction 
coopers performed certain consulting services for color tile in connection with the transaction and the bond offering,the most significant of which were reviewing abf financial condition,performing due diligence on abf,and analyzing how color tile would financially perform after acquiring abf assets.color tile committee alleges that,as a result of these activities,coopers learned that the financial projections used by the investcorp group to substantiate the transaction were unrealistic and that,because these financial projections bore no resemblance to the actual performance of the two companies,there was a significant risk that color tile would be unable to meet its financial obligations as they came due and to operate its business in a competitive fashion after the transaction closed.this alleged knowledge on the part of coopers is referred to as the negative conclusions in the various complaints subsequently filed by color tile committee.coopers allegedly failed to share these negative conclusions with the color tile board of directors,three of whom were members of color tile management management directors and two of whom were affiliated with the investcorp group investcorp group directors.
the investcorp group optimistic financial projections about the color combined operations never came to pass,and color tile began to experience difficulties servicing its new debt.in or about december,color tile defaulted on a million interest payment due on its bonds,and the following month it filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.in september of,a global settlement was reached between color tile bankruptcy estate and its various creditors,pursuant to which an assignment was made to color tile committee authorizing it to prosecute certain claims on behalf of the bankruptcy estate.
ii.district court proceedings 
in december,color tile committee filed a complaint in the district court against various investcorp group affiliates investcorp group defendants,the investcorp group directors,and coopers.the complaint was amended once in march first amended complaint and once again in august second amended complaint after the district court had granted from the bench coopers motion to dismiss on the ground that,under new york law,the facts pled in the first amended complaint demonstrated as a matter of law the affirmative defense of in pari delicto.
color tile committee alleged several causes of action against coopers in its second amended complaint,only two of which are relevant to this appeal.first,color tile committee alleged that coopers breached the fiduciary duties it owed to color tile by not informing color tile board of directors of the negative conclusions,and in particular,that the transaction was being forced on color tile by the investcorp group for the interests of the investcorp group and was detrimental to the interests of color tile and the transaction created a grave risk that color tile would be unable to meet its obligations as they became due and operate its business competitively.color tile committee further alleged that coopers breach of its fiduciary duties to color tile proximately caused damage to color tile,because absent the breach,color tile would not have consummated the transaction.in particular,color tile committee alleged that,if coopers had informed color tile board of coopers negative conclusions,the management directors would have informed the underwriter of the bond offering and the lenders whose consents were required to close the transaction of the negative conclusions.allegedly,those entities would not have permitted the transaction to close had they been so informed.second,color tile committee alleged that coopers breached its consulting contract with color tile to perform the due diligence for the transaction either by not discovering the negative conclusions or by discovering them and not reporting them to the board 
color tile committee also alleged several causes of action against the investcorp group defendants and the investcorp group directors,only one of which is relevant to this appeal.according to color tile committee,the investcorp group defendants breached the duties of loyalty that they owed to color tile as controlling shareholders by forcing color tile to purchase the abf assets on unreasonable terms,by paying a purchase price that was allegedly more than twice the fair market value of the assets and by incurring additional bond debt that bore a much higher rate of interest than the bank debt it was retiring as a condition to closing the transaction that were were dictated by them.the investcorp defendants were allegedly motivated to breach their duties of loyalty both by their desire to cash out their shares at a premium in a potential future color tile initial public offering and the approximately million in fees they received in connection with the transaction.in particular,color tile committee alleged that the investcorp group defendants dictated the terms and price that color tile paid for the abf assets,and responded to the objections made by the management directors by freezing them out of the transaction and by handling all of the arrangements themselves and not permitting color tile to seek advice from independent advisors,experts or other sources as to whether the t ransaction was fair to color tile.
about one month after the parties briefed coopers motion to dismiss the second amended complaint for failing to state claims upon which relief could be granted,the district court,apparently sua sponte,ordered supplemental briefing on whether the claims now on appeal were governed by new york or texas law.following this supplemental briefing,in november,the district court granted coopers motion to dismiss the second amended complaint,pursuant to.b,on the ground that the facts alleged in the complaint failed to state claims upon which relief could be granted.after concluding that texas law governed the claims asserted against coopers,the district court found that color tile committee had standing to sue coopers on behalf of color tile,even though color tile board had unanimously voted in favor of approving the abf deal.see color tile i,d at.but,the court concluded,the only texas case on point suggested that if collaboration by color tile management with coopers were established on the face of the second amended complaint,dismissal of the complaint for pleading the affirmative defense of in pari delicto would be appropriate.id.
according to the district court,the affirmative defense of in pari delicto is limited to situations where the plaintiff bore at least substantially equal responsibility for his injury.id.at.relying on color tile committee allegations in the second amended complaint that the color tile board approved the transaction knowing that it was based on grossly inflated and exaggerated projections of revenue growth,and that the investcorp group acting as color tile sole shareholder forced the abf deal on color tile against warnings from color tile management,the district court found that color tile,through its board and sole shareholder,bore at least substantially equal responsibility with coopers for permitting the transaction to go forward on the basis of inflated projections.id.accordingly,b ecause all the facts that give rise to an in pari delicto affirmative defense were alleged in the second amended complaint,the district court found it was proper to dismiss both the breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract claims under rule b.id.
about eighteen months after dismissing color tile committee claims against coopers,the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the investcorp group defendants and the investcorp group directors on several of the claims alleged in the second amended complaint,including the claim that,as controlling shareholders,the investcorp group defendants breached the duties of loyalty that they owed to color tile by forcing the company to close the transaction.see color tile ii,d.the district court offered three reasons to support its conclusion that,as a matter of law,the investcorp group defendants did not breach their duties of loyalty to color tile,the third of which was that a ll the evidence demonstrates that the interests of the shareholder defendants were aligned with,and not in conflict with,the interests of all the other shareholders.id.at.in particular,in response to color tile committee claim that the management directors had approved the deal because they feared that if they opposed it,they would be replaced by the investcorp group defendants,the district court found that t he only evidence in the record on this point directly refutes plaintiff speculation.id.at.indeed,all of the management directors testified during their depositions that their decision to approve the transaction was not influenced by the fear of losing their job s.id.
in october,the remaining claims against the investcorp group defendants were dismissed as part of a million settlement.two weeks later,color tile committee moved,pursuant to.b,to revise the district court november order dismissing the claims against coopers,to reinstate the breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract claims against coopers,and for leave to amend the second amended complaint to conform it to the evidence in accordance with the district court summary judgment decision in color tile ii.on november,the district court entered final judgment dismissing with prejudice the claims against coopers,and on december,it denied color tile committee rule b motion,characterizing it as an untimely motion to amend the pleading because of the lack of evidence.on the same day,color tile committee filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
does color tile committee have standing to bring these claims 
the district court dismissed the claims against coopers,even though it found that color tile committee had standing to bring those claims.on appeal,coopers argues that the district court decision can be affirmed on the alternative ground that the district court misinterpreted texas law and should have held that color tile committee lacked standing to bring those claims.indeed,b ecause standing is jurisdictional under article iii,it is a threshold issue in all cases since putative plaintiffs lacking standing are not entitled to have their claims litigated in federal court.shearson lehman hutton,wagoner,cir.we therefore first address the issue of standing.
as assignee of the color tile bankruptcy estate,color tile committee stands in the shoes of color tile and has standing to bring any suit that color tile could have instituted had it not petitioned for bankruptcy.id.at citing.conversely,color tile committee can not sue for claims that could have been brought by color tile creditors.id.furthermore,state law determines whether a right to sue belongs to color tile or to the individual creditors.in re mediators,cir see also in re educators group health trust,cir educators.
the district court concluded that texas law should be applied to determine whether color tile committee claims against coopers for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract belong to color tile or to its creditors,see color tile i,d at,and the parties do not contest that conclusion in this appeal.in educators,the fifth circuit,interpreting texas law held that the trustee of a bankrupt health insurance than the bankrupt trust standing to pursue state court actions in which it was alleged that the defendants administrators of the trust breached their contract with the trust and breached their fiduciary duties to the trust.at.one of the arguments rejected by the fifth circuit was that the causes of action listed in the complaint are not the property of the estate because the debtor representatives participated in the acts or omissions giving rise to the causes of actions.id.at.implicit in this argument,the court opined,was the notion that a debtor can not raise a cause of action for which the defendant may have a valid defense on the merits.id.in rejecting that notion,the fifth circuit found no support for the proposition that a defense on the merits of a claim brought by the debtor precludes the debtor from bringing the claim.id.according to the court,t hat the defendant may have a valid defense on the merits of a claim brought by the debtor goes to the resolution of the claim,and not to the ability of the debtor to assert the claim.id.
the parties agree that the unspecified valid defense referenced by the court in educators is the in pari delicto defense.in a somewhat cryptic footnote,however,the fifth circuit stated that it could not conclude from the allegations in the complaint whether representatives of the bankrupt trust actually participated in the acts or omissions giving rise to the causes of action,and for that reason the court found misplaced the reliance on the second circuit decision in wagoner because,in wagoner,it was uncontested that the management of the debtor corporation cooperated with the defendant in stripping the corporation of its assets.id.quoting wagoner,at.
here,the district court relied on educators in concluding that color tile committee had standing to sue coopers for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract.see color tile i,d at.the parties agree that educators is the only case interpreting texas law with respect to whether color tile committee has standing to bring the claims it alleges against coopers,but they disagree over whether color tile committee has standing under this decision,given both color tile committee allegation that color tile board and controlling shareholders approved the transaction and the contents of the footnote distinguishing our decision in wagoner.despite the footnote,the fifth circuit decision plainly supports the district court conclusion that color tile committee had standing to sue coopers,regardless of the complicity of color tile in coopers alleged misconduct.the dicta in the footnote distinguishing wagoner does not change this result,for it distinguishes a decision of this court that did not purport to apply texas law accordingly,we find that,under texas law,color tile committee had standing to bring color tile breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract claims against coopers.
ii.was the affirmative defense of in pari delicto established as a matter of texas law by the facts pled in the second amended complaint 
a complaint should not be dismissed pursuant to.b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.cooper parsky,cir quoting conley gibson,d.a court task in ruling on a rule b motion is merely to assess the legal feasibility of the complaint,not to assay the weight of the evidence which might be offered in support thereof.id.quoting ryder energy distribution merrill lynch commodities,cir.furthermore,a court must accept as true all factual allegations in the complaint.id.finally,a complaint can be dismissed for failure to state a claim pursuant to a rule b motion raising an affirmative defense if the defense appears on the face of the complaint.pani empire blue cross blue shield,cir citing charles wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure,supp.we review de novo a dismissal for failure to state a claim.cooper,at.
the defense of in pari delicto derives from the latin in pari delicto potior est conditio defendantis in other words,where the wrong of the one party equals that of the other,the defendant is in the stronger position,and a court will not administer a remedy.jur d equity.as one texas court described the basis for this ancient rule 
w hile a court of equity will on swift wings fly to relieve the innocent from wrong and injury,it travels with leaded feet and turns a deaf ear,when called on to furnish a cloak of righteousness to cover sin,and,where both parties are equally guilty,neither can be said to come with clean hands,and the court will relieve neither,but leave the parties where they are found.
grant grant.on appeal,color tile committee argues that the district court erred in dismissing both its breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty claims at the pleading stage.
in dismissing the second amended complaint on the ground that the affirmative defense of in pari delicto had been established as a matter of texas law,the district court did not make any distinctions between the applicability of that defense to color tile committee breach of contract claims and its breach of fiduciary duty claims.we analyze separately the applicability of this defense to each of these claims below.
breach of contract claims 
on appeal,color tile committee argues that in pari delicto generally has been rejected by courts as applying to breach of contract claims,absent an allegation that the breached contract was unlawful.see,in re olympia brewing.sec,wl,dist.lexis.moreover,color tile committee argues that we should construe the absence of any reported texas cases in which in pari delicto was raised as an affirmative defense to claims that a lawful contract was breached as evidence that texas courts would not permit the defense to be raised in these circumstances.
coopers urges that we affirm the dismissal of the breach of contract claims on two alternative grounds.first,coopers argues that color tile committee did not raise this argument in its opposition to coopers motion to dismiss the second amended complaint and only raised it for the first time in a footnote to its legal memorandum in support of its rule b motion.consequently,coopers argues that the argument has been waived and that we should not consider it.in the alternative,coopers argues that color tile committee of how they are pled in the second amended really accounting malpractice claims,and thus should be subject to in pari delicto.alternatively,coopers argues that texas does not permit accounting malpractice claims to be pled as breach of contract claims.
generally,we will not consider an argument on appeal that was raised for the first time below in a motion for reconsideration.union fire,ins.stroh,cir.this waiver rule,is one of prudence,however,and not jurisdictional.baker dorfman,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we retain broad discretion to consider issues not timely raised below.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in determining whether to consider such issues,we are more likely to exercise our discretion when either consideration of the issue is necessary to avoid manifest injustice or the issue is purely legal and there is no need for additional factfinding.id.internal quotation marks omitted.while the latter exception might seem applicable here on its face,we decline to reach color tile committee contract claims arguments.
our discretion to decide purely legal issues derives from the supreme court pronouncement that where the proper resolution is beyond any doubt,an appellate court may legitimately exercise its discretion to hear an issue not addressed below.singleton wulff,d stating that this discretion is left primarily to the courts of appeals and is subject to no general rule see also reg.sch.dist.bd.of,cir describing the exception under which an appellate court will reach a purely legal question as a subset of the court discretion outlined in singleton to resolve issues where the proper outcome is beyond any doubt.most pure issues of law are issues where proper resolution is beyond any doubt.
here,of course,the proper resolution of the legal issues concerning the applicability of the in pari delicto defense to the claims styled by color tile committee as breach of contract claims is far from beyond any doubt.first,it is not beyond doubt whether the claims styled as breach of contract claims in the second amended complaint are,indeed,breach of contract claims,as opposed to malpractice claims.for example,in hirsch arthur andersen,cir,we held that the breach of contract claims brought against an accounting firm relating to due diligence performed in connection with a corporate acquisition sounded only in malpractice and not in contract,notwithstanding how they were pled in the complaint the law in texas is not so settled,however.texas courts plainly disfavor breach of contract claims brought against accountants in connection with their performing traditional auditing services.see,fdic ernst young,cir.bank ernst whinney.there are no texas cases on point,however,concerning whether this disfavored treatment extends to breach of contract claims like those pled in the second amended complaint brought against accountants in connection with consulting services that fall outside their traditional tax and auditing services.color tile committee directs our attention to dicta in southwestern bell telephone delanney,where the texas supreme court labeled a suit filed against a yellow pages owner for failing to list the plaintiff name as a breach of contract claim but opined that some contracts involve special relationships that may give rise to duties enforceable in tort.but,to the extent that this question turns on the language of the consulting contract between color tile and coopers,we face the additional obstacle that the contract has not been furnished to us at bottom,the record lacks the information required to determine the precise nature of this contract,so deciding whether this contract in particular moves coopers beyond the position articulated in sledge and into the liability exception left open in delanney would require guesswork on our part.
second,were we to decide that these claims are really malpractice claims dressed up as breach of contract claims,it is not beyond doubt whether such claims are barred by the in pari delicto defense under texas law.color tile committee asserts that the defense is not available in negligence or malpractice cases,as the defense is not compatible with the texas proportionate responsibility act passed in.see.civ.prac.ann.et.vernon.as discussed above,the district court relied on the fifth circuit decision in educators,which held that in pari delicto is a valid defense to claims for breach of duty of care owed,see at,brought by a bankruptcy estate while the fifth circuit never mentioned the doctrine of in pari delicto,the district court in the case at bar observed that t he parties are in agreement that the affirmative defense to which the fifth circuit refer red was the equitable defense of in pari delicto.color tile i,d at in any event,we have found no texas cases sustaining an in pari delicto defense to malpractice before or after the enactment of the texas proportionate responsibility act.
finally,were we to decide that these claims are breach of contract claims,it is not beyond doubt that the in pari delicto defense is available in contract claims where the contract is not alleged either to violate public policy or to be unlawful.this is yet another area of in pari delicto jurisprudence that remains uncharted in texas.
given all of these unanswered questions concerning issues of first impression under texas law,the pure legal issue presented on appeal by color tile committee in this diversity perhaps worthy of certification if raised in another by definition subject to contradictory interpretations and thus not beyond any doubt.accordingly,we decline to reach out,exercise our discretion,and address the merits of a belated argument where there has been no showing made of manifest injustice.
breach of fiduciary duty claims 
presuming the applicability of some form of the in pari delicto defense to color tile committee breach of fiduciary duty claims,the district court observed that color tile,through its board and controlling shareholders,bore at least substantially equal responsibility with coopers for permitting the transaction to go forward on the basis of inflated projections.color tile i,d at.this finding was in accord with the district court interpretation of texas law that the in pari delicto defense applies in situations where the plaintiff bore at least substantially equal responsibility for his injury.id.the allegations in the second amended complaint relied upon by the district court in establishing that color tile bore substantially equal responsibility with coopers were that color tile board approved the transaction knowing that it was based on grossly inflated and exaggerated projections of revenue growth,and that the investcorp group acting as color tile sole shareholder forced the transaction on color tile against warnings from color tile management.on appeal,color tile committee argues that the district court erred in finding,as a matter of law,that the in pari delicto defense applied to its breach of fiduciary duty claims,because the application of this defense is very fact intensive and thus adjudicating its merits on a rule b motion to dismiss was inappropriate.
was the district court interpretation of texas in pari delicto doctrine correct 
as an initial matter,we are not as certain as the district court and the parties that the interpretation of the in pari delicto doctrine applied here by the district court is one that would be applied by the courts of texas.there are no texas cases opining on the applicability of the in pari delicto defense in a factual situation analogous to that alleged by color tile committee.rather,the cases decided in texas arise where a party seeks to excuse its failure to perform on the ground that the transaction was unlawful.the texas courts response to this defense is that the party seeking to avoid performance may not be able to do so on this ground.see,lewis davis,graham dean,am.ins.tabor.the rule in texas,even in the case of an unlawful transaction,is that courts must decide whether the policy against assisting a wrongdoer outweighs the policy against permitting unjust enrichment of one party at the expense of the other,and this balancing of the equities often depends upon the peculiar facts and the equities of the case,and the answer usually given is that which it is thought will better serve public policy.lewis,at.
texas and other federal courts have applied a federal in pari delicto defense that also uses this concept of not allowing wrongdoers to benefit at the expense of the public in adjudicating private rights of action arising under various federal regulatory statutes.for example,in banc one capital partners kneipper,cir,a securities fraud action filed under federal and state securities laws,the court quoted language from the supreme court decision in bateman eichler,hill richards,berner,d,to the effect that parties are in pari delicto where the plaintiff bears at least substantially equal responsibility for the violations he seeks to redress.as another court explained,after opining that tension apparently existed between the objectives of federal securities regulatory scheme and this common law equitable defense,the elements of the regulatory version of this defense in the fifth circuit are that the fault of the parties must be clearly mutual,simultaneous,and relatively equal the plaintiff must be an active,essential,and knowing participant in the illegal activity and the effect on the investing public or on the regulatory scheme,caused by permitting the defense,must be so slight that it does not interfere with the objectives of the securities laws.miller interfirst bank dallas.
in finding that in pari delicto was established in the second amended complaint as a matter of texas law,the district court relied exclusively on this regulatory line of in pari delicto cases,see color tile i,d at,as did the parties in their briefs,even though the facts of the case at bar are not analogous to the facts in these cases.our research has found no recent texas case law on point indeed,in kalb,voorhis american financial,cir a case not cited by the district court or the previously applied the regulatory interpretation of in pari delicto as the law of texas in concluding that a creditor of a bankrupt corporation had standing to sue the corporation former controlling shareholder on a theory that the corporation and defendant were alter egos and that the corporate veil between the two should be pierced.in reaching this conclusion,we rejected the argument that the bankrupt corporation was in pari delicto with its controlling shareholder because the former participated with the latter in its self dealing.id.with respect to the in pari delicto defense,we held that,where the parties do not stand on equal terms and one party controls the other,the in pari delicto doctrine does not apply.id.in so holding,we relied on our decision in ross bolton,cir,where we stated that where both parties are in delicto,but not in pari delicto,a trial court should make findings regarding the respective amount of blame assigned to each,granting relief to the one whose wrong is less.kalb cited no texas case law in support of its decision to apply the regulatory interpretation of in pari delicto found in federal common law to a set of facts not arising in the regulatory context.
given the paucity of recent texas authority applying the in pari delicto defense to facts such as those giving rise to this appeal,we decline to endorse the interpretation of that defense applied by the district court and briefed by the parties.we will nevertheless review the district court analysis by applying that interpretation because the parties have not urged us to apply a different one and because we can find no texas authority clearly repudiating or endorsing it.as they have done with their argument discussed above and for similar reasons,color tile committee has thus waived its argument that the district court formulation of texas in pari delicto defense is incorrect.but thompson county of franklin,cir winter,concurring in the judgment declining to decide appeal based on clearly incorrect legal stipulation of federal law by the parties on the ground that doing so would be tantamount to issuing an advisory opinion.
did color tile have at least substantially equal responsibility with coopers 
turning to the district court conclusion that the in pari delicto affirmative defense was established as a matter of texas law by the facts pled in the second amended complaint,we agree with the district court that color tile,through its board and controlling shareholders,bore at least substantially equal responsibility with coopers for permitting the transaction to go forward on the basis of inflated projections.color tile i,d at.in particular,the color tile board unanimously approved the transaction,notwithstanding the management directors express warning that the purchase price was grossly excessive,the projections supporting the transaction were unrealistic and exaggerated,and the transaction would impose an imprudent and unmanageable debt structure on color tile.moreover,the second amended complaint alleges that coopers either deliberately or negligently failed to advise the board about what the board already knew.thus,since the board allegedly had the same knowledge that coopers allegedly should have disclosed,the pleadings established at least equal fault on the part of the board.with respect to color tile controlling investcorp second amended complaint is strewn with allegations establishing that the investcorp group was responsible for every detail of the transaction from the decision to purchase the abf assets,to dictating the terms and the price that color tile paid for the abf assets,to dictat ing the terms of the bond offering,to finally dominat ing color tile board of directors and forc ing color tile to consummate the transaction.consequently,color tile committee pleadings also established that color tile controlling shareholders were at least equally at fault with coopers.
on appeal,color tile committee raises several challenges to the district court conclusion that in pari delicto was established as a matter of law in the second amended complaint,none of which we find persuasive.
dismissal at the pleadings stage 
color tile committee first argues that,under texas law,in pari delicto can never be established on the pleadings because issues of relative fault are quintessential fact questions for the jury.color tile committee cites no texas cases on point in support of this position indeed,this court has affirmed the dismissal of breach of fiduciary duty claims on the pleadings upon findings that in pari delicto had been established in the complaints.see in re mediators,hirsch.consequently,there was nothing inherently wrong with the district court dismissal of the pleadings on in pari delicto grounds.
adverse interest actor rule 
color tile committee next argues that the district court improperly attributed the misconduct of color tile controlling shareholders,the investcorp group,to color tile because the investcorp group interests were adverse to color tile.see askanase fatjo,cir knowledge and actions of a corporation agent will not be imputed to the corporation if the agent was acting adversely to the corporation and entirely for his own or another purpose so that the agent endeavors are so incompatible that they destroy the agency this argument also lacks merit.as the district court correctly noted,where,as here,the persons dominating and controlling the corporation orchestrated the fraudulent conduct,their knowledge is imputed to the corporation as principal under the sole actor rule,which negates the adverse interest exception when the principal and agent are one and the same.color tile i,d at citing in re mediators,at ernst young,at.this rule imputes the agent knowledge to the principal notwithstanding the agent because the party that should have been informed was the agent itself albeit in its capacity as principal.mediators,at.
relying on precedents applying the sole actor rule from this circuit,color tile committee argues that the sole actor rule does not apply here principally because there were relevant decision makers who were not engaged in the fraud and who would have stopped the transaction if they had known of coopers negative conclusions.in particular,the second amended complaint alleges that,if the management directors had known of the negative conclusions,they could and would have prevented the transaction from closing by going outside the company and informing the company underwriter and lenders,neither of which would have sold the notes or otherwise financed the transaction in the face of coopers negative conclusions.
we initially note that the second circuit precedents cited by color tile committee did not apply texas law,so they are not dispositive here.moreover,in ernst young,the fifth circuit rejected a similar argument made by the assignee of a bankrupt corporation trustee,which was suing the company outside accountants for negligently auditing the company.the court found that,as a matter of law,the corporation could not have been misled by the auditor failure to disclose certain negative financial information about the company because the company sole shareholder committed the fraud that was the cause of the company dire financial situation and his knowledge of the fraud was imputed to the corporation under the sole actor rule.at.the assignee then argued that the accounting firm negligence still could have caused losses to the company because,had the audits been accurate,someone,such as the company creditors or government regulators,would have rescued the company.id.the fifth circuit responded that this argument was flawed because the company could not claim that it should recover from the accounting firm for not being rescued by a third party for something the company was already aware of and chose to ignore.id.likewise,color tile committee alleged that the management directors approved the transaction knowing that the purchase price and the debt were excessive,and thus the possibility that color tile creditors or underwriter would have rescued color tile if informed of the negative conclusions is legally irrelevant.accordingly,the district court properly concluded that the sole actor rule negated the applicability of the adverse interest exception.
pleading in the alternative 
color tile committee next argues for the first time on appeal that the claims against the investcorp group defendants are irrelevant to the claims against coopers and thus the former knowledge and conduct should not be considered when analyzing the legal sufficiency of the claims against coopers under some form of alternative pleading analysis.in particular,color tile committee relies on our dec
