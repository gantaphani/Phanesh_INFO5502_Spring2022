rick lange,the bankruptcy trustee for debtors brook valley iv,joint venture,and brook valley vii,joint venture,brought suit against robert schropp,leo dahlke,and several entities controlled by schropp dahlke.lange alleges that schropp and dahlke breached their fiduciary duties to the bankruptcy estates and converted property of the estates.after a trial,the bankruptcy court concluded that schropp and dahlke had violated their fiduciary duties.to remedy this breach,the court imposed a constructive trust on their gains from the sale of the properties and awarded damages.both sides appealed to the eighth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap,which affirmed the bankruptcy court finding that schropp and dahlke had breached their fiduciary duties.lange schropp in re brook valley iv,cir.bap.as to the remedy,the bap approved the bankruptcy court imposition of a constructive trust,and directed the award of additional damages beyond those granted by the bankruptcy court.we affirm the ruling of the bap.
schropp and dahlke were partners in thirteen commercial real estate partnerships with prime realty,an entity controlled by james mccart.the debtors,brook valley iv and brook valley vii,were two of these partnerships,with each owning a single commercial property in omaha.in september,a dispute arose between the partners in the brook valley joint ventures.in response to this falling out,mccart company prime realty filed suit to dissolve all thirteen partnerships,including the two at issue in this appeal.by march,several lenders had foreclosed on the partnerships properties,causing schropp,dahlke,and prime realty to lose substantial sums of money.as a result,prime realty filed for bankruptcy protection in march.
the brook valley partnerships suffered a similar fate.when the initial construction loans came due,the primary lender,first national bank of omaha,refused to extend the repayment term,forcing the brook valley partnerships to file for bankruptcy on april.in addition to the mortgage with first national,the properties were allegedly encumbered by liens held by darland construction company and prime realty,though there was some dispute as to the validity of these liens.after filing for bankruptcy,both partnerships acted as debtors in possession under the exclusive control of schropp and dahlke.
seventeen days after filing for bankruptcy protection,schropp and dahlke,acting on behalf of the bankruptcy estates,consented to a foreclosure sale of the two brook valley properties.prime realty,the entity controlled by mccart and a partner in both ventures,objected to the sale,arguing that it did not serve the interests of the bankruptcy estates.mccart argued that the properties had substantial equity and produced sufficient rents to service the debt to first national.concerned that schropp and dahlke were unwilling to act in the estates interests,prime realty requested the appointment of a trustee.after the bankruptcy court denied this request,mccart remained convinced that the properties were more valuable than schropp and dahlke had acknowledged,and he attempted to buy the properties at the foreclosure sale.because of prime realty precarious financial position,mccart could not raise the necessary capital.
the foreclosure sale occurred on september.the winning bidder,at a combined cost of for both properties,was phoenix properties llc,an entity controlled by schropp and dahlke.schropp and dahlke did not disclose their controlling interest in phoenix properties.at the time of the sale,both great western bank and first national conducted appraisals of the properties.great western appraised the properties at,while first national valued them between and.these appraisals suggest that phoenix purchased the properties at a considerable discount.thus,the decision to consent to the foreclosure sale had proved lucrative for schropp and dahlke,if not for the bankruptcy estates and the creditors.
schropp and dahlke financed most of the acquisition with a loan from great western bank,while an entity called phoenix brook valley provided an additional.the terms of the foreclosure sale required all bidders other than first national to pay in cash the amount of the estates debt to first national.any amount beyond this would be paid to the bankruptcy court pending a determination of the priority of the remaining liens.phoenix properties failed to abide by this stricture,purporting to credit bid the amount of the darland lien,rather than pay this amount to the bankruptcy court,as required by the terms of the sale.
shortly after the foreclosure sale,in november,mccart discovered that schropp and dahlke had been on both sides of the foreclosure sale as controlling partners of both phoenix properties and the brook valley partnerships.upon learning this fact,prime realty filed another motion requesting the appointment of a trustee,and accused schropp and dahlke of secretly buying estate property.schropp and dahlke responded by denying this accusation 
great western bank entered into a transaction with phoenix properties,llc.phoenix properties,llc also apparently entered into a transaction with phoenix brook valley,llc.the purpose of both transactions was apparently to provide financing to phoenix properties to allow it to bid at the trust deed foreclosure sale conducted by the first national bank of omaha.both of these transactions and the supporting documents were entered into between parties who are not parties to this bankruptcy proceeding.those private transactions which apparently provided the financial resources for phoenix properties,llc to bid on and buy the real estate being sold at public auction have nothing to do with this bankruptcy case.
appellee app.
this response,of course,did not acknowledge that schropp and dahlke had controlling interests in both the debtors in possession and phoenix properties.the bankruptcy court found it misleading,add.at,and concluded that schropp and dahlke,through their counsel,who were also counsel for the debtors,went to a lot of trouble to keep the ownership of phoenix properties a secret from the court and from counsel for prime realty.id.at.
on june,all of the debtors assets having been sold,the bankruptcy court converted the case to a chapter proceeding and appointed the appellee,rick lange,as trustee of both estates.this order mooted prime realty motion for appointment of a trustee.lange investigated prime realty accusations and then commenced this suit against schropp,dahlke,and several entities they controlled.the parties to this suit agreed that the brook valley properties should be sold,with the net proceeds to be held by the court.after paying off debt,the sales generated a net profit of on the two properties.
after a trial,the bankruptcy court found in the trustee favor and imposed a constructive trust on the net proceeds of the sale.in addition,the court found that,which schropp and dahlke credit bid at the foreclosure sale but never paid,was property of the bankruptcy estates and had been converted by schropp and dahlke.the bankruptcy court also found that the net cash flow earned by the partnerships in the period between the filing for bankruptcy and the foreclosure sale,plus interest was property of the estate,and the court awarded that amount to the trustee.the court nonetheless concluded that the last two amounts would not be due if schropp and dahlke complied with the order establishing a constructive trust.the court also declined to award damages for operating profits generated by the properties after the sale to phoenix properties.
both sides appealed the bankruptcy court judgment to the bap,which affirmed the bankruptcy court in most respects,but found the trustee entitled to all of the damages,without regard to whether schropp and dahlke complied with the court constructive trust order.brook valley,at.the bap also awarded damages based on the profits that schropp and dahlke earned from operating the properties after the foreclosure sale.id.at.like the bap,we review the bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.debold case,cir.
schropp and dahlke argue that the trustee action against them is an impermissible collateral attack on the bankruptcy court order allowing the debtors to proceed with the foreclosure sale.in their view,property interests acquired at a foreclosure sale are good against the world and thus are not subject to later attack by the trustee.
once a sale of assets has been approved by a final order of the bankruptcy court,it is a judgment that is good as against the world,not merely as against parties to the proceeding.regions bank oil,llc,cir.under this standard,property rights acquired at a foreclosure sale can not be challenged unless the procedural rules allow for a collateral attack.see.b fed.thus,if the trustee discovers that the order permitting a foreclosure sale has been obtained wrongfully,rule b governs his ability to obtain relief from the otherwise final judgment.
we conclude,however,that rule b does not apply in this circumstance.this action does not directly attack the validity of the foreclosure sale.instead,the trustee alleges a breach of fiduciary duty and requests that the gains enjoyed by schropp and dahlke be placed in a constructive trust,to be conveyed to the estates.the court need not set aside the judgment approving the foreclosure sale to effect a disgorgement of these allegedly gains.thus,the trustee action is not an impermissible collateral attack on a final sale,because he does not seek to abrogate the foreclosure sale.rather,he seeks a remedy for an alleged breach of fiduciary duty,where the remedy presumes the continued validity of the foreclosure sale itself.
schropp and dahlke contend that the properties no longer belonged to the bankruptcy estates at the time of the foreclosure sale,so that bidding at the foreclosure sale could not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty.the trustee maintains that an order permitting a foreclosure sale does not release the property from the estate,and that because the debtors did not abandon the properties,the properties remained part of the estates until the sale was consummated.d unless the court orders otherwise,property of the estate that is not abandoned under this section and that is not administered in the case remains property of the estate.
when a bankruptcy court lifts the automatic stay,it merely removes an injunction barring creditors from bringing suit against the debtor.catalano commissioner,cir.although the property may pass from the control of the estate,that does not mean that the estate interest in the property is extinguished.id.relief from an automatic stay entitles the creditor to realize its security interest in the property,but all proceeds in excess of the creditor interest must be returned to the trustee.nebel richardson in re nebel.because the estate is entitled to any proceeds in excess of the amount owed,the estate retains a property interest so long as state law recognizes the underlying property right.therefore,an order lifting the automatic stay,on its own,does not remove the property from the bankruptcy estate.
notwithstanding this interpretation of federal law,schropp and dahlke argue that the foreclosure sale extinguished the estates interest in the property under state law,which determines the nature and extent of any property interest.see garrott sons union planters bank of memphis in re garrott sons,cir.if lifting the automatic stay had extinguished the underlying property interests,it is immaterial that any remaining interests would be part of the estates.schropp and dahlke point out that nebraska law does not provide a debtor the right to cure where notice of default is given and the cure period has expired.nor does nebraska law give a mortgagor a right to redeem property after the foreclosure sale has occurred.schropp and dahlke infer from these provisions that a bankruptcy estate has no remaining property interest once a bankruptcy court has ordered a foreclosure sale.
we disagree.prior to the foreclosure sale,the mortgagor retains the right to pay the note in full and retake the property.because the brook valley partnerships retained this right,their interests in the properties were not extinguished until the foreclosure sales occurred.see butts hale,in re jones.thus,because the properties were part of the estates at the time of the foreclosure sale,we must decide whether schropp and dahlke acted improperly by bidding.the bankruptcy court held that there is a per se prohibition on debtors in possession purchasing estate property at a foreclosure sale.see also in re rahe.on appeal,the bap ruled that while there was no per se prohibition,schropp and dahlke violated their fiduciary duties in this case by consenting to the foreclosure sale and then bidding.in this appeal,schropp and dahlke argue that there is no blanket prohibition on such bidding,and that they did not act improperly by bidding at the foreclosure sale.
debtors in possession and those who control them owe fiduciary duties to the bankruptcy estate.cftc weintraub,d wolf weinstein,d.thus,the partners in a bankrupt partnership,acting as a debtor in possession,must run the business as agents of the bankruptcy estate,and not for their own personal gain.the fiduciary obligation consists of two duties the duty of care and the duty of loyalty.collier on bankruptcy ed.the duty of care requires the fiduciary to make decisions that can be attributed to a rational business purpose.in re integrated.in general,courts do not business decisions made in good faith.id.
the duty of loyalty comes into play when there appears to be a conflict between the interests of the fiduciary and the entity to which he owes loyalty.for a debtor in possession,this duty includes an obligation to refrain from,to avoid conflicts of interests and the appearance of impropriety,to treat all parties to the case fairly and to maximize the value of the estate.collier on bankruptcy.courts have held that managers of debtors in possession breached their duty of loyalty by participating as an undisclosed bidder at an auction of estate property.see ross kirschenbaum in re beck,cir.
though some the bankruptcy court in this held that bidding for estate property always violates the debtor in possession duty of loyalty,see rahe,at,we need not adopt this blanket rule to conclude that schropp and dahlke violated their duties here.only seventeen days after filing the bankruptcy petitions,schropp and dahlke consented to relief from the automatic stay.this consent implicitly represented to the court that schropp and dahlke believed foreclosure to be in the estates interests.this could be the case only if the properties could not be operated profitably on the estates behalf.in fact,the properties remained profitable after the partnerships filed for bankruptcy,and the appraisals of the property revealed substantial equity.schropp and dahlke proceeded to bid secretly at the foreclosure sale and take possession of the properties unencumbered by any duties to the bankruptcy estates.rather than searching for financing to make their own purchase of the properties,schropp and dahlke should have been making efforts to obtain financing on behalf of the debtors to salvage the properties.brook valley,at emphasis in original.
when a transaction involving an insider is challenged as breaching the insider duty of loyalty,the fiduciary must prove that the transaction was fair and reasonable.norlin rooney,pace,cir.schropp and dahlke have failed to carry this burden.initially,they caused the debtors to consent to relief from the automatic stay.then,they secretly bid at the foreclosure sale,paying considerably less than the appraised value of the properties.after prime realty objected,schropp and dahlke misled the court about their holdings in phoenix properties.the actions of schropp and dahlke support the bap conclusion that they were looking out for themselves rather than the estates.
having concluded that schropp and dahlke violated their fiduciary duties to the estates,we turn to the issue of whether the bankruptcy court properly imposed a constructive trust on their gains from the sale of the two properties.schropp and dahlke argue that the price received at the foreclosure sale conclusiv
