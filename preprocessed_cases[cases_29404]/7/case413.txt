opinion of the court 
creditors who file an involuntary bankruptcy petition against a debtor must satisfy several statutory requirements before obtaining relief.see.everyone agrees the creditors who filed the petition in this case met those requirements.the question is whether their petition may nonetheless be dismissed as a filing.we hold that bad faith provides an independent basis for dismissing an involuntary petition.for the following reasons,we will affirm.
the parties are familiar foes.founded by keith day,forever green athletic fields sells artificial turf playing fields.in,forever green sued one of its competitors,progreen,for million for diversion of corporate assets the bucks county action.charles dawson,who is an owner of progreen and a former forever green sales representative,would be liable if damages are awarded in that suit.
that same year,charles and his wife,kelli dawson,sued forever green for unpaid commissions and wages the louisiana action.on march,after years of litigation,the louisiana court entered a consent judgment in favor of the dawsons.with interest and other costs,this judgment now totals more than.to date,forever green has not paid a penny on this judgment.
while the louisiana action was still running its course,the parties to the bucks county action agreed to arbitrate their claims.however,on march,just a few weeks after the consent judgment was entered in the louisiana action,progreen filed a motion to terminate the arbitration.in support of this motion,progreen argued that it has become clear that forever green is insolvent and that keith day does not have the ability or desire to pay the arbitrator fees and expenses.in addition,progreen said that charles and kelli dawson have a judgment against forever green and expect judgments in the same amount against day very soon.as such,any monies paid as advance deposits to the arbitrator by forever green are subject to execution and garnishment.id.the next month,the dawsons transferred their judgment in the louisiana action to pennsylvania and obtained a writ of execution against the arbitrator and his law firm.at that point,with his fees in peril,the arbitrator recognized he was adverse to the dawsons,so he suspended the arbitration until the fee issue was resolved.
during his deposition,charles dawson offered some strategic insight into these actions.with the consent judgment in hand,he intended to f ind any available asset that forever green may have and try to use the lien to seize it.id.at.he testified,i going to use that judgment to levy any monies i can find anywhere,whether it be the arbitrator or anyone else.so,yeah,if we can get the lien paid,that my number one objective.if i can get it paid,i very happy.id.at.
in response to the suspension of the arbitration,forever green filed a complaint in state court trying to reinstate the arbitration the philadelphia action.day testified that forever green was forced to file this complaint because charles dawson and his counsel were determined to derail the arbitration and this was our own legitimate response to it.id.at.according to day,charles dawson and his counsel had threatened to put forever green into bankruptcy if forever green did not agree to terminate the arbitration.id.at.after forever green commenced the philadelphia action,the dawsons counsel sent a letter to forever green saying that the arbitration was in an indefinite state of suspension and u nless and until the consent judgment for about is paid off in full,that indefinite state of suspension will continue.id.at.
the judge in the philadelphia action issued a scheduling order for the parties to brief the issues identified in forever green complaint.the dawsons brief was due on may.they never filed it.instead,they chose a different tack.
two weeks before their brief was due,the dawsons and the law firm cohen seglias pallas greenhall furman,which was owed from forever green,filed an involuntary chapter bankruptcy petition against forever green.justifying this decision,charles dawson said that his counsel suggested the best way to get to forever green assets would be involuntary bankruptcy.app.it is undisputed that the dawsons and cohen seglias satisfied the statutory criteria for commencing an involuntary bankruptcy case because they are three creditors,they each hold an uncontested claim against forever green,and their claims aggregate at least more than the value of liens on forever green property.see b.despite the petitioning creditors facial compliance with the statute,forever green moved to dismiss the petition as a filing.
the bankruptcy court convened an evidentiary hearing on the motion.in addition to receiving evidence of the parties course of conduct in the years leading up to the filing,the bankruptcy court heard testimony about forever green financials.it was established that forever green has essentially shut down its business in,its operating account had no activity and its balance never exceeded.forever green focus has been on winding down its affairs and recovering assets for its approximately creditors.as for the balance sheet,forever green has million in assets,the largest by far being its claims against progreen for million.on the other side of the ledger,forever green has million in debts,including a million secured line of credit.
although forever green itself has not been paying any of its debts,day has personally paid off hundreds of thousands of dollars of forever green debt.he explained that he has paid debts for which he had financial personal guarantees.app.day acknowledged that neither he nor forever green has paid anything to the dawsons,but he said that secured creditors and certain unsecured creditors are ahead of them in the pecking order.day also is personally funding all of forever green current litigation,including this suit and the suspended arbitration against progreen.
after the parties made their pitches as to whether the petition was filed in bad faith,the bankruptcy court ruled in forever green favor and granted the motion to dismiss.it explained that,because bankruptcy courts are courts of equity,a petitioning creditor for involuntary bankruptcies or debtor for voluntary bankruptcies must come to the court for a proper purpose.involuntary chapter proceedings,it said,are intended to protect creditors from debtors who are making preferential payments to other creditors or from the dissipation of the debtor assets.creditors who file petitions for other as to collect on a personal debt,to gain an advantage in pending litigation,or to harass the in bad faith.the bankruptcy court concluded that,even though the petitioning creditors met the statutory filing requirements,charles dawson was a creditor because he was motivated by two improper purposes to frustrate forever green efforts to litigate its claim against progreen and to collect on a debt.the district court affirmed.the dawsons without cohen seglias filed this appeal 
we discuss three issues on appeal.first,whether an involuntary petition may be dismissed as a filing.second,whether the bankruptcy court erred in finding bad faith.and third,whether other creditors could have cured the petition.
section of the bankruptcy code,which governs involuntary cases under chapter or,contains three requirements for commencing an action against a debtor who has twelve or more creditors there must be three or more petitioning creditors each petitioning creditor must hold a claim against the debtor that is not contingent as to liability or the subject of a bona fide dispute and the claims must aggregate at least more than the value of liens on the debtor property.b.it is undisputed that the dawsons and cohen seglias satisfied these three requirements.the code further provides that the court shall order relief against the debtor in an involuntary case only if the debtor is generally not paying such debtor debts as such debts become due.id.h.the parties agree forever green is not paying its debts.
section has one reference to bad faith.it says that if the court dismisses an involuntary petition,it may award damages against any creditor that filed the petition in bad faith.id.i.as one might expect,because the only mention of bad faith is in i and deals with damages,the vast majority of litigation concerning bad faith centers on that provision.in the typical case,the creditors do not satisfy the b requirements for filing the petition in the first instance e,fewer than three creditors filed the petition or the creditors claims were subject to bona fide disputes.following dismissal,debtors invariably file motions for damages under i,arguing the petition was filed in bad faith 
less often litigated is the issue here,namely,whether bad faith may serve as a basis for dismissal even where the criteria for commencing a suit are satisfied and where the debtor is admittedly not paying its debts as they become due.according to the dawsons,we can not engage in a inquiry in these circumstances.they say a creditor subjective motivations are irrelevant because b contains objective criteria for who may file an involuntary petition,and if they are satisfied,h provides that the court shall order relief against a debtor who is not paying its debts.some courts have been receptive to this position section,furthermore,discusses bad faith only in the context of assessing damages after a petition has been dismissed.if congress wanted bad faith to be a separate basis for dismissal,one could argue,the code would have included language to that effect.and although this court has repeatedly held that a voluntary petition may be dismissed for bad faith,the provisions of the code at issue in those cases permitted dismissal for cause.section,by contrast,does not have any similar statutory hook for allowing dismissals.congress must have intended something by this distinction,the argument goes.
we disagree that the text of forecloses dismissals.the dawsons make much of the fact that they satisfied b three requirements for commencing an involuntary petition.but meeting the b criteria,like pleading a prima facie case in many actions,is just the first hurdle.it does not bear on other defenses that may support dismissal.in other words,if the three filing requirements are not satisfied,we agree the bankruptcy court must dismiss the case but if the three requirements are satisfied,that does mean the bankruptcy court ca dismiss the case.
the one reference to bad faith in supports our conclusion.section i allows a bankruptcy court to award damages following dismissal against any petitioner that filed the petition in bad faith.under the dawsons reading,courts may engage in a inquiry only after they have dismissed a case for the creditors failure to comply with the statutory filing requirements.we see no reason why the code would permit the imposition of damages including punitive damages for filings but not allow the same conduct such as using involuntary bankruptcy as a litigation tactic in pending proceedings to provide a basis for dismissing the petition.the better view is that,by including an express reference to bad faith in,congress intended for bad faith to serve as a basis for both dismissal and damages.
section h,moreover,does not provide that a bankruptcy court shall order relief against a debtor who is not paying its debts.rather,the court shall order relief only if the debtor is not paying its debts,meaning a debtor not paying its debts is a necessary but not sufficient condition for ordering relief.an if or if and only if clause would have been more favorable to the dawsons.
the bigger flaw in the dawsons argument is that it overlooks the equitable nature of bankruptcy.time and again,we have emphasized that good faith filing requirements have strong roots in equity.in re sgl carbon,at see also in re tamecki,at.at its most fundamental level,the good faith requirement ensures that the bankruptcy code careful balancing of interests is not undermined by petitioners whose aims are antithetical to the basic purposes of bankruptcy.in re integrated telecom express,cir.as courts of equity,bankruptcy courts are equipped with the doctrine of good faith so that they can patrol the border between good and filings.see in re sgl carbon,at in re little creek dev,cir explaining that the good faith requirement protects the integrity of the bankruptcy courts by rendering their powerful equitable weapons available only to those debtors and creditors with clean hands.we will not depart from this general good faith filing requirement in the context of involuntary petitions for bankruptcy.the majority of courts agree 
policy considerations lend further support to this conclusion.t he filing of an involuntary petition is an extreme remedy with serious consequences to the alleged debtor,such as loss of credit standing,inability to transfer assets and carry on business affairs,and public embarrassment.in re reid,cir.given these serious consequences,courts should be wary of creditors who may find alluring the retributive quality of thrusting a debtor into bankruptcy allowing for the dismissal of filings will encourage creditors to file petitions for proper reasons such as to protect against the preferential treatment of other creditors or the dissipation of the debtor assets.see in re silverman,at.accordingly,we hold that an involuntary petition filed under may be dismissed for bad faith.
we review the decision to dismiss the case as a filing for abuse of discretion.in re myers,at.the determination of bad faith is a fact intensive determination better left to the discretion of the bankruptcy court.in re lilley,cir citations omitted.in terms of allocating burdens of proof,creditors are presumed to have acted in good faith.see in re bayshore,at.to dismiss the petition,the debtor must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the creditors acted in bad faith.in re petralex stainless.
at the outset,we must decide on the standard for evaluating bad faith,which is not defined in the code.on this issue,courts have applied a dizzying array of standards,mostly with regard to motions for damages under i.see in re bayshore,at reviewing different standards trading yale materials handling,cir same.some courts,for instance,apply an improper use test,which asks whether a petitioning creditor uses involuntary bankruptcy procedures in an attempt to obtain a disproportionate advantage for itself,rather than to protect against other creditors obtaining disproportionate advantages,particularly when the petitioner could have advanced its own interest in a different forum.in re,internal quotation marks omitted.other courts apply an improper purpose test,which looks to whether the filing was motivated by ill will,malice,or a desire to embarrass or harass the alleged debtor.in re bayshore,at.still others apply an objective test,which assesses what a reasonable person would have believed and what a reasonable person would have done in the creditor position.in re wavelength,cir.and yet other courts have applied a broad totality of the circumstances standard,which effectively combines all the tests and looks to both subjective and objective evidence of bad faith.in re john richards,at.
we adopt the totality of the circumstances standard for determining bad faith under.this standard is most suitable for evaluating the myriad ways in which creditors filing an involuntary petition could act in bad faith.it also is the same standard we apply when reviewing allegations that a debtor filed a voluntary petition in bad faith.see in re myers,at in re lilley,at.in conducting this review,courts may consider a number of factors,including,but not limited to,whether the creditors satisfied the statutory criteria for filing the petition the involuntary petition was meritorious the creditors made a reasonable inquiry into the relevant facts and pertinent law before filing there was evidence of preferential payments to certain creditors or of dissipation of the debtor assets the filing was motivated by ill will or a desire to harass the petitioning creditors used the filing to obtain a disproportionate advantage for themselves rather than to protect against other creditors doing the same the filing was used as a tactical advantage in pending actions the filing was used as a substitute for customary
