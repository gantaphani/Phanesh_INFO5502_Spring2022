the village makes numerous arguments urging reversal,not the least of which is a constitutional due process argument.the village argues that the bankruptcy judge decided the case before hearing its arguments.the district court found that the bankruptcy judge made his decision based on the pleadings and trustee report however,the bankruptcy court order stated the determination the mcwilliamses lacked the intent to defraud was based,in part,on testimony from the hearing.the district court noted that if the judge was obligated to recuse himself from this case simply because he had read the pleadings before the hearing,no judge could ever come to court prepared.the district judge comment was right on the mark,and we need not elevate this disagreement to a constitutional level when it is more appropriately framed as a ordinary review for error.
