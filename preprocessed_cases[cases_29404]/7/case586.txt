diana houck commenced this action under k,alleging that the defendants foreclosed on and sold her homestead in violation of the automatic stay triggered by her filing of a chapter bankruptcy petition.the district court granted the motion to dismiss filed by one of the defendants,substitute trustee services,the substitute trustee,concluding that houck failed to allege facts that plausibly supported her allegation that the violation of the automatic stay was willful,a necessary element of a k claim.because we find to the contrary,we vacate the district court judgment,reverse its order dismissing houck claims against the substitute trustee,and remand for further proceedings.
in,houck father deeded to her part of the family farm located in ashe county,north carolina.after houck had secured financing from a predecessor to lifestore bank,she and her,ricky penley,placed a mobile home on part of the homestead.
in,houck refinanced the loan so that she and penley could remodel the family farmhouse,but within a year,she lost her job and began having difficulty making her loan payments.in the summer of,after she and penley were married,houck asked lifestore for a loan modification.lifestore,however,referred her to grid financial services,a debt collection agency,which denied her request because she was unemployed.houck thereafter defaulted on her loan.
in july,the hutchens law firm formerly hutchens,senter,kellam pettit,served penley with a notice of foreclosure.to stop the foreclosure proceedings,houck,acting pro se,filed a chapter bankruptcy petition on september.the next day,the hutchens law firm notified the clerk of the superior court of ashe county that houck had filed a bankruptcy petition and consequently that all foreclosure proceedings had to be stayed.a few weeks later,however,the bankruptcy court dismissed houck petition because she had failed to file certain schedules and statements in accordance with applicable bankruptcy rules,and the substitute trustee,by its counsel,the hutchens law firm,reactivated the foreclosure proceedings.
on december,houck,again acting pro se,filed a second chapter bankruptcy petition,again to stop the foreclosure proceedings.on that same day,penley called the hutchens law firm to notify it of the bankruptcy filing.the employee of the firm with whom penley spoke acknowledged that the firm had a file for houck.penley told the employee that houck had filed a second bankruptcy petition earlier that day,and he provided the employee with the new case number.on that same day,penley also contacted lifestore to notify it of the new bankruptcy petition.lifestore told penley that it intended to wait for notice from the bankruptcy court before taking any action.
on december,two days after houck had filed her second bankruptcy petition,the bankruptcy court ordered houck to appear and show cause why her petition should not be dismissed.two days later,on december,the substitute trustee,represented by the hutchens law firm,sold houck homestead at a foreclosure sale.the following day,the bankruptcy court dismissed houck second bankruptcy petition.because houck had filed the second petition with the purpose of preventing the sale of her homestead and it had already been sold,she did not object to the petition dismissal.thereafter,penley endeavored unsuccessfully to undo the sale.in march,after the sheriff issued a notice to vacate,houck and penley left the homestead and moved into a small cabin.
houck retained counsel and commenced this action,naming as defendants lifestore,grid financial,and the substitute trustee and asserting a claim against them under k for violation of the automatic stay.she also asserted several related state law claims.
the substitute trustee filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,contending that the complaint had failed to allege that the substitute trustee was aware of the second bankruptcy petition filing at the time it conducted the foreclosure sale of houck homestead.the district court granted the motion by order dated october,concluding that houck had failed to allege that she sent notice of the second petition to the substitute trustee or that the substitute trustee had any notice of the bankruptcy petition.based on that deficiency,the court also dismissed houck related state law claims.on october,houck filed an interlocutory appeal from the district court order dismissing her claims against the substitute trustee.
the remaining defendants,lifestore and grid financial,thereafter filed various motions to dismiss or for summary judgment.in one of those motions,grid financial contended that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over houck k claim,maintaining that the provision did not create a private cause of action that could be adjudicated outside of the bankruptcy court.by order dated february,the district court granted grid financial motion and dismissed houck complaint,agreeing that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over houck federal claim for violation of the automatic stay and declining to exercise its discretion to adjudicate her state law claims.the clerk of court thereafter entered judgment and closed the case.
subsequently,we,sua sponte,dismissed houck pending appeal of the district court october,order dismissing the substitute trustee because it had been taken from an interlocutory order.houck substitute tr,app x,cir per curiam.we concluded further that the jurisdictional defect was not cured by the district court february,order granting grid financial motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,as that order was also not final.id.at.
thereafter,houck filed motions requesting that the district court reopen the case and reconsider its february,order.the district court denied the motions,reiterating that it had finally decided the case with that order.houck then filed an unopposed motion in our court for clarification,seeking to resolve her procedural predicament created by the district court statement that its february,order finally closed the case and our contrary statement that that order was not final.in response,we recalled the mandate issued on our dismissal of houck appeal and granted panel rehearing.
in her appeal,houck contends that,in dismissing her k claim against the substitute trustee,the district court applied the wrong legal standard for ruling on a rule b motion and erroneously concluded that her complaint failed to allege sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for relief.
at the outset,we determine whether we have jurisdiction to hear houck appeal.see,chevron page in re naranjo,cir.
in its october,order,the district court granted the substitute trustee motion to dismiss on the ground that houck complaint failed to allege that she had given the substitute trustee notice of her bankruptcy petition before the substitute trustee sold her homestead,thus precluding any claim that the substitute trustee conduct was willful.but because lifestore and grid financial were not parties to that motion and remained defendants in the action,houck appeal of the october dismissal order was interlocutory.moreover,houck made no request that the district court certify the order as a final judgment under federal rule of civil procedure b,although it appears that she could have satisfied that rule requirement.see,nystedt nigro,cir upholding a rule b certification of an order granting a rule b motion to dismiss filed by some but not all of the defendants.consequently,we dismissed houck appeal sua sponte because it was not taken from a final decision,as required by a.houck,app x at.
after houck requested that we reconsider the effect of the district court february,order granting grid financial motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,we recalled our mandate and now hear this appeal to consider her arguments.
if the district court february,order,entered several months after the court had dismissed houck claims against the substitute trustee,was a final judgment,then houck appeal might be reviewable under the doctrine of cumulative finality a finality achieved by the cumulative effect of the october,dismissal order and the february,dismissal order.see equip.fin,traverse computer brokers,cir recognizing cumulative finality in circumstances where all claims are dismissed,albeit at different times,before the appeal taken from the first dismissal order is considered.
upon close review of the district court february,order,we conclude that it was indeed a final judgment.in that order,the district court granted grid financial motion to dismiss lifestore was not a party to the motion concluding that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over houck k claim for violation of the bankruptcy code automatic stay.because subject matter jurisdiction goes to the power of the court to adjudicate a claim,an order dismissing a claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction necessarily dismisses the claim as to all defendants.and,indeed,the district court february,order reflected this effect by dismissing the entire complaint without limiting its ruling to any particular party.consistently,the district court also directed the clerk of court to enter judgment by way of a separate docket entry,as required by federal rule of civil procedure for entry of a final judgment.finally,the court later confirmed that it had intended to dismiss the entire case when it denied houck motions to reopen the case and to reconsider its february,ruling.specifically,it stated that o n february,the court dismissed houck only federal claim,and it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her pendent state law claims.because the district court february,order disposed of the entire case,leav ing nothing for it to do,united states breeden,cir quoting coopers lybrand livesay,internal quotation marks omitted,the order was a final judgment.this brings us to consideration of the doctrine of cumulative finality.
in equipment finance,we articulated the requirements for application of the doctrine.there,the district court granted summary judgment to one of two defendants,and the plaintiff appealed the district court order.equip,at.while the appeal was pending,the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its claim against the second defendant.id.at.on appeal,we rejected the first defendant argument that we lacked jurisdiction,concluding that the subsequent dismissal of the claim against the remaining defendant prior to our consideration of the appeal effectively satisfie d the finality requirements of rule b.id.noting that the case procedural circumstances warrant ed a practical approach to finality,we recognized a doctrine of cumulative finality where all joint claims or all multiple parties are dismissed prior to the consideration of the appeal.id.the doctrine applies,however,only when the appellant appeals from an order that the district court could have certified for immediate appeal under rule b.see in re bryson,cir.
in this case,the district court dismissed completely houck claims against the substitute trustee in its october,order,leaving open only her claims against lifestore and grid financial.because the court could have certified such an order as a final judgment under rule b and because the court later entered final judgment against the remaining defendants with its february,order before we considered houck interlocutory appeal,we conclude that the doctrine of cumulative finality applies and that we therefore have jurisdiction to hear her appeal 
a second jurisdictional issue is presented by the district court february,order,in which the court dismissed houck federal claim on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.of course,if the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear houck k claim,it could not have ruled on the substitute trustee rule b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
as noted above,on february,the district court concluded,without further discussion,that a claim under k for violation of the automatic stay could only be brought in a bankruptcy court,not in a district court.it relied for support on scott wells fargo home mortgage,d,aff sub nom.scott wells fargo,app x cir per curiam,where the district court stated,i t is doubtful that a violation of k is cognizable in this court.while k arguably creates a private right of action for willful violation of the automatic stay,it does not create a private cause of action outside of the bankruptcy court for violations of the automatic stay.citation omitted.the scott court in turn relied for support on dashner cate.
but in dashner,the district court did not consider k because,at the time of the stay violation at issue there,k had not yet been enacted.at.the dashner court simply held that before,before the creation of what is now a k cause of in the bankruptcy code indicate d that congress intended to create a private right of action outside of the bankruptcy court for a violation of the automatic stay.id.at.to reach that conclusion,the court pointed to stacy roanoke mem l hosps.in re stacy.the stacy court likewise considered a pre violation of the automatic stay and concluded,the proscriptive provision of the code in question here,the automatic stay provision,is not a proscription to be enforced by a debtor or any third party.a stay is an order of the bankruptcy court,to be enforced by the bankruptcy court.id.at.
thus,both dashner and stacy,on which scott relied,analyzed the pre version of,which lacked subsection k private cause of action,and therefore are inapposite.for that reason,neither the district court opinion in scott nor our unpublished,affirmance of that decision supports the district court determination below that only a bankruptcy court may entertain a k claim.
both houck and the substitute trustee now agree that the district court erred in determining that it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate houck k claim.but because subject matter jurisdiction can not be conferred by agreement,see mccorkle first.banking trust,cir,we appointed counsel to submit an amicus curiae brief defending the district court position on the issue we turn now to whether the district court erred in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate a claim brought under k.
as background,the filing of a bankruptcy petition operates immediately to stay creditors from pursuing certain enumerated collection actions against the debtor or the debtor estate.see a.this automatic stay is one of the fundamental debtor protections provided by the bankruptcy laws,at,reprinted in.it gives the debtor a breathing spell from his creditors and stops all collection efforts,all harassment,and all foreclosure actions.id.
before,when congress enacted k designated h when enacted,the automatic stay appeared to be merely proscriptive.section a provided that the filing of a bankruptcy petition operates as a stay,without prescribing any sanction for its violation.a.the bankruptcy code simply gave the bankruptcy court authority to administer the proscription.for example,d authorized the bankruptcy court to grant relief from the stay,and e and f otherwise authorized the bankruptcy court to regulate the stay length,conditions,and termination.thus,courts had held that the a provision did not provide a party with an independent right of action for damages but rather with a procedural mechanism to be regulated and enforced by the bankruptcy court.see,stacy,at.
in,however,with the enactment of the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of,stat.codified in scattered sections of and,congress created a private cause of action for the willful violation of a stay,authorizing an individual injured by any such violation to recover damages.see k in creating the cause of action,congress did not specify which courts possess jurisdiction over a k claim for violation of the automatic stay.
under the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act,the district courts were given original and exclusive jurisdiction in all cases under title,a,and original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title,id.b.but they were also authorized to refer to bankruptcy judges any such cases or proceedings.see id.a exec.benefits ins.agency arkison.in addition,the act authorized the district courts to withdraw,in whole or in part,any case or proceeding that they had referred.see d.in short,while the district courts were given jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases,congress also delegated to the bankruptcy courts,as judicial officers of the district courts,wellness int l,sharif,quoting internal quotation marks omitted,adjudicatory authority,subject to the district courts supervision as particularized in and the limits imposed by the constitution.in no circumstance,however,did the act,in conferring such adjudicatory authority,give a bankruptcy court jurisdiction to the exclusion of a district court.
a claim under k for violation of the automatic stay is a cause of action arising under title,and as such,a district court has jurisdiction over it.of course,under a,a district court may refer a k claim to the bankruptcy court.if the k claim did not stem from the bankruptcy itself or would not necessarily be resolved in the claims allowance process,stern marshall,or would only augment the bankruptcy estate and would otherwise exis t without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding,wellness.at alteration in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted,the referral would be for recommended findings of fact and conclusions of law,see exec.benefits.at.but even if the referral authorized the bankruptcy court to adjudicate the claim to final judgment,it would not deprive the district court of jurisdiction.see b see also justice cometh,lambert,cir per curiam price rochford,cir.but see eastern equip.servs.factory point bank,cir per curiam stating,without considering,that a k claim must be brought in the bankruptcy court,rather than in the district court,which only has appellate jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases.
the amicus contends that jurisdiction to hear houck k claim was vested solely in the bankruptcy court because of a standing referral order,entered under a,which has been in place in one form or another in the western district of north carolina since july.at the time relevant to this case,that order provided that all bankruptcy matters were automatically referred to the bankruptcy judge.the amicus argues that,under d,until such time as that reference is withdrawn,the district court has ceded its jurisdiction to the bankruptcy court.she maintains that d requirement that cause be shown for a discretionary withdrawal of a referral confirms her interpretation.see d the district court may withdraw,in whole or in part,any case or proceeding referred under this section,on its own motion or on timely motion of any party,for cause shown emphasis added.
but nowhere in the text of is there any indication that the provision is jurisdictional,as the amicus claims.the text indicates that is simply a procedural mechanism authorizing a bankruptcy court,upon referral from a district court to hear constitutionally core claims to final judgment,subject to appeal in the district court,and to recommend findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court in constitutionally matters for de novo review and final judgment by the district court.see exec.benefits.at.indeed,in stern,the court observed that is little more than a traffic regulator,directing where adjudication of bankruptcy matters can take place,and that it does not implicate subject matter jurisdiction.at.as the court stated 
section allocates the authority to enter final judgment between the bankruptcy court and the district court.that allocation does not implicate questions of subject matter jurisdiction.
id.emphasis added citation omitted see also home ins.of adco oil,cir a judge failure to follow orderly procedures under for allocating bankruptcy matters within a district court does not deprive the court of jurisdiction.consistent with its ruling,the stern court held that because the provisions of were not jurisdictional,their proscriptions could be waived.at.
in the same vein,the fact that litigants may consent to a bankruptcy court adjudication of a proceeding also indicates that is not jurisdictional.see c permitting bankruptcy courts to adjudicate statutorily proceedings with the parties consent wellness.at holding that bankruptcy courts may,with the parties knowing and voluntary consent,adjudicate stern claims,statutorily core but constitutionally proceedings.
thus,even if houck k claim was indeed subject to the western district of north carolina standing order referring all bankruptcy matters to the bankruptcy court,the district court failure to follow the procedural rule did not deprive it of subject matter jurisdiction.the district court always had original jurisdiction over any bankruptcy matter,and any breach of would not implicate questions of subject matter jurisdiction.stern.at see also home ins,at.while it may be that the district court should have sent houck k claim to the bankruptcy court in accordance with its standing order,the amicus has failed to explain how not doing so deprived the district court of the original jurisdiction that congress bestowed upon it by way of.see justice cometh,at stating that,although the district courts may refer to the bankruptcy courts proceedings arising under title,the explicit grant of original jurisdiction over title cases clearly forecloses a conclusion that the district court s lack subject matter jurisdiction over k claims price,at observing that the plaintiff claim for willful violation of the automatic stay should probably have been referred to the bankruptcy court under the district court standing order of reference,but deciding that the defect was not jurisdictional.
moreover,neither houck nor the substitute trustee objected to the district court failure to refer this case to the bankruptcy court.accordingly,any claim that the case should have been tried in the bankruptcy court was waived or forfeited.see stern.at holding that the failure to raise the statutory limitations of amounted to a waiver or forfeiture home ins,at finding that the district court had committed no reversible error in failing to refer the matter to the bankruptcy court because,in part,neither of the parties challenged the district court decision to hear the case.
at bottom,we hold that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over houck k claim and therefore that the court had authority to rule on the substitute trustee motion to dismiss houck claims against it,to which we now turn.
on the merits,houck contends that the district court erred in dismissing,under federal rule of civil procedure b,her k claim against the substitute trustee,arguing that the court applied the wrong legal standard and that her complaint was legally sufficient under the proper standard.
in dismissing her claim,the district court applied the standard i f after taking the complaint factual allegations as true,a lawful alternative explanation appears a more likely cause of the complained of behavior,the claim for relief is not plausible.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the court then found that the complaint was replete with generalized and conclusory allegations that the foreclosure sale was improper or conducted improperly and that t he only specific factual allegation against the substitute trustee was that it conducted the foreclosure sale in violation of the bankruptcy stay.more specifically,the court focused on the elements of a k claim and noted that houck had failed to allege that she sent notice of the second bankruptcy petition to the substitute trustee or that the substitute trustee had any notice of the petition,thus precluding any allegation of willfulness.
houck argues that the district court improperly created a balancing test for ruling on a rule b motion and that we should summarily reject it because it has no legal basis and is logically unworkable.and as to the court finding that the complaint was factually insufficient,she argues simply that the complaint did sufficiently allege that the substitute trustee had notice of her bankruptcy petition,pointing to numerous paragraphs in her complaint.
it is well established that a motion filed under rule b challenges the legal suffi
