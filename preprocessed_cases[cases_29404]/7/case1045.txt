south beach,thein the bankruptcy proceeding,also is controlled by greenblatt.it is not participating actively in this appeal it has merely,as we said,adopted scattered brief,but the department of justice official whose role is to be a watchdog in bankruptcy proceedings,a is.he opposed the confirmation of the plan of reorganization in the bankruptcy court and the district court and defends their rulings in this court.he argues that the only purpose of south beach declaration of bankruptcy,and of the plan of reorganization,is to avoid taxes,and a plan of reorganization can not be confirmed if the principal purpose of the plan is the avoidance of taxes.d.the role was especially important in this case because the bankruptcy was nonadversarial,and,indeed,as we shall see,phony.were it not for his participation,scattered would have no opponent in this court.
scattered argues that the trustee is not authorized to object to a plan of reorganization on the ground that the plan primary purpose is to avoid taxes.and indeed it is not obvious that the trustee writ runs to policing against tax might think the proper watchdog would be the internal revenue service,which could have objected to confirmation of the plan at the outset,or could step in later by invoking section of the tax code discussed below when and if a party to the bankruptcy proceeding claimed a tax benefit.e.and there are objections based on the text of the bankruptcy code to the trustee playing the role of tax watchdog in bankruptcy proceedings,though not compelling objections.
the code permits only a party in interest that is a governmental unit to oppose a plan of reorganization on the ground that the plan primary purpose is to beat taxes.d in re trans max technologies,collier on bankruptcy,alan resnick henry sommer,ed.a trustee is deemed not to be a governmental unit only while serving as a trustee in a bankruptcy case.the trustee is not the trustee in bankruptcy in this case.there is no trustee south beach is a debtor in possession.the ninth circuit has ruled,however,that the trustee can never be a governmental unit,even when not serving as a trustee in bankruptcy.balser department of justice,cir.in so ruling,the court overlooked section of the bankruptcy code,the section we just quoted that makes clear that the trustee is not a governmental unit only when he is acting as a trustee in bankruptcy.balser was not actually addressing the question whether the trustee is authorized by d to participate in a bankruptcy.yet in re trans max technologies,supra,at,relied on balser to conclude that the trustee was not questioning the oversight that had led the ninth circuit to that erroneous conclusion.id.at.
but there is another ground on which to question the trustee authority to challenge the plan of reorganization.remember that only a party in interest that is a governmental unit emphasis added can object to a plan on tax grounds.now it is true that the term party in interest is defined nonexclusively as including the debtor,the trustee,a creditors committee,an equity security holders committee,a creditor,an equity security holder,or any indenture trustee.b emphasis added.the trustee is not excluded.and anyway all this section means is that anyone who has a legally protected interest that could be affected by a bankruptcy proceeding is entitled to assert that interest with respect to any issue to which it pertains.in re james wilson associates,cir.this implies that the trustee can be a party in interest when he seeks to protect the rules and procedures of bankruptcy,over which he is the congressionally ordained has a statutory interest in making sure that bankruptcy law is abused.
but elsewhere in the code party in interest and united states trustee are treated disjunctively.see,b after notice and a hearing,the court,on its own motion or on a motion by the united states trustee,trustee or any party in interest,on request of a party in interest or the united states trustee.yet when we turn to section of the code we discover that the united states trustee may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in any case or proceeding under this title.this language,exactly parallel to the authority granted parties in interest by section b a party in interest may raise and may appear and be heard on any issue in a case under this chapter,suggests that the trustee can object to a plan of reorganization after all,in his role as guardian of the public interest in bankruptcy proceedings.see.in re united artists theatre,cir.the public has an interest in limiting the use of bankruptcy to the purposes for which it is intended rather than permitting it to be used as a vehicle by which solvent firms can beat taxes.courts often have deemed the trustee to be a party in interest in related contexts,in re trash pickup,cir moving for conversion or dismissal of chapter case in re miles,moving for dismissal or transfer of case because of improper venue.
the statute is a mishmash but the view that the trustee can be a party in interest makes better sense,as this case illustrates we see that the case really needed a watchdog,and we can not see what would be gained by everyone having to wait for the internal revenue service to take action against greenblatt tax shenanigans.the irs did receive a copy of the plan and did object to it,but may have thought that since it could always disallow the deductions later if the plan got confirmed and since it is in the business of preventing abuse of bankruptcy per se,there was no need for it to intervene in the bankruptcy.
and even if the trustee was not a party in interest,the bankruptcy or district court,since it can hardly be thought required to approve an unlawful plan of reorganization,need not turn a deaf ear when the trustee,or anyone else for that matter,argues the plan unlawfulness.if in doing so the trustee is acting ultra vires,as we very much doubt,his superiors in the justice department can rein him in but even if he should be thought an officious intermeddler,this would not authorize scattered to flout bankruptcy law.congress has authorized the federal courts to issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title the bankruptcy code,and,even more pointedly,has declared that no provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from,sua sponte,taking any action or making any determination necessary or appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules,or to prevent an abuse of process.a.consistent with this language,bankruptcy judges have considered issues of tax avoidance on their own initiative.in re hartman material handling systems,and in re maxim industries,in re economy cast stone.as hartman explained,this court can not fairly consider plan confirmation and ignore the obvious tax avoidance question.congress has given the bankruptcy courts the responsibility for determining whether a reorganization plan is proper,including tax considerations.at.
and given the breadth of the statutory definition of party in interest,how can the trustee have standing to make motions and be heard in bankruptcy cases as he is expressly authorized to do,b if he has no interest in such cases we conclude that he is a party in interest,and come at last to the merits of the appeal.
south beach was once a registered securities,but by the time it declared bankruptcy it had become a shell.it had no employees or business activities,and its only assets were net operating losses.these are better described as potential assets,because they can sometimes,but by no means always,as we about to see,be set off against taxable income and thus reduce a company taxes.united dominion industries,united states,in re comdisco,inc,cir in re harvard industries,cir boris bittker james eustice,federal income taxation of corporations and shareholders,ed.we do know how south beach came to have these losses its only recent activity was preparing its bankruptcy filing.
south beach is wholly owned by nola,llc,which has no business operations either its sole asset is the stock of south beach.nola,a limited liability company,has three members.one is greenblatt father the others are the fathers of scattered other two officers and directors.nola is managed by a company named teletech whose president and sole employee at the relevant time was greenblatt and whose sole function is to manage nola.through teletech,and thus through nola,greenblatt controls south beach.
in greenblatt directed another corporation that he controls,loop corporation,to lend south beach million for five years at an annual interest rate of percent.he then had south beach lend nola million.the purpose of the loan to nola was to enable it to purchase the stock of a company called health risk management,inc hrm.we do not know where south beach obtained million to make up the difference between the million that it received from loop and the million that it lent to nola.it may have had assets left over from its time as a as we said,it has no assets now other than net operating losses.
loop then sold to scattered,for,the million loan that it had made to south beach.this made scattered a creditor of south beach,because south beach was loop debtor and now scattered had stepped into loop shoes.scattered claims to be owed million by south beach,though it has not explained why the million loan that it bought from loop should give it a million claim against south beach,the debtor on that loan conceivably the explanation is the high interest rate.
greenblatt is an officer and director of scattered,along with the sons of nola other owners,and it appears that he negotiated all the transactions relating to this case both with and on behalf of south beach.he also signed south beach chapter petition.all the companies that we have mentioned except hrm have the same office address.it is apparent that greenblatt caused scattered to become south beach creditor and caused south beach to declare bankruptcy.
south beach bankruptcy filings list,as its sole asset,the stock in hrm,and assign to that stock a value of zero.how south beach ended up with hrm stock,which it had lent nola the money to buy,is unexplained,but it confirms the obvious all these companies are controlled by greenblatt.
nola,having used the money it borrowed from south beach to buy stock in hrm that became worthless,and having no other assets,went broke too,just like south beach.its bankruptcy proceeding began at the same time as south beach,but is not before us.
south beach did not list its net operating losses as an asset.but its disclosure statement,consistent with the requirement that material tax consequences be described in it,does state that the purpose of the bankruptcy is to monetize south beach net operating losses.amendments made to the bankruptcy code in do apply to this case,filed in april this disclosure requirement explicit.a bankruptcy service,lawyer edition.but the requirement has been held to be implicit in the version of section applicable to this case.see hall vance,cir in re metrocraft publishing services.
the plan of reorganization proposed by south beach and turned down by the bankruptcy judge and the district judge would have given scattered all the stock of south beach.a court ca confirm a plan of reorganization,however,unless the owners of at least one class of impaired claims a term broadly defined to encompass claims altered by the plan,in re wabash valley power ass n,cir in re l j anaheim associates,cir homer drake,christopher strickland,chapter reorganizations,ed,other than an insider member of the class,vote to approve it,a,and also unless either the owners of all other classes of impaired claims accept the plan,or the other conditions in that subsection for a cramdown approval of a plan over the objection of one or some of the creditors are met.a,b.a class of claims is deemed to have accepted a plan if creditors other than the insiders that section a excludes from the eligible voters for a plan vote for it who own at least in amount,and more than a half in number,of allowed claims of the class.c.scattered voted for the plan south beach had no other creditors we defer the question whether in the absence of other creditors scattered consent was effective.
had the plan been confirmed,scattered,as sole creditor of the debtor,would have ended up owning south beach net operating losses.south beach could not have offset those losses against its own income since it has no income or assets aside from the potential assets consisting of the losses themselves and no prospects of obtaining any it is not engaged in any business or investment activities and in fact is defunct,though it remains a corporation in good standing.consistent with the law of mississippi where it is incorporated for maintaining its corporate status in the absence of an agreement by the shareholders to eliminate the board of directors,south beach has a single director.ann.a,b.he is unpaid and inactive,since he does nothing.but he does have,greenblatt testified,a beating heart,and no more is required.
outside of bankruptcy,south beach net operating losses could be used to obtain a tax benefit only if the company received a capital infusion that enabled it to obtain income against which to offset the losses,or if its assets other than the net operating losses were acquired by a company that had income or assets.for the general rule is that taxpayers may not transfer net operating losses to other taxpayers.in re luster,cir irs private letter ruling may.if the plan of reorganization were approved,scattered would become the owner of south beach and,wanting to extract a tax benefit from south beach net operating losses,would transfer capital to south beach to enable that company to generate income against which to offset the net operating losses.the result would be to shield income of scattered from federal tax,because south beach income would be scattered income since scattered would be south beach sole owner.
consistent with the general rule that we just mentioned,both the internal revenue code and the tax doctrine of substance over form on which see,gregory helvering,in re comdisco,supra,at yosha commissioner,cir in re cm holdings,cir stewart.commissioner,cir impose limitations on using the purchase of a company as the basis for deducting the company net operating losses from the purchaser taxable income.comdisco applied the doctrine to a net operating loss.if,for example,the owner of the corporation that has the losses sells his stock,the corporation is not permitted to offset those losses against its future income by more than the income the
