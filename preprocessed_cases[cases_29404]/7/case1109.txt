conseco,and two of its senior officers entered into certain employee benefit agreements.shortly thereafter,both officers employment with conseco ended,and conseco subsequently went bankrupt.at issue is whether conseco obligations under certain of these agreements continued for the benefit of one of these former employees after conseco bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court did not think so and granted summary judgment in favor of conseco.the district court agreed,and for the following reasons,we affirm.
stephen hilbert and rollin dick were the ceo and cfo,respectively,of conseco.in the years prior to conseco bankruptcy filing,they received hundreds of millions of dollars from conseco in the form of salary,loan guarantees,and various other ostensible forms of compensation.in late,hilbert and dick entered into agreements the agreements with conseco.the subject matter of each agreement was one life insurance policy,in which either hilbert or dick or their spouses was the insured.under the agreements,conseco would be responsible for remitting the premium payments to the insurance companies,with a small contribution to be made by hilbert and dick.there were five agreements in all,with four benefitting hilbert and the fifth benefitting dick.at issue here are the four agreements in which hilbert was the insured and dick was named as trustee.
on december,hilbert asked conseco compensation committee for formal authorization of the agreements.at that meeting,hilbert noted that due to conseco previous encouragement of senior executives to purchase large amounts of company stock,the death of a senior executive could inflict a liquidity crisis upon the estate and require the expedited sale of conseco stock without regard to existing market conditions.the life insurance,hilbert explained,would alleviate this potential cash crunch.the committee authorized conseco to enter into the agreements.
there were three parties to each agreement conseco,the employee hilbert,and the owner of the insurance policy.the four policies were owned by two irrevocable trusts created by hilbert in which dick was the trustee the trusts.neither hilbert nor dick were beneficiaries of the trusts.the policy amounts for three of the policies was million each,and million for the fourth,for a total death benefit of million.
under the agreements,conseco agreed to pay virtually all of the annual premiums for each insurance policy.conseco stated motivation was to reflect that the employee is also an officer and director of the corporation and has contributed significantly to its success.the corporation desires to continue to retain the services of the employee.
the agreements required conseco to determine the precise allocation of premium payments between conseco and hilbert,calculated to ensure favorable tax treatment to hilbert.hilbert or one of the trusts was to forward hilbert portion to conseco,which,in turn,was to remit the full premium payments to the insurers.
hilbert was the sole insured person under the million policy.the other polices were polices,in which the death benefit did not pay until after the deaths of both hilbert and his wife.when the death benefit payments were to be paid,conseco had the unqualified right to recover the amount of premium payments it had made.the policies owners the trusts were entitled to the remaining balance,if any.in addition,conseco obtained a collateral assignment for each insurance policy to secure this reimbursement.
the agreements specified two events which would terminate the agreements before the death benefits came due bankruptcy of conseco,or hilbert share of the annual premium was not paid and conseco elected not to cover the shortfall.in either case,the trusts had the option to purchase the policies from conseco within days of the termination event by reimbursing conseco for its premium payments.such a purchase had the added effect of releasing conseco collateral assignment.if the period lapsed,conseco had the option of becoming the owner of the policies or enforcing its security interest by surrendering the policies for cash.if conseco elected to surrender the policies,it could take reimbursement from the proceeds with any residual to be remitted to the trusts.
the parties operated under the agreements from until december.hilbert and dick employment with conseco ended in april,the circumstances of which are not before us.conseco stopped paying the premiums on hilbert policies beginning with the december payment.the policies did not lapse as a result of the nonpayment at some point the trusts converted them to policies with lower death benefits.
on december,conseco filed its petition for bankruptcy.on february,the trusts filed proofs of claim against conseco alleging that conseco breached the agreements.on september,the bankruptcy court entered an order confirming conseco plan of reorganization,and the plan became effective the following day.in september,conseco informed the trusts of its intent to exercise its early termination rights,to which the trusts responded that they would sue conseco for breach of contract and conversion should conseco attempt to do so.on april,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of conseco.the district court affirmed,and the trusts appeal.

conseco argues that the filing of its bankruptcy petition triggered the early termination provision of the contract.early termination provisions are commonly invalidated by e of the bankruptcy code,which provides 
n otwithstanding a provision in an executory contract or unexpired lease,or in applicable law,an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor may not be terminated or modified,and any right or obligation under such contract or lease may not be terminated or modified,at any time after the commencement of the case solely because of a provision in such contract or lease that is conditioned on 
b the commencement of a case under this title.
section applies only to executory contracts therefore,if the agreements were not executory contracts on december,then the filing of conseco bankruptcy petition on that date will have ended its obligations by virtue of the early termination clause.although the bankruptcy code does not define executory contract,we have held an executory contract for purposes is a contract on which performance remains due to some extent on both sides.in re streets beard farm,cir citing.at and.at,reprinted in,and,respectively see nlrb bildisco bildisco,d citing same to define executory contract for a.recognizing that the literal definition would render nearly all agreements executory,we determined that in order to effectuate congress intent,should be applied only to contracts where significant unperformed obligations remain on both sides.streets beard farm,at emphasis added citing vern countryman,executory contracts in bankruptcy part i,gouveia tazbir,cir citation omitted holding restrictive covenant giving ongoing right of present enjoyment of real property did not amount to an executory contract subject to.in other words,a contract is executory if each party is burdened with obligations which if not performed would amount to a material breach.see streets beard farm,at in re columbia gas,cir u nless both parties have unperformed obligations that would constitute a material breach if not performed,the contract is not executory under.
