section a of the bankruptcy code provides that debts for educational loans made,insured or guaranteed by a governmental unit,or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit,may not be discharged unless excepting such debt from discharge would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents.federal government student loan programs began in.in,to curb perceived abuses,the commission on the bankruptcy laws of the united states recommended that educational loans be nondischargeable unless the first payment falls due more than five years prior to the petition.doc,reprinted in b app.collier on bankruptcy,pt.c,at ed.congress enacted this recommendation in the bankruptcy reform act of,a,stat,codified at a.in,congress lengthened from five to seven years the period beyond which student loans became automatically dischargeable,stat,amending a a.then,in the higher education amendments of,congress eliminated this time limitation,making undue hardship the only exception to,a,stat.

when this case was tried in february,jesperson was years old,in good health,and unmarried,with two sons from different relationships living with their mothers.he began college in,attended three schools over the next eleven years,and graduated from the university of in.he began law school in,changed schools in,completed his legal education in,and passed the bar on his first attempt in february.at the time of trial,he owed ecmc in principal,interest,and collection costs on eighteen student loans,and he owed arrow financial services on seven other student loans.he has never repaid any part of any loan.
the bankruptcy court found that jesperson record of work experience is besmirched by a patent lack of ambition,cooperation and commitment.at.after passing the bar,jesperson was hired as a judicial clerk on the island of saipan,then as an attorney with alaska legal services,and then as a legal temporary with kelly services.he quit each job for a variety of personal reasons.several months after leaving kelly,he began work for another placement agency,spherion professional services.at the time of trial,he was working on a project that paid an hour.he was one of only ten lawyers spherion retained out of a pool of sixty.he testified at trial 
q it true,jesperson,that you think this debt should just go away,is that true 
q and even if you had,jesperson,an extra per month,you do think you should have to put that towards your student loans,do you 
based on gross monthly income of,jesperson stipulated that he was likely in the combined federal and state income tax bracket.using this inflated tax rate,the bankruptcy court found that his current income was per month.use of the inflated tax rate was clear error.arguably,jesperson failure to make a good faith estimate of his applicable tax rate means that he failed to prove undue hardship.alternatively,a reasonable estimate of the combined rate for gross income of would be,producing net income of per month rather than per month.the bankruptcy court estimated jesperson basic necessary monthly expenses as for housing,for child support,for food,for auto maintenance and insurance,for gasoline,and for parking.at.however,jesperson testified at trial that he lived rent free with his brother,expected to pay his brother per month,and was looking for an apartment.estimating his basic necessary monthly housing expense at per month,rather than,was clear error.a debtor making a good faith effort to repay loans would continue to live with his brother to save money.while jesperson is under a court order to pay per month to support his elder son,he testified he has never made a full monthly payment.he does not owe child support for the younger son,but occasionally pays to the mother of this son,and feels an obligation to pay to support each child.
based on these estimates,the bankruptcy court concluded that jesperson current surplus is at best a trifle and more likely a fiction.at.this was clear error.a court may not engage in speculation when determining net income and reasonable and necessary living expenses.see,in re rose,cir.bap.to be reasonable and necessary,an expense must be modest and commensurate with the debtor resources.in re debrower.on this record,it is apparent that the court underestimated jesperson monthly net income and overestimated his reasonable and necessary living expenses in concluding he has no current surplus from which student loans could be repaid.compare in re ekenasi,cir.a reasonable estimate would be a surplus of approximately per month.
jesperson young age,good health,number of degrees,marketable skills,and lack of substantial obligations to dependents or mental or physical impairments weigh in favor of not granting an undue hardship discharge.see,oyler educ.credit mgmt,cir in re gerhardt,cir goulet educ.credit mgmt,cir in re burton.thus,on this record,the only reason he has even a colorable claim of undue hardship is the sheer magnitude of his student loan debts.while the size of student loan debts relative to the debtor financial condition is relevant,this should rarely be a determining factor 
it would be perverse to allow the debtor to benefit from his own inaction,delay and recalcitrance by automatically granting discharge simply because the debt is a sizeable one.this,of course,would benefit those who delay and obstruct the longest and could encourage other students to follow the same course.

when the size of the debts is the principal basis for a claim of undue hardship,the generous repayment plans congress authorized the secretary of education to design and offer under the william ford federal direct student loan program become more relevant to a undue hardship analysis.see student loan reform act of,tit.iv,stat,codified at d.the most generous plan is the income contingent repayment plan icrp,which permits an eligible borrower to make varying annual repayment amounts based on the income of the borrower,paid over an extended period of time prescribed by the secretary,not to exceed years.d d see.though the house and senate bills initially provided that loans issued under the direct student loan program would not be dischargeable,the house conference report explained why this provision was deleted from the final bill 
the conferees believe that current provisions of the bankruptcy code are sufficient to protect against unnecessary discharge of direct student loans in bankruptcy.section a of the bankruptcy code operates to prevent the discharge of federally guaranteed education loans except in cases where failure to allow the discharge would impose an undue hardship it is the intent of the conferees that loans made pursuant to the federal direct student loan program would be subject to these same limitations on discharge.

ecmc presented undisputed evidence that its loans to jesperson are eligible for the icrp.based on jesperson adjusted gross income at the time of trial,the bankruptcy court found that his monthly icrp payments would be per month for a family of one,per month for a family of two,and per month for a family of three,without regard to the size of his unpaid student loan balance.thus,with a current surplus of per month,the record establishes that he can make icrp payments on his ecmc loans without compromising a minimal standard of living.in these circumstances,the debt should not be discharged.long,at see in re faish,cir.
the bankruptcy court and the district court rejected reliance on the icrp because it does not offer a fresh start and might even be viewed as inimical to the goals of the fresh start because the icrp allows for negative amortization of the student loan debt and a potentially significant tax bill if the student loan is ultimately forgiven after years.at,quoting lee,at.we disagree.in a,congress carved an exception to the fresh start permitted by discharge for unpaid,federally subsidized student loans.if the debtor with the help of an icrp program can make student loan repayments while still maintaining a minimal standard of living,the absence of a fresh start is not undue hardship.
the bankruptcy court and the district court also relied on a flawed analysis of the icrp.to demonstrate negative amortization,the bankruptcy court presented a chart showing jesperson student loan debt to ecmc growing to over the icrp repayment period on account of the capitalization of unpaid interest if he made monthly icrp payments.but the chart ignored the icrp explicit ten percent limit on the capitalization of unpaid interest.c.likewise,the court reference to a potentially significant tax bill when any unpaid balance is cancelled after years ignored the fact that cancellation results in taxable income only if the borrower has assets exceeding the amount of debt being cancelled.see a b.
jesperson is a paradigmatic example of a student loan debtor for whom icrp eligibility combined with his other circumstances require a conclusion of no undue hardship.near the start of his legal career,he seeks bankruptcy discharge of multiple student loan debts he never tried to repay.recent employment is evidence that,if motivated,he will enjoy sustained legal employment in future years,profiting from his many years of higher education.based on jesperson history of employment retention difficulty,the bankruptcy court thought it unlikely he would increase or even maintain his current rate of pay in the future.but this pessimistic speculation is unwarranted and inappropriate.a debtor is not entitled to an undue hardship discharge of student loan debts when his current income is the result of limitations,rather than lack of job skills,and he has not made payments on his student loan debt despite the ability to do so.in re loftus.with the receipt of a education,the student assumes an obligation to make a good faith effort to repay those loans,as measured by his or her efforts to obtain employment,maximize income,and minimize expenses.in re roberson,cir.here,jesperson testified that he was unaware of the icrp until settlement negotiations in this proceeding,further evidence of a less than good faith effort to repay his student loan debts.
on this record,we conclude that,with the aid of an income contingent repayment plan,mark allen jesperson can presently make student loan payments without compromising a minimal standard of living,and he has the potential of repaying at least a substantial portion of his student loan debts during the icrp repayment period.when a debtor is eligible for the icrp,the court in determining undue hardship should be less concerned that future income may decline.the icrp formula adjusts for such declines,without regard to the unpaid student loan balance,which in most cases will avoid undue hardship.therefore,however unattractive or unfair jesperson may find this situation,he is not entitled to an undue hardship discharge under a.the judgment of the district court is reversed,and the case is remanded with directions to enter an order declaring that jesperson student loan debts to ecmc are not discharged.
i concur in the court judgment that,applying de novo review,jesperson is ineligible for an undue hardship discharge of his student loan debt under a.i write separately to emphasize that whether the debtor enrolled in the income contingent repayment plan icrp remains merely a factor to consider when applying the test.in the present case,even assuming that jesperson decision to forgo enrolling in the icrp was reasonable,other relevant factors,such as jesperson young age,good health,number of degrees,marketable skills,and lack of substantial obligations to dependents or mental or physical impairments,supra part iii,establish that jesperson does not represent the type of debtor experiencing undue hardship that congress envisioned receiving the benefit of a.
