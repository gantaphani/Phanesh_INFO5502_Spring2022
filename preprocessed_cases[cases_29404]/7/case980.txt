the defendant barbara hurtado appeals the district court decision granting summary judgment against her,in favor of the trustee charles taunt.barbara hurtado hurtado,the mother of debtor jon rey hurtado,was the recipient of a fraudulent conveyance made by her son and her,debtor denice hurtado.the hurtados eventually filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in.
on appeal,barbara hurtado claims that she was not an initial transferee from whom the trustee could recover a fraudulent conveyance under,because she only distributed the funds according to the desires of the debtors.she therefore claims to be a mere conduit for the funds,lacking the requisite legal dominion over the funds sufficient to be considered an initial transferee.
the bankruptcy court agreed with barbara hurtado and rendered summary judgment in her favor.the district court reversed and granted summary judgment in favor of the trustee.we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
jon rey hurtado sometimes referred to as jon rey and denice hurtado,who are married,are the debtors in this case.they filed for chapter bankruptcy protection on september.their debts were discharged on december.the plaintiff in this case is charles taunt,the trustee in the underlying bankruptcy proceeding.the defendant,barbara hurtado,is the mother of debtor jon rey hurtado.
in the early,the two debtors incurred significant financial obligations to various creditors.the creditors included comerica bank,which obtained a judgment on june,against the debtors in the amount of,and the irs,which was owed roughly for taxes evidently dating back to.smaller debts were owed to the state of michigan,michigan national bank,and cigna bank.
during the time in which the debtors were incurring these debts,they received two significant blocks of income.in september,the debtors sold their house and received proceeds of.in august,the debtors settled a lawsuit against blue cross and blue shield bcbs for.instead of going to the debtors creditors or into the debtors accounts,however,the funds went immediately to hurtado mother,defendant barbara hurtado.
barbara hurtado deposited the checks into her savings account at tnc credit union.barbara hurtado and her husband daniel were the only signatories on the account and had exclusive control of the funds therein.
although the funds stayed in barbara hurtado account,she spent them only at the direction of the debtors.the debtors used the funds to pay living expenses,which amounted to a month,and to pay certain specific creditors.when the debtors needed to pay some particular living expense,they would instruct barbara hurtado to write a check on their behalf.throughout the period of this arrangement,barbara hurtado kept the debtors money separate from her own and never spent any portion of it on herself.the funds from the sale of the debtors house and the settled lawsuit against bcbs were depleted by,two years before the debtors declared bankruptcy.barbara hurtado had held funds for the debtors for over three years.no consideration was given in exchange for her aid.
although barbara hurtado characterizes the funds as always belonging to the debtors and herself as a mere agent at their direction,there was,of course,a reason why the debtors insisted on having barbara hurtado take legal control of the money.with barbara hurtado legally in control of the funds,the creditors had no access to them.the funds were not,for example,listed as the debtors assets on the form filed with the irs by the debtors in february.
there is no question that the transfer of funds was done deliberately to circumvent the creditors rights.jon hurtado baldly admitted this in deposition.when asked why he gave the funds to his mother to place in her account rather than his own,jon hurtado responded,well,several reasons.number one,i mean i got creditors and creditors.i will just be very candid with you,you know,judgments and so forth,and i needed to survive.at dep.test.of jon hurtado.barbara hurtado also knew that the money was being used to pay certain creditors,for she was the individual writing checks to them.
the trustee filed a complaint to avoid and recover the transfer of conveyances and to revoke the debtors discharge in may.the complaint was filed against the debtors as well as barbara hurtado.the debtors were later dismissed from the action by the bankruptcy court,and that decision was not appealed.
the bankruptcy court granted barbara hurtado motion for summary judgment and denied the trustee motion,on the ground that hurtado was not liable under.the bankruptcy court reasoned that barbara hurtado never had sufficient control over the money for liability to attach instead,she was a mere conduit of the funds.the district court reversed,finding that hurtado was liable as an initial transferee under.the district court issued a limited remand in the case for consideration of whether the statute of limitations barred the trustee from recovering the portion of the funds that came from the sale of the debtors home.on remand,the trustee quickly conceded the issue.the bankruptcy court then entered a final judgment in favor of the trustee on november,in the amount of the bcbs proceeds,and the district court affirmed.hurtado appealed to this court,raising solely the question of whether she is liable under with regard to the bcbs proceeds.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
in a case which comes to us from the bankruptcy court by way of an appeal from a decision of a district court,we review directly the decision of the bankruptcy court.we accord no deference to the district court decision we apply the clearly erroneous standard to the bankruptcy court findings of fact,and we review de novo the bankruptcy court conclusions of law.schilling in re kenneth allen knight trust,cir.
b.the power of avoidance under 
two provisions of the bankruptcy code are of particular importance in this case,and.the former allows a trustee to avoid certain types of fraudulent transfers the latter empowers the trustee to recover the property transferred.
the parties do not dispute that there has been a fraudulent transfer under in this case.section allows the trustee to step into the shoes of a creditor in order to nullify transfers voidable under state fraudulent conveyance acts for the benefit of all creditors.corzin fordu in re fordu,cir quotation omitted see also mason young in re young.
at the time of the transfer,there were two provisions of michigan law that potentially rendered the transfer fraudulent,namely.comp.laws and.section deems fraudulent any conveyance made by an insolvent debtor without a fair consideration section deems fraudulent any conveyance made with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any of a debtor present or future creditors.comp.laws,
the debtors do not dispute that their conveyance of the bcbs funds to barbara hurtado was fraudulent under michigan law.there is no doubt either that the conveyance was made to hinder the debtors creditors or that the debtors were insolvent and did not receive any reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer to barbara hurtado.because the conveyance was fraudulent under michigan law,vests the trustee with the right to avoid the transfer.
c.the power of recovery under 
the disputed issue in this case is whether the trustee can recover the improper transfer under.although related conceptually,these two issues must be kept analytically separate.see suhar burns in re burns,cir explaining that avoidance and recovery are distinct concepts and processes that are addressed in two separate sections of the code.section provides as follows 
a except as otherwise provided in this section,to the extent that a transfer is avoided under section,b,or a of this title,the trustee may recover,for the benefit of the estate,the property transferred,or,if the court so orders,the value of such property,from 
the initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made or 
any immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee.
b the trustee may not recover under section a of this section from 
a transferee that takes for value,includi
