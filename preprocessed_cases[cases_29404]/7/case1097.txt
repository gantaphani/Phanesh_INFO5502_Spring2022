approximately years ago,the illinois gaming board igb,or board issued a state riverboat gambling license to emerald casino.although emerald operated for a time in east dubuque,illinois,it closed that facility in two years later,it attempted to relocate its operations to rosemont,illinois,a suburb of chicago near international airport.hoping to reap economic advantage from the proposed casino,the village of rosemont decided to help emerald along by constructing a large parking facility.to make a long story short,the relocation never got off the ground.instead,emerald became embroiled in administrative proceedings before the igb,in which it risked losing its gambling license altogether,and some time thereafter,it filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.
the first of the two appeals before us now,deals with an adversary proceeding rosemont brought before the bankruptcy court.in that case,rosemont claimed that it had a right to require the defendants all members of the igb to cooperate in emerald efforts to transfer its principal asset,the gaming license,to a new holder.the bankruptcy court dismissed this action for failure to state a claim,and the district court affirmed.the second appeal,brings before us emerald objection to a different decision of the bankruptcy court.emerald wanted the bankruptcy court to enjoin the igb from revoking its gaming license and to require the igb to drop the disciplinary proceedings that were pending against emerald.here too,the bankruptcy court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim and the district court affirmed.we have consolidated the appeals for decision because of the close factual relation between them.
since we heard oral arguments in these decisions,the illinois appellate court has handed down a decision pertinent to these cases.see emerald casino,illinois gaming,d,emerald ii.in that opinion,the appellate court held that the state trial court had failed properly to enforce the appellate court mandate stemming from emerald casino,illinois gaming,d,emerald i.in emerald i,the court had held that the igb was required to grant emerald application for renewal and relocation of its license,subject to whatever revocation proceedings the igb chose to conduct.we conclude that these developments do not materially change the nature of the questions presently before us,which relate to the bankruptcy court power to require a state agency to refrain from exercising its regulatory power over a license holder.in both instances,the district court properly dismissed these actions,and we therefore affirm the two judgments before us.emerald and rosemont of course remain free to continue to pursue whatever state remedies may be available to them.
we pick up the story here with emerald effort to move its license from east dubuque to rosemont.in april,was then still operating in east for a license renewal,but it stated that it wanted to move from the mississippi to rosemont.the igb turned down its application.emerald filed an administrative appeal,but while the appeal was pending,it ceased operations.later,the administrative law judge alj affirmed the board decision,but before emerald administrative appeal went back to the board,the illinois general assembly passed an amendment to the illinois riverboat gambling act irga,to be effective june.see ilcs a.the new section permitted a licensee that was not conducting riverboat gambling on january,to apply to the board for renewal and approval of relocation to a new home dock location and the board shall grant the application and approval upon receipt by the licensee of approval from the new municipality.id.emphasis added.as the illinois appellate court noted in emerald i,this section described emerald and only emerald.
what happened on the remand to the board may have surprised the drafters of a.in light of the new law,the board declared the alj order moot and allowed emerald to file a new application for renewal and relocation.on july,the board of trustees of rosemont approved emerald request for relocation,as the statute required.some time thereafter,rosemont constructed a parking garage that was designed to serve the casino.to both emerald and rosemont dismay,however,the igb announced on january,that it intended to deny emerald application.on march,it released its formal notice of denial and more it issued a disciplinary complaint seeking to revoke emerald license.emerald sued in the circuit court of cook county,seeking a declaration that a required the igb to approve its application it also sought a writ of mandamus commanding the igb to approve the application.emerald stressed the fact that the statute imposed only two requirements on an applicant first,that it submit a proper application,and second,that the affected municipality approve the plan.at that point,the law used the mandatory word shall to describe the board duties.the cook county court ruled in favor of the board,and emerald appealed.in emerald i,the state appellate court reversed and remanded.it concluded that the legislature meant shall to be mandatory,not directory,when it enacted section a.emerald i,at.it remanded the case to the circuit court with instructions to enter summary judgment in favor of emerald and rosemont.
in the meantime,the board had been going ahead with its disciplinary proceeding.it began a trial in that proceeding in may.about a month later,on june,rosemont and four other creditors filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition against emerald.they took this step because rosemont believed that emerald had tried,or was trying,to settle the disciplinary proceeding in a manner that was detrimental to its creditors,and because emerald was refusing to reimburse rosemont for the cost of constructing the garage.the bankruptcy court granted the petition,and later emerald converted the case to a voluntary chapter proceeding.
at this point the board suspended the disciplinary proceeding,while emerald sought its approval for a proposed sale of the license.emerald also tried to put together a reorganization plan that would be acceptable to both the board and its creditors.in may,emerald filed a plan with the bankruptcy court that was unanimously supported by the members of the board.the attorney general of illinois,however,withheld her consent to the plan.the board,taking the view that it had no authority to settle the case without the attorney general consent,concluded that it had no choice but to recommence the disciplinary proceeding.it did so on june.this prompted emerald to file an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the igb it argued that the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy code,would be violated if the administrative proceedings went forward.
the attorney general then stated that she would not approve any plan of reorganization that resulted in a return of investment for the emerald shareholders who had been accused of wrongdoing in the administrative case.the illinois legislature then the picture,passing another amendment to the irga on may.the new section of the act did several things it recognized the legislature intent to increase the amount of revenue available to the state it allowed the board to reissue a license that had been revoked or not renewed and it provided that if a casino operator license was revoked or expired without a renewal,the proceeds from any reissued license would go to the state.after conducting a hearing on emerald request for relief under,the bankruptcy court denied the motion,finding that the board actions fell within the exception to the automatic stay for a governmental entity enforcement of its police and regulatory power.see b.the court rejected emerald argument that the possibility that the state might benefit financially from the revocation and reissuance of the license meant that it was indirectly engaged in debt collection activity.the district court affirmed on december.see in re emerald casino,wl.
at that point emerald was working both within and outside the bankruptcy proceeding to settle the case.within the proceeding,it pursued a plan that contemplated the sale of its business to another entity,contingent on dismissal of the disciplinary proceeding.outside the proceeding,it was negotiating with the igb and the attorney general over the conditions that it would have to obtain to gain consent to such a transfer and dismissal.the latter negotiations culminated in a side letter dated december,the first side letter.this letter was not made a part of the bankruptcy plan,but the plan was conditioned on the successful implementation of the letter.the first side letter included several commitments and said that t he ag and the igb may revoke their commitments under specified paragraphs relating to both the bids and the stay of the disciplinary proceedings if any of the specified events has occurred at that point,emerald would be entitled to days notice before the disciplinary proceedings could continue.the letter also expressly reaffirmed the state sovereign immunity.
after the first side letter was signed,the bidding procedure it had outlined took place.in march the board selected isle of capri,a company that operates gaming facilities,as the winning bidder,subject to the final suitability review.isle of capri was willing to pay million for the license.
this did not meet with the attorney general approval.in a letter to the board dated march,the attorney general raised numerous questions about the bidding process,the choice of isle of capri,and the selection of rosemont as the site for the license.in addition,she noted that one of the conditions specified in the first side letter had failed the illinois appellate court in emerald i had done something other than staying,dismissing,or affirming the circuit court decision.shortly thereafter,a second condition failed the bankruptcy court did not enter an order confirming the plan by april.the attorney general letter emphasized the lack of a fair playing field among the participants in the bidding process she criticized the decision to favor rosemont just because it had engaged in the unauthorized conduct of building the parking garage and it was pressing a dollar claim in the bankruptcy case she asked why the igb staff recommendations were ignored and she questioned the choice of isle of capri,which,she pointed out,had been disciplined frequently and fined by both state and federal regulators.her letter concluded with a request to the board to address publicly each of the concerns she had raised and to consult with her staff.she warned that i f you refuse to honor my requests,i reserve my option to resume the revocation hearing.
dissatisfied with both the board and emerald responses,the attorney general announced in may that she was ready to the disciplinary proceeding.at the same time,the process for evaluating the reorganization plan was moving ahead.the members of the igb still supported the proposed plan,under which emerald license was to be transferred to isle of capri.at the may,confirmation hearing before the bankruptcy judge,a majority of the board members testified in favor of the plan.the attorney general filed an objection to the plan,complaining that as structured it would prevent the igb from completing its disciplinary proceeding.emerald and the creditors disclaimed any intention to restrict the attorney general actions,telling the court that the plan did not at this time seek to enjoin the igb or the attorney general.emerald urged the judge to confirm the plan even if it were not guaranteed to succeed.as the following comments reveal,the bankruptcy judge recognized the frailty of the reed on which all this stood,even if some of the parties did not 
the court is there anything that would prevent the resumption of the revocation proceeding and the revocation of the license here,despite confirmation of the plan that presently before the court,other than a majority vote of the illinois gaming board 
counsel for emerald no.
the court so that if the membership of the gaming board changed,or if members of the gaming board changed their mind,there would still be a potential for revocation 
counsel for emerald well,your honor,there all sorts of things that could happen.
on that understanding,the court confirmed the plan on may.it later confirmed an amended plan on july,but the changes do not affect our analysis here.it reserved the right to vacate the confirmation order if all conditions to its effectiveness were not satisfied or waived within days after confirmation or any approved extension.the court made clear that the plan did not bind the attorney general,who was not a party before it.
after confirmation,the conflict between the igb and the attorney general took a new turn.on june,the attorney general filed an action against the board and its members seeking to enjoin them from conducting a suitability review of isle of capri.soon thereafter,the igb adopted a resolution authorizing the execution of a second side letter,which it issued on august.that letter purported to waive the failure of the conditions in the first side letter,insofar as the igb was concerned.the letter was careful to note,however,that it spoke only for the board and implicitly not for the attorney general.shortly after this letter was released,two members of the igb resigned.
matters shifted again when the igb was reconstituted in march with two new members.shortly after their appointment,the board at long last resumed the disciplinary proceedings.it appointed former circuit judge abner mikva to preside over those proceedings,and it refused to conduct any suitability review of isle of capri.these developments prompted rosemont to file the complaint now before us in the bankruptcy court it named all five members of the board and the board interim administrator as defendants.the first part of the complaint sought specific performance of the igb commitments under the reorganization plan,including the completion of the suitability review and the termination of the disciplinary proceedings.the second part sought an injunction against any conduct that interfered with the plan.
emerald also filed a complaint in the bankruptcy court seeking specific performance of the same provisions of the plan that rosemont had identified.it also asked for an injunction that would prevent the board from revoking its license and transferring the license to any party other than isle of capri.as we have already noted,the bankruptcy court rejected both rosemont and emerald claims,and two different judges on the district court affirmed those decisions.
with all this activity,it should surprise no one that developments in this case have continued apace while it has been pending before this court.prior to oral argument in the rosemont litigation,on november,alj mikva issued a opinion in which he recommended that the igb make permanent its order of revocation and that any efforts by emerald to engage in gambling in illinois at any location be denied.this recommendation was based upon findings of fact that emerald and its principals had dissembled about the plans to move to rosemont,that the renewal application emerald had filed on september,was neither accurate nor complete,and that both emerald and its principals had not been honest in other respects.emerald had also permitted ineligible parties to invest in its casino.the igb accepted this recommendation and formally revoked the license on december.on december,after rejecting several motions that would have prevented the board from acting at all,this court enjoined the igb from selling or reissuing the license pending further court order.in this way,we hoped,we would minimize federal interference in ongoing state proceedings,and at the same time preserve the status quo as it related to the federal appeals.
on june,the illinois appellate court handed down emerald ii.the precise question before the court was whether the trial court had enforced the mandate from emerald i.the appellate court recalled that its holding in emerald i had been that a of the irga imposed a nondiscretionary duty on the board to resurrect emerald license.the trial court,however,interpreted the mandate to mean that emerald had a right to have a license granted effective september,in an order dated june,and that is what the board did on june.naturally,this accomplished nothing from emerald point of view,since the newly resurrected license expired by its own terms on september,nearly two years before the board order,and three months before the illinois appellate court issued emerald i.the court found this response to its earlier order unacceptable,stating that it reject ed the notion that this court is in the business of making empty and useless gestures,at.the court also noted that the board action was inconsistent with its position in the bankruptcy proceeding,where the board was taking part in the process that would auction off emerald license interests.id,at.
the appellate court took pains to make clear that its holding addressed only the reissuance of the license and the enforcement of the court own mandate 
we stress that our only intent is to address the question of whether our mandate has been enforced.nothing else.whether emerald and rosemont possess sufficient moral fiber to conduct and host a gambling business is not now our concern.we said before and we say again nothing in section a prevents the board from moving to revoke emerald license.
emerald i,at.the supreme court said it,too the act license revocation provision still applies to emerald with full force ilcs c west,and revocation proceedings have,in fact,been initiated against it.crusius illinois gaming bd.
at.indeed,as the appellate court acknowledged,the state supreme court in crusius could not have been any clearer 
we further note that section a does not undermine the riverboat gambling act goal of strict regulation simply because it requires the board to grant emerald application for renewal and relocation.as mentioned,the act contained no provisions regarding relocation prior to the enactment of section a.therefore,the amendment of the act to allow for relocation did not diminish the regulatory authority of the board in any way.as for license renewal,it is only one facet of the board regulatory authority.if any riverboat gambling licensee,including emerald,fails to comply with the act requirements,the board has the authority to investigate and take appropriate disciplinary action.ilcs c west.the act license revocation provision still applies to emerald with full force ilcs c west,and revocation proceedings have,in fact,been initiated against it.thus,regardless of emerald eligibility for license renewal and relocation under section a,if emerald has failed to comply with the requirements of the act,it could lose its riverboat gambling license in accordance with the act provisions,as is the case with any other licensee.
at.emerald ii concluded with the following order w e direct that immediately on receipt of our mandate the trial court shall order the board to issue emerald license for renewal and relocation within days of the receipt of the trial court order.the license shall be effective as of the date of issuance and shall remain in effect for four years,subject to revocation proceedings,at emphasis added.
as we noted above,the board had already completed the disciplinary proceeding and issued a order revoking emerald license on december.although it does not quite say so in so many words,emerald is now arguing that emerald ii implicitly set aside that order of revocation,since the decision came some six months after the order.the state takes the position that the qualification in the court order excepting revocation proceedings can mean only that emerald ii left the revocation order untouched.in any event,the state points out in a supplemental letter filed january,that proceedings challenging the revocation order are pending before the illinois appellate court.
we return,at last,to the somewhat narrow issues before this court,all of which have to do with the question whether the bankruptcy court should have acted to compel the igb and its members to carry through with the terms of the reorganization plan that the bankruptcy court confirmed in its order of may.that plan,recall,which at one time had the support of a majority of the board but later lost this support and which did not have the support of the attorney general,contemplated the auction of emerald license and its transfer to the winning bidder,and it contemplated that the casino facility would remain in the village of rosemont.we are satisfied that it would still be possible to grant this relief,if we thought that it was appropriate.emerald ii took care of the renewal of emerald license,and our order staying any future transfer or reissuance of the license preserved the possibility that the igb could rescind its order of revocation and perform as emerald and rosemont would like.we therefore proceed to the merits of the appeals.
rosemont appeal 
rosemont appeal gives great prominence to the first side letter,which was signed in december.it argues that the letter became an enforceable part of the bankruptcy plan,because it was attached as an exhibit to the plan and was referred to in of the plan.the district court apparently agreed with this position,as it said several times that the december,letter agreement was incorporated in the plan by reference.this assumption favors rosemont,and so we proceed on that basis.in the end,it does not help rosemont,because the act of incorporating the first side letter does not change the content of that letter,and it is the content that should be rosemont concern.
nothing in the december letter required the attorney general to do anything,including to abandon the disciplinary proceedings.instead,the attorney general explicitly reserved the right to reactivate those proceedings,if certain conditions were not met,and it is undisputed that those conditions indeed failed.rosemont is thus forced to supplement its argument based on that letter with two additional pieces of data first,the fact that a majority of the board members testified in favor of the first side letter before the bankruptcy court,and second,the fact that the board later issued the second side letter before it later decided to withdraw its support from both letters.we see two problems with this position first is the idea that some individual members of the board can somehow estop the full board from acting in an ongoing proceeding second is the undisputed fact that the attorney general was not a party to the second side letter,and she had the power to pursue the disciplinary proceeding before the board.the board recognized this,both in the second side letter and elsewhere throughout these complex proceedings.
rosemont also argues that the bankruptcy court had the power to enforce the plan which it believes incorporated a firm obligation on the part of the board to permit the sale of emerald license to isle of capri under b of the bankruptcy code,b.that section,however,says only that t he court may direct the debtor and any other necessary party to execute or deliver or to join in the execution or delivery of any instrument required to effect a transfer of property dealt with by a confirmed plan,and to perform any other act,including the satisfaction of any lien,that is necessary for the consummation of the plan.we agree with the fifth circuit that this language does not confer any substantive rights on a party apart from whatever the plan provides.see in re brass,cir.instead,it empowers the bankruptcy court to enforce the unperformed terms of a confirmed plan.id.this also means that b is of no help to rosemont insofar as it is looking for a source of power for the bankruptcy court to enforce the second side letter,which was issued after the plan was confirmed.for that reason alone,we think it indisputable that the second side letter could not have been part of the plan.
taking another approach,rosemont urges us to find that the bankruptcy court independently had the authority under a to compel specific performance of the board alleged commitments.that statute is,more or less,a necessary and proper provision of the bankruptcy code it provides that t he court may issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.a.as rosemont
