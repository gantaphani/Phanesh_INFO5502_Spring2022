murguia,circuit judge 
in loan agreements and any subsequent bankruptcy proceedings a borrower defaults on a loan when he fails to fulfill a material obligation under the terms of the loan agreement,such as making a payment by a particular date.a default can trigger certain consequences,such as foreclosure on any property securing the loan,late fees and penalties,or acceleration,which occurs when the entire unpaid amount of the loan becomes immediately due and payable.but the borrower can also cure the default,most often by paying the arrearages and bringing the loan current.a cure generally allows the borrower to avoid the consequences of default,restores the loan to its original terms,and allows the borrower to keep the property.
the bankruptcy code incorporates the concept of cure.chapter provides that a debtor plan of reorganization must provide adequate means for the plan implementation,including the curing or waiving of any default.a g.this statute means that a plan of reorganization may include a provision authorizing the debtor to remedy any breach of a loan agreement with a creditor and return to conditions.great bank tr.lumber supply,in re lumber supply,cir.
we held in that a debtor who cures a default is entitled to avoid all consequences of the default including higher interest rates.id.at.in other words,if a loan agreement provided for a higher,interest rate on arrearages in the event of default,a debtor who cures is entitled to repay the arrearages at the lower,interest rate.we concluded that the power to cure under the bankruptcy code authorizes a plan to nullify all consequences of default,including avoidance of default penalties such as higher interest,even when the terms of the loan agreement called for a higher interest rate upon default.id.
the case before us requires us to decide whether rule that a debtor may nullify a loan agreement requirement of interest remains good law in light of d,a provision that congress enacted after.section d provides that,if a plan proposes to cure a default,the amount necessary to cure the default shall be determined in accordance with the underlying agreement and applicable nonbankruptcy law.d.we hold that rule of allowing a curing debtor to avoid a contractual interest rate in a loan agreement is no longer valid in light of d.

chapter of the bankruptcy code provides that a plan of reorganization must,among other things,provide adequate means for the plan implementation,including the curing or waiving of any default.a g.in,we observed that the bankruptcy code did not define cure.at.we borrowed the second circuit definition a default is an event in the relationship which triggers certain consequences.curing a default commonly means taking care of the triggering event and returning to conditions.the consequences are thus nullified.this is the concept of cure used throughout the bankruptcy code.id.alteration omitted quoting di pierro taddeo in re taddeo,cir.we held that the power to cure under the bankruptcy code authorizes a plan to nullify all consequences of default,including avoidance of default penalties such as higher interest.id.at.as a result,a debtor whose plan proposed to cure a default would allow him to avoid having to pay a higher,interest rate called for in the loan agreement.

notwithstanding subsection a of this section and sections b,a,and b of this title,if it is proposed in a plan to cure a default the amount necessary to cure the default shall be determined in accordance with the underlying agreement and applicable nonbankruptcy law.
subsection d renders void rule that a debtor who proposes to cure a default may avoid a higher,interest rate in a loan agreement.subsection d governs here because new investments plan proposes to cure a default.the underlying agreement here,the promissory note requires the payment of a higher interest rate upon default.and applicable nonbankruptcy law here,washington state law allows for a higher interest rate upon default when provided for in the loan agreement see.code ann.a providing that a borrower may cure a monetary default by paying the trustee t he entire amount then due under the terms of the deed of trust and the obligation secured thereby,other than such portion of the principal as would not then be due had no default occurred.in other words,under d,the amount necessary to cure new investments default is governed by the deed of trust and washington law,which respectively require and permit repayment at a higher,interest rate.
the plain language of d compels the holding that a debtor can not nullify a preexisting obligation in a loan agreement to pay interest solely by proposing a cure.but even if we were to read ambiguity into the statute,the legislative history would not help new investments.the house report for the bill that became d states that congress was primarily concer
