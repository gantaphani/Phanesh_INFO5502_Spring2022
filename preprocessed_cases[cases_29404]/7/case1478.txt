bankruptcy 
the panel reversed the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court summary judgment in favor of the defendant in an adversary proceeding brought by a chapter bankruptcy trustee.
the trustee sought to recover for the bankruptcy estate a loan payment debtor tenderloin health made to defendant bank of the west within ninety days of the filing of the bankruptcy petition.the bankruptcy court concluded that the trustee failed to satisfy the greater amount test,pursuant to b,by demonstrating that by virtue of that payment,the bank received more than it otherwise would have in a hypothetical chapter liquidation where the challenged transfer had not been made.the bankruptcy court reasoned that the bank had a right of setoff,and the debtor account contained at least on the petition date.
the trustee asserted that in the hypothetical liquidation,the trustee would avoid a deposit,leaving less than in the debtor account,even allowing for the bank right of setoff.
the panel held that courts may account for hypothetical preference actions within a hypothetical chapter liquidation when such an inquiry is factually warranted,is supported by appropriate evidence,and the action would not contravene an independent statutory provision.the panel concluded that the deposit would constitute an avoidable preference in the hypothetical liquidation at issue.the panel therefore reversed the district court judgment in favor of the bank and directed that the action be remanded to the bankruptcy court further proceedings.
district judge korman concurred in part and concurred in the judgment.he concurred in the decision to reverse and remand to the bankruptcy court and joined all but part ii of the majority opinion,addressing the hypothetical liquidation.judge korman agreed that,under the circumstances of this case,applying b greater amount test required the court to construct a hypothetical liquidation,and that in so doing,the court could consider whether a reasonable trustee would bring and win a preference action within the hypothetical chapter proceedings.he wrote that he could not,however,join in the liquidation constructed by the majority because he could not agree that the entirety of the deposit was itself a preferential transfer subject to clawback under.
in this preference action,lynn schoenmann schoenmann,the trustee in bankruptcy,seeks to recover for the bankruptcy estate a loan payment debtor tenderloin health tenderloin made to bank of the west botw within ninety days of the filing of tenderloin chapter bankruptcy.to succeed,schoenmann must demonstrate that by virtue of that payment botw received more than it otherwise would have in a hypothetical chapter liquidation where the challenged transfer had not been made.this inquiry,required by b,is called the greater amount test.
the bankruptcy court granted botw motion for summary judgment,finding schoenmann could not satisfy section b,because botw had a right of setoff,and tenderloin account contained at least on the petition date.schoenmann asserts that in the hypothetical liquidation,the trustee would avoid a deposit,leaving less than in tenderloin account,even allowing for botw right of setoff.
in order to resolve the issues presented in this case,we address whether courts may entertain hypothetical preference actions within section b hypothetical chapter liquidation,and if so,whether the deposited in this case would meet the definition of an avoidable preference.
we conclude that courts may account for hypothetical preference actions within a hypothetical chapter liquidation when such an inquiry is factually warranted,is supported by appropriate evidence,and the action would not contravene an independent statutory provision.we are also satisfied that the deposit in this case would constitute an avoidable preference in the hypothetical liquidation at issue here.
we therefore reverse the district court judgment in favor of botw and direct that this action be remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
in may,botw extended a line of credit to tenderloin,a clinic serving aids patients in san francisco.botw loaned another to tenderloin two years later.the loans were secured by tenderloin personal property,including its deposit accounts with botw.
in late or early,tenderloin elected to wind up its affairs.in carrying out that election,it sold its only real property for.the escrow on that sale closed on june.tenderloin used the proceeds of that sale to execute two transactions that same day.first,it paid botw from escrow to satisfy fully its outstanding loan obligations debt payment.next,it moved the rest of its net sale proceeds from escrow into its botw deposit account the deposit.
on july,tenderloin filed for chapter bankruptcy.ninety days prior to filing,its account contained approximately that sum shrunk to on the date of the two disputed transfers,but grew to immediately after the deposit.tenderloin then spent some of its funds in the days preceding its bankruptcy,so the account contained on the petition date.if we subtract from that sum the amount of the disputed deposit tenderloin account would have contained only on the petition date.
schoenmann sued botw on december,alleging that the debt payment was preferential,and subject to avoidance under b.the bankruptcy court granted botw motion for summary judgment on july,concluding that schoenmann could not show that botw received more than it would have in a hypothetical liquidation where the debt payment had not been made.schoenmann appealed to the district court pursuant to a.the district court affirmed,and schoenmann timely appealed to our court.

section b permits a bankruptcy trustee to recover for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate preferential payments from a debtor to a creditor made within the ninety days preceding the filing of a bankruptcy.b.to avoid such a payment,the trustee must show,among other things 
that it enables such creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if 
a the case were a case under chapter of this title 
b the transfer had not been made and 
c such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.
b emphasis added.
this element b constitutes the greater amount test,which requires the court to construct a hypothetical chapter case and determine what the creditor would have received if the case had proceeded under chapter without the alleged preferential transfer alvarado walsh in re lco enters,cir.lco.schoenmann challenges the debt payment,claiming that section b is satisfied in this case if botw received a greater amount than it would have if the debt payment had not been made and there had been a hypothetical chapter liquidation as of the petition date.batlan transamerica commercial fin.in re smith home furnishings,cir.smith.
the bankruptcy court determined that botw did not receive more than it would have in a hypothetical liquidation because it maintained a right of setoff that entitled it to full payment,and tenderloin deposit account held the requisite amount of funds on the petition date.schoenmann argues,however,that the trustee would avoid the deposit in a hypothetical liquidation,such that the deposit account would contain only on the petition date,a sum far less than the botw actually received,even allowing for its right of setoff.
botw objects to schoenmann analysis for two reasons.first,botw insists it is impermissible to entertain a hypothetical preference action within a hypothetical liquidation.second,botw claims that the deposit made by tenderloin into its deposit account would not meet the definition of an avoidable preference.we find neither argument persuasive.
section b does not forbid courts from considering hypothetical preference actions.
the text of the bankruptcy code,its legislative history,and current practice in the bankruptcy courts all support the conclusion that courts may entertain hypothetical preference actions within hypothetical chapter liquidations.further,our holding in lco does not pose an obstacle to this conclusion.
text and legislative history 
statutory interpretation begins with the text.pakootas teck cominco metals,cir.if the meaning of the text is unambiguous,the statute must be enforced according to its terms.id.
here,section b permits the trustee to avoid any transfer within ninety days of bankruptcy that enables the creditor to receive more than such creditor would receive if a the case were a case under chapter of this title b the transfer had not been made and c such creditor received payment of such debt to the extent provided by the provisions of this title.b emphasis added.the phrase provisions of this title appears to refer to the totality of title of the code,which includes the preference provisions appearing in section.accordingly,the text clearly does not directly forbid courts from considering hypothetical preference actions within a hypothetical chapter liquidation.however,since the statute treats the issue globally,our understanding will be refined by considering the legislative history of section b.
section was included in the bankruptcy reform act of pub,stat.describing element b,the senate committee report states the transfer must enable the creditor to receive a greater percentage of his claim than he would receive under the distributive provisions of the bankruptcy code,at,reprinted in,emphasis added.the phrase distributive provisions might be thought to narrow the hypothetical liquidation to disbursement under chapter,but the very next sentence clarifies the meaning of the phrase specifically,the creditor must receive more than he would if the case were a liquidation case,if the transfer had not been made,and if the creditor received payment of the debt to the extent provided by the provisions of the code.id.emphasis added.the house report echoes this language a preference is a transfer that enables a creditor to receive payment of a greater percentage of his claim against the debtor than he would have received if the transfer had not been made and he had participated in the distribution of the assets of the bankrupt estate,at,reprinted in.the phrase participate s in the distribution leaves room to assume the hypothetical chapter trustee might initiate preference actions in conjunction with the distribution of the assets of the estate.
evidence bearing more directly on this question appears in the paragraphs that follow the general overview of section b.the reports provide 
the phrasing of the final element changes the application of the greater percentage test from that employed under current law.under this language,the court must focus on the relative distribution between classes as well as the amount that will be received by the members of the class of which the preferee is a member.the language also requires the court to focus on the allowability of the claim for which the preference was made.if the claim would have been entirely disallowed,for example,then the test of paragraph will be met,because the creditor would have received nothing under the distributive provisions of the bankruptcy code.
at emphasis added accord at.by invoking allowability,which refers generally to whether payment of a claim would violate some independent provision of the bankruptcy code,the report suggests it is appropriate to consider whether a hypothetical claim would be affected by the preference provisions.there are numerous cases that refer to the greater amount test as implicating the distributive provisions of the code but in light of this history,we can not exclude section from the hypothetical chapter distribution.
current practice under the bankruptcy code 
the view that courts may consider hypothetical preference actions within hypothetical chapter liquidations is bolstered by the fact that bankruptcy courts are doing precisely that under two other provisions of the code.
section a a ii requires bankruptcy courts to determine what creditors would receive under a hypothetical chapter liquidation,and then compare that amount to what the same creditors would receive under a chapter reorganization.it provides that a bankruptcy court may confirm a chapter plan only if each holder of an impaired claim will receive or retain property of a value,as of the effective date of the plan,that is not less than the amount that such holder would so receive or retain if the debtor were liquidated under chapter of this title on such date.a a ii.although t he hypothetical liquidation analysis must be based on evidence and not assumptions in order to meet the best interests of creditors test,collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed.hereinafter collier citing in re mcorp,bankr,a trustee avoiding powers in a hypothetical chapter case may affect the analysis,id.
for instance,in in re affiliated foods,bankr,the court found the statute requires an estimation of the value of all of the bankruptcy estate assets,including such hard to determine values as disputed and contingent claims,the potential disallowance of claims under d,the probability of success and value of causes of action held by the estate,and,in this case,potential preference actions.id.at internal citation omitted.likewise,in in re,bankr.cal,the court found all provisions applicable in a chapter liquidation are to be taken into account when the court determines what sums would be paid to whom in a hypothetical liquidation.id.at.it then applied two avoidance provisions in the hypothetical liquidation using the facts and testimony in the record.see id.at concluding a competent chapter trustee would be able to recover against the creditor under and.
chapter has a comparable best interest of the creditors test that requires the same comparison.section a requires a bankruptcy court to confirm a chapter plan if,among other things,the value,as of the effective date of the plan,of property to be distributed under the plan is not less than the amount that would be paid on such claim if the estate of the debtor were liquidated under chapter of this title on such date.when administering this provision,court s must consider property that would be likely to be recovered by a chapter trustee use of the avoiding powers.collier see also in re larson,bankr.finding that in the hypothetical liquidation,the court must look not only at the debtor assets as listed on his schedules,but it must also consider the recovery of assets by the trustee through fraudulent transfer and preference actions.
lastly,we note that several courts have applied hypothetical setoff analyses under section within hypothetical chapter liquidations.see durham smi indus,cir.smi would have been entitled to assert its right of setoff under section a if the check exchange had not been executed before continental petition was filed since both debts were incurred.braniff airways,exxon,cir.the fact that a setoff never actually took place does not affect the analysis.the issue is whether exxon hypothetically had the right to a setoff,and because of this right it was secured and therefore the payment received from braniff was not a voidable preference.mason dixon lines,johnsbury trucking in re mason dixon lines,bankr.in the case at bar,had the debtor not made the payment to the creditor carrier,the creditor could have offset the debt prepetition pursuant to section or if the days elapsed postpetition had the offset amount as a secured claim under section a.lingley contractors,in re nepsco,bankr.maine had the debtor in this case not paid cgi the prior to the filing of the chapter petition,cgi would have been entitled to a right of setoff under a.true,hypothetical setoff analyses,unlike preference actions,do not require that we assume a party will initiate an adversary proceeding.that said,it would be odd to permit bankruptcy courts conducting hypothetical liquidations to look only to section,while ignoring other chapter provisions,like section.
c.our prior holding in lco poses no bar.
in response,botw relies on our decision in lco,which held the hypothetical chapter analysis required by b must be based on the actual facts of the case.at.since schoenmann has not challenged the deposit in tenderloin actual liquidation,botw asserts we may not permit such a challenge in a hypothetical liquidation.a close reading of lco reveals that this argument is misguided because it improperly relies on the decision broad language divorced from the context of the case.
in lco,the debtor,lco enterprises,leased commercial space from a company named lincoln.id.lco fell behind in paying rent and filed for chapter bankruptcy,leading lco and lincoln to restructure their relationship.id.specifically,they changed the terms of the lease agreement,and lco disclosed the terms of the revised agreement in its chapter plan.id.lco then faced the decision of whether it would assume or reject the lease in bankruptcy.id.importantly,under chapter,the lco stands in the shoes of the trustee.additionally,if the debtor was in default on an unexpired lease before filing for bankruptcy,the lease may not be assumed unless,at the time of assumption,the trustee cures the default and provides adequate assurance of future performance.b a c.lco,as trustee,assumed the revised lease and cured the default,in compliance with section b.lco,at.the reorganization plan was eventually confirmed by the bankruptcy court.id.at.
two months after confirmation,a chapter trustee was appointed to pursue any preferential payments.id.the trustee sued to recover several rent payments lco transmitted to lincoln in the ninety days preceding the filing of its bankruptcy.id.the action turned on the greater amount test,whether lincoln received more than it otherwise would have in a hypothetical chapter liquidation as of the petition date where the prepetition rent payment had not been made.id.at.
the trustee argued that in a hypothetical liquidation,a hypothetical chapter trustee might have rejected the lease,giving lincoln an unsecured claim for its shortfall in rent,rather than the full payment it received when the lease was assumed and the default was cured.id.at.the trustee also said the court should exercise its own independent judgment as to whether,if the court were administering the estate under chapter,it would have assumed or rejected the lease at the time of the chapter bankruptcy.id.we rejected these arguments,holding t he phrase hypothetical chapter does not mean that the bankruptcy court can construct its own hypothetical from whole cloth or from only some of the facts.id.at.rather,the hypothetical chapter analysis required by b must be based on the actual facts of the case.id.at.since the lease had been assumed,the bankruptcy court could neither speculate that there was no lease nor assume that the lease was rejected.id.at.those assumptions simply did not reflect the facts at any time.id.moreover,under section b,once the lease was assumed,the requirement to cure any default was mandated.this gave lincoln a secured claim for all outstanding prepetition rent in the hypothetical liquidation,so it did not receive more than it otherwise would,precluding satisfaction of the greater amount test 
importantly,we also noted that if we deviated from the actual facts in the case,and assumed that the hypothetical chapter trustee had rejected the lease,the trustee would be allowed to recover payments it was obligated to make to lincoln to cure the default pursuant to section b.id.at.in other words,straying from the actual facts would permit b to circumvent the requirements of b.id.to avoid such a statutory collision,we held t he t rustee can not have his leased property and his rent payments,too.id.at.
mindful of this context,it is apparent that lco required fidelity to the actual facts in the case because to hold otherwise under those circumstances would have violated an independent statutory provision of the bankruptcy code.section b requires the trustee to pay the landlord all outstanding rent when a lease is assumed,but a preference action would permit the trustee to recover the very prepetition rent payments it owes the landlord under that provision.in light of this conflict,we conclude that lco must be narrowly construed.to that end,courts that have followed lco holding have done so when presented with the same statutory collision scenario.see in re kiwi int l air lines,at t he assumption of a contract under bars a preference claim by a trustee.in re superior toy,cir.section and are mutually exclusive avenues for a trustee.a trustee may not prevail under both.nor may a subsequent trustee pursue one course,when her predecessor has pursued another.
adding further support for the interpretation that lco requires fidelity to the actual facts only when doing otherwise would violate an independent statutory provision,the opinion explicitly relies on the eleventh circuit decision in seidle gatx leasing corporation,cir.see lco,at.there,a creditor held a chattel mortgage on a debtor aircraft which secured payments due under a note.seidle,at.the debtor made partial payments on the note within the ninety day period preceding its chapter bankruptcy.id.once in bankruptcy,the debtor and creditor entered into a stipulation under,obligating the debtor to cure its default in exchange for the debtor continued use of the aircraft.id.at.the trustee later sued to recover as preferential the prepetition payments made on the note.id.the court rejected the preference action because the trustee was seeking to recover payments it was obligated to make under the stipulation.see id.at pursuant to the section stipulation,a creditor is entitled to unpaid payments,as defaults a trustee may not later thwart the effect of the statute by challenging the validity of these transfers as preferences.as in lco,if the court assumed a hypothetical trustee would have rejected the stipulation,it would be permitting a preference action that would undermine an independent statutory provision section.
in sum,lco does not bar us in this case from assuming in a hypothetical liquidation that the hypothetical trustee would sue to recover the deposit.unlike in lco,permitting such an action would not violate any other statutory provision,and it is consistent with the text and legislative history recited above having established that section b does not forbid courts from entertaining hypothetical preference actions,we next must determine if the deposit in this case would meet the definition of an avoidable preference.
ii.in the hypothetical liquidation,the trustee would avoid the deposit as a preference.
schoenmann concedes botw would have a right of setoff in the hypothetical liquidation botw asserts it would exercise that right sometime after the bankruptcy petition was filed.in that scenario,if we permit the hypothetical preference action,botw will have received more as a result of the debt payment than it would have received in a hypothetical chapter liquidation 
hypothetical setoff 
where a creditor fails to exercise its right of setoff prior to the filing of the petition it does not lose the right,but must proceed in the bankruptcy court by means of a complaint to lift the automatic stay so as to be allowed to exercise its already existing right to offset.durham smi indus,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.in accordance with that procedure,in the scenario botw would move to lift the stay,submit a proof of claim,and then argue its right of setoff entitles it to receive.mandatory claim disallowance under d,however,is one bankruptcy code provision that applies in chapter liquidations.in re,at.it requires that the court disallow any claim of any entity from which property is recoverable by a trustee,or that is the transferee of an avoidable transfer,unless and until the property is turned over and the transfer is paid.id.pursuant to this provision,the bankruptcy court likely would decide the trustee hypothetical preference action before allowing botw claim.it therefore would consider whether the deposit satisfies the elements of section b.
the section b elements.
as previously noted,section b requires that the transfer be to or for the benefit of a creditor,for or on account of an antecedent debt,made while the debtor was insolvent,made within days of the bankruptcy,and one which permits the creditor to receive more than it would in a hypothetical liquidation where the challenged payment had not been made.b.botw argues that in the hypothetical preference action it would no longer be a creditor,the deposit would not be for or on account of an antecedent debt,and the deposit would not constitute a transfer.we disagree.
in the hypothetical liquidation where the debt payment had not been made,botw would still be a creditor because it would be owed the it loaned to tenderloin.though it is a closer question,the deposit also would be for or on account of an antecedent debt.true,tenderloin transferred the in proceeds having already satisfied its preexisting debt,but the revision to the bankruptcy statute defined preferences solely with respect to a payment effect on the size of the debtor estate.marathon oil flatau in re craig oil,cir.see also vern countryman,the concept of a voidable preference in bankruptcy,vand,the function of the preference concept is to avoid prebankruptcy transfers that distort the bankruptcy policy of distribution.transfers that do distort this policy do so without regard to the state of mind of either the debtor or the preferred creditor.by that measure,in the hypothetical liquidation,the deposit would have the effect of diminishing the funds available to tenderloin creditors because it would increase the size of botw secured claim against the bankruptcy estate.the deposit would also constitute a transfer under the terms of the bankruptcy code.it would subject the funds to botw security interest,give botw title to the funds,and deplete the assets available for distribution to tenderloin creditors.tenderloin therefore would be disposing of or parting with an interest in property.d see also bernard sheaffer in re bernard,cir.finding that depositing money into a bank account is a transfer and correspondingly concluding that withdrawing money from a bank account is a transfer.
arguing to the contrary,botw invokes new york county national bank massey.there,the supreme court observed that 
a deposit of money to one credit in a bank does not operate to diminish the estate of the depositor,for when he parts with the money he creates at the same time,on the part of the bank,an obligation to pay the amount of the deposit as soon as the depositor may see fit to draw a check against it.it is not a transfer of property as a payment,pledge,mortgage,gift or security.
id.at emphasis added.for several reasons,we are not persuaded by botw invocation of massey.as previously noted,i n,congress fundamentally restructured bankruptcy law by passing the new bankruptcy code.begier internal revenue service.among other changes,congress elected to expand the code definition of the term transfer.at accord at.pursuant to the revision,any transfer of an interest in property is a transfer,including a transfer of possession,custody,or control even if there is no transfer of title,because possession,custody,and control are interests in property.id.applying that definition,the committee reports state squarely that a deposit in a bank account or similar account is a transfer.id.the massey court had no occasion to contemplate these amendments it considered only the bankruptcy code former and narrower definition of transfer.
we,however,had occasion to consider the revised definition of transfer in bernard sheaffer,at.there,the debtors withdrew money from an account and placed it in a safe.id.at.they argued that withdrawals did not constitute transfers because the assets merely changed form.id.at.we held that the debtors argument fail ed to take proper account of the bankruptcy code definition of transfer,which is extremely broad.id.emphasis in original.recognizing that title passes to the bank when funds are deposited,we said the debtors owned only claims against their bank.id.at.when they withdrew from their accounts,however,they exchanged debt for money and thus parted with property,satisfying the code definition of transfer.id.under the holding in bernard,there is no ambiguity around the definition of a transfer withdrawals and deposits into bank accounts clearly qualify.a h,huff in re huff,btb,wl,at cir.as is the case here,a deposit exchange s money for debt result ing in a parting with property under the holding in bernard as a matter of law.see also batlan bledsoe in re bledsoe,cir.invoking bernard interpretation of transfer in the context of another section of the bankruptcy code 
next,even though a debtor bank deposit ordinarily constitutes a transfer of the debtor property to the title and possession of the bank,some courts nonetheless have asked whether this transfer is of a kind that section invalidates.collier b emphasis added citing new jersey bank gutterman in re applied logic,cir.katz first bank of glen head,cir.though we doubt such an inquiry is warranted when deciding whether a transaction constitutes a transfer even assuming it is,the asserted standard is met here.
the pertinent question is whether the deposit depletes the assets of the estate available for distribution to creditors.see begier,at stating that the preference provision is designed to preserve the property includable within the bankruptcy estate on the specific facts of this case,as noted before,the deposit would have that effect.no bankruptcy creditor had an interest as far as we are aware in tenderloin real property.moreover,if the deposited funds had not been transferred and therefore remained in escrow they would have passed to the estate and thus to other creditors.through the deposit,however,one creditor botw gained a beneficial interest in the funds.botw also became indebted to tenderloin for,and correspondingly increased its right to exercise a setoff for the full amount of its loan.the deposit therefore represents the kind of transfer that the preference provisions target.see,meoli v.the huntington bank in re teleservices,stating that massey has become an anachronism and finding that a deposit in a bank account pledged as collateral for a loan fits the definition of an avoidable transfer ivey first citizens bank trust,noting that in teleservices a part of the transfers were deposits into bank accounts that themselves served as security for the line of credit that the defendant bank extended to debtor.therefore,whether or not the bank actually exercised its rights against the accounts,the deposits themselves created an actual or potential diminution of the estate by subjecting the funds to the bank power under this credit agreement citation omitted.
the implication of the above is that if botw sought to exercise its right of setoff after the petition was filed,the hypothetical preference challenge to the deposit would still be successful.as a consequence,tenderloin account functionally would contain on the petition date,a sum far less than the botw received,even allowing for its right of setoff under the hypothetical facts,the trustee could demonstrate that the elements of section b would be met 
conclusion 
we hold that courts may entertain hypothetical preference actions within section b hypothetical liquidation when such an inquiry is factually warranted,supported by appropriate evidence,and so long as the hypothetical preference action would not result in a direct conflict with another section of the bankruptcy code.
here,the undisputed facts demonstrate that botw received two transfers simultaneously within ninety days of tenderloin bankruptcy.we are also satisfied that in a hypothetical liquidation where the debt payment had not been made,the hypothetical bankruptcy trustee would challenge as preferential the deposit,as would any reasonable bankruptcy trustee.once we permit such a hypothetical preference action,schoenmann can demonstrate that botw received more as a result of the debt payment than it would in a hypothetical chapter liquidation.as a consequence,the trustee can prove each required element of his claim,and botw has not shown it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
we reverse the district court judgment in favor of botw.botw summary judgment motion is therefore denied,and the matter is remanded to the district court with directions to remand the matter to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.appellee shall bear costs on appeal.fed.app.a.
reversed and remanded.
i concur in the decision to reverse and remand to the bankruptcy court,and join all but part ii of the majority opinion.i agree that,under the circumstances of this case,applying b greater amount test requires us to construct a hypothetical liquidation,and that in so doing,we may consider whether a reasonable trustee would bring and win a preference action within the hypothetical chapter proceedings.i can not,however,join in the liquidation that the majority constructs in this case,because i can not agree that the entirety of the deposit was itself a preferential transfer subject to clawback under.
the majority is correct that bernard sheaffer,cir,binds us to begin with the premise that a bank deposit is a transfer under the modern bankruptcy code,see also op.at but the ultimate issue is not merely whether tenderloin deposit was a transfer,but whether it was a preferential one.on the latter question,the majority position runs headlong into justice brandeis seminal opinion in new york county national bank massey.the majority does not ignore massey nevertheless,its treatment of that case almost totally elides what massey has to say about the central question presented here.
instead of engaging massey analysis of what makes a preference,the majority opinion focuses at length on whether,in light of the expanded definition of transfer that congress adopted in,massey still means that deposits are not transfers.the trouble is that massey never meant that at all.the massey court never said that customer deposits were not transfers.meoli v.the huntington bank in re teleservices,bankr.emphasis added,cited at op.at.rather,it said that such deposits were not preferential within the meaning of the bankruptcy laws solely because they create a right of setoff in a creditor.massey,at a deposit of money in a bank does not operate to diminish the estate of the depositor.emphasis added.
the question is whether massey holding,that the creation of a setoff right does not suffice to make a preference,has survived congress creation of the contemporary scheme governing preferences and setoff.in that respect,the massey court faced a similar statutory landscape to the one we do now.the act provided that an insolvent debtor transfer was preferential only if it enable d any one of his creditors to obtain a greater percentage of his debt than any other of such creditors of the same class.a,stat.nevertheless,it expressly authorized the setoff of mutually owing debts without providing an exception applicable when a setoff would improve the bank position.id.a,stat.at.the court held that the preservation of setoff indicated congress intent that the creation and exercise of a setoff right exist as an exception to the act definition of a preferential transfer.massey,at.after all,setoff and the creation of a setoff right always favors offsetting creditors,who receive a preference in the fact that,to the extent of the right,they are paid in full.id.as justice brandeis explained,to enlarge the scope of the statute defining preferences so as to prevent setoff in cases coming within the terms of the provision authorizing setoff would defeat congress choice to preserve setoff under those terms.id.
in enacting the act,or any of the numerous subsequent amendments to the bankruptcy code,congress could have included the creation or exercise of a setoff right in the roster of transactions that are avoidable under,but it did not.instead,it preserved the basic feature of the act on which massey relied the treatment of preferential transfers and setoff rights in separate provisions subject to different rules.like a of the act,of the code is an entirely separate provision that subjects setoffs,exclusively,to different rules than those applicable to the recovery of preferences generally.see,woodrum ford motor credit in re dillard ford,cir.
because that structure is unchanged,to hold that the creation of a setoff right that the code preserves under the terms of may be preferential under would,as in massey,operate to enlarge the scope of the statute defining preferences so as to prevent the exercise of in cases coming within the terms of.as in massey,a preference is still defined as a transfer that leaves the receiving creditor better off than it otherwise would have been.see b,see also op.at the pertinent question is whether the deposit depletes the assets of the estate available for distribution to creditors.setoff rights are still preserved,subject to more forgiving limitations than transfers generally.compare b with b and as a matter of economic reality,the creation and exercise of those rights still advantage some creditors in a way that would but for massey limiting construction meet the hornbook definition of a preference.
concededly,massey interpreted the text of a different statute than the one before us today.nevertheless,the ultimate question in any statutory interpretation case is the intent of congress,and the supreme court has instructed that congress is presumed to be aware of a judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it a statute without change.lorillard pons.there is no indication that congress meant to disrupt massey bedrock holding when it enacted a new bankruptcy law,but preserved the structure that formed the essential basis for the supreme court analysis.in such circumstances,we should be mindful not only of congress intent,but of the fact that only the supreme court may overrule one of its precedents.see thurston motor lines,jordan rand,per curiam.
in a footnote,the majority opinion also argues that this case is distinguishable from massey because the accounts were pledged as security on an antecedent loan,and the deposit itself would render botw fully secure.op.at.certainly,the creation of a new lien would have made a preferential transfer.nevertheless,the fact that tenderloin took the funds out of escrow and deposited the money made no difference to the bank security position.all of tenderloin personal property was subject to the same floating lien,including its general intangibles.those included tenderloin contractual right to be paid the funds out of escrow.see in re merten,bankr.cal.tenderloin interest in those funds would have been identically encumbered,and botw identically secured,if the money had stayed in escrow indefinitely,or transferred out of escrow and into a safe in tenderloin offices.
because massey reasoning applies with the same force today as it did in,i can not join in the majority holding that the deposit was a preference subject to attack under.i would have the hypothetical bankruptcy court treat tenderloin account as containing the full as of the petition date,and proceed to apply to determine what portion of that amount botw could set off against tenderloin debt 
section does not preserve setoff rights without limitation.rather,creditors may only set off subject to the strictures imposed by b,a miniature preference provision akin to.eckles petco,interstate in re balducci oil,bankr.much like b does for transfers,b directs us to apply an test it disallows setoff to the extent that the creditor was better secured on the date of setoff than it was on the first day it became undersecured or days before bankruptcy,if an insufficiency existed at the start of the preference period.
to be sure,there is some question whether b applies to limit actual setoffs.see collier on bankruptcy c noting division of authority.but as the fifth circuit has noted,the safeguards of b are unnecessary in an actual liquidation,where the need to proceed by application to lift the automatic stay gives the bankruptcy judge an opportunity to weigh the equities of allowing or denying the creditor claim.braniff airways,exxon,cir.
by contrast,in a hypothetic
