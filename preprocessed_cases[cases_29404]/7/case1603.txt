shelli renee joye and teresa joye the joyes filed an adversary complaint in bankruptcy court against the state of california franchise tax board and its executive director,selvi stanislaus collectively,the board,for declaratory and injunctive relief.the joyes seek an order declaring that their state tax obligations from the year were discharged at the conclusion of their chapter bankruptcy proceeding in.they also seek an injunction enjoining the board from collecting these outstanding tax liabilities.the board moved for summary judgment,and the bankruptcy court denied the motion.the district court reversed the bankruptcy court,and entered summary judgment in the board favor.the joyes now appeal from the district court summary judgment.we have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to c.we reverse and remand.
the joyes filed their chapter bankruptcy petition on march.the bankruptcy petition scheduled the board as a priority creditor in the estimated amount of for outstanding state income taxes for the year.pursuant to,official notice of the joyes bankruptcy case was then sent to all creditors scheduled in the petition.the notice indicated that the meeting of creditors would take place on april,and that the claims bar date for governmental claims was set for september.the board does not appear to have attended the meeting of creditors,or otherwise filed objections to the joyes bankruptcy plan.the bankruptcy court confirmed the joyes bankruptcy plan on may.the board did not file a proof of claim in the joyes case,and the claims bar date for governmental claims elapsed as scheduled.
on october,the joyes filed their year state income tax return.although this return was originally due on april,california law grants taxpayers an automatic extension of the deadline for filing personal income tax returns.the joyes year state tax return was therefore timely filed.the return showed the joyes owing taxes and penalties totaling.no payment accompanied the return.
the joyes successfully completed their bankruptcy plan on february.on march,the bankruptcy court discharged the joyes from bankruptcy pursuant to a.the discharge order stated that the debtor is discharged from all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under,subject to a few exceptions not relevant here.the order also stated that a ll creditors are prohibited from attempting to collect any debt that has been discharged in this case.
subsequently,the board attempted to collect the outstanding taxes reported in the joyes year state tax return.on march,the joyes commenced an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court,alleging that the board collection efforts violated the discharge order.the board filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing that the outstanding taxes survived discharge pursuant to.in the alternative,the board argued that barring its collection of these outstanding taxes would violate the constitutional guarantee of fundamental fairness to governmental entities.
the bankruptcy court denied the board motion,concluding that the outstanding taxes were properly discharged.with respect to the board primary argument,the bankruptcy court observed that section was inapplicable to the parties dispute because that section has nothing to do with discharge.it has to do with whether a creditor,such as the board,may file a claim,and if so,how that claim is treated.but that not our case the board did file a claim and it got notice of the proceeding,and the discharge is a final order.the bankruptcy court also rejected the board alternative argument regarding the constitutional doctrine of fundamental fairness.the bankruptcy court held that the board received both adequate notice of the joyes bankruptcy case and a meaningful opportunity to file a proof of claim for the outstanding taxes.
the district court on appeal agreed that the outstanding taxes were technically discharged through the chapter proceeding because the board did not file a proof of claim.however,the district court concluded that the board was nonetheless entitled to summary judgment because barring collection of the outstanding taxes would constitute a denial of fundamental fairness to the board.the court held that the board did not receive adequate notice of its right to payment on the outstanding taxes because california income tax system relies on taxpayers to assess how much they owe and inform the board of that amount by filing a tax return,and the joyes did not file their state tax return until after the claims bar date for governmental claims.the court further held that scheduling the board as a creditor in the bankruptcy petition for an estimated amount was insufficient to provide the board with constitutionally adequate notice.
therefore,the district court reversed the bankruptcy court decision,and granted the board motion for summary judgment.rather than remanding the case to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings,the district court entered judgment in favor of the board.this appeal followed.

the joyes argue that the district court erred in entering

both the bankruptcy court and the district court concluded that the joyes outstanding tax liabilities for the year were discharged at the conclusion of their bankruptcy case pursuant to a.in so ruling,the two courts rejected the board argument that these outstanding taxes survived the bankruptcy court discharge order under.indeed,both courts held that section was irrelevant to the determination of whether these outstanding taxes were subject to discharge.the board disputes this conclusion,renewing its argument that section allows certain claims to survive a debtor chapter discharge so long as the claimholder elects not to file a proof of claim.for their part,the joyes appear to concede that if the outstanding taxes give rise to a claim under section,the taxes would survive discharge.
we have not addressed whether section operates to protect certain claims from a bankruptcy discharge.however,we need not decide this open question of ninth circuit law because even if section can be read to shield certain claims from discharge,its protection extends only to claims,and we conclude that the joyes outstanding taxes can not give rise to such a claim under section.we therefore agree with the ultimate conclusions of both courts that these taxes were discharged in the joyes bankruptcy case.
section is entitled filing and allowance of claims.subsection a provides that a proof of claim may be filed by any entity that holds a claim against a debtor for taxes that become payable to a governmental unit while the case is pending.a.the parties do not dispute that the joyes bankruptcy case was pending from march,to march.therefore,whether the joyes outstanding taxes give rise to a claim pursuant to section a depends on when these taxes became payable for the purpose of that section.
we have yet to construe the term payable as used in section a.see in re savaria,cir.bap recognizing,without resolving,the split in authority on the meaning of the word.however,the court of appeals for the fifth circuit and the bankruptcy appellate panel for the tenth circuit have each addressed this issue with differing results.in united states ripley in re ripley,cir,the court held that taxes that have become payable are those that must be paid now.id.at.in coming to this conclusion,the court stated that the word payable in customary usage means not only c apable of being paid but also justly due and legally enforceable.id.at,quoting black law dictionary ed.the court then held that t he latter of these is the only reasonable meaning to be affixed to the word as it is used in section.id.the court appears to have based its conclusion on the fact that this construction comports with the law of commercial paper when a negotiable instrument is payable to bearer or to order,the sum therein must be paid to the bearer or to the order of the person therein specified,citing.the court acknowledged,however,that the meaning of the word was not disputed by the parties.id.at.
in dixon irs in re dixon,cir.bap,the bankruptcy appellate panel for the tenth circuit construed the term differently.the panel construed ripley as addressing payable in the context of the last permissible time to pay one taxes before the given taxing authority can commence forcible collection activities.id.at.the panel observed,however,that t he bankruptcy code generally attempts to deal with debtors payment obligations at an earlier time.id.reading the word payable in conjunction with the bankruptcy code definitions for claims and debts,respectively,the panel reasoned that the word is best construed to refer to a time before the last permissible day for paying taxes.id.this construction is confirmed,the panel held,by the legislative history of the bankruptcy code,which contains the statement,section a provides for the filing of a proof of claim for taxes and other obligations incurred after the filing of the chapter case.id.at,quoting,at,reprinted in,emphasis added in dixon.
the reasoning of the tenth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel is persuasive.as the court in ripley acknowledged,the word payable is susceptible to more than one interpretation.ripley,at stating that payable can mean either capable of being paid or justly due and legally enforceable.the panel in dixon therefore correctly reviewed the statutory scheme of the bankruptcy code to discern congress intent.united states daas,cir to determine the plain meaning of a particular statutory provision,and thus congressional intent,the court looks to the entire statutory scheme.
in that regard,the panel in dixon rightly stated that chapter of the code is generally concerned with satisfying or discharging claims against a given debtor.dixon,at,citing.a claim is broadly defined as the right to payment,whether or not such right is reduced to judgment,liquidated,unliquidated,fixed,contingent,matured,unmatured,disputed,undisputed,legal,equitable,secured,or unsecured.a.this broad definition supports dixon conclusion that the term payable,which is used to define a certain class of claims,refers to a time before the creditor right to payment matures into a legally enforceable prerogative.
further examination of the statutory scheme confirms this interpretation.like section a,section i of the code also addresses tax claims held by governmental entities.this section provides that a claim for certain tax liabilities owed to governmental units that does not arise until after the commencement of the case shall be determined,and shall be allowed the same as if such claims had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition.i.reconciling section i with section a,collier on bankruptcy concludes that the taxes covered by section i are those which are incurred prepetition that do not come due until after the petition is filed.if a tax is incurred postpetition,it can be treated only as a postpetition claim under section.collier on bankruptcy alan resnick henry sommer,ed.emphasis added see also in re flores,holding that a claim under section is a liability that arises postpetition and relates only to postpetition activity emphasis added keith lundin,chapter bankruptcy,at ed.supp.section deals only with debts that arise after the petition emphasis added.therefore,only taxes incurred may be treated as claims under section a 
moreover,as stated in dixon,the legislative history of the bankruptcy code indicates that section a was meant to address taxes incurred after the filing of the chapter case.dixon,at,quoting,at,reprinted in,emphasis added in dixon.although resort to legislative history is generally discouraged in statutory construction and certainly unnecessary where the meaning of a statute is plain,we have the option of turning to it for insight into congressional intent where,as here,the statutory language is ambiguous.daas,at if the statute is only may look to its legislative history for evidence of congressional intent.
reviewing the statutory scheme of the bankruptcy code and the relevant legislative history,we conclude that congress meant section a to refer to taxes that were incurred by the debtor during the pendency of the debtor bankruptcy case.we would frustrate this congressional intent were we to construe the word payable to refer to only those taxes that have become legally enforceable or justly due.ripley,at.rather,as the court in ripley stated,payable can also describe amounts that are simply capable of being paid.see also black law dictionary ed.an amount may be payable without being due.debts are commonly payable long before they fall due.this construction of payable better comports with congress intent to cover a debtor tax liability at a time prior to the point when that liability becomes legally actionable therefore,because t he purpose of statutory construction is to discern the intent of congress,daas,at,we hold that taxes become payable for purposes of section a when they are capable of being paid 
applying this construction here,we hold that the joyes outstanding state taxes for the year can not give rise to a claim pursuant to section a.under california law,personal taxes are calculated based on the given taxpayer income earned for each taxable year.cal.a.a taxable year is in turn defined as a calendar year.cal.thus,the joyes could have technically determined and paid their year taxes on the day after the close of the corresponding calendar year.although the joyes were not required to pay these taxes until april,or at the latest october,their tax liability to the state for the year was nonetheless capable of being paid,and thus payable,as of january.
because this date fell prior to the date the joyes filed their bankruptcy petition on march,these taxes can not give rise to a claim under section a.therefore,even if section shields claims from discharge which we do not decide,it would not operate to protect the board claim to the joyes outstanding taxes from discharge.these taxes were thus properly discharged at the conclusion of joyes bankruptcy case 
the board presents an array of internally inconsistent,and ultimately unsuccessful,arguments against adopting the broader definition of become payable suggested in dixon.first,the board appears to argue that the ninth circuit has adopted the same analysis as ripley to determine when taxes become payable.on this point,the board mentions that it believes that ripley interprets payable under the internal revenue code.yet,later in the board brief,the board attempts to distinguish dixon on the same grounds,arguing that,i n this case,the issue is not when taxes become payable under the internal revenue code,but when they become payable under the california revenue and tax code.
to the extent that the board argues that cases interpreting payable under the internal revenue code are not particularly instructive,we agree.as aptly stated in dixon,words used in the bankruptcy code do not necessarily mean the same thing they might mean in the internal revenue code.dixon,at.and as described earlier,there are ample clues provided by the plain language,statutory scheme,and legislative history of section for us to divine congressional intent without recourse to interpretations of a wholly different statute.see,sherman united states parole comm n,cir declining to adopt the interpretation of a certain statute provided in a prior case,in construing a similar phrase used in a different statute,because the prior case dealt with an entirely separate statutory scheme accord united states ex rel.chicago,new york boston refrigerator interstate commerce comm n.b ecause words used in one statute have a particular meaning they do not necessarily denote an identical meaning when used in another and different statute.
for similar reasons,we also reject the board argument that payable under section a should be construed by reference to the california revenue and tax code.on this issue,the board confuses the substantive determination to be made under section a with the task of construing the statutory provision in the first instance.true,under raleigh.dep t of revenue,d,the basic federal rule in bankruptcy is that state law governs the substance of claims,quoting butner united states,d.however,before we can determine whether the joyes outstanding taxes became payable under california law during the pendency of their bankruptcy case,we must first decide what the bankruptcy code means by the term payable in section a.for that initial determination,we rely on the traditional canons of statutory interpretation,not the substantive tax law of california.
the board also suggests that this circuit in pan american van lines united states,cir has already determined that payable refers to the tax return deadline.we do not agree.in that case,the court determined whether taxpayer liability for the restricted interest was legally due and owing within three years preceding bankruptcy under section a of the bankruptcy act.id.at.thus,pan american interpreted a completely different statutory provision than the one at issue here,and in no way speaks to the interpretation of the term payable under section a.to the extent that the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel in savaria held that pan american van lines stands for the proposition that taxes become payable when the final tax return for the tax year is required to be filed,we disagree with the panel.savaria,at.
the other cases relied on by the board are also unhelpful.in schatz franchise tax board,th,d,a case also relied upon by the dissent,the court held that a state income tax deficiency is assessed for the purposes of federal bankruptcy laws when the assessment contained in a notice of proposed deficiency assessment becomes final.id.at.schatz did not,however,address when taxes become payable under california law for purposes of section a.the tax return deadline may be the date when the state formally act s to finally fix the tax deficiencies for those years,but that does not preclude the conclusion that the taxes owed are capable of being paid at a point before the state formal action.id.at.
the same reasoning distinguishes franchise tax board bracey in re bracey,cir.like schatz,this case dealt with the issue of when a tax deficiency is assessed under california law for purposes of rendering the assessment nondischargeable in federal bankruptcy proceedings.id.at.the moment when a tax deficiency assessment becomes final is plainly different than when income taxes become payable for purposes of section a.
for these reasons,we disagree with the board argument that the joyes outstanding taxes became payable on the date their state tax return was due.as described above,those taxes became payable at the close of the year taxable year.because the date the taxes became payable fell before the date the joyes filed their bankruptcy petition,the taxes were properly discharged in their bankruptcy case.
having concluded that the board is not entitled to summary judgment on statutory grounds,we are now required to address the parties constitutional arguments.we must decide whether barring the board from collecting the joyes outstanding taxes would constitute a denial of fundamental fairness in state proceedings guaranteed by the constitution.in mullane central hanover bank trust,the supreme court held that a n elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.in city of new york new york,new haven hartford,the court extended this constitutional guarantee to governmental entities.
we assessed the constitutional adequacy of the official notice provided in bankruptcy proceedings in matter of gregory,cir.there,a creditor argued that its claim in bankruptcy should not be discharged because it had received inadequate notice of the debtor bankruptcy plan.id.at.it was undisputed,however,that the creditor had received official notice of the bankruptcy case and the scheduled meeting of creditors.id.we rejected the creditor constitutional challenge,holding that w hen the holder of a large,unsecured claim in bankruptcy receives any notice from the bankruptcy court that its debtor has initiated bankruptcy proceedings,it is under constructive or inquiry notice that its claim may be affected,and it ignores the proceedings to which the notice refers at its peril.id.at.we added that i f the creditor had made any inquiry following receipt of the notice,it would have discovered that it needed to act to protect its interest.see also espinosa united student aid funds,cir,amended by holding that gregory is entirely consistent with mullane and the more than a half century of due process caselaw that follows it.
gregory controls here.the joyes filed their bankruptcy petition on march.the petition scheduled the board as a priority creditor in the estimated amount of.the bankruptcy court then sent the board official notice of the petition.the notice indicated that the meeting of creditors would be held on april,and that the claims bar date for governmental claims was september.the parties do not dispute that this notice complied with the requirements of the bankruptcy code.moreover,the board does not contend that it did not receive this official notice.therefore,like the creditor in gregory,the board received constitutionally adequate notice of its right to the form of the official notice mandated by the bankruptcy it ignored the joyes bankruptcy proceeding at its peril.gregory,at.
the board argues that even though it received this official notice,it could not determine the joyes actual tax liability until after october,because california income tax system relies on taxpayers to assess how much they owe and inform the board of that amount through a tax return.but this does not change the fact that the board received actual notice of the joyes bankruptcy petition,which had scheduled the board as a priority creditor for an estimated.although this estimate was below the actual amount owed,the estimate certainly put the board on notice that it may be entitled to some amount of payment from the joyes chapter estate.in re coastal alaska lines,cir holding that an unscheduled creditor had constitutionally adequate notice of the bankruptcy proceedings because it had sufficient information to evaluate whether to participate in the case and protect its interests in re kragness,holding that the operative fact is whether or not the creditor has notice of the debtor bankruptcy proceeding in time to file a timely proof of claim.
moreover,as the joyes correctly point out,if the board had doubts about the tax estimate,it could have either requested an extension of time in which to file a claim,or filed an estimated claim in any amount,and then sought an amendment of that claim prior to the distribution.see,lompa price in re price,cir holding that a creditor who had received actual notice of a bankruptcy proceeding through his counsel did not suffer a due process violation because he had notice in time to file a com
