order and amended opinion 
the opinion filed on may,and reported at wl cir.may,is replaced by the amended opinion filed concurrently with this order.
in this direct appeal from the bankruptcy court,scott lee egebjerg egebjerg challenges the bankruptcy court dismissal of his chapter petition for abuse under b.in an issue of first impression in this circuit under the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa,we consider whether a debtor repayment of a k loan constitutes a monthly payment on account of secured debts or an o ther n ecessary e xpense that can be deducted from a debtor monthly income for purposes of calculating the debtor disposable monthly income under b.because we conclude it is not,the debtor filing in this case was presumptively abusive under the means test of b.we therefore affirm the bankruptcy court dismissal of his chapter petition.
facts and procedural history 
egebjerg filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition on december.at the time,he had been employed by ralph grocery store for years and earned a gross income of per month.egebjerg was single with no assets.his only secured property was an automobile he used for work and a timeshare.he had unsecured consumer debt of about.
approximately two years before he filed for bankruptcy,egebjerg had taken a loan from his k plan.the plan automatically deducted from his paycheck each month to repay this loan,which was scheduled to be fully repaid by september.according to egebjerg amended schedule of necessary expenses in which he included the k repayment,he was left with a monthly disposable income of 
the trustee moved to dismiss egebjerg chapter petition,arguing that egebjerg had improperly included the k repayment in his necessary expenses.if,the trustee urged,this amount were not subtracted from income as a necessary expense,egebjerg filing was presumptively abusive under the means test of b.the trustee further argued that even if the presumption of abuse did not arise under b,the court should still dismiss the case because,under the totality of the circumstances,egebjerg had sufficient means to repay a meaningful portion of his debts,especially once his k loan was repaid.
the bankruptcy court rejected the trustee first argument,concluding that the k loan was a secured debt and could be deducted from income for purposes of the means test.by including this figure,no presumption of abuse arose under b.
still,agreeing with the trustee on the totality of the circumstances ground,the bankruptcy court dismissed the chapter petition under b,noting that,at the time of the court order in june,the k loan would be repaid in just over a year,leaving a month to repay unsecured creditors.the court concluded that the debtor could therefore pay a significant amount of his debts in a chapter proceeding and that,because of his ability to pay,it would be an abuse to permit the case to continue as a chapter proceeding.the court ordered the case to be dismissed unless the debtor converted to a chapter within ten days,which egebjerg did not do.
egebjerg filed a notice of appeal and requested that the bankruptcy court enter an order certifying the decision for direct appeal pursuant to d.the bankruptcy court entered the certification,and a motions panel of this court granted egebjerg petition for direct appeal and stayed the district court appeal pending circuit review.
discussion 
statutory background 
prior to bapcpa,there was a presumption in favor of granting the relief requested by the debtor.b.this presumption could be overcome if the court found that granting of relief would be a substantial abuse of chapter.id.emphasis added.courts looked to the totality of the circumstances to make this substantial abuse determination.in re price,cir.
bapcpa produced a sea change.there is now no presumption favoring chapter relief,but an emphasis on repaying creditors as much as possible,pt.at,reprinted in.bapcpa introduced a mathematical formula,commonly referred to as the means test,to determine whether a debtor financial circumstances create a presumption against granting relief under chapter.b.a presumption of abuse may be rebutted if the debtor demonstrates special circumstances such as a serious medical condition or a call or order to active duty in the armed forces.b b.even if a debtor financial situation does not create a presumption of abuse or if the presumption is rebutted,the bankruptcy court may still dismiss the petition if the debtor filed the petition in bad faith or if the totality of the circumstances demonstrates abuse of chapter.b blausey trustee,cir.
this case potentially implicates both b and b.however,because the statute is framed to consider the presumptive abuse question first,and resorts to the totality of circumstances analysis only if the debtor survives the means test,we have chosen to address the proper interpretation of b first.we review the bankruptcy court legal conclusions de novo.in re fowler,cir.
ii.presumption of abuse under b 
secured debt 
in calculating the debtor current monthly income,b permits the debtor to deduct the average monthly payments on account of secured debts.b a iii emphasis added.in the bankruptcy code,the term debt means liability on a claim.claim is defined very broadly within the code to mean any right to payment,whether fixed,contingent,matured,disputed,secured,and so on.the terms debt and claim are coextensive,flip sides to the same coin.in re rifkin,cong d,reprinted in.therefore,egebjerg k loan constitutes a debt only if the plan administrator has a claim for repayment.
we join the vast majority of courts in holding that the debtor obligation to repay a loan from his or her retirement account is not a debt under the bankruptcy code.see,in re villarie,cir loan drawn on employee contributions to retirement system not a debt because plan has no right to sue a member for the amount of the advance,it is simply offset against future benefits bolen adams,wl,vast majority of courts have held a debtor obligation to repay retirement account loan is not a debt under the code eisen thompson,majority view is that retirement plan loans are not secured debts in re esquivel,clear consensus that borrowing from retirement account does not give rise to either secured or unsecured claim under the bankruptcy code see also mcvay otero,in re fulton,in re scott,in re jones.
the reasoning behind these decisions is straightforward.egebjerg obligation is essentially a debt to has borrowed his own money.in re smith,see also mcvay,at collecting cases.egebjerg contributed the money to the account in the first place should he fail to repay himself,the administrator has no personal recourse against him.in re villarie,at.instead,the plan will deem the outstanding loan balance to be a distribution of funds,thereby reducing the amount available to egebjerg from his account in the future.see in re mowris,see also mullen united states,cir.this deemed distribution will have tax consequences to egebjerg,but it does not create a relationship.in re smith,at nonpayment comes with liability for income taxes and penalties,but is a valid,lawful alternative.
as succinctly explained by one district court 
retirement plan loans are qualitatively different than secured debts such as home mortgages and car loans.the retirement plan administrator does not loan the plan participant the administrator money.it simply deducts the requested loan amount from the participant own account,and credits the loan payments and interest back to the participant account.if the participant defaults on the loan,the plan administrator deducts the amount owed from the vested account balance,and repays the loan with this deduction.the participant must treat this deduction as a distribution which is taxable as income to the participant in the default year.the participant may also be subject to an early withdrawal penalty.but,the plan administrator has no right to payment under the bankruptcy code.
thompson,at.
because the debtor loan repayment obligation is not a claim or debt under the bankruptcy code,the debtor may not include payments on such loans as a deduction for purposes of the
