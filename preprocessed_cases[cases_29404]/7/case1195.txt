turner did not respond directly to the letter.rather,he forwarded it to his attorney,who then brought suit under and f of the fair debt collection practices act fdcpa.the attorney also wrote with notice of the bankruptcy,and then closed its file.section generally prohibits false,deceptive or misleading collection activities.section prohibits any unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.in his suit,turner maintained that violated both provisions by essentially telling him that he had to pay a debt that had been discharged in bankruptcy,thus misrepresenting the legal status of the debt.
the district court granted motion for summary judgment on the ground that there was no evidence from which a reasonable could conclude that knew that turner debt was discharged in bankruptcy.turner,d.the court below also denied turner for summary judgment without discussing turner arguments.id.at.turner appeals.
this court reviews the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing all facts in favor of the nonmoving party.rogers city of chicago,cir.summary judgment is proper when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.thus,s ummary judgment is appropriate if,on the record as a whole,a rational trier of fact could not find for the party.rogers,at.
section,as explained above,generally prohibits false,deceptive or misleading collection activities.more specifically,as it applies to our situation,the provision prohibits the false representation of the legal status of any debt.a.in this case,turner theory is that falsely represented the legal status of his debt by insinuating that,despite the debt discharge in bankruptcy,turner was nonetheless obligated to pay the obligation that he had incurred to before his bankruptcy petition.in short,by asserting turner owed a debt that no longer existed,on its face the letter was false.relying on hubbard national bond collection associates,aff without opinion,cir,the district court granted summary judgment to,reasoning that,as a matter of law,the debt collector lacked knowledge of turner bankruptcy and therefore could not be held liable for sending turner a collection letter regarding the debt to.
although was unaware of the bankruptcy,under ignorance is no excuse.this circuit has held that applies even when a false representation was unintentional.gearing check brokerage,cir citing russell equifax,cir because the act imposes strict liability,a consumer need not show intentional conduct by the debt collector to be entitled to damages.moreover,our test for determining whether a debt collector violated is objective,turning not on the question of what the debt collector knew but on whether the debt collector communication would deceive or mislead an unsophisticated,but reasonable,consumer.gammon gc servs,cir see also id.at easterbrook,concurring reasoning that the trier of fact must inquire whether a misleading implication arises from an objectively reasonable reading of the communication.although the existence of the debt collector knowledge may be relevant insofar as it sheds light on the actual effect that a communication is likely to have on the unsophisticated consumer,the debt collector subjective intent or belief is not dispositive of our inquiry under.id.at.regarding,then,it was legal error for the district court to treat lack of knowledge as determinative and to grant summary judgment on that basis.furthermore,a reasonable jury could conclude as a matter of fact that a misleading implication that turner had to pay the debt arises from an objectively reasonable reading of collection letter of march.we therefore reverse as to.
we observe that,on remand,the district court might confront the question of knowledge if were to put forth a proper motion asserting the affirmative defense provided by c.id.under that subsection,which is entitled intent,a debt collector that violates,or any other substantive provision of the fdcpa,can avoid liability by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was unintentional,resulting from a bona fide error,and that error occurred the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.jenkins heintz,cir.to the extent that were to rely on c,proof that it was unaware of the bankruptcy would be a logical first step.could also show that it had taken reasonable preventive measures to avoid such mistakes such as an agreement with its that debts are current and the demand letter was sent soon after the assignment.
we now turn to,which states that a debt collector may not use unfair or unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any debt.turner theory is that,via its letter of march,violated this provision by attempting to collect a debt that was discharged in bankruptcy.as it had in regard to,the district court reasoned that knowledge of the bankruptcy was a necessary element of liability under and granted summary judgment because there was no evidence that it knew that turner debt was discharged.but the focus of this section is on the means used to collect,here the collection letter.whether the debt collector own knowledge in this case,of the bankruptcy is a prerequisite to liability under is an issue of first impression in this court.the weight of authority,including an opinion from one of our sister circuits,applies an objective test to determine liability under the test does not hinge on the defendant knowledge,but rather upon how a consumer would perceive the demand letter.these authorities endorse the proposition that the collector knowledge is not a condition for violating rather,they hold that the existence of a violation hinges on objective factors that relate to a consumer who receives the demand for payment.
the statutory text supports this view.section provides a list of examples of statutory violations,some of which clearly provide for liability without the collector knowledge of a misstatement or other error.section states,without qualification,that the following conduct is a violation of this section.section,for example,prohibits the collection of any amount including any interest,fee,charge,or expense incidental to the principal obligation unless such amount is expressly authorized by the
