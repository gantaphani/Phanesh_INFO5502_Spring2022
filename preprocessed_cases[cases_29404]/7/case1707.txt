we consider whether the bankruptcy code preempts a state statute that gives an assignee selected by the debtor the power to void preferential transfers that could not be voided by an unsecured creditor.

discussion 
congress has broad authority to preempt state laws,but whether congress has done so in a particular instance is a matter of congressional intent.this intent is most easily detected where the statute expressly preempts other laws,but preemption may also be inferred where it is clear from the statute and surrounding circumstances that congress intended to occupy the field,leaving no room for state regulation.the supreme court,in pacific gas electric state energy resources conservation development commission,d,summarized the contours of the field preemption doctrine 
absent explicit language,congress intent to supersede state law altogether may be found from a scheme of federal regulation so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,because the act of congress may touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject,or because the object sought to be obtained by the federal law and the character of obligations imposed by it may reveal the same purpose.

there can be no doubt that federal bankruptcy law is pervasive and involves a federal interest so dominant as to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject much like many other areas of congressional power listed in article i,section,of the constitution,such as patents,copyrights,currency,national defense and immigration.the bankruptcy clause,which grants congress the power to make bankruptcy laws,const.art.i,cl,stresses that such rules must be uniform.bankruptcy law occupies a full title of the united states code.it provides a comprehensive system of rights,obligations and procedures,as well as a complex administrative machinery that includes a special system of federal courts and united states trustees.
at the same time,federal law coexists peaceably with,and often expressly incorporates,state laws regulating the rights and obligations of debtors or their assignees and creditors.see,b incorporating state personal exemptions to the bankruptcy estate id.b making state law on voidable transfers available to the bankruptcy trustee id.d excusing some assignees for the benefit of creditors from compliance with property turnover requirements.in determining whether is preempted,we must consider whether it is merely another creditor rights provision of the kind that is tolerated by the bankruptcy code,or whether it gives the state assignee powers that are within the heartland of bankruptcy administration.
sherwood argues that the preference avoidance provisions of section are not only tolerated but specifically incorporated by the bankruptcy code through section b,which allows a bankruptcy trustee to avoid any transfers voidable by unsecured creditors under applicable law including state law section b,says sherwood,manifest s congressional intent not to preempt state statutes invalidating preferences empowering bankruptcy trustees to so act a fortiori manifests a congressional intent that state statutes are valid and available to be used by a bankruptcy trustee.reply br.of appellee at.the supreme court in stellwagen clum,in fact cited section of the bankruptcy act of,the precursor to section b,in upholding a statute allowing assignees to void certain preferential transfers.see id.at.
but the trustee powers under section b are limited to those of unsecured as the right of an individual unsecured creditor to set aside fraudulent conveyances under state law.see,decker advantage fund,cir involving a claim,under section b,to avoid a transfer using california uniform fraudulent transfer act,cal.similarly,the ohio statute upheld in stellwagen,unlike the california statute at issue here,gave trustees only those avoidance powers already held by a ny creditor or creditors.at.quoting the statute by contrast,the power to set aside preferential transfers under california section can be exercised only by general assignees,not by individual unsecured creditors.in other words,the assignee appointed pursuant to section is given new avoidance powers by virtue of his position.
to make stellwagen and section b cover this case would require us to read the term creditor in section b as encompassing representatives of creditors such as sherwood.we doubt that congress had sherwood in mind when describing unsecured creditors in section b.the bankruptcy code defines creditor,in relevant part,as an entity that has a claim against the debtor that arose at the time of or before the order for relief concerning the debtor.a.custodian is a different concept,which includes receivers,trustees and assignee s under a general assignment for the benefit of the debtor creditors.id.in fact,congress defined custodian using the word creditor in two places.see id.b,c.custodians,instead of being by their nature creditors,stand in a certain fiduciary relation to creditors.but congress did not mention custodians alongside creditors in section b.we are therefore unable to read creditor in section b to include custodians.see dubis supply in re delta group,collier on bankruptcy,at lawrence king et,ed.creditor in section b includes assignees or successors of the original creditor,but a n assignee for the benefit of creditors is not such a creditor see also in re komfo prods,vern countryman,the use of state law in bankruptcy cases part ii,if congress intended any creditor in section,the precursor to section b,to mean any representative of any creditor,it would be desirable to amend the statute to say so.contra zimmerman frem in re kenval mktg,thus,section b of the bankruptcy code,and its partial incorporation of state transfer avoidance law,does not save the california statute from preemption.
the question remains whether the section assignee special avoidance powers,though not expressly incorporated into the bankruptcy code by section b,nevertheless can peaceably coexist with the federal bankruptcy scheme.to answer this question we must consider the essential goals and purposes of federal bankruptcy law,and then determine whether section is consistent with them.
it is generally agreed that chapter of the bankruptcy code,which governs liquidations,embodies two ideals giving the individual debtor a fresh start,by giving him a discharge of most of his debts and equitably distributing a debtor assets among competing creditors.see stellwagen,at.as the leading bankruptcy treatise explains,these two goals are separate and operate somewhat independently of each other 
from the creditors viewpoint,chapter establishes the concept of equitable distribution among creditors of a debtor resources which,in most cases,are insufficient to permit full payment to all.from the individual debtor vantage point,chapter permits the honest debtor to obtain a new financial life through the discharge of unpaid debts.neither concept is dependent on the other.thus,in many chapter cases,which may also be called cases,the debtor has no property realizable by creditors.nevertheless,unless the debtor has committed certain acts,he is entitled to a full discharge and release from all debts except those rendered nondischargeable the distribution to creditors is also not affected by whether or not the debtor obtains a discharge.should discharge be denied,and property exists in the chapter estate available to creditors,distribution will occur.

we know,because the supreme court has repeatedly told us,that state statutes that purport to perform the first of these functions,by giving debtors a discharge of their debts,are preempted.see int l shoe pinkus.see also pobreslo joseph boyd.stellwagen,at.that the state discharge statute may be compatible with or even identical to the federal discharge statute makes no difference.nor does it matter that a creditor may be able to opt out of the state insolvency proceeding by commencing an involuntary federal bankruptcy proceeding indeed,according to stellwagen,it does not even matter whether a federal bankruptcy act is in effect.id.at.it is settled that a state may not pass an insolvency law which provides for a discharge of the debtor from his obligations,which shall have the effect of a bankruptcy discharge as to creditors in other states,and this although no general federal bankruptcy act is in effect.such state procedures are preempted simply because the ability to grant a discharge is one of the principal requisites of a true bankruptcy law.id.at.
what goes for state discharge provisions also holds true for state statutes that implicate the federal bankruptcy law other major goal,namely equitable distribution.bankruptcy law accomplishes equitable distribution through a distinctive form of collective proceeding.this is a unique contribution of the bankruptcy code that makes bankruptcy different from a collection of actions by individual creditors.in a world of individual actions,each creditor knows that if he waits too long,the debtor assets will have been exhausted by the demands of the quicker creditors and he will recover nothing.the creditors race to the courthouse,all demanding immediate payment of their entire debt.like piranhas,they make short work of the debtor,who might have survived to pay off more of his debts with a little bit of at least might have more equitably fed the slower piranhas.see,in re hoskins,cir noting the bankruptcy code purpose of preventing a mutually destructive feeding frenzy by creditors,rev on other grounds,assocs.commercial rash,d in re kish,describing the attacks of creditors.do see piranha new world pictures.but see berger piranha,in re piranha,a case where the creditors got the piranha.
federal bankruptcy law seeks to avoid this scenario by creat ing a whole system under federal control which is designed to bring together and adjust all of the rights and duties of creditors and embarrassed debtors alike.msr exploration,meridian oil,cir.the filing of a bankruptcy petition brings a bankruptcy estate into being and triggers an automatic stay,which prevents creditors from enforcing their claims,thus preserving the debtor assets for ultimate distribution by the bankruptcy trustee.see,see also collier on bankruptcy b,at to.
one of the major powers the code gives the trustee is the power to avoid preferential transfers the trustee is authorized to recover these sums for the use of the bankruptcy estate in making its distribution to creditors.of course,this power,like all others,may be exercised only under the supervision of the federal courts and the trustee exercising those powers to liquidate a corporation is not by the debtor,as was sherwood,but appointed and supervised by the united states trustee,an official of the department of justice,see,or elected by the creditors,see id,to ensure impartiality.federal law protects creditors like the trustee possible conflicts of interest and other possible sources of,see id.regulating what professionals a trustee may employ id.regulating the compensation of such professionals fed.regulating employment of professionals,and generally provides extensive disclosure,see fed.
it is clear that if a state assignee under section recovers a preferential transfer and distributes its proceeds to creditors,this will preclude a federal trustee from recovering the same sum under the federal preference statute if a federal bankruptcy proceeding is begun.the creditor who disgorged the transfer can not disgorge it twice the creditors who later received the recovered money may be impossible to identify and even if they can be identified,they may be gone or in financial difficulty themselves.the distribution of the recovered sum will then have been made by a state assignee subject to state procedures and substantive standards,rather than by the federal trustee subject to bankruptcy law substantive standards and procedural protections 
sherwood points out that the creditor may be able to avoid this result by quickly filing an involuntary federal bankruptcy petition,which would have the effect of preempting the state proceedings.but this argument proves too much.the same would be true of a state statute that purported to give debtors a discharge creditors in that situation could presumably also avoid the effect of state law by bringing a federal petition.yet the supreme court has stated unequivocally that such state statutes are preempted.see page supra.
in any event,the affected creditor like lycos may not be able to run to federal court because in most cases,those where there are more than eleven creditors at least three creditors are required to force the debtor into bankruptcy.b.and the action of the state assignee may diminish the likelihood that lycos will be able to obtain the consent of other creditors.after all,if the state assignee succeeds in recovering the preferential transfer under state law,the other creditors may share in that bounty and might therefore have no interest in invoking the potentially more expensive and federal processes.
this points to yet another vice of the state proceedings once they are commenced,they will affect the incentives of various parties as to whether they wish to avail themselves of federal bankruptcy law.the creditor whose ox is being gored by the state assignee may have a new incentive to begin an involuntary federal proceeding other creditors,for the reasons explained above,may have diminished incentives.the provisions of the bankruptcy code,including those that explicitly incorporate certain state laws like voluntary assignments,or preference recovery provisions available to unsecured creditors carefully delineate the circumstances under which federal bankruptcy proceedings are to be initiated.we do not believe congress contemplated state laws that would sharpen or blunt the effect of those statutory incentives 
stellwagen,on which sherwood relies heavily,is not to the contrary.as noted above,see pages supra,the supreme court in stellwagen did uphold a statute that allowed a state trustee to recover preferential transfers,but the preferential avoidance power the trustee exercised in that case was one that could have been exercised by any creditor.at.while the court in stellwagen reiterated that a state statute granting a discharge would definitely be preempted,it left open whether other state statutes dealing with the subject of insolvency may also be preempted.id.at.we believe that statutes that give state assignees or trustees avoidance powers beyond those that may be exercised by individual creditors trench too close upon the exercise of the federal bankruptcy power congress has thought carefully about how collective insolvency proceedings are to be conduc
