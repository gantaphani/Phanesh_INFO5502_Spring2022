ronald henderson,an attorney who represented william kyle kisseberth and ekaterina kisseberth in their bankruptcy case,sued the kisseberths in state court to collect in unpaid attorney fees following the close of the bankruptcy proceeding.the kisseberths responded by filing a motion to reopen their bankruptcy case.henderson then filed an application for attorney fees in the bankruptcy court.because the bankruptcy court found that henderson fees were excessive and that he had not disclosed to the court the majority of the fees charged,the court ordered henderson to disgorge of the that he had previously collected,as well as to forfeit any claim to the unpaid fees.on appeal,the district court upheld the order of the bankruptcy court in part and reversed in part.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
the kisseberths owned and operated two jewelry stores in toledo,ohio.in,one of their stores was destroyed by fire.although the kisseberths had insured their business through eagle american insurance company,they were unable to recover any part of their loss because an ohio court determined that they had intentionally caused the fire.on march,four days before the insurance ruling,the kisseberths retained henderson,an experienced bankruptcy attorney,to counsel them regarding their poor financial condition.two months later,the kisseberths,with henderson as their counsel,filed a joint petition for personal bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.
henderson included a compensation statement in the kisseberths bankruptcy petition,as required by of the united states bankruptcy code and rule b of the federal bankruptcy rules.in the compensation statement,henderson disclosed that he had been paid a retainer and that he would be billing the kisseberths per hour for his services.during the two months between the hiring of henderson in march of and the filing of the bankruptcy petition in may of that year,henderson had already billed in legal fees for approximately hours of work.henderson did not disclose this fact in the chapter petition,and the kisseberths testified that they were unaware of the size of henderson prepetition fees.according to henderson,these fees were incurred in preparing the chapter petition,preserving the possible appeal of the state court adverse insurance judgment,and handling general matters concerning the kisseberths financial affairs.
after the kisseberths bankruptcy case had begun,the united states trustee assigned to their case decided to appeal the insurance ruling.the bankruptcy court required the kisseberths to personally bear a portion of the financial burden of the appeal,based on its determination that they would indirectly benefit from a favorable outcome.specifically,the kisseberths were required to pay for the appellate transcript.william kisseberth mother,bonnie kisseberth,along with two other relatives,loaned the kisseberths the funds to pay for the transcript.the funds were tendered to henderson law firm with the express understanding that the lenders were to be paid back in the event of any recovery in the insurance case.
henderson ultimately recorded billable hours on the kisseberths bankruptcy case,bringing the total cost for his legal services to.the large number of hours spent on the case,henderson maintained,was justified because the petition was not an ordinary chapter no asset case.henderson,for example,notes that the case was open for months and involved a business with over unsecured creditors.he also testified that his postpetition services involved,among other things,attending the statutorily required meeting of creditors,avoiding a possible creditor action against the kisseberths estate,and conducting negotiations with a party that was considering an action to prevent the kisseberths from receiving a discharge in bankruptcy due to their fraud.in addition,henderson aided in the appeal of the adverse insurance judgment,even though the kisseberths and the trustee had retained two other lawyers for this purpose.henderson was not asked for this help by the kisseberths or the trustee,nor had he been approved by the bankruptcy court to act as legal counsel in this matter.
eagle american settled the insurance case while the appeal was pending,despite the trial verdict in its favor.funds became available from the proceeds of this settlement to reimburse the kisseberths relatives for the funds that they had provided for the appellate transcript.instead of returning the advanced amount directly to the relatives,however,henderson applied to the unpaid fees for his work on the kisseberths bankruptcy case.the kisseberths,meanwhile,had personally paid henderson toward his total bill.at the completion of the bankruptcy proceedings,remained unpaid.
henderson did not disclose to the bankruptcy court the subsequent payments by the kisseberths or his retention of the funds paid to him from the proceeds of the insurance case settlement.rule b of the federal bankruptcy rules requires a debtor counsel to report the receipt of fees during the course of bankruptcy proceedings.there is no dispute that henderson failed to comply with rule b,although henderson contends that his noncompliance was inadvertent.
procedural history 
in december of,after the bankruptcy case was closed,henderson sued the kisseberths in an ohio state court for the unpaid balance of his fees.the kisseberths,in turn,filed a motion to reopen their bankruptcy case.in addition,bonnie kisseberth sued henderson in state court to recover the that she and two other relatives had advanced for the appellate transcript.
after the kisseberths filed the motion to reopen their bankruptcy case,henderson filed an application for fees in the amount of in the bankruptcy court.he disclosed that he had been paid,including the transcript funds that he had applied toward his fees.
the bankruptcy court held a pretrial conference on october,at which time it asserted the authority to determine the proper amount of fees to be paid henderson for services rendered in the bankruptcy proceeding.although it expressed uncertainty about its jurisdiction to adjudicate bonnie kisseberth claim for recovery of the transcript funds,the bankruptcy court ordered henderson to disgorge of the that he had collected,including the transcript funds.the transcript funds were then allocated to the bankruptcy estate,with the rest of the disgorgement going to the kisseberths.in addition,the bankruptcy court ordered a forfeiture of the unpaid balance of the funds that henderson had sought to collect through his state court action against the kisseberths.that case had been removed to the bankruptcy court pursuant to authorizing removal of cases related to bankruptcy proceedings.
henderson appealed the bankruptcy court order to the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.the district court rendered a decision on march,affirming the order of the bankruptcy court.on april,the district court modified its march,decision to reallocate the transcript funds to the kisseberths as debtors,rather than to the bankruptcy estate.henderson then filed this appeal.
ii.analysis 
a.the bankruptcy court did not err in exercising jurisdiction over all of the fees that henderson collected,including the transcript funds claimed by bonnie kisseberth 
henderson contends that the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction to order the disgorgement of the fees he collected from the transcript funds claimed by bonnie kisseberth.the bankruptcy court asserted its jurisdiction over the transcript funds based on its in rem jurisdiction over the debtors estate.included in the kisseberths bankruptcy estate are their assets as of the time the petition was filed.defining the bankruptcy estate.but the transcript funds,as the subject of a postpetition loan between the debtors and third parties,are not part of the bankruptcy estate.id.the bankruptcy court therefore relied on an inapplicable basis for its jurisdiction over these funds.
nevertheless,the bankruptcy court was empowered to order disgorgement of the transcript funds bas
