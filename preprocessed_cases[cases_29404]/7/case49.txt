this appeal presents an important and unsettled question of bankruptcy law that,in the case present posture,we lack jurisdiction to resolve.accordingly,we dismiss this appeal.
facts background 
like many mortgagors,appellant louis bullard owns real property whose value is substantially lower than the amount he still owes the mortgagee.appellee hyde park savings bank hyde park holds a mortgage on the property that secures a promissory note in the original principle amount of and with a maturity date of june.bullard filed a chapter petition in december,at which time he was current on his payment obligations to hyde park.hyde park filed a proof of claim in the amount of.the value of the property is disputed,but all parties agree that it is worth substantially less than the amount of hyde park claim.
on january,bullard filed his third amended plan.the plan,a hybrid plan,proposed to bifurcate hyde park claim into secured and unsecured portions per a,with the secured portion being reduced to the value of the property.the plan called for paying a dividend of approximately on the unsecured portion over sixty months under b and paying the secured portion according to the terms of the promissory note under b.hyde park objected,arguing that the plan could invoke either the modification provision of b or the provision of b,but not both.the bankruptcy court agreed,sustaining hyde park objection,denying confirmation of the plan,and ordering bullard to file an amended plan within thirty days or else face dismissal.on bullard motion,the bankruptcy court continued the deadline to file an amended plan pending the outcome of his appeal.
bullard appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel for the first circuit bap.recognizing,though disagreeing with,bap precedent holding that denial of confirmation of a reorganization plan is not a final order appealable as of right,see a watson boyajian in re watson,cir per curiam,aff,cir,bullard also filed a motion for leave to appeal the bankruptcy court interlocutory order,see a,b granting bankruptcy appellate panels discretionary jurisdiction over appeals of interlocutory orders of the bankruptcy court.the bap granted the motion and,on may,affirmed the bankruptcy court denial of confirmation albeit with a slightly different rationale.
bullard filed with the bap a notice of appeal to this court and,a few days later,a motion for certification of the appeal under d,which the bap denied.this court issued an order to show cause why the case should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the bap order affirming the denial of confirmation did not appear to be a final order,as required by u.d.after receiving bullard response,we determined that the case should proceed to full briefing of both the jurisdictional and merits questions.
ii.analysis 
we start and,as it turns out,end with the jurisdictional question congress has granted the courts of appeals jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees entered by a bap or district court sitting in an appellate capacity in bankruptcy proceedings.d.with the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa,stat,it extended our jurisdiction to reach direct appeals of the bankruptcy court orders final or interlocutory,upon certification by the bankruptcy court,district court,or bap and authorization by the court of appeals,see d 
because this appeal comes to us under d,we have jurisdiction only if the bap order rejecting bullard proposed plan is a final order we have noted that an order of the bap can not be final unless the underlying bankruptcy court order is final.watson boyajian in re watson,cir.b ecause bankruptcy cases typically involve numerous controversies bearing only a slight relationship to each other,finality is given a flexible interpretation in bankruptcy.bourne northwood,llc in re northwood,llc,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this flexibility means that an order may be final even if it does not resolve all issues in the case,but it must finally dispose of all the issues pertaining to a discrete dispute within the larger proceeding.perry first citizens fed.credit union in re perry,cir.we have recognized that,when an intermediate appellate court remands a matter to the bankruptcy court for significant further proceedings,there is no final order for purposes of d and the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction.in re gould eberhardt gear mach,f d,cir.conversely,w hen a remand leaves only ministerial proceedings,for example,computation of amounts according to established formulae,then the remand may be considered final.id.
we have previously suggested that an order denying confirmation of a reorganization plan may not be a final order so long as the bankruptcy case has not been dismissed and the debtor remains free to propose a modified plan.see watson,at.in watson,the parties conceded that the bankruptcy court order denying confirmation was not final,so this court did not expressly rule on the issue.id.at.instead,we held that,even if the order was not final when issued,it became final when the bankruptcy court entered an order dismissing the case.id.at.the question thus remains open in this circuit.
the finality of an order denying confirmation of a reorganization plan is the subject of a circuit split.a pair of recent cases covers the terrain.the sixth circuit joined the second,eighth,ninth,and circuits in holding that such an order is not final if the case has not been dismissed and the debtor remains free to propose another plan.see lindsey pinnacle bank in re lindsey,cir.the fourth circuit,over a strong dissent,joined the third and fifth circuits in holding that such an order can be final,even if the underlying bankruptcy case has not been dismissed.see mort ranta gorman,cir.
bullard urges us to eschew a rigid standard by which an order denying confirmation is per se not a final order,and,more expansively,to hold not only that such an order can be final,but that it should be presumed to be final unless the appellee can show otherwise.hyde park urges us to join the majority of the circuits and hold that an order denying confirmation is not a final order if the debtor may still propose an amended plan.it argues in the alternative that,even if such an order could be final,bullard has not satisfied any flexible standard we might adopt.
the principles set forth in perry and gould eberhardt dictate the result in this case.an order of an intermediate appellate tribunal affirming the bankruptcy court denial of confirmation of a reorganization plan is not a final order so long as the debtor remains free to propose an amended plan.the rejection of bullard plan plainly does not finally dispose of all the issues pertaining to a discrete dispute within the larger proceeding,perry,at,nor are the bankruptcy court responsibilities on remand only ministerial,gould eberhardt,at.the bankruptcy court gave bullard a deadline to file an amended plan,a deadline that,on bullard motion,the court continued pending the outcome of his appeal.once bullard files a new plan,his creditors will have an opportunity to file objections and the bankruptcy court must determine whether to sustain those objections or confirm the new plan.nothing about these tasks is mechanical or ministerial lindsey,at see also gordon bank of,in re gordon,cir t he bankruptcy court will have to give creditors notice of the new amended plan,permit time for any objections,and then conduct another confirmation hearing.all of which is to say,the district court remanded the debtors case to the bankruptcy court for significant further proceedings.internal quotation marks omitted.essentially everything remains unresolved in the chapter bankruptcy below a n order can not sensibly be final when it not only fails to dismiss the underlying case but additionally advises that a party may revise its own court filings.mort ranta,at faber,dissenting.
bullard argues that the ability to propose an alternative plan is illusory in this case,as the plan he proposed is the only feasible plan.he says that,if he can not appeal the denial of his plan,his only options are to propose an unwanted
