this appeal requires us to consider what happens when a in a chapter bankruptcy case,who negotiated the purchase of copyrights prior to the bankruptcy proceeding,later uses the bankruptcy code to reject those contracts that transferred ownership of the copyrights to the debtor.our resolution of that question determines the outcome of much of this suit by a rap artist who created the works giving rise to the copyrights in question.the artist sold copyrights in his works to a music recording company in exchange for a recording contract that entitled the artist to future royalties.the recording company later went bankrupt,becoming the.in confirming the debtor reorganization plan,the bankruptcy court ordered that all of the debtor contracts with the artist be rejected under the bankruptcy code and the copyrights sold to a rival recording company and its owner,two of the defendants in the instant case.
years later,the artist sued the defendants,alleging that they did not actually gain ownership of the copyrights through the bankruptcy,or if they did,they now owe him royalties.based on that premise,the artist asserts numerous claims sounding in federal and state law.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims,and for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
the pertinent facts span a period of seventeen years.we recount first the history of the artist business dealings with the,then the bankruptcy court administration of the debtor reorganization,and finally the proceedings leading to this appeal.
jeffrey thompkins thompkins is a rap artist who performs individually under the name jt money.as teenagers in the late,thompkins and a partner were discovered at a miami talent show by a member of the somewhat notorious south rap group live crew.another member of live crew,luther campbell campbell,owned a number of variously named record labels and was in the business of developing new artists.in may,campbell signed thompkins to an exclusive recording agreement the agreement or agreement with a predecessor company to campbell luke records,luke records under the agreement,thompkins would record albums under the group name poison clan.
the agreement covered a contract period of five years.under its terms,thompkins was required to record and deliver master recordings masters for production and release by luke records.luke records was given exclusive,unlimited and perpetual rights throughout the world to the copyrights in sound recordings as distinguished from the musical compositions embodied thereon recorded by artist during the term.thompkins also granted luke records a license for a ll musical compositions or material recorded pursuant to this agreement which are written or composed or which are owned or controlled,directly or indirectly,in whole or in part,by artist any producer of the masters subject hereto.in exchange for its ownership of the sound recording copyrights and its license to exploit the musical compositions,luke records agreed to pay thompkins royalties according to specified rates.the agreement obligated luke records generally to commercially release each lp album recorded and delivered by thompkins under certain conditions,but specified 
thompkins acknowledges that the sale of records is speculative and agrees that the judgment of luke records with regard to any matter affecting the sale,distribution or exploitation of such records shall be binding and conclusive upon thompkins.except for the general provision requiring luke records to release completed albums,nothing contained in this agreement shall obligate luke records to make,sell,license,or distribute records manufactured from masters delivered hereunder.
in addition to the agreement,the validity of which neither party disputes on appeal,the record contains a number of other documents that appear to be contracts between thompkins and various parties.several of these suggest that,after the agreement was signed,thompkins in fact signed away to luke records all or part of his copyrights in the musical compositions embodied on his albums among these documents is an addendum to the agreement,dated february the addendum or addendum,transferring to luke records an undivided of the publishing interest,in all compositions of thompkins including without limitation,the copyrights therein and all renewal and or sic extensions throughout the world.in exchange,the addendum recites that thompkins is to receive,among other things,cash advances for each album and the entire royalty to which poison clan was entitled under the agreement regardless of any future addition of other members to the group.thompkins signed the addendum,which also has an unsigned blank for a signature on behalf of luke records by luther campbell,president.
other documents pertain to thompkins work as a sideman on certain compositions and recordings created by campbell,who performed as a solo artist in addition to performing with live crew and managing his music production business.these letter agreements the sideman agreements set forth thompkins compensation for his contributions to certain of campbell solo works in slightly different language,each of the sideman agreements provides that the specified royalty rate lump sum payment represents thompkins payment in full for his services on the listed songs and that he will receive no other royalties or no other monies.the sideman agreements do not explicitly reference the ownership of any copyrights in those works.
from through the year in which the agreement expired by its terms,thompkins recorded three albums as poison clan low life muthas,poisonous mentality,and rufftown behavior.luke records distributed each of these.
on march,luke records became the subject of an involuntary chapter bankruptcy petition filed by its creditors in the bankruptcy court for the southern district of florida.that june,campbell individually filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition,and luke records moved to convert its chapter case into one under chapter.the bankruptcy court granted luke records motion on june,and jointly administered the luke records and campbell bankruptcies 
on november,thompkins filed a proof of claim in the luke records bankruptcy for an unspecified amount owed to poison clan based on services performed and royalties copywright sic from the period to.in deposition testimony taken in the course of the instant case,thompkins admitted that the address he listed on the proof of claim form was his residence at the time and that he did,in fact,receive notices at that address regarding the bankruptcy case 
the bankruptcy cases continued throughout the following months,and by,luke records,campbell individually,and the official unsecured creditors committee in the luke records bankruptcy had tentatively agreed upon a joint plan of reorganization the joint plan or plan for the two debtors.the joint plan provided for the classification and treatment of all claims in both bankruptcies,specifying that after confirmation by the bankruptcy court,all of the provisions of this plan,including all appendices and other exhibits hereto,shall be binding on the debtor,the estate,all creditors,and all other entities who are affected or whose interests are affected in any manner by the plan.a letter of intent annexed as exhibit a to the joint plan specified the proposed terms of the plan execution.
under the letter of intent,the various luke records entities including luke records,pac jam,and campbell individually proposed to convey a number of specified assets to lil joe records,and its owner,joseph weinberger weinberger.the assets were to be transferred free and clear of any and all liens,claims,encumbrances,charges,setoffs or recoupments of any kind,except as noted hereinbelow.the assets to be conveyed included a ll worldwide rights to the masters owned or controlled by luther campbell or luke records and a ll worldwide copyrights publishing interests held by luther campbell,luke records,or pac jam publishing,except with regard to certain other artists not at issue here.under the agreement,campbell and pac jam would receive no royalties,whether as artist,producer,writer,publisher,or in any other capacity,on any of the masters or compositions being sold.in exchange,lil joe records,and weinberger agreed to pay a total of to the two bankruptcy estates.
the joint plan and letter of intent also provided for the disposition of executory contracts to which campbell or luke records were parties.the joint plan established as a default that any executory contracts not otherwise explicitly disposed of were to be deemed rejected pursuant to again,with certain exceptions not relevant here the letter of intent proposed that luke records shall assume and assign to lil joe records,and weinberger,in weinberger sole discretion,all existing artist and producer contracts to which luke records or its affiliates and subsidiaries is a party with poison clan.emphasis added.both the joint plan and the letter of intent provided that their terms were subject to an order of confirmation by the bankruptcy court.
in the interim between the filing of the joint plan and the bankruptcy court confirmation order,the disposition of executory contracts remained an unresolved issue in the bankruptcy.on february,same day on which the joint plan was records filed a motion pursuant to to determine its ability to assume and assign various contracts it characterized as executory,including debtor exclusive recording agreement with poison clan.according to the motion,a material provision of the joint plan and letter of intent will be the assumption and ultimate assignment of the executory contracts described to lil joe records,and weinberger.apparently,however,in the weeks that followed,weinberger thought better of that aspect of the plan,opting instead to exercise the discretion given to him in the letter of intent and direct luke records to reject the contracts.on march,the bankruptcy court entered an order withdrawing without prejudice luke records motion to assume and assign the contracts setting the confirmation hearing date as the intended deadline for any other motions to assume executory contracts and reiterating that a ny contracts not assumed will be deemed rejected.
on march,the bankruptcy court approved and confirmed the joint plan and letter of intent,ordering that the parties are authorized and directed to perform thereunder the confirmation order.the order recites various findings required for plan confirmation under,including that the joint plan was proposed in good faith,that it complied with the applicable provisions of the bankruptcy code,and that t he sale of debtors assets to joseph weinberger and lil joe records,pursuant to the terms of the plan and the letter of intent is in the best interest of each of the debtors estates weinberger and lil joe records,are independent purchaser s and the letter of intent was negotiated in good faith and at arms length.among its specific mandates,the confirmation order provides 
a ll executory contracts and unexpired leases of the debtors are hereby rejected pursuant to section a of the bankruptcy code.parties to such rejected contracts and leases are directed to file proofs of claim for rejection damages or be forever barred from asserting such claims all of the assets to be transferred under the plan,the letter of intent or this order shall be transferred free and clear of any interest in such property of an entity other than the debtors.
following the plan confirmation,the bankruptcy court issued orders in both bankruptcy cases setting bar dates for claims arising from rejected executory contracts.the order in the luke records bankruptcy,issued on april,provided that a ll of the debtor executory contracts,including those exclusive recording contracts known to the debtor shown on exhibit a attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference are rejected.the first artist listed on exhibit a was poison clan.parties to the rejected contracts were allowed thirty days to file any claims arising as a result of such rejection,and claims not timely filed were to be deemed waived and will not be entitled to distribution under the confirmed joint plan.thompkins did not file any proof of claim for rejection damages.
as a final step in the reorganization process,the parties executed the various transactions required under the plan.among these was a copyright assignment to lil joe records,of all of luke records,campbell and pac jam portion of all rights,title and interest set forth in and to the musical compositions,comprising of all worldwide rights owned by luke records,campbell and pac jam including but not limited to the lyrics,music,and title of the compositions,and any and all works derived therefrom,together with the copyrights and proprietary rights therein.the copyright assignment was executed on april.
nearly six years later,on march,thompkins filed the instant suit against lil joe records,lil joe wein music,and weinberger hereinafter collectively,lil joe in the district court for the northern district of georgia seeking damages,declaratory relief,and permanent injunctive relief for alleged violations of the copyright act,lanham trademark act,and state common law contract claims.later that year,the case was transferred to the southern district of florida,where thompkins filed an amended complaint on november,adding a claim of fraud under florida common law.the parties conducted discovery and filed opposing motions for summary judgment.on march,after a hearing on the motions for summary judgment,a magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation that both motions be denied.lil joe objected to the magistrate report.on december,the district court declined to adopt the report,granted lil joe motion for summary judgment on the ground that the earlier bankruptcy confirmation order precluded thompkins claims,and denied thompkins motion for summary judgment.the district court entered final judgment for lil joe on december.thompkins now appeals,challenging the district court order granting lil joe motion for summary judgment.
we review de novo a grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court and reviewing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.calhoun lillenas publ g,cir.summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of lil joe on the ground that the bankruptcy court confirmation order precluded all of thompkins claims in the district court.neither the parties nor the district court,however,refer to the precedent of this circuit governing the preclusive effect of bankruptcy orders in subsequent collateral litigation.see,eastman kodak atlanta retail,in re atlanta retail,cir kaiser aerospace elecs.teledyne,in re piper aircraft,cir wallis justice oaks ii,in re justice oaks ii,cir.we think it less than clear whether the confirmation order precludes altogether thompkins claims in this case,but we find it unnecessary to enter that thicket in our review.the essence of the parties quarrel on appeal is how certain assets were disposed of in the bankruptcy both thompkins and lil joe now contend that the bankruptcy reorganization gave them ownership over these assets or other collateral rights.although both parties couch their arguments in terms of res judicata,their dispute is not simply whether thompkins claims were precluded before he even came through the courthouse door to file the instant complaint.instead,this case depends upon the substance of the bankruptcy reorganization of luke records.
accordingly,we decline to the grant of summary judgment on preclusion grounds,but we consider instead the merits of the parties respective arguments,as we may do in our review on appeal.see lucas grainger,cir holding that a judgment can be affirmed on appeal on any ground that finds support in the record,including alternate grounds for summary judgment quoting jaffke dunham,d.in the sections that follow,we examine each of thompkins claims or related group of claims under the copyright act,the lanham act,florida contract law,and florida tort law of fraud,respectively 
thompkins first asserts a claim of infringement under the copyright act,alleging that lil joe has illegally exploited copyrights owned by thompkins in dozens of songs that he authored and performed on recordings thompkins created and performed these compositions either for his poison clan records under the agreement the poison clan songs or in collaboration with luther campbell for use on records campbell released as a performer the campbell songs.we examine separately the copyright claims on the poison clan songs and the campbell songs.
with regard to the poison clan songs,thompkins argues that any copyrights he transferred to luke records under the agreement reverted to his ownership when luke records rejected the poison clan contracts as executory under the bankruptcy joint plan thompkins further argues that,upon reversion of the copyrights,those assets ceased to constitute part of the bankruptcy estate and thus were not transferred to lil joe under the joint plan,notwithstanding the language of the plan and the various supporting documents and bankruptcy orders suggesting that the copyrights were meant to be transferred.accordingly,thompkins argues,lil joe infringed his copyrights when it exploited them after the plan confirmation.lil joe disputes thompkins interpretation of the effect of the joint plan confirmation,arguing instead that luke records ownership of the copyrights was unaffected by its rejection of any contracts.thus,lil joe contends,those copyrights were transferred to lil joe among other luke records assets disposed of by the terms of the joint plan.
the terms of the agreement clearly transferred ownership of the disputed copyrights to luke records in the course of its business relationship with thompkins,well before the bankruptcy.the parties now dispute the effect on copyright ownership caused by luke records rejection of the agreement in the bankruptcy as an executory contract pursuant to because ownership of the copyrights determines thompkins ability to assert copyright claims on the poison clan songs in this suit,we must decide whether luke records rejection of the agreement had any effect on luke records or,more precisely,its bankruptcy estate continued ownership of those copyrights in the bankruptcy.
we hold that the rejection of the agreement did not cause ownership of the poison clan song copyrights to revert to thompkins thus,the copyrights properly passed into luke records bankruptcy estate and from there were legally assigned to lil joe.in essence,thompkins asks this court to deem an executory contract rejection under to be the functional equivalent of a rescission,rendering void the contract and requiring that the parties be put back in the positions they occupied before the contract was formed this is not the purpose of,nor does thompkins cite any authority to show otherwise.
in support of his argument,thompkins relies on the proposition that a debtor can not accept only the benefits of an executory contract while eschewing the burdens.see,in re beverage canners int l,collier on bankruptcy ed.he also correctly observes that of the bankruptcy code ordinarily deems rejection of an executory contract to be a breach of such contract immediately before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition.g see also cohen drexel burnham lambert group,in re drexel burnham lambert group.thompkins apparently concludes that because luke records rejection of the agreement constituted a breach of that contract,that event somehow reverses any transfer of asset ownership previously carried out by the rejected contract.in other words,luke records rejection of the burdens of the agreement prevents luke records from keeping the benefits,which,in thompkins view,are the copyrights luke records received.
it is true that a debtor must either assume an executory contract in its entirety or completely reject it,see byrd gardinier,in re gardinier,cir,but thompkins misunderstands the implications of rejection under.thompkins argument basically calls for an interpretation of rejection as an outright dissolution of the contract.but rejection does not embody the properties so commonly ascribed to it rejection merely frees the estate from the obligation to perform it does not make the contract disappear.in re drexel burnham lambert group,at.more specifically,r ejection has absolutely no effect upon the contract continued existence the contract is not cancelled,repudiated,rescinded,or in any other fashion terminated.id.at quotations omitted see also eastover bank for savings sowashee venture in re austin dev,cir holding that rejection under g does not mean that the executory contract has been terminated,but only that a breach has been deemed to occur cont l airlines,in re cont l airlines,cir to assert that a contract effectively does not exist as of the date of rejection is inconsistent with deeming the same contract breached.enter.energy united states in re columbia gas,cir rejection,which is appropriate when a contract is a liability to the bankrupt,is equivalent to a nonbankruptcy breach.
the drexel burnham lambert group case,cited by thompkins himself,presents a useful illustration of what a rejection does and does not affect.the corporate debtor,in an attempt to avoid its prospective obligations to compensate its former general counsel under the terms of an employment agreement,sought to reject the agreement as executory under.in re drexel burnham lambert group,at.among the compensation provided for in the agreement were various monetary payments,plus three stock portfolios purchased by the former general counsel from the debtor upon execution of the agreement and held in escrow for future disbursement.id.at.the debtor claimed that by rejecting the employment means by which the stock portfolios were purchased and escrowed by the general debtor pull ed the plug on the general counsel rights to the escrowed portfolios.id.at.
the bankruptcy court granted the debtor motion to reject the contract,resulting in a prepetition breach under the terms of g and converting the monetary balance owed to the general counsel into a general unsecured claim that can be paid in tiny bankruptcy dollars.id.at citation omitted.as to the stock portfolios,however,the court repudiate d debtor contention that rejection vaporizes or otherwise avoids the general counsel interest in the escrowed funds.id.the terms of the agreement gave the general counsel both legal title and the equitable interest in the escrowed stock,and the only right the debtor company retained in the stock upon execution of the agreement was a contingent interest subject to a condition subsequent,which ultimately never materialized.id.at.when the condition subsequent became moot,the general counsel became entitled to immediate possession of the stocks,and that possession was unaffected by the rejection of the contract.id.
like the debtor in drexel burnham lambert group,thompkins argues that luke records pulled the plug on its own claim of ownership over the copyrights when it rejected the contract thus,he contends,the copyrights could not have been assigned to lil joe out of luke records estate.but like the bankruptcy court in drexel burnham lambert group,other courts have observed that rejection differently affects the unperformed portions of an executory agreement and those provisions of the agreement that,by their nature,are fully executed.see software prods.elgar elecs.in re software prods,in re executive tech.data,section addresses only future performance obligations of the parties.it does not have any impact upon the executed portions of a contract.leasing serv.first.bank ass n,cir holding that a security interest,which was created by covenant in an executory agreement,was fully vested and thus,leaving it unaffected by the bankruptcy trustee rejection of the executory agreement citing jenson cont l fin,cir.the rejection of a executory contract pursuant to which the debtor acquired property does not obligate the debtor to return the property.in re executive tech.data,at see also in re software prods,at t he debtor can not undo an executed sale of property where title has passed.such property does not revert as a result of the debtor rejection of the executory contract.in re dmr fin,dictum fain irving trust in re waterson,berlin snyder,cir holding that where copyright assignments from composers to debtor were absolute,title is in the bankrupt estate the composers can not object if the trustee sells the copyrights.
there is no debate that thompkins transfer of his copyrights to luke records under the agreement was an executed sale of property.the terms of the agreement leave thompkins not even so much as a contingent interest in the copyrights.nor did thompkins negotiate any specific requirements for the sale or promotion of his records luke records needed only to commercially release each record,which it undisputedly did,and all matters of business judgment in such efforts were reserved to luke records and binding on thompkins.to the extent the agreement was executory,in the sense of not being fully executed,it was only insofar as luke records was required to pay thompkins royalties based on any future sales of his records.the transfer of the copyrights was fully executed,however,and luke records held full legal and equitable title under the terms of the agreement.
thus,when the bankruptcy court approved the rejection of the agreement,it freed luke records from the obligation,or burden,to pay royalties under the contractual terms and gave thompkins a claim for damages resulting from the breach.see in re gardinier,at in re austin dev,at in re drexel burnham lambert group,at.it also would have released thompkins from any outstanding obligation to perform under the,to convey any unrealized benefit to luke records.but the bankruptcy court confirmation order did not effectively rescind the agreement and reverse the executed transfer of the poison clan song copyrights to luke records.the rejection had no effect on luke records ownership of the copyrights,and they passed from the estate to lil joe under the terms of the joint plan and confirmation order and the later documents executing the agreed upon and confirmed terms of the reorganization.accordingly,thompkins can not support a claim of copyright infringement against lil joe as to the poison clan songs,and we affirm the grant of summary judgment on that claim in favor of lil joe.
thompkins complaint also alleges copyright infringement as to songs that he created and performed in collaboration with luther campbell for use on campbell records.in his amended complaint,thompkins alleges that he granted luke records only a license to exploit his performances on these campbell songs in exchange for royalties,and that the four sideman agreements he signed regarding these songs did not transfer any of plaintiff ownerships sic interests in the copyright in either the sound recordings or the compositions.there is scant evidence in the record pertaining to the campbell songs,and none of it appears to address ownership of copyrights,whether in the sound recordings or musical compositions.presumably,under a,thompkins was at least a of the copyrights in joint works to which he contributed.
but whether or not thompkins might have been able to make out a claim of infringement on the campbell songs,he does not specifically address that claim in his arguments on appeal.accordingly,we determine that the claim is waived,and we do not consider it here.see allstate ins.swann,cir issues that clearly are not designated in the initial brief ordinarily are considered abandoned.although thompkins filed a general notice of appeal from the entry of final judgment on all his claims,and a lthough we have a practice of reading briefs liberally to ascertain the issues raised on appeal,united states milam,cir,under no fair reading of thompkins briefs could we conclude that he asserted on appeal an argument pertaining to his claim of infringement of the campbell songs.see id.
thompkins has failed to mention these songs at all on appeal,and his initial brief statement of the issues relevant to the copyright claims focus entirely on the effect of rejection under.based on the scant record regarding thompkins claim of infringement on the campbell songs,it appears his theory is that luke records never obtained any ownership interest in the campbell song copyrights in the first instance.if that were true and we express no opinion either way on the issue,the luke records bankruptcy proceedings would be irrelevant to that claim.thompkins would ostensibly have retained whatever ownership interest he originally had in the campbell song copyrights,and his infringement claim against lil joe would be uncomplicated by the intervening transfer of assets through the bankruptcy and its attendant affects on the parties rights to the assets.because thompkins chose to argue on appeal only his interpretation of the effects of rejection under only to those assets that might have transferred through the bankruptcy,the copyrights in the poison clan because he nowhere mentions his claim regarding the campbell songs,we must deem that claim to be waived.see id.deeming an alternate argument to be waived on appeal where,i ntentionally or not,the appellants took an all or nothing approach by not appealing the district court decision on the alternate ground.
in addition to his copyright claims,thompkins alleges that lil joe has violated provisions of the lanham trademark act of,ch,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of.on appeal,thompkins argues that lil joe runs afoul of two separate provisions of the act dealing with trademark infringement,and dealing with false designation of origin.first,thompkins claim was not properly raised in the district court,and thus we do not consider it here.even a generous reading of thompkins amended complaint in light of liberal pleading rules reveals that the complaint nowhere states a claim under.the complaint never so much as mentions the word trademark,let alone alleges that thompkins owns one and that lil joe used it in an infringing manner.thompkins apparently first attempted to assert his claim in his response to lil joe motion for summary judgment.this is procedurally improper at the summary judgment stage,thompkins should have sought to amend his complaint in accordance with federal rule of civil procedure a if he wished to add a claim.see gilmour gates,mcdonald,cir 
we dispose just as easily of thompkins claim for false designation of origin.thompkins essentially claims that by selling copies of records that he wrote and performed,lil joe is falsely designating itself the origin of those goods,in contravention of the statute.thompkins does not allege that lil joe is selling his records under someone else,passing off his works as those of another simply that lil joe is selling copies of thompkins works with lil joe indicated as the creator of the actual physical records.the supreme court has explicitly held that such conduct does not give rise to a claim under.dastar twentieth century fox film,d interpreting origin of goods under the statute to refer to the producer of the tangible goods that are offered for sale,and not to the author of any idea,concept,or communication embodied in those goods.thompkins concedes on appeal that this is so accordingly,his claim fails.
as an alternative to his claim of copyright ownership,thompkins alleges four claims based on contract theories under florida common law.we first address thompkins breach of contract claim,and then we address his remaining contract claims together.
thompkins bases his breach of contract claim on the theory that lil joe became liable for luke records obligations when it purchased luke records assets in the bankruptcy.although thompkins entitlement to royalties arose entirely from his contracts with luke records,thompkins alleges that luke records is the predecessor in interest to lil joe,and that lil joe has reproduced and used thompkins sound recordings and musical compositions under the contractual agreements between plaintiff and luke records assumed by lil joe.by failing to pay him royalties in accordance with his agreements with luke records,thompkins argues,lil joe has breached those contracts.
notably,thompkins does not allege that lil joe breached any contract to which it was itself an original party,nor does he claim that lil joe came to be liable for luke records contractual obligations by execution of a novation or any other sort of contractual device.instead,he claims that the bankruptcy proceedings,by operation of law,resulted in lil joe being subject to a duty to pay royalties thompkins argues that this result is necessary to protect the authorial interest recognized by copyright law.according to his essentially equitable theory,it is unfair for his royalty rights to be severed from the copyrights through the bankruptcy.
we are not persuaded.in support of his argument,thompkins relies primarily on a decision of the ninth circuit court of appeals in yount acuff,cir,which in turn cites fain irving trust in re waterson,berlin snyder,cir.the yount case lends thompkins argument no support,as the purchaser of the copyrights out of bankruptcy in that case apparently did not contest that it had assumed the royalty obligation created by the original copyright agreement entered into by the debtor.at.yount concerned only a dispute over which of two parties was the proper recipient of the royalties.id.the in re waterson,berlin snyder decision,on its face,appears more pertinent.in that case,the second circuit held that,although a trustee may sell copyrights out of a bankruptcy estate,they should be sold subject to the right of the composers to have them worked in their behalf and to be paid royalties according to the terms of the contracts.in re waterson,berlin snyder,at.in deciding to impose an equitable servitude on the copyrights,the court was choosing between what it saw as two possible outcomes.id.as the court framed the problem,either the copyright transfer might be rescinded and the copyrights reconveyed to the authors,or the copyrights could be sold subject to the royalty obligations entered into by the debtor.id.
neither of the options considered by the court in in re waterson,berlin snyder is possible within the mechanism provided by under the current incarnation of the bankruptcy code and the parties do not dispute that it is the operation of that determines their respective rights.as we have discussed,supra,rescission is not a possible function of nor does the equitable imposition of a royalty obligation on the purchaser of copyright assets serve the purposes of the bankruptcy code.the court in in re waterson,berlin snyder was concerned that,unless the author royalty rights followed the copyrights through the bankruptcy to the purchaser of the assets,the author may be deprive d of the only means of fixing the royalties which he has been promised.at.but the bankruptcy code specifically addresses that problem by providing that rejection of an executory contract under g constitutes a breach,and the party to the rejected contract becomes a general unsecured creditor who may seek contract damages against the debtor as a claim in the bankruptcy.see g byrd gardinier,in re gardinier,cir eastover bank for savings sowashee venture in re austin dev,cir collier on bankruptcy ed.
thus,the is not left completely without recourse in the event that his original copyrights,transferred in consideration of future royalties,are later sold to a third party out of the estate,free and clear of royalty obligations due to the rejection of the original copyright agreement.in that event,the bankruptcy code explicitly provides a means by which the author can file a damages claim against the debtor for what is deemed a breach of contract.
this was precisely the course available to thompkins,and of which he undisputedly did not avail himself.luke records obligation to pay a creature of its contracts with rejected in accordance with along with all luke records other contractual obligations to thompkins.the bankruptcy court confirmed that rejection and ordered the parties to rejected contracts to file proofs of claim for rejection damages within thirty days of the date of the confirmation order or forever be barred from asserting such claims.thompkins had notice of these developments,but did not file a claim for damages the bankruptcy court disposition of the joint plan and the estate assets was consistent with the code scheme for rejection damages.thompkins simply slept on his rights,and any damages to which he might have been entitled were waived accordingly.
of course,while it is useful to note what thompkins should have done to protect his rights as against luke records in the bankruptcy,his potential recovery there is not the issue that controls thompkins contract claims against lil joe here.instead,we need only observe that,upon its rejection of the contract,luke records was no longer obliged to pay royalties.in the place of royalties,thompkins was entitled to rejection damages from luke records estate in the of which has anything to do with lil joe.furthermore,the bankruptcy court ordered that lil joe was a good faith,arms length,third party purchaser,and that the assets it was purchasing were to be transferred free and clear of any interest in such property of an entity other than the debtors.thus,thompkins can not show that any of luke records obligations under its contracts with thompkins passed through the bankruptcy to bind lil joe.without being able to prove the existence of a valid contract with lil joe,he can not maintain a claim for breach of contract under florida law.see rollins,butland,so d,wl,at,reciting the elements of a breach of contract claim.
thompkins remaining claims based on contract theories are more easily resolved.in light of our above holdings,they are without merit.first,thompkins alleges a theory of unjust enrichment,claiming that lil joe has unjustly profited from its misappropriation of his works and its receipt of profits and monies owed and due plaintiff from such works.among other elements of an unjust enrichment claim under florida law,a plaintiff must show circumstances such that it would be inequitable for the defendant to retain the benefit conferred by the plaintiff without paying for it.nova info,greenwich ins,cir.as we have held,supra,however,lil joe became lawful owner of the copyrights through the bankruptcy,and it has no royalties obligations to thompkins.thus,any profits lil joe realizes from its exploitation of the copyrights that it lawfully purchased through the bankruptcy can not be characterized as unjust,and thompkins can not maintain this claim.
next,thompkins makes a claim of promissory estoppel,the first element of which is a representation by the defendant as to a material fact that is contrary to a position.romo amedex ins,so d.thompkins alleges that defendants have made promises to honor and pay for their exploitation of plaintiff sound recordings and copyrighted works.we find no evidence in the record of any such representations by lil joe to support this assertion.it is unclear what thompkins even intended by this claim,because the complaint contains no allegation identifying exactly what constituted the purported promise by lil,for that matter,the position contrary to that promise.nor does our review of the record shed any significant light on what the allegedly actionable promise might be,given that all of thompkins business dealings relevant to this case were with luke records,not lil joe 
the only glimmer of a possible theory behind thompkins promissory estoppel claim comes from his reply to lil joe summary judgment motion in the district court.there,in support of the claim,thompkins asserted that weinberger promised and agreed in writing to the bankruptcy court that he would pay the artists,and then takes a contrary position.here again,thompkins theory is based on his misunderstanding of the bankruptcy proceedings.lil joe made no such promise in the bankruptcy on the contrary,lil joe has consistently asserted that it purchased the copyrights free and clear of any obligation to pay royalties.accordingly,thompkins promissory estoppel claim also fails.
finally,thompkins makes a claim for rescission and restitution.while a party to recording contracts can properly seek rescission of those agreements under state law,see yount,at,thompkins theory in support of his claim is flawed.he alleges that plaintiff and defendants entered into various agreements regarding the exploitation of plaintiff works,and prays that each and every contract or license or agreement of any kind between plaintiff and defendant be deemed rescinded.yet,as we have noted,supra,none of the luke records agreements bind lil joe,and thompkins points to nothing in the record indicating that lil joe ever entered into any other contract that would be pertinent thus,thompkins claim fails the first requirement of a suit for rescission under florida the parties to the lawsuit lie in contractual privity.see bland freightliner llc,d.if thompkins wished to seek rescission of his recording agreements,he should have done so in a claim against luke records,either before or as part of the bankruptcy proceedings.that ship has long since sailed,so thompkins claim of rescission here against lil joe must fail as a matter of law.
finally,we consider thompkins claim of fraud under florida law.the requirements for a claim of fraud or fraudulent inducement are a false statement regarding a material fact the statement maker knowledge that the representation is false intent that the representation induces another reliance and consequent injury to the party acting in reliance.see wadlington cont l med,so d,biscayne inv.group,guarantee mgmt,so d.
we have trouble understanding the purported basis for this claim,as it appears thompkins is himself unsure of the theory behind it.in his response to lil joe summary judgment motion in the district court,thompkins lumped his fraud claim together with his claim for promissory estoppel.there,he made a conclusory argument that lil joe misrepresented in the bankruptcy court that it would continue to pay the parties to rejected contracts in accordance with luke records royalty obligations.as we observed in our discussion of the promissory estoppel claim in part,supra,this assertion is baseless.
moreover,this later theory conflicts with the original theory of fraud that thompkins alleged in the amended complaint.in pleading his fraud count in the complaint,thompkins alleges four misrepresentations by lil joe.only one of these four alleged statements presents even a plausible basis for supporting the claim thompkins alleges that,i n order to induce plaintiff to enter into the luke agreements,luke records and weinberger represented to plaintiff that plaintiff would receive royalties and accountings from luke records.
this theory fails all the same,however.thompkins accuses both luke records and weinberger individually.if luke is not a defendant misrepresentations to induce thompkins to enter into contracts,thompkins perhaps could have sued luke records,but he can not recover from lil joe for luke records alleged torts.to the extent thompkins alleges that defendant weinberger individually misrepresented material facts ostensibly during weinberger employment at luke records,the record simply contains no evidence to support it.while all of the contracts between thompkins and luke records are premised on royalty payments,thompkins points to no particular instances in which weinberger individually represented to him that he would receive royalties and accountings.
even if thompkins had submitted such evidence,we doubt his claim has any merit.under florida law,a fraud claim can not be premised on a promise to do something in the future except where the promise is made without any intention of performing or made with the positive intention not to perform.wadlington,so d at.again,nothing in the record indicates that weinberger or luke records intended at the time the contracts were made not to pay the royalties agreed upon.additionally,we suspect this fraud claim is of the type barred by the economic loss rule in florida,under which m isrepresentations relating to the breaching party performance of a contract do not give rise to any independent cause of action in tort,where such misrepresentations are interwoven and indistinct from the heart of the contractual agreement.hotels of key largo,rhi hotels,so d.here,thompkins complains about nothing more than that luke records and weinberger did not fulfill their promises under the the basis for a breach of contract claim.in any event,thompkins fraud claims are insufficient,and so they must fail.
ultimately,this case boils down to a simple missed his chance through the bankruptcy to recover some of the royalty money he would have been owed by luke records.having belatedly realized his error,he now asks this court to play the role of deus ex machina,swooping in to rescue his claims with interpretations of the bankruptcy code that ignore its premium on finality.this we can not do.thompkins may think unfair the procedure that congress devised,but his legal arguments to overcome it are unavailing.we affirm the district court grant of summary judgment on all claims.
so ordered.
the predecessor company that signed thompkins was effect records,a division of campbell skyywalker records which later became luke records.these and all of campbell other various music business entities relevant here ultimately fell under the ownership of luke records or campbell individually.for ease of reference,we refer collectively to all of the luke records and campbell music recording and publishing entities as luke records.
poison clan originally referred to both thompkins and his original partner,patrick watler.thompkins and watler were both parties to the agreement,but in july,watler apparently decided to perform with a different group and signed a letter purporting to release any interest he had in poison clan.watler involvement with poison clan is not at issue here.
thompkins also obliged himself to obtain a license on luke records behalf for any compositions that thompkins did not himself own or control.
some of these purported agreements were technically between thompkins and pac jam publishing pac jam,campbell music publishing company.pac jam was also disposed of as part of the campbell bankruptcy,so we include it when we refer to luke records.
the sideman agreements are dated april,december,may,and february.each covers between one and four songs by campbell.
although the bankruptcy court administered the two cases jointly,they were maintained as separate cases on the bankruptcy court docket.the two case designations were in re luke records,and in re luther campbell.
on february,the official unsecured creditors committee in the luke records bankruptcy filed an objection to various claims,including thompkins.the committee asserted that thompkins unliquidated claim was pursuant to an executory contract and should be disallowed and held in abeyance pending luke records decision on whether to accept or reject executory contracts.there is no evidence in the record that thompkins responded to the committee objections or took any other action with regard to the bankruptcy cases.

thompkins amended complaint includes nine enumerated counts.among them are claims entitled injunction and attorney fees,costs punitive damages.these are clearly remedies and costs to which thompkins is only entitled if he prevails they are not causes of action in and of themselves.see,klay united healthgroup,cir i f the plaintiff rights have not been violated,he is not entitled to any relief,injunctive or otherwise.the seven remaining actionable counts are pled as violation of copyright act,violation of lanham act,breach of contract,unjust enrichment,promissory estoppel,rescission and restitution,and fraud.because the breach of contract,unjust enrichment,promissory estoppel and rescission claims all rely on florida law generally pertinent to contracts,we treat those claims together.
a provides,anyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner as provided by sections through is an infringer of the copyright.
the specific songs for which thompkins claims copyright ownership are listed by name in the mandatory initial disclosures that he filed in support of his original complaint in the northern district of georgia,and to which his amended complaint refers.oddly,the record contains no single piece of evidence compiling all the works in question and explicitly indicating which specific titles were covered by which contracts between thompkins and luke records.this information is obviously relevant to determining the ultimate ownership of the copyrights in the various our review of the piecemeal record,we are able to conclude that the songs listed on thompkins initial disclosures fall into four categories songs that were released on the first poison clan album,low life muthas songs that were released on the second poison clan album,poisonous mentality songs that were released on the third poison clan album,rufftown behavior and songs that were released on records by luther campbell as a performer,with thompkins performing in a sideman capacity.all of the first three categories of songs are covered by the agreement,as those songs appeared on albums produced under thompkins initial recording contract with luke records.the fourth category,discussed in greater detail at part,infra,is covered by the sideman agreements the record contains no evidence of any other contractual agreements governing the rights to the songs in this category.
we pause for a moment here to make clear what copyrights are at issue with regard to the poison clan songs.lil joe contends that under the confirmed joint plan,it came to own copyrights in both the sound recordings and the musical compositions of the poison clan songs.as to the former,there is no dispute that luke records received the copyrights to the sound recordings under the agreement.thus,to the extent that lil joe acquired luke records assets through the we discuss in the text following this note,joe would unquestionably have gained ownership of the sound recording copyrights in the poison clan to the latter,lil joe claim to ownership of the musical composition copyrights is based on thompkins assignment of all or part of those copyrights to luke records via two sets of documents the addendum to the agreement,a series of songwriter agreements executed during the term of the agreement and purportedly transferring one hundred percent of thompkins composition copyrights in dozens of individual songs on the three poison clan albums.thompkins disputes the validity of the addendum and the songwriter agreements,arguing that luke records and thus,lil joe never came to own any part of the composition need not consider the songwriter agreements,for the addendum sufficiently establishes that luke records owned half of the musical composition copyrights in the poison clan songs.the addendum by its terms transferred ownership of the composition copyrights to luke records.to the extent that lil joe acquired luke records assets through the bankruptcy,luke records would have transferred to lil joe.this is significant because,if lil joe is now a of the composition copyrights in addition to being full owner of the sound recording copyrights,thompkins can not maintain his suit for infringement.see quintanilla.television,cir a of a copyright can not be liable to another for infringement of the copyright.quoting oddo ries,cir zuill shanahan,cir same mca television pub.interest,cir applying a similar principle that exclusive licensees of copyrights can not be liable for infringement.thompkins attempts to disclaim the addendum,alleging that it is invalid because it was not executed by any representative of luke records and for failure of consideration.as a matter of law,these arguments are insufficient to free thompkins from his obligations under the contract.see diaz rood,so d,it is clear that a promise,no matter how slight,can constitute sufficient consideration so long as a party agrees to do something that they are not bound to do.internal quotations omitted dodge of winter park,morley,so d,generally,it is enough that the party against whom the contract is sought to be enforced signs it.skinner haugseth,so d,same.thompkins does not dispute the authenticity of his signature or claim that he expressly intended that the addendum only be valid upon signatures of all parties.furthermore,the addendum itself recites luke records promises to compensate thompkins for his assignment of fifty percent of the copyrights.accordingly,we find that the addendum is valid and binding on thompkins,and luke records held in the composition copyrights in the poison clan songs.thus,when we refer to copyrights in this subsection,we include both the sound recording and musical composition copyrights.furthermore,because the addendum modified the terms of the agreement,for ease of reference we hereinafter include the former when we refer to the latter.
under a,the trustee,subject to the court approval,may assume or reject any executory contract of the debtor.this provision has spawned much litigation over the proper definition of an executory contract,and courts have struggled to formulate a coherent approach to the issue.the parties in this case have likewise grappled with the definition of the contracts at issue between thompkins and luke records.on appeal,the parties agree that the contracts were executory for the purposes of and that luke records rejected them.but this rare point of agreement between the parties is unique to the appeal in this case in the district court,thompkins maintained exactly the opposite position,asserting that the contracts were improperly treated as executory by the bankruptcy,we need not descend into the morass and attempt to define executory in this case.the parties do not contest that issue on appeal,and even if they were so inclined,we might otherwise be precluded from reconsidering the executoriness of the contracts.that issue was already decided by various bankruptcy court orders deeming the relevant contracts to be executory and confirming their rejection.in addition to the confirmation order generally deeming any unassumed contracts to be rejected,the order setting the bar date for rejection claims in the luke records bankruptcy specifically designated the exclusive recording contracts with poison clan as rejected executory we do not find it necessary to reexamine whether the agreement was properly treated as executory,we note that the bankruptcy court approval of the rejection of the agreement would be consistent with the functional approach to executoriness that we have tacitly approved in our precedent.that is,e ven though there may be material obligations outstanding on the part of only one of the parties to the contract,it may nevertheless be deemed executory if its assumption or rejection would ultimately benefit the estate and its creditors.sipes dev.in re dev,quoting order on evidentiary rehearing pursuant to remand at,sipes dev.in re dev,emphasis omitted,aff sub nom.sipes atl.gulf cmtys.in re dev,cir.the bankruptcy court presumably determined that rejection of the agreement would benefit the luke records estate by maximizing the value of the copyrights.the enhanced value of the copyrights in turn increased the value of the estate and the amount available to be paid to all of luke records thompkins,had he properly filed a claim in the bankruptcy.
thompkins also alleges a separate cause of action in his amended complaint for rescission and restitution under florida law.we address that claim in part,infra.
