ii.analysis 
standard of review 
this is an appeal in a bankruptcy case raising questions of law only.in a case which comes to us from the bankruptcy court by way of an appeal from a decision of a district court,we review directly the decision of the bankruptcy court.we accord no deference to the district court decision and review de novo the bankruptcy court conclusions of law.in re hurtado,cir citing schilling in re kenneth allen knight trust,cir.
absent an express statutory provision to the contrary 
the direct task before this court is to determine where the power to accept the voluntary resignation of a trustee in bankruptcy lies.this issue has not been extensively litigated the pivotal query in this case,however,is directed at the relationship between the common law and statutory authority as it relates to the process of voluntary resignation and acceptance of that resignation.on this issue,the law provides adequate guidance.
generally,where a principle is the courts may take it as given that congress has legislated with an expectation that the principle will apply except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.astoria fed.sav.loan ass solimino,d citing isbrandtsen johnson.specifically,the ust argues that,under the common law,absent an express statutory provision to the contrary,a public officer has the right to resign,and the authority to accept the resignation resides with the person or body having authority to appoint the successor.see rockingham county luten bridge,cir.the bankruptcy court,however,found that the ust,a creature of statute,can not,as he is now attempting,simply arrogate to himself the power to accept a trustee resignation,without congress so providing.in re dale brookover,at citing louisiana pub.serv.comm,d a federal agency may not confer power upon itself or expand its power.the foundation of the bankruptcy court position is,therefore,that a congressional grant of authority must be the sole source of the ust power to accept a trustee voluntary resignation.such a proposition,however,provides ample space for the expression of that invested power to be explicit or implicit.implicit or incidental power can be found in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary.carlucci doe,d a bsent a specific provision to the contrary,the power of removal from office is incident to the power of appointment.citation omitted.thus,the threshold question is whether there is a relevant statutory provision that limits,expressly or impliedly,the alleged common law authority of the ust to accept the voluntary resignation of a trustee,where that ust has the express authority to replace the trustee without judicial or other oversight.
application of 
in the present case,the bankruptcy court rejected the common law rule because it concluded that the bankruptcy code specifies a role for the court in accepting or refusing the voluntary resignation of a trustee.specifically,the bankruptcy court stated that r esort to common law is not proper in the face of a bankruptcy code section clearly setting forth the statutory procedure to be used when either a trustee seeks,or other officer of the court or the court seeks,the trustee removal from a pending case.in re dale brookover,at emphasis added.importantly,the bankruptcy court uses the word removal removal is a separate and distinct process from resignation
