order and opinion 
the petition for panel rehearing is granted.the opinion and dissent filed on july,appearing at,are withdrawn.a new superseding opinion and dissent are being filed concurrently with this order.
the petition for rehearing en banc is denied as moot.the parties may file additional petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc.
the motion for leave to file a reply in support of the petition for rehearing is denied.
we consider whether a lender that made colorable objections to a plan of reorganization in bankruptcy court and then diligently sought a stay in order to litigate those objections may obtain review of its objections on appeal even though the plan has been implemented.because it would be possible to devise an equitable remedy to at least partially address the lender objections without unfairly impacting third parties or entirely unraveling the plan,we hold that the lender objections are not equitably moot and should be considered on appeal.we thus reverse the district court decision dismissing the appeal on equitable mootness grounds and remand for further proceedings.
background 
in,five related entities acquired the westin hilton head resort and spa and the westin la paloma resort and country club.the five entities collectively debtors were transwest hilton head property,llc,and transwest tucson property,llc collectively operating debtors transwest hilton head ii,llc,and transwest tucson ii,llc collectively mezzanine debtors and transwest resort properties,holding company debtor.the holding company debtor was the sole owner of each of the mezzanine debtors.the mezzanine debtors,in turn,were each the sole owners of the operating debtors,which owned and operated the respective hotels.
the acquisition of the hotels was financed by two loans first,a million loan to the operating debtors secured by liens on the two hotels the mortgage loan and,second,a million loan to the mezzanine debtors secured by liens on the ownership interests in the operating debtors the mezzanine loan.
the mezzanine debtors and the operating debtors defaulted on the mezzanine and mortgage loans,respectively.in,all five debtors filed for chapter bankruptcy in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of arizona.the bankruptcy cases for the five entities were jointly administered.
jpmcc grasslawn lodging,llc lender,which had acquired the mortgage loan before the debtors filed for bankruptcy,filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding for million pim ashford subsidiary i llc,which had acquired the mezzanine loan in,filed two proofs of claim totaling million debtors and lender stipulated that the value of the two hotels was million.
plan of reorganization 
debtors filed a joint plan of reorganization.the plan proposed to cancel the mezzanine debtors equity interest in the operating debtors and to dissolve the mezzanine debtors.southwest value partners fund xv,lp swvp would invest no less than million and would become the new sole owner of the operating debtors.
pursuant to b,lender elected to have its entire allowed claim,million,treated as a secured claim the plan proposed to reinstate the loan,but to restructure the repayment requirements to comprise monthly payments and then a balloon payment of the remaining loan amount after years.
the proposed restructured loan terms also included a clause.pursuant to the clause,any sale or refinancing of the hotels would make the entire remainder of the million loan due immediately.the clause contained an exception,however between years five and fifteen of the loan,the hotels could be sold or refinanced subject to the restructured loan meaning the new buyer would take on the loan obligations,without the full amount of the loan coming due on sale,as long as certain conditions were met 
pim ashford treatment under the reorganization depended on whether it voted for the plan.if it voted against the plan,it would not receive any distributions.if it voted for the plan,pim ashford would be entitled to a small percentage of surplus cash flow in the future.the plan extinguished the mezzanine loan collateral the mezzanine debtors equity interest in the operating debtors.
there were ten classes of claims under the plan the mortgage loan and the mezzanine loan were each in a class by themselves.after the plan was proposed,lender acquired the mezzanine loan from pim ashford.lender then voted both its positions its original claim and the claim it obtained from pim ashford against the plan.
the plan was confirmed despite the votes of lender two dissenting classes because the plan satisfied the cram down requirements of b pursuant to the plan,the restructured mortgage loan entitled the lender to deferred cash payments totaling at least the amount of the allowed claim million,or the total loan amount,and having a net present value equal to the value of the collateral million.b a i ii.lender also retained a lien on the hotels for the total loan amount.id.b a i i.
as part of the consummation of the plan,the operating debtors were renamed swvp la paloma,llc,and swvp hilton head property,llc collectively reorganized debtors and continued to be wholly owned by swvp through an intermediary entity.the reorganized debtors became the borrowers under the restructured mortgage loan.
lender two objections to the plan 
lender objected to two aspects of the plan.first,lender contended that the exception to the clause should be removed because it negated its b election.according to lender,the option to keep the entire loan amount as a secured claim,codified in b,was intended by congress to protect secured creditors against the undervaluation of their collateral.if the collateral for a loan were undervalued,lender argued,the clause would protect the lender interests by,for example,preventing the debtor from immediately selling the collateral subject to the restructured loan and capturing the true value of the collateral here,lender specifically asserted that the exception to the clause between years five and fifteen would allow reorganized debtors to unfairly negate at least part of the benefit of lender b election.
second,lender complained that the bankruptcy court misapplied one of the requirements.section a requires that,i f a class of claims is impaired under the plan,at least one class of claims that is impaired under the plan must have accepted the plan for it to be confirmed.a.lender pointed out that in cases involving multiple debtors,courts have split on whether a requirement applies per plan or per debtor.compare,in re tribune.del per debtor,with jpmorgan chase bank,charter commc ns operating,llc in re charter commc ns.per plan.lender argued for the interpretation of a.because the mezzanine debtors here did not have any impaired class of creditors voting for the plan,lender argued that,under this interpretation,the plan violated a.
the bankruptcy court overruled lender two objections and confirmed the plan.
proceedings 
four days after the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan,lender filed a notice of appeal on the same day,lender filed a motion in the bankruptcy court requesting that the consummation of the plan be stayed pending appeal.lender argued that failure to grant the stay could result in the appeal being rendered moot.debtors and swvp each filed objections to the stay request,arguing that lender had not shown how substantial consummation of the plan would moot lender appeal.the bankruptcy court denied lender motion for a stay and having apparently accepted debtors and swvp arguments ruled that lender had not shown the likelihood of irreparable harm required for a stay because the possibility of mootness was speculative,at best.lender then filed an identical stay motion in the district court,and debtors and swvp again opposed it.like the bankruptcy court,the district court declined to issue a stay.
when the district court then considered the appeal which advanced lender two objections to the plan it held that the appeal was equitably moot.although the district court acknowledged that lender had been diligent in seeking a stay,it stated that the plan had been consummated,third parties had relied on the confirmation of the plan,and the relief sought would be inequitable.
lender filed this timely appeal from that decision.
equitable mootness is a prudential doctrine by which a court elects not to reach the merits of a bankruptcy appeal.rev op grp.ml manager llc in re mortgs.mortgages i,cir.an appeal is equitably moot if the case presents transactions that are so complex or difficult to unwind that debtors,creditors,and third parties are entitled to rely on the final bankruptcy court order.id.at alteration omitted.unlike article iii mootness,which causes federal courts to lack jurisdiction and so to have an inability to provide relief,equitable mootness is a doctrine that reflects an unwillingness to provide relief.id 
we have set out four considerations to help determine whether an appeal is equitably moot 
we will look first at whether a stay was sought,for absent that a party has not fully pursued its rights.if a stay was sought and not gained,we then will look to whether substantial consummation of the plan has occurred.next,we will look to the effect a remedy may have on third parties not before the court.finally,we will look at whether the bankruptcy court can fashion effective and equitable relief without completely knocking the props out from under the plan and thereby creating an uncontrollable situation for the bankruptcy court.
motor vehicle cas.thorpe insulation in re thorpe insulation,cir.because each of lender objections would require a separate form of relief,the equitable mootness analysis must be applied separately to each objection.see rev op grp.ml manager llc in re mortgs.mortgages ii,cir.
in evaluating a dismissal on equitable mootness grounds,we review factual findings for clear error and legal conclusions de novo.see mortgages i,at.
courts must be cautious in applying equitable mootness when a party has been diligent about seeking a stay.mortgages ii,at.to say that a party claims,although diligently pursued,are equitably moot because of the passage of time,before the party had a chance to present views on appeal,would alter the doctrine to be one of inequitable mootness.i t would be inequitable to dismiss their appeal on equitable mootness grounds merely because the reorganization has proceeded.in re thorpe,at.
mortgages i and mortgages ii together highlight the importance of diligence in the equitable mootness analysis.in mortgages i,the appellant had failed to seek a stay while pursuing an appeal.at.that the appellant had sat on its rights weighed heavily in favor of holding the appeal equitably moot.id.at.in mortgages ii,by contrast,the appellant had sought a stay pending the appeal.at.we held that the appeal was not equitably moot and,in doing so,specifically emphasized the request for a stay as a factor differentiating it from mortgages see mortgages ii,at unlike in mortgages i,appellant diligently pursued its rights by seeking a stay of the declaratory judgment order,even though it was unable to obtain the stay.
here,lender was diligent about seeking appellate review of its two objections to the plan.four days after the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan,lender filed a notice of appeal and asked the bankruptcy court to stay the consummation of the plan.when the bankruptcy court denied that motion,lender sought a stay from the district court.that lender was diligent here cuts strongly in favor of appellate review of lender claims.see mortgages ii,at w e are cautious about not giving a party who is diligent an opportunity to present its appeal.
the next consideration in the test for equitable mootness is whether substantial consummation of the plan has occurred.in re thorpe,at see also mortgages ii,at.the term substantial consummation is defined in the bankruptcy code as 
a transfer of all or substantially all of the property proposed by the plan to be transferred 
b assumption by the debtor or by the successor to the debtor under the plan of the business or of the management of all or substantially all of the property dealt with by the plan and 
c commencement of distribution under the plan.
as lender does not dispute,the record indicates that the plan has been substantially consummated.swvp assumed control over the debtors.swvp then reorganized the debtors by,among other things,extinguishing mezzanine debtors equity interests in operating debtors.finally,swvp funded accounts necessary to make disbursements under the plan and assumed contracts in order to run the hotels.
reorganized debtors argue that substantial consummation creates a presumption that the appeal is moot.to support this proposition,they cite to a series of cases.see appellees br.citing,aetna cas.sur.ltv steel in re chateaugay,cir.our circuit articulation of the equitable mootness test,however,has never included such a presumption.see mortgages ii,at substantial consummation of a bankruptcy plan often brings with it a comprehensive change in circumstances that renders appellate review of the merits of the plan impractical.but this is not always the case we must still consider whether,despite substantial consummation,we can fashion effective relief.to do so,we analyze the final two factors from thorpe.citations omitted see also in re thorpe,at.although substantial consummation is a factor weighing in favor of finding the appeal moot,the law in this circuit requires that we still look at the third and fourth prongs of the equitable mootness test.
the third consideration in the test for equitable mootness is whether the relief sought would bear unduly on innocent third parties.in re thorpe,at mortgages ii,f d at.to evaluate this,we must ask whether it is possible to alter the plan in a way that does not affect third party interests to such an extent that the change is inequitable.in re thorpe,at.third parties reliance on the consummation of the plan is not enough to find this prong satisfied.rather,for this factor to weigh in favor of holding a party appeal to be equitably moot,the specific relief sought must bear unduly on innocent third parties.see id.
we analyze each of lender objections in turn.
the exception to the due on sale clause 
lender argued that the plan exception to the clause negates its b election.if lender prevailed on the merits of this argument,lender proposed relief would be the elimination of the exception to the clause.without the exception,the clause would prevent reorganized debtors from selling or refinancing the hotels without paying lender the remainder of the total loan amount.
the relief requested by lender affects only the division between lender and reorganized debtors of any appreciation in value of the hotels or from any inaccurately low valuation of the hotels during the bankruptcy proceeding.no party other than lender and reorganized debtors and their owner swvp would be affected by this division.
reorganized debtors argue that swvp,as the owner of reorganized debtors,is the type of innocent third party that the equitable mootness doctrine is meant to protect.in light of swvp participation at every stage of these proceedings,we hold that swvp is not an innocent third party.swvp became involved in the reorganization as a new investor and as the proposed owner of the reorganized entity before the confirmation of the plan.although debtors put forward the initial version of the plan,swvp participated in the hearings held by the bankruptcy court regarding confirmation of the plan,and the bankruptcy court acknowledged that it considered swvp pleadings in reaching its decision to confirm the plan.in fact,swvp negotiated with lender over the final form of the confirmation order in other words,the final version of the plan,including the portions that gave rise to lender objections 
following confirmation of the plan,swvp participated in further proceedings in the bankruptcy and district courts.swvp filed a notice of appearance as appellee in the earlier stage of this appeal in the district court.when lender sought a stay pending appeal,swvp then filed objections in both the bankruptcy and district courts,arguing,among other things,that lender objections to the plan were meritless.
in thorpe,we noted that in evaluating whether any remedy would unduly affect innocent third parties,a n important consideration is whether all the parties affected by the appeal are before the court.in re thorpe,at.reorganized debtors are a party to this appeal,and swvp called itself an appellee and participated as such in the first stage of this appeal in the district court.counsel for swvp has not appeared in the proceedings before this court,but regardless of whether that means swvp is not before the court in the sense anticipated by thorpe,the involvement swvp had at every other step in the process means it is not an innocent third party.indeed,when a sophisticated investor such as swvp helps craft a reorganization plan that press es the limits of the bankruptcy laws,appellate consequences are a foreseeable result.bank of trust official unsecured creditors comm.in re pac.lumber,cir 
section a accepting class requirement 
lender suggests that there would be two possible remedies if it prevailed on appeal on its argument that a requirement should be applied to each debtor.first,lender argues that it could be compensated for the plan having extinguished the collateral of its mezzanine loan.second,lender argues that the liens on the ownership interest in the debtors could be reinstated.
reorganized debtors have not shown how either of these proposed forms of relief would affect innocent third parties.instead,reorganized debtors arguments focus on the effect that allowing the appeal to go forward would have on swvp.but the two forms of relief sought distribution of money from reorganized debtors to lender or reinstatement of lender liens would alter only the relationship between reorganized debtors and lender.see,clear channel outdoor,knupfer in re pw,llc.cir finding that reinstatement of a lien would not affect third parties.even if swvp would be affected indirectly through the impact on reorganized debtors,swvp involvement in the reorganization process means that it is not the type of innocent third party that the third prong of the equitable mootness test is designed to protect.
the fourth,and most important,consideration in the equitable mootness test is whether the bankruptcy court could fashion equitable relief without completely undoing the plan.see mortgages ii,at in re thorpe,at.even if the relief would be only partial,w here equitable relief,though incomplete,is available,the appeal is not moot.in re thorpe,at.
the exception to the due on sale clause 
lender seeks elimination of the exception to the clause.lender argument in support is that allowing a sale of the hotels subject to the restructured loan frustrates the intended purpose of the b election.we need not and should not consider the merits of that argument given that our present task is only to determine whether equitable mootness prevents the district court from considering the argument at all.it is sufficient for now to understand that,if lender succeeded on the merits of this argument,eliminating the exception to the clause would give lender complete relief.
even if lender were successful on the merits,however,the potential options for relief would not necessarily be limited to eliminating the full exception.because even incomplete relief can be enough to counsel against mooting the appeal,see mortgages ii,at,we have to ask whether there are any forms of even partial relief that could be provided without unravelling the plan.we can think of two examples of potential partial relief.first,the bankruptcy court could reduce the length of the window during which the clause does not apply.second,the court could decide that,if a sale occurred during the window,lender would be entitled to some percentage of the difference between the remainder of the total loan amount and the loan present value.
reorganized debtors insist that any relief would be inequitable.their position implies that were the court to narrow the window of the exception by one day or,in the case of a sale during the period of the exception,to award lender one percent of the difference between the remainder of the total loan amount and the loan present value that would undermine the entire plan.we see no reason why this would be true,and reorganized debtors have offered none 
additionally,reorganized debtors present contention that altering the exception to the clause would unravel the economics of the plan is in tension with the positions swvp filing briefs as a interested party,before the reorganization took place and the original debtors advocated in the bankruptcy and district courts.swvp and debtors both actively opposed the stay sought by lender in the bankruptcy and district courts,arguing that there would be no likelihood of irreparable harm absent a stay.in doing so,swvp specifically stated that lender had not demonstrated how substantial consummation of the confirmed plan would,in fact,moot its appeal.debtors argued that there would be no immediate harm from the plan exception to the clause because the exception would not arise until approximately january,and that i t wa s entirely speculative whether such a sale would ever occur.these prior positions by their severely undermine reorganized debtors argument before this court that the exception to the clause was a fundamental component of the transaction and that it can not now be eliminated or altered without unraveling the plan.
section a accepting class requirement 
section a requires that,in order to confirm a plan,at least one impaired class of claims must vote in favor of the plan.lender second objection was that a requirement that there be an impaired class voting for the plan should apply to each individual debtor,not to the plan as a whole.because lender,in its position as the sole creditor of the mezzanine debtors,voted against the plan,lender argued that this requirement was not satisfied here.
if lender succeeded on the merits of this argument,it would have shown that,under the bankruptcy code,it had the right to veto the plan at the confirmation stage even if we assume that vetoing the entire plan is no longer an available form of relief,though,we must again ask whether there is any other remedy that could be crafted to address lender claim.
logically,the value of lender ability to veto was worth somewhere between nothing and million the total value of lender claims against the mezzanine debtors.under f,a class of claims that is not impaired meaning the plan does not alter its rights is deemed to automatically accept the plan.accordingly,if lender mezzanine claim had been paid in full,the mezzanine claim would have been deemed to have voted for the plan.making that payment now or,at least,that payment plus interest would thus seem to eliminate the a objection.a lesser payment may not eliminate the a objection altogether,but would at least offer a partial remedy.and we see no reason why,if the court were to devise a remedy that required reorganized debtors to pay lender one dollar,for example,the plan would be undone.see in re thorpe,at holding that equitable remedies vest great discretion in a court devising a remedy.
we conclude that lender appeal is not equitably moot.although the plan has been substantially consummated,lender was diligent about seeking a stay,and it would be possible to devise an equitable remedy for each objection that would not bear unduly on innocent third parties.
for the foregoing reasons,we reverse the district court dismissal for equitable mootness and remand for further proceedings.
i respectfully dissent.
the majority wrongly concludes that the interests of southwest value partners swvp,a investor with no interest in this bankruptcy,should not inform our assessment of whether it would be prudent or equitable to disturb this reorganization plan at this late stage.it is only by ignoring these interests that the majority is able to conclude that any equitable remedies would be available in this case.in reality,the remedies the lender proposes are grossly inequitable to swvp and would surely jeopardize the reorganization.more broadly,the majority decision discourages potential investors from relying on the finality of bankruptcy court confirmation orders,or from investing in struggling properties until all bankruptcy litigation is concluded,which,as in this case,can take many years.this impedes the bankruptcy code goal of maximizing debtors estates and facilitating successful reorganization,to the detriment of both debtors and creditors.in re continental airlines,cir.
the majority and i agree that this plan has been substantially consummated,and that this factor weighs in favor of finding this appeal equitably moot.we disagree,however,regarding just how much weight the factor should carry.while i agree that the fact that a plan is substantially consummated does not,by itself,render an appeal moot,in re mortgages,cir internal quotation marks omitted,substantial consummation should be our foremost consideration in assessing equitable mootness,see in re continental airlines,at.indeed,as the majority acknowledges,many of our sister circuits have held that substantial consummation creates a presumption of equitable mootness.see aetna cas.sur.ltv steel in re chateaugay,cir rochman ne.utils.serv.grp.in re pub.serv.of,cir in re aov.while we have not recognized such a presumption,nothing in our precedents suggests that we should not accord significant weight to substantial consummation in determining whether an equitable and effective remedy is available.in re mortgages,at recognizing that s ubstantial consummation of a bankruptcy plan often brings with it a comprehensive change in circumstances that renders appellate review of the merits of the plan impractical,but that courts must still consider whether it is possible to fashion effective relief.
i strongly disagree with the majority conclusion that the equitable mootness doctrine is not meant to protect the interests of a investor in swvp position.the majority concludes that we should not consider how the proposed remedies will affect swvp interests because swvp participated in the bankruptcy proceedings,and,to some extent,in this appeal.but we have never held that we may ignore a investor interests merely because the third party participated in the proceedings.the majority relies in part on the fifth circuit decision in bank of new york trust official unsecured creditors committee in re pacific lumber,cir.however,that case involved a reorganization plan that had been crafted by a creditor and a competitor of the debtor.id.at.it was therefore at least arguably fair to discount the creditor and competitor interests in deciding whether the appeal was equitably moot,since they were responsible for the deficiencies in the plan.id.there is no indication that swvp had any connection to this case until the debtors approached it to fund a reorganization plan the debtors had already crafted.in fact,a different investor initially agreed to fund the plan.it was only after the first investor unexpectedly declined to pursue the transaction that swvp agreed to make an investment on terms that were substantially similar to those the debtors had previously negotiated with the other investor.once swvp agreed to fund the plan,it was only natural that it would be involved in the bankruptcy proceedings,since its investment was the very reason the proposed reorganization was feasible.see in re gwi pcs,cir rejecting argument that insiders lack ed good faith reliance on the reorganization plan,and noting that it would be natural for many,if not a majority,of the transactions set forth in a reorganization plan to involve the participants of the chapter proceedings.
the majority suggests that swvp was not entitled to rely on the finality of the confirmation order because it could reasonably foresee that the order would be appealed.this argument unduly focuses on the reasonableness of swvp reliance,rather than on the compelling reasons why investors should be affirmatively encouraged to rely on the finality of confirmation orders.as the third circuit has observed,
o ur inquiry should not be about the reasonableness of the investors reliance or the probability of either party succeeding on appeal.rather,we should ask whether we want to encourage or discourage reliance by investors and others on the finality of bankruptcy confirmation orders.the strong public policy in favor of maximizing debtors estates and facilitating successful reorganization,reflected in the code itself,clearly weighs in favor of encouraging such reliance.indeed,the importance of allowing approved reorganizations to go forward in reliance on bankruptcy court confirmation orders may be the central animating force behind the equitable mootness doctrine.
in re continental airlines,at.this case illustrates perfectly why encouraging reliance on bankruptcy confirmation orders is critical to facilitating complex reorganizations.once a third party like swvp invests to improve the debtors capital,to the benefit of creditors and debtors alike,it is much more difficult for it to walk away if the terms of its bargain are altered on appeal.the rule the majority endorses ignores the realities of the marketplace,and creates strong incentives for investors to delay funding improvements until after the appeal is completed,which may take years.it has already taken approximately three years since swvp funded the plan in this case.had swvp waited to fund improvements,the debtors hotels would still be depreciating in value,and perhaps might even have been abandoned for want of funding.this would have negatively impacted the lender by decreasing the value of its collateral and impeding,or terminating,the ability of the debtors to generate cash flow and service their debt.worse,the majority approach discourages third parties from agreeing to make these kinds of investments in the first instance.this is likely to detrimentally impact both creditors and debtors by decreasing the value of debtors estates ex ante and making it more difficult to facilitate workable reorganizations.as the seventh circuit has eloquently observed 
every incremental risk of revision on appeal puts a cloud over the plan of reorganization,and derivatively over the assets of the reorganized firm.people pay less for assets that may be snatched back or otherwise affected by subsequent events.through the adjustment of prices may affect the viability of the reorganization,and in any event may distort the allocation of assets away from the persons who can make the most valuable uses of them and toward persons who are less sensitive to the costs of ex post changes of plans.by protecting the interests of persons who acquire assets in reliance on a plan of reorganization,a court increases the price the estate can realize ex ante,and thus produces benefits for creditors in the aggregate.
in re unr,cir,cert.denied.once this plan was confirmed,and once the lender request for a stay was denied,the very success of the reorganization depended on swvp promptly funding improvements in reliance on the confirmation order.reliance should be encouraged here,not discouraged.
there is another reason we absolutely must consider the impact the proposed remedies will have on swvp.to determine whether this appeal is equitably moot,we must assess whether the remedies will completely knock the props out from under the plan and thereby creat e an uncontrollable situation for the bankruptcy court.motor vehicle cas.thorpe insulation in re thorpe insulation,cir.because the success of the entire reorganization plan hinges on swvp continued investment,answering this question requires us to predict whether swvp will still consider this transaction attractive if the requested remedies are imposed.
there is ample reason to believe that incorporating the proposed remedies into the reorganization plan could cause swvp to stop funding improvements and divest.the lender suggests that the bankruptcy court could compensate lender for the value of its extinguished collateral by amending the plan to provide a distribution to lender equal to the approximately million that swvp paid for the new ownership interests in the reorganized debtors.for all practical purposes this would amount to a distribution of money from swvp to the lender,since swvp owns the reorganized debtors and was the source
