although many have tried to put a stake through the heart of this fee dispute which refuses to die,all have failed to do the trick.we,as the sixth forum to take a stab at it,are next in line.now creeping along as a bankruptcy appeal,the case is here after stops at the district of columbia bar arbitration board,the superior court of the district of columbia,the superior court of delaware,the federal bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois,and finally the federal trial court for that district.baise miller,the washington,law firm in this dispute,is here today appealing an order barring its claim for additional fees under of the bankruptcy code.in resolving the firm appeal,we must go back in time to when this saga all began.
the ingersoll cutting tool company ictc,since its inception in the late,was at the forefront of the metal cutting tool industry.for the vast majority of that time it was a enterprise,handed down from its founder,winthrop ingersoll,to future generations.but that changed in,when iscar,took over in a sale allegedly masterminded by the first outside board members in ictc history.prior to the sale,ictc was owned by the gaylords,descendants of ingersoll and the appellees in this case.they claim they had no desire to sell the company but were duped by the nonfamily ceo and certain directors.according to them,a corporate chauffeur overheard these individuals scheming and laughing in a limousine,reveling in their plan to take down ictc and ship it overseas where it belonged.whether this actually occurred is gaylords never managed to get a statement from the it does make much of a difference.what is important is that when the gaylords caught wind of this plan,they tried with all their might to stop the sale,retaining baise miller to act on their behalf.and when the law firm failed to make a sought more money for its gaylords found themselves trading one battle over their company for another over legal fees.
the gaylords first contacted baise miller in late november.they explained to partner marshall miller that they needed to stop the sale,and miller agreed to help by filing a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction.miller allegedly told them not to worry he was friends with a judge in delaware who owed him a favor,so getting the sale enjoined was no big deal.what more,miller supposedly said he had contacts in the media who could sling mud at iscar.he even said he spoke with a lieutenant general jim williams who was ready to investigate the company on international security grounds.so miller could handle this thing,no sweat.but he would need help from another lawyer,david margules of bouchard,margules friedlander.
miller and margules held a phone conference with the gaylords on december.the gaylords lived in illinois miller in washington,and margules in delaware.margules introduced himself,described his background and experience,and told the gaylords that this sort of thing was his bread and butter.bouchard margules and friedlander gaylord,wl.but despite all miller friends in high gaylords were sold.
the deal was sealed until the two attorneys flew to rockford,illinois,and met the gaylords in person.you see,the gaylords were to a fault meetings were important,but if they went well,they were happy to trust an agreement to a handshake and a promise.in fact,robert gaylord,who was more or less in charge before he passed away during this litigation,conducted dollar deals on this basis.so he thought nothing of reaching an oral agreement to pay miller a retainer,with the understanding that margules would be paid out of those funds as well.
a few days later,miller sent the gaylords a letter memorializing their oral agreement.it contained some surprises.after reciting the retainer and the fact that margules would submit his fees to miller not the gaylords,the letter discussed a contingency fee.the gaylords were shocked.thinking they had an agreement for a capped fee of,they refused to sign the contract.
in the meantime,margules decided he needed a bigger piece of the action.margules previously reached a deal with miller where he would receive of the retainer based on the expectancy that he would do a quarter of the work.however,as a preliminary injunction hearing drew this point they had filed suit in delaware chancery court,a court of equity known mainly for its decisions on corporate saw that he was doing a greater percentage of the work.so margules asked miller for more money,and miller arbitrarily decided on a new retainer figure,because that was the next notch up.bouchard margules and friedlander,wl at.
back at the negotiating table with the gaylords,miller assured them that was the outside figure,and that he would return any unused portion of the fee.robert gaylord agreed to the deal reluctantly he was willing to pay if need be,but not a penny more.id.at.unfortunately,the agreement was never put in writing,and this caused headaches as the fees escalated well beyond the cap.
for all that,the litigation was unsuccessful.the delaware court denied injunctive relief,and the sale was consummated.then came the fee dispute.as agreed,the gaylords deposited into baise miller escrow account.but well after the representation came to a close,the gaylords had received any invoices from miller detailing the costs and fees.it turns out there was a logical if unreasonable explanation for the delay the total fees from miller and margules outstripped the escrow fund.when the gaylords finally received the invoices from both had been billing miller all along but received only partial total came to almost.outraged by the request for another on top of the outside figure,the gaylords wrote miller and insisted he had it wrong.they explained that the agreement was for no more than,and if miller and margules had trouble apportioning the money,that was their problem.miller did back down.while continuing to demand more money,though,he partially satisfied margules by paying him short of the total claimed.
when the gaylords also refused to budge,baise miller filed an action in the superior court.the court stayed the case,however,because the gaylords agreed to arbitration before the arbitration board.the board issued its ruling in late,but unfortunately it failed to decide the critical represented the gaylords maximum liability to both law firms.this is what the board said 
the total fees and costs to be or to have been payable by the gaylords to baise miller total.the gaylords paid to baise miller account.baise miller has paid of the to bouchard,margules friedlander.baise miller paid to itself the remaining sum of.
this award does not resolve the issues of whether baise miller action in paying to bouchard,margules friedlander was reasonable or appropriate and expresses no opinion as to how that issue should be resolved.in addition,this award does not resolve,nor express any opinion as to,the reasonableness or recoverability of any fees or costs assessed by the law firm of bouchard,margules friedlander to the gaylords or to baise miller.
this decision was not exactly a model of clarity,and it caused problems down the road.the fairest interpretation,however,is that the gaylords did owe miller any more money they were seemingly entitled to a refund to the extent miller retained less than his due,he could look to the gaylords for compensation and margules would either have to look to miller for any shortfall or bring his own claim against the gaylords.
despite our read,miller saw things differently.in a motion to confirm the award filed with the superior court,miller contended that the board decision meant the gaylords owed him more money.we find that argument baffling,but the superior court response seems even more so.that court said that the award makes clear that the gaylords owe baise miller and that the arbitration board is taking no position on the amounts owed by the gaylords to margules.fair enough though we might quibble with the word owe,since the gaylords already paid miller well over that sum.but then we get this it is not challenged that the gaylords have paid baise miller.deducting that amount from the award
