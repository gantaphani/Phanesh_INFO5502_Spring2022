this is an appeal by the official committee of asbestos claimants the committee from a district court order that affirmed a bankruptcy court order denying the committee motion for the appointment of a chapter trustee.the committee contends that the district court and the bankruptcy court misapplied our decision in in re marvel entertainment group,cir marvel.the committee does not dispute the proposition that,under our cases,the party seeking the appointment of a trustee generally bears the burden of persuasion by clear and convincing evidence,but the committee contends that what marvel described as the strong presumption in favor of a debtor current management is inapplicable under the facts of this case and that the committee burden of persuasion was therefore reduced to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.accordingly,the committee argues,the bankruptcy court and the district court erred in applying the clear and convincing standard,and the committee asks us to reverse and remand with instructions to reconsider the evidence under the preponderance standard.because we see no support for the proposition that the burden of persuasion in a case of this nature is ever reduced from clear and convincing evidence to a preponderance of the evidence,we reject the committee argument and affirm the decision of the district court.
in january,holdings,filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code,et.now operates as under a and,a holding company that is beneficially owned by samuel heyman,succeeded to the liabilities of gaf corporation and the ruberoid company.beginning in the,gaf,ruberoid,and other former producers of asbestos products faced mass tort litigation throughout the united states regarding injuries.before filing for chapter reorganization,had inherited responsibility for some pending asbestos suits.in january,pursuant to a,the united states trustee appointed the committee to represent persons asserting asbestos tort claims against.in november,the committee filed a motion for the appointment of a chapter trustee.the parties produced and the bankruptcy judge reviewed more than exhibits relating to the motion,and the bankruptcy judge then held a hearing.in support of its motion,the committee advanced two arguments,only one of which is now relevant the argument implicated in this appeal was that excessive conflict between and the asbestos claimants warranted appointment of a trustee under both a,which authorizes the appointment of a trustee for cause,and a,which authorizes the appointment of an outside trustee when the appointment is in the interests of creditors.in simple terms,it is the committee position that current management is subordinating the interests of asbestos claimants to those of heyman and favored creditors.among other things,the committee complains that current management refused to bring fraudulent conveyance actions against heyman and others,joined with a subsidiary in litigation designed to shield the former assets of gaf building and roofing products business from asbestos claimants,and lavishly funded a lawsuit charging three law firms that represent asbestos claimants with racketeering,fraud,and other torts,in turn,insists that heyman revived a troubled business and that current management is simply attempting to defend itself against largely spurious asbestos claims.
after the hearing,the bankruptcy court denied the committee motion.the court noted that the party seeking appointment of a trustee must prove the need for the appointment by clear and convincing evidence and that there is a strong presumption against appointing a trustee.the court recognized that the appointment of a trustee may be called for when there is extreme acrimony between a debtor in possession and creditors,but the court found it appropriate to apply the usual presumption in this case both because management of ha d been in place for years and was familiar with the company operations and because there was insufficient evidence to show that appointment of a trustee would be helpful.t he evidence presented by the committee,the bankruptcy court concluded,did not meet the clear and convincing standard.id.at.while acknowledging that there was some strident disagreement and litigation on critical aspects of this case,the court noted that the debtor in possession had shown at least a degree of willingness to cooperate with the committee by obtaining tolling agreements from heyman and other targets of avoidance actions.id.at.apparently referring to lawsuit against the law firms and the committee fraudulent conveyance action against heyman,both of which were pending in the southern district of new york,the bankruptcy court also pointed out that critical disputed issues,such as the legitimacy of corporate restructurings and the litigation against the plaintiffs asbestos firm,would be tested and ultimately resolved in other proceedings.id.at.the committee then took an appeal to the district court.the committee argued that the usual presumption in favor of current management is inapplicable in this case for three reasons is a holding mere shell that operates no business at hence its existing managers familiarity with the business is irrelevant to the decision of whether or not to appoint a trustee because a trustee would simply need to manage asbestos claims,the trustee would not need to incur the usual substantial costs associated with learning how to manage an active service company and has shown no presumptive ability to discharge its fiduciary duties to creditors given its actions and the structural problem of heyman control as the dominant shareholder.at.because the usual presumption was inapplicable,the committee argued,the bankruptcy judge reliance upon that presumption as the basis for her ruling was an abuse of discretion per se,and the committee only had to show that a trustee was warranted by a preponderance of the evidence,rather than by clear and convincing evidence.at,quoting committee dist.reply br.at.
the district court affirmed the order of the bankruptcy court and issued a detailed opinion explaining the basis for its decision.the district court held that the bankruptcy judge did not abuse her discretion in finding that the committee had failed to produce clear and convincing evidence of the need for a trustee under either subsection of a and that t he committee ha d not proved the need for a trustee by the same type of clear and convincing evidence presented in cases in which bankruptcy trustees had been appointed.at,ja.the district court wrote 
the bankruptcy judge clearly is not convinced that heyman is fraudulently attempting to avoid asbestos liability or that his control of renders unfit to serve as fiduciary for the estate.she correctly notes that the parties will have the opportunity to test and ultimately resolve such allegations in the other proceedings.
at,ja.the district court also observed that neither marvel nor any other case cited by the parties suggests that if a court deems the presumption in favor of current management inapplicable,the movant need no longer present clear and convincing evidence that a trustee is necessary.
at,ja.in the present appeal,the committee could have argued that the evidence before the bankruptcy court proved by clear and convincing evidence that the standard for the appointment of a trustee was met and that the bankruptcy court erred in finding otherwise.but the committee has elected not to advance this factual argument.instead,the committee argues that the bankruptcy court and the district court committed two errors of law.first,the committee contends that the usual presumption in favor of existing management should not have been applied in this case because managers have no significant experience operating the debtor business and can not be relied upon to discharge faithfully their fiduciary obligations to the estate and its creditors.appellant br.at.second,the committee maintains that,with the presumption in favor of current management out of the way,t he standard of proof to which the committee should have been held was the normal preponderance of the
