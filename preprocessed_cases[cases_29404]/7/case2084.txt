eric red appeals from a judgment entered upon a verdict in favor of respondents,nilda roos and wilma baum,on their respective complaints against red for wrongful death.before trial respondents filed a motion in limine requesting the court apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel to factual findings made by the federal bankruptcy court in a discharge proceeding involving the parties.the bankruptcy court specifically found respondents wrongful death claims were not discharged by red petition for bankruptcy because the claims were the result of red willful and malicious conduct.the trial court here granted the motion in limine,and thus,precluded red from contesting the issue of liability on the wrongful death claims in front of the jury.on appeal red claims the trial court erred in giving the bankruptcy court findings collateral estoppel effect because doing so violated a federal bankruptcy statute,which preserved his right to a jury trial on wrongful death claims and did not comport with fairness and sound public policy.we disagree.red has not convinced us united states code section precludes the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel in this context or that the application of the doctrine was unfair or unsound.consequently,we affirm.
factual and procedural history 
wrongful death claims.about on may,red was driving his sport utility vehicle suv and struck another vehicle stopped at a red light on wilshire boulevard in santa monica after pushing the car in front of his into the intersection,red suv crossed opposing lanes of traffic,veered off the road and crashed through the front doors of a billiards pub.the suv came to a stop when it hit the bar inside the pub.two patrons of the pub,the adult sons of respondents nilda roos and willa baum,died as a result of the collision.immediately after the collision,red picked up a piece of broken glass and attempted to cut his throat.
in june,respondent roos filed a wrongful death action against red.respondent baum filed her claim in may and both actions were consolidated in july.
in october,red,who had briefly relocated to texas filed for bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of texas.red sought to discharge all of his debts including the claims filed in the tort actions stemming from the collision by operation of law.red also sought and received a stay of the state court wrongful death actions.respondents appeared in the bankruptcy proceedings and asked the bankruptcy court to lift the stay so that the wrongful death actions could proceed in the california state court.red opposed the request arguing to the bankruptcy court 
t here will be a presentation of evidence apparently that this bankruptcy court will be asked to weigh regarding whether there was any intent here so it on that basis,your honor,we ask you to use the equitable discretion the court has to deny the request for relief from stay.and if there is a petition filed to establish a debt,let the facts be presented here,let this court hear whether there a basis for anything.
the bankruptcy court denied the respondents request.in turn,respondents filed complaints in the bankruptcy proceedings to determine the dischargeability of their claims against red and to object to the discharge.specifically they alleged their claims were debts for willful and malicious injury by the debtor and were thus not subject to discharge in bankruptcy pursuant to united states code section a.
the parties conducted discovery in preparation for a trial in the bankruptcy court on respondents complaints in red brief,among the issues he listed for the court determination were whether the may,collision was the result of a voluntary and intentional act on red part red intended to cause harm to the patrons of the pub and respondents had met their burden of proof and shown by a preponderance of the evidence red acted willfully and maliciously in causing the collision.
in november,the matter proceeded to a bench trial in the bankruptcy court.during the trial evidence from percipient and expert witnesses was presented.red introduced evidence from seven witnesses,offered exhibits,and testified on his own behalf.
the contest in the trial court centered on the cause of the collision.red contended the collision was the result of his unintentional and involuntary acts.he claimed he suffered from an episode of syncope,a brief loss of consciousness caused by a temporary loss of oxygen to the brain and therefore he was unconscious from the moment his suv hit the car on wilshire boulevard until it came to rest inside the pub.he stated he had suffered from several prior incidents of loss of consciousness,though he admitted that he did not tell anyone about them at the time they occurred.
respondents claimed the accident,which occurred on the anniversary of red failed marriage,was the result of his depressed mental state caused by distress over his personal and financial problems.they also presented a medical expert witness who testified red behavior and circumstances surrounding the collision did not support a finding of syncope.
the parties presented inconsistent eyewitness testimony some witnesses stated that they saw red upright,awake and alert during the incident.two witness supported red version,testifying red eyes were closed and that he was leaning towards the right.at the end of the presentation of evidence,the parties submitted written closing arguments to the court and the matter was taken under submission.
on february,the bankruptcy court issued its opinion.the court concluded respondents claims were not discharged under united states code section,subdivision a.the court determined the collision was the result of red voluntary and intentional actions red intended to harm the patrons of the pub and respondents had met their burden to prove that the injuries resulted from red intentional and malicious conduct.the bankruptcy court found red defense of loss of consciousness incredible and unproved.the bankruptcy court concluded red was conscious and alert and intentionally jammed his foot onto the accelerator crashed through the front doors of the billiards pub at a speed approaching mph,and killed two that all of this occurred because of a fit of uncontrollable rage on the part of red 
red filed an appeal of the bankruptcy court decision in the federal district court while the appeal was pending,red filed a motion in the bankruptcy court requesting a stay pending the appeal.the court denied the stay.but during the hearing on the stay,the court made comments indicating a belief that the state court wrongful death action would proceed to trial and that red would have an opportunity to convince a jury in the state of california that he was right 
in april,this case was returned to the active calendar in the superior court.prior to trial,respondents filed a motion in limine requesting the trial court give the bankruptcy court findings in the dischargeability proceeding collateral estoppel effect in the wrongful death actions.specifically they requested that in view of the bankruptcy court conclusion red had acted willfully and maliciously in causing the accident,red should not be allowed to relitigate his liability for the injuries.
red opposed the motion arguing collateral estoppel should not apply because the issues in the bankruptcy proceeding were not identical to those at issue in the wrongful death action the matter was not fully and fairly litigated in the bankruptcy court because respondents medical expert was not qualified to give his opinion,the bankruptcy judge was biased against him,and red had located a new witness who did not provide evidence in the bankruptcy trial he had no right to a jury trial in the bankruptcy trial and thus application of collateral estoppel would deprive him of his constitutional right to a jury trial and application of collateral estoppel would be unfair,contrary to public policy and would not further the purposes of the doctrine.
the trial court granted the motion in limine,ruling red could not contest the issue of liability and ordered that the jury trial be limited to the issue of damages.after a brief trial the jury returned verdicts of for respondent roos and for respondent baum.
red filed a motion for a new trial,requesting a new trial and stay pending the outcome of then still pending appeals of the bankruptcy court order in the federal court.the court denied the motion.
red timely appealed from the underlying judgment.
discussion 
standard of review 
among the several points of contention in this appeal is whether the standard of appellate review governing a decision to apply collateral estoppel is de novo or an abuse of discretion.some case law discusses the trial court exercise of discretion in deciding to allow the offensive use of collateral estoppel,sandoval superior court d.such authority suggests the appellate court should give deference to the lower court decision.the predominate view,however,is the trial court application of collateral estoppel is reviewed de novo.see groves peterson th,d campbell scripps bank th,d.here the facts determining whether the trial court properly applied collateral estoppel are uncontested,and thus application of the doctrine is a question of law to which we apply an independent standard of review 
ii.the trial court did not err in applying collateral estoppel 
on appeal red asserts the trial court erred in giving the bankruptcy court dischargeability factual findings collateral estoppel effect to preclude him from contesting liability on the wrongful death claims.first,red points out collateral estoppel applies only where the parties had a full and fair opportunity to litigate in the prior action.he claims he did not have a full or fair chance to litigate because the factual findings in the bankruptcy court were made by a judge rather than a circumstance,according to red,that directly contravenes united states code section,subdivision a,which expressly preserves the right to a jury trial in state court on the wrongful death claims the right to a jury trial and united states code section a contention.second,red claims application of the collateral estoppel was unfair and did not satisfy the public policy reasons underlying the doctrine the fairness exception.our analysis of these contentions begins with a review of the legal principles governing collateral estoppel and the related concept of res judicata.
the doctrine of res judicata rests upon the ground that the party to be affected,or some other with whom he is in privity,has litigated,or had an opportunity to litigate the same matter in a former action in a court of competent jurisdiction,and should not be permitted to litigate it again to the harassment and vexation of his opponent.public policy and the interest of litigants alike require that there be an end to litigation.citizens for open access.tide,seadrift th,d.the doctrine precludes parties or their privies from relitigating a cause of action that has been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.this aspect of res judicata has traditionally been referred to as res judicata or claim preclusion.
res judicata also includes a broader principle relevant here and commonly referred to as collateral estoppel or issue preclusion.under this principle an issue necessarily decided in prior litigation may be conclusively determined as against the parties or their privies in a subsequent lawsuit on a different cause of action.vandenberg superior court cal th,d.thus,res judicata does not merely bar relitigation of identical claims or causes of action.instead,in its collateral estoppel aspect,the doctrine may also preclude a party to prior litigation from redisputing issues therein decided against him,even when those issues bear on different claims raised in a later case.moreover,because the estoppel need not be mutual,it is not necessary that the earlier and later proceedings involve the identical parties or their privies.only the party against whom the doctrine is invoked must be bound by the prior proceeding.ibid.
collateral estoppel applies when the party against whom the plea is raised was a party or was in privity with a party to the prior adjudication,there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior action and the issue necessarily decided in the prior adjudication is identical to the one that is sought to be relitigated.coscia mckenna cuneo cal th,d.
in addition to these factors,and especially where collateral estoppel is applied offensively to preclude a defendant from relitigating an issue the defendant previously litigated and lost,the courts consider whether the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue.parklane hosiery company,shore,d kremer chemical construction corporation,d sutton golden gate bridge,highway and transportation district th,d.
to that end,the courts have recognized that certain circumstances exist that so undermine the confidence in the validity of the prior proceeding that the application of collateral estoppel would be unfair to the defendant as a matter of law.kremer chemical construction corporation,supra,at.redetermination of issues is warranted if there is reason to doubt the quality,extensiveness,or fairness of procedures followed in the prior litigation.such unfair circumstances include a situation where the defendant had no incentive to vigorously litigate the issue in the prior action,particularly if the second action is not foreseeable.securities exchange commission monarch funding corporation cir,parklane hosiery company,shore,supra,at.another such circumstance occurs when the judgment in the prior action is inconsistent with previous judgments for the defendant on the matter.parklane hosiery company,shore,supra,at.finally,application of collateral estoppel is unfair where the second action affords the defendant procedural opportunities unavailable in the first action that could readily cause a different result.id.at.with these legal principles in mind,we turn to red contentions on appeal.
right to a jury trial and united states code section,subdivision a 
preliminarily we note red does not contest that he was a party in the bankruptcy proceedings,that the bankruptcy court order was final on the merits,or that the issue necessarily decided in the bankruptcy proceeding was identical to the one he sought to relitigate in the wrongful death action instead he claims that he was denied a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the bankruptcy court.he argues that applying collateral estoppel was improper because the state court wrongful death action afforded him a procedural opportunity,that is,a right to a jury trial,unavailable in the federal bankruptcy court discharge proceeding.
this argument fails for several reasons.first,an additional procedural opportunity is meaningful only where it could readily cause a different result in the action.parklane hosiery company,shore,supra,at.we are not convinced that a jury acting as the trier of fact on the liability issues would readily have reached a different result than the judge in the bankruptcy proceeding.as the supreme court observed in parklane hosiery,the presence or absence of a jury as factfinder is basically a neutral,quite unlike,for example,the necessity of defending the first lawsuit in an inconvenient forum.id.at,fn.the jury hearing the same facts and essentially the same evidence and arguments concerning red mental state and causation,should reach the same conclusion as a judge assessing those matters.
this notwithstanding,the more fundamental failing in red argument is that the right to a jury trial poses no insurmountable barrier to applying collateral estoppel.securities exchange commission monarch funding corporation,supra,at.notably absent from parklane hosiery list of procedural opportunities missing from first action which would undermine the application of collateral estoppel in a subsequent action is the right to a jury trial.indeed,the supreme court in parklane hosiery expressly held that the application of offensive collateral estoppel did not violate the seventh amendment right to a jury trial.parklane hosiery company,shore,supra,at.thus,the parklane hosiery court concluded the unavailability of a jury trial in the first proceeding did not preclude the application of collateral estoppel in the second action.ibid.the california state supreme court has likewise concluded that notwithstanding the state constitutional jury trial guarantee,the lack of a jury trial on contested factual issues in one proceeding does not preclude application of collateral estoppel in a subsequent proceeding.people sims cal d,fn,any right to a jury trial is only a right to submit to a jury issues of fact which are triable.when issues of fact have been conclusively resolved against a party in a prior action,application of collateral estoppel to take those issues from the jury does not violate the right to a trial by jury lucido superior court cal d.
red recognizes parklane hosiery and resolve the question of whether the right to a jury precludes the application of collateral estoppel against him.red,nonetheless,asserts application of collateral estoppel in this case violated united states code section,subdivision a a statute which he asserts guarantees his right to a jury trial in the wrongful death action irrespective of the bankruptcy court findings in the discharge proceedings or the doctrine of collateral estoppel 
section,subdivision a provides,in pertinent part t his chapter and title do not affect any right to a trial by jury that an individual has under applicable nonbankruptcy law with regard to a personal injury or wrongful death tort claim,subd.a.
red construes section,subdivision a as providing that no bankruptcy court order or finding can be used to deny a party a right to a jury trial in a wrongful death action.he concludes that when the court applied collateral estoppel here and thus precluded him from contesting liability in the wrongful death action,the court effectively used the bankruptcy court findings to deprive him of his right to a jury trial in direct contravention of section,subdivision a.red concludes the trial court should have denied respondents motion in limine because section,subdivision a is an insurmountable barrier to collateral estoppel in this case.
while at first glance red interpretation of section and its implication on the doctrine of collateral estoppel appears to follow logically from the language of the statute,closer scrutiny of the provision does not support his view.red cites no legal authority for his reading of section,subdivision a.nor does a review of the legislative history of the section,or relevant bankruptcy legal authority serve to legitimize his interpretation.
background of section.in congress extensively revised the federal bankruptcy laws and expanded the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts.under the bankruptcy act disputes tangentially related to bankruptcy that previously could only be adjudicated in state or federal district courts,now could be heard in bankruptcy court.to ensure litigants law rights to a jury trial would not be lost in such cases,congress provided for the preservation of jury trial rights by allowing bankruptcy courts to conduct such trials.see,repealed elizabeth gibson,jury trials in bankruptcy obeying the commands of article iii and the seventh amendment.
when the united states supreme court in northern pipeline const.marathon pipe line,d,held unconstitutional the jurisdictional grant of authority to the bankruptcy courts under the act,it did so on the basis that article iii powers were unconstitutionally conferred on bankruptcy judges.the marathon court reasoned the broad grant of jurisdiction violated article iii because it permitted bankruptcy judges who lacked tenure and salary protections mandated by article iii,to hear and decide state common law actions without the parties consent.id.at.while marathon did not expressly hold that the bankruptcy judge authority under the act to conduct jury trials rendered the jurisdictional provisions of the act unconstitutional,the decision cast doubt on the authority of bankruptcy judges to conduct such trials courts subsequently have interpreted marathon to mean that it is unconstitutional for bankruptcy judges to conduct jury trials.see,in re american energy.
in response to marathon,congress quickly passed the bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of the amendments.the amendments retained the stature of bankruptcy judges but reduced their authority over judicial proceedings to comply with article iii apparent requirement that the essential functions and attributes of judicial power be vested in article iii courts.gibson.at.
among various alterations to the law,congress eliminated the act broad jury trial provision,section and replaced it with section,which limited jury trial rights to wrongful death and personal injury actions.the legislative history of section shows its drafters,like their predecessors who drafted section,intended merely to preserve the right to a jury trial only insofar as it existed under law they did not intend to expand or create a new source of jury trial rights.see cong.rec.daily ed.june,senator heflin explained the intent of jury trial provision as w here a party would have a right to a jury trial on an issue of fact pursuant to federal or state law absent the application of bankruptcy laws,this jury trial provision ensures that such rights remain intact and that the provision was intended to maintain the status quo and not to alter rights to jury trials which might have existed under state or federal law prior to.
furthermore,congress preserved jury trial rights in the amendments for personal injury and wrongful death actions not because it was constitutionally mandated under marathon or the seventh amendment but because of the strong lobbying efforts of the personal injury tort bar.see in re ice cream liquidation.congress also recognized that personal injury and wrongful death tort claimants,unlike most other creditors in bankruptcy proceedings,had not voluntarily associated with the debtor.see braugh,personal injury and wrongful death claims in bankruptcy the case for abstention baylor.thus,section was designed with the protection and interests of tort rights,rather than debtors,in mind.the objective of section is to prevent a debtor from taking away the protections provided under state law from creditors who depend on them the most.bibler,the status of unaccrued tort claims in chapter bankruptcy proceedings am.according to senator heflin congress never intended that the filing of a bankruptcy petition by a debtor act as an escape hatch from jury trials.cong.rec.daily ed.june.
finally,this court found no evidence in the legislative history that congress intended section to guarantee a jury trial in every wrongful death or person injury tort case,even where the doctrine of collateral estoppel would otherwise under law preempt the right to a jury trial.
our detour into bankruptcy law clarifies several matters that inform our interpretation of section,subdivision a.first,it is apparent from the legislative history section,subdivision a does not create any additional procedural or substantive rights to a jury trial.thus,red interpretation of section,subdivision a is too expansive.the statute preserves the right to a jury trial in a wrongful death action only to the extent that the right to a jury trial existed under the applicable law,under the constitution or relevant statute and as discussed elsewhere above,the federal and california state constitutional jury trial guarantees give way to the application of collateral estoppel 
second,nothing in the case law,legislative history or statutory scheme indicates that section operates to supplant the doctrine of collateral estoppel.as red points out,the bankruptcy court had no authority to conduct a jury trial in the discharge proceeding,in re hashemi cir.similarly the bankruptcy court would not have had jurisdiction to liquidate the wrongful death claim or conduct a trial in the action,subds.b b see grogan garner,d in re santos.but the limitations imposed upon the bankruptcy court authority and jurisdiction and the inherent distinctions between bankruptcy discharge proceedings and wrongful death claims are simply beside the p
