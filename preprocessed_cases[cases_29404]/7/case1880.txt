wilserv credit union credit union,appeals from an order and judgment of the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirming the judgment of the bankruptcy court.in re harper,wl.the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of,patrick malloy,iii,the chapter trustee trustee,avoiding the credit union security interest in the debtors truck pursuant to.under a,the trustee has the status of a hypothetical lien creditor once the bankruptcy petition is filed,and may avoid security interests that are unperfected under applicable law.in re hicks,cir.stat.tit,a.our jurisdiction arises under d,and we affirm.
background 
on september,the debtors purchased a truck from a dealer that financed the purchase price plus a fee.the dealer assigned the purchase contract to a finance company.the muscogee creek nation nation apparently issued a title on october.
over six weeks after the purchase october,debtors obtained a loan from the credit union.the debtors granted the credit union a security interest in the truck and used the proceeds to pay off the finance company and for a lien filing fee.the parties stipulated that the credit union had a valid security interest in the truck.on december,the credit union filed a lien entry form with the nation tax commission,which recorded the credit union lien on the title.no lien entry form was filed with the oklahoma tax commission.nor is there any evidence that a financing statement was ever filed.
the parties stipulated that the debtors did not live in indian country.they further stipulated that the truck was properly registered pursuant to the nation code.muscogee creek nation stat.eligibility for registration merely requires a person to be an enrolled member in the nation and to reside within its political jurisdiction.muscogee creek nation stat.tit,b c a.debtors filed their chapter petition on may,listing the truck as an asset of the estate.the bankruptcy trustee commenced an adversary proceeding against the credit union on the theory that the credit union lien was avoidable as unperfected under oklahoma law.a.
the bankruptcy court and the bap agreed.both recognized the general rule that the local law of the jurisdiction where the debtor is located,here oklahoma,governs perfection and priority of a security interest.stat.tit,b.however,where goods are covered by a certificate of title,the local law of the issuing jurisdiction applies to perfection and priority.stat.tit,c.article recognizes that perfection may occur with reference to a local statute.stat.tit,a.for example,perfecting a security interest in a certificate of title issued by the oklahoma tax commission requires delivery of a lien entry form,a certificate of title or application and the required fee thereafter,the lien will be noted on face of the certificate of title.stat.tit,a,tit,b.article of the oklahoma uniform commercial code ucc provides priority rules.stat.tit.
section c suggests that the local law of the issuing jurisdiction,the muscogee creek nation ought to apply to perfection and priority of the underlying security interest.but for c to be applicable,there must be a certificate of title as that term is defined in the ucc 
certificate of title means a certificate of title with respect to which a statute provides for the security interest in question to be indicated on the certificate as a condition or result of the security interest obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the collateral.
stat.tit,a emphasis added.both the bankruptcy court and the bap held that the title at issue could not qualify as a certificate of title because no nation statute or law addressed perfection or priority noting the security interest on the certificate of title.in the words of the bankruptcy court 
the creek motor vehicle registration statute does not provide or even suggest that noting the lien on the certificate of title issued by the creek nation is a condition to the lien holder obtaining priority over a lien creditor,or that noting the lien results in a priority over a lien creditor.
similarly,the bap noted the absence of any applicable muscogee nation law providing for the perfection or priority of a lien on a motor vehicle.
thus,it was necessary to resort to other oklahoma law concerning perfection and priority as the debtors resided in glenpool,oklahoma.stat.tit,b.after rejecting numerous possible exceptions to a creditor filing a financing statement as a means of perfection,both the bankruptcy court and the bap concluded that a financing statement would have been necessary,and none was filed.stat.tit,a.the exceptions include 
stat.tit,a ordinarily,filing a financing statement would not be necessary or effective to perfect a security interest given a lien noted on a certificate of title from another jurisdiction.but this provision did not apply because the title in this case could not be considered a certificate of title as defined by the oklahoma ucc.
stat.tit,a as amended and effective may.this section provides that filing a financing statement generally will not be necessary or effective given a lien noted on a tribal title.it further provides that filing a financing statement is not required to perfect a security interest where a security interest is noted on the face of a title issued by a tribe within days after the security interest attaches.id.it is undisputed that more than days intervened between attachment and the notation of the lien on the title at issue.section a also dispenses with the requirement of filing a financing statement if the security interest is otherwise perfected under an applicable law or procedure of that tribe,but both courts concluded that no tribal law or procedure addressed a perfection scheme.
stat.tit,a,a statute which excepts a vehicle registered by a federally recognized indian tribe as provided in g from the requirement that the secured party deliver the requisite documents and fee to the oklahoma tax commission in order to perfect.subsection g provides a security interest in vehicles registered by a federally recognized indian tribe shall be deemed valid under oklahoma law if validly perfected under the applicable tribal law and the lien is noted on the face of the tribal certificate of title.these provisions were effective april.regardless of whether these provisions are retroactive,the bap determined that they would not apply because no nation law dealt with perfection of vehicle liens.
stat.tit.both courts concluded that the credit union could not rely upon automatic perfection for a purchase money security interest pmsi to prevail over the trustee lien.the refinancing in this case by a different creditor could not be viewed as a pmsi because it did not secure a purchase money obligation incurred with respect to the truck and did not allow the debtors to obtain rights or use of the collateral.stat.tit,a.
stat.both courts rejected statutory subrogation that would enable the credit union to attain the status perfection of the prior lienholder because the credit union lacked an inferior lien on the vehicle when it advanced the funds to the debtors who then paid off the prior lienholder.
equitable subrogation.both courts rejected equitable subrogation because no evidence suggested the credit union had been somehow deceived concerning the validity of its security interest,and therefore should have been placed in the position of the prior lienholder.
on appeal,the credit union argues that both the bankruptcy court and the bap erred in determining that this case was not governed by.stat.ann.tit,a g,providing that oklahoma will recognize a security interest in a vehicle if validly created by tribal law and noted on the title,and by caselaw recognizing indian title and registration authority,the tribal title was not a certificate of title under the ucc,the credit union did not have a pmsi in which it could assert priority,and the credit union could not assert any lien priority of the previous lender via statutory or equitable subrogation.
