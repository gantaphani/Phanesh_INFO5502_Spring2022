i.the legal principles.
under code of civil procedure section,the assignee of a general assignment for the benefit of creditors may recover any transfer of the property of the whom we will refer as the certain conditions.transfers of the debtor property may be recovered by the assignee if the transfer was made 
to or for the benefit of a creditor 
on account of an antecedent debt owed by the debtor before the transfer 
while the debtor was insolvent 
within days before the assignment,or between days and one year before the assignment if the creditor,at the time of the transfer,
a was an insider,and 
b had reasonable cause to believe the debtor was insolvent at the time of the transfer and 
the transfer enables the creditor to receive more than another creditor of the same class.code civ,subd.b.
there are several exceptions to the assignee power to recover transfers,such as contemporaneous exchanges for new value given to the debtor,payment of a debt incurred in the ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the debtor and the transferee,and so on,subd.c.
discussion 
code of civil procedure section is not preempted by the federal bankruptcy code.
after these appeals were filed,the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit issued an opinion in sherwood partners,supra.over a dissent,the majority in sherwood partners concluded the federal bankruptcy code title of the united states code preempts the california statute giving the assignee the power to void preferential transfers.code civ.cummins flp,vantiger and gemmel raised the issue of preemption in their brief on appeal.because preemption is a question of subject matter jurisdiction see de tomaso pan american world airways,cal d,fn,and in this case presents a question of law not dependent upon any factual determinations,the issue is properly before this court 
we begin with a review of the principles governing the question whether a state law has been preempted by federal law,as summarized in sherwood partners.congress has the authority to preempt state laws.whether it has done so in a particular case is a question of congressional intent.congress may preempt state laws expressly,or its intent to do so may be inferred where it is clear from the statute and surrounding circumstances that congress intended to occupy the field,leaving no room for state regulation.sherwood partners,supra,at.the united states supreme court has observed that,while various expressions of the governing principle have been employed,the court primary function in deciding a preemption issue is to determine whether the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.hines davidowitz.hines see sherwood partners,supra,at.
according to the sherwood partners majority,the assignee powers to avoid and recover preferential transfers can not peaceably coexist with the federal bankruptcy scheme.the assignee avoidance powers,the court concluded,are inconsistent with the operation of the bankruptcy system,and trench too close upon the exercise of the federal trustee power to avoid preferential transfers.sherwood partners,supra,at.sherwood partners explains that the bankruptcy code embodies two goals a fresh start for the debtor and the equitable distribution of the debtor assets among competing creditors.because state statutes purporting to discharge debtors from their obligations the first goal are preempted,pobreslo joseph boyd.pobreslo,sherwood partners asserts that state statutes that implicate the federal bankruptcy law other major goal,namely equitable distribution,are likewise preempted.sherwood partners,at.the reasoning of the sherwood partners majority is this 
the trustee power to avoid preferential transfers and recover the funds for distribution to creditors is exercised under the supervision of the federal courts,and the trustee is appointed by the united states trustee or elected by the creditors,not by the debtor as is the assignee under state law.federal law protects creditors from the trustee possible conflicts of interest and other possible sources of.
if a state assignee under code of civil procedure section recovers a preferential transfer and distributes its proceeds to creditors,a federal trustee will be precluded from recovering the same sum if a federal bankruptcy proceeding is begun.the distribution of the recovered sum will then have been made by a state assignee subject to state procedures and substantive standards,rather than by the federal trustee subject to bankruptcy law substantive standards and procedural protections.sherwood partners,supra,at.
once state proceedings are commenced,they will affect the incentives of various parties as to whether they wish to avail themselves of federal bankruptcy law.sherwood partners,supra,at.the creditor whose transfer the assignee avoids may have a new incentive to begin an involuntary federal proceeding other creditors may have diminished incentives because they may share in the funds recovered by the assignee and might therefore have no interest in invoking the potentially more expensive and federal processes.ibid.according to the sherwood partners majority,congress did not contemplate state laws that would sharpen or blunt the effect of statutory incentives for the initiation of federal bankruptcy proceedings.ibid.
sherwood partners thus concludes that statutes that give state assignees avoidance powers beyond those that may be exercised by individual creditors trench too close upon the exercise of the federal bankruptcy power.sherwood partners,supra,at.
we are constrained to disagree with the analysis in sherwood partners,as we find it impossible to conclude that code of civil procedure section is inconsistent with the essential goals and purposes of federal bankruptcy law sherwood partners,supra,at.
first,it is undisputed that congress intended,in general,to permit the coexistence of state laws governing voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors.as sherwood partners necessarily concedes,voluntary assignments for the benefit of creditors have a venerable pedigree sherwood partners,supra,at,fn.and were expressly upheld in pobreslo,supra,at page.and,quite in harmony with the purposes of the federal act,the provisions of wisconsin law that are regulatory of such voluntary assignments serve to protect creditors against each other and go to assure equality of distribution see also stellwagen clum.stellwagen ohio statute permitting appointment of a receiver to take charge of all assets of the debtor and administer them for the equal benefit of all creditors,in a suit by creditors seeking to void a transfer made in contemplation of insolvency and designed to
