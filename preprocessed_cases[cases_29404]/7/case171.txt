chapter trustee joseph braunstein appeals the district court order reversing the bankruptcy court findings of fact and conclusions of law.the trustee alleged certain payments by the debtor,rowanoak corporation,to appellee ann walsh were fraudulent transfers under.laws ch,and a.walsh contends the transfers were payments on loans walsh had made to the debtor.after holding an evidentiary hearing,the bankruptcy court found the payments were fraudulent transfers and ordered walsh to reimburse the debtor estate.walsh appealed to the district court.the district court reversed,finding the bankruptcy court made several errors of law and fact.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.we reverse the district court judgment.
the debtor,rowanoak corporation,was incorporated in july by its president and sole shareholder,darragh murphy.rowanoak did business as a general contractor of construction projects,primarily with the city of boston.rowanoak performed virtually no labor on its contracts.instead,rowanoak,whose only employee and officer was murphy,hired subcontractors and occasional labor to perform the labor on its projects.
on january,rowanoak filed a voluntary petition for chapter relief.during the course of the bankruptcy proceeding,the trustee requested that rowanoak turn over all of its books and records,as well as its canceled checks and bank statements.in response,rowanoak turned over only canceled checks and bank statements.in reviewing these documents,the trustee discovered that from march,through may,rowanoak made six payments from its bank account to murphy mother,ann walsh.the checks totaled 
uncertain about the basis for these checks,the trustee filed a motion to compel rowanoak to turn over other books and records to the trustee.in response to the motion,murphy,as president of rowanoak,filed an affidavit stating that rowanoak did not maintain any books and records with respect to the financial operations of the corporation,and did not have any documents in its possession,custody or control that are relevant to payments made by the debtor to ann walsh.the trustee subsequently commenced an adversary proceeding against walsh to avoid and recover the payments as fraudulent pursuant to.laws ch,and a.in response,walsh claimed the checks represented payments on various loans made by walsh to rowanoak.
the bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing at which walsh,murphy,and the trustee testified walsh and murphy testified that walsh made several loans to rowanoak as evidenced by various canceled checks,check registers,and credit card statements.no promissory note,security interest,mortgage,or other documentation existed between walsh and rowanoak to substantiate the alleged loans.instead,walsh contended the loans were evidenced by credit card statements and canceled checks drawn from bank accounts in the name of walsh,her husband,and the dorchester,ross common quilts,a corporation of which walsh is president.all canceled checks were payable to murphy individually,except for one check made payable to home depot.none were payable directly to rowanoak.rowanoak and tax returns did not identify any outstanding loans to walsh.at the hearing,however,walsh and murphy both testified the checks to murphy were intended to be loans to rowanoak.
murphy testified that rowanoak often had cash flow problems,as it needed to pay subcontractors and laborers before it received payment from the city for completed projects.because rowanoak customers often took sixty days or more to settle their accounts,murphy asked her mother,walsh,for money to pay subcontractors,and then paid the advanced funds back when rowanoak received payment.walsh claimed she fronted rowanoak approximately,and that rowanoak still owed her when rowanoak filed for bankruptcy.walsh did not file a proof of claim until one week before the trial,however,and rowanoak did not include walsh on its list of creditors when it filed,under oath,its bankruptcy petition.based on this testimony and the documentary evidence,the bankruptcy court entered judgment in favor of the trustee,concluding rowanoak fraudulently transferred the payments to walsh in violation of.laws ch,and a.
walsh appealed to the district court.the district court reversed,finding the bankruptcy court erred as a matter of law by using a preferential transfer analysis when the trustee had alleged only fraudulent transfers,erred as a matter of law by considering the absence of potentially exculpatory bank statements against walsh erred as a matter of law by characterizing the payments to walsh as capital contributions when the trustee did not raise that issue and erred as a matter of fact and law by concluding rowanoak reasonably should have believed it was incurring or intending to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they became due.
in an appeal from the district court reviewing proceedings before the bankruptcy court,we independently review the bankruptcy court decision,applying the clearly erroneous standard to findings of fact and de novo review to conclusions of law.in re perry hollow mgmt,cir.we owe no special deference to the district court determinations.id.
the trustee first challenges the district court ruling that the bankruptcy court erred as a matter of law by employing a preferential transfer analysis.the trustee undisputably did not bring a preferential transfer claim under rather,the trustee sought to avoid and to recover fraudulent transfers under.laws ch,and.pursuant to,the trustee must show the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation 
without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation,and the debtor 
ii intended to incur,or believed or reasonably should have believed that he would incur,debts beyond his ability to pay as they became due.
pursuant to a,the trustee also may avoid fraudulent transfers if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation and the debtor became insolvent as a result of the transfer or obligation.
the district court concluded the bankruptcy court erroneously used a preferential transfer analysis based on the following comments the bankruptcy court made during its findings of fact and conclusions of law 
if,indeed,walsh was owed anything by the debtor,in receiving payments of during and holding no security in the debtor assets,walsh essentially came ahead of all other creditors,and it a basic tenet of the bankruptcy code that all creditors who are not protected by valid security interests must share and share alike in whatever dividends can be paid out of the debtor assets.one creditor ca be paid in preference to others.
we disagree with the district court conclusion that this statement indicates the bankruptcy court engaged in a preferential transfer analysis.after the comment,the bankruptcy court stated 
the defendant,walsh,has not provided sufficient evidence to rebut the trustee allegations,either under.general law chapter,section,or section a.first,there is no credible evidence that walsh gave any value to the debtor in exchange for its payments to her 
second,pursuant to section of.general law a,during when the transfers to walsh occurred,i find that the debtor reasonably should have believed that it was incurring or intending to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they become due.
likewise,pursuant to section a of.general law chapter,although there is insufficient evidence that the debtor was insolvent at the time the transfers were made,i find that the debtor was rendered insolvent as a result of the transfer to walsh.
the bankruptcy court explicitly stated it was analyzing the case under sections and,as alleged by the trustee.and the bankruptcy court findings that walsh gave no reasonably equivalent value to rowanoak in exchange for the payments,that rowanoak reasonably should have believed it was incurring or intending to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they become due,and that the transfers to walsh rendered rowanoak insolvent are elements of fraudulent transfers under sections and of the massachusetts fraudulent transfe
