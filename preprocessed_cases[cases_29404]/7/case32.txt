patrick hannon hannon appeals from the entry of summary judgment denying his petition for a discharge in bankruptcy.see a a.the bankruptcy court denied the discharge after concluding that hannon made false material statements with respect to disbursements made on his behalf by third parties during the bankruptcy proceeding.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court entry of summary judgment,and we affirm as well.
background 
factual background 
in may of,hannon and his wife,elizabeth,sought protection from their creditors by filing a voluntary bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code the hannons reported total assets of about million,and liabilities of approximately million,which included a disputed tax debt of more than million.
hannon owned and operated a recycling and scrap metal company,recycling,recycling,as well as a real estate company,ware real estate,llc ware real estate,which held title to the land on which recycling was located.the hannons estimated that monthly expenses necessary to support their family during the bankruptcy process would average about,and noted that the income required to pay those expenses would come from recycling ongoing operations while hannon served as.
recycling and ware real estate 
hannon bought recycling and ware real estate with the help of an attorney named george mclaughlin,who had previously represented hannon.mclaughlin owned a financing company,bright horizon finance,llc bright horizon,which loaned hannon the necessary funds.bright horizon loan terms included warrant rights,affording it the option to purchase a percent interest in each company.on june,after the hannons filed for bankruptcy protection,bright horizon assigned its warrant to abcd holdings,llc abcd holdings,another company controlled by mclaughlin,and,on july,abcd holdings exercised those warrant rights,thereby obtaining a percent ownership interest in both ware real estate and recycling.
a few weeks earlier,on june,mclaughlin,suspecting that business funds were being diverted by hannon for unauthorized purposes,obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order from the suffolk county superior court.that order temporarily barred hannon from recycling premises.on july,however,that order was modified to allow hannon to resume operational control over the business.a short time later,on july,abcd holdings removed hannon as an officer of ware real estate and appointed mclaughlin to replace him.hannon,however,continued to operate recycling until february,when abcd holdings removed him as an officer and director of that company as well.on march,the bankruptcy court approved the sale of hannon remaining minority interest in both ware real estate and recycling to abcd holdings.
hannon monthly operating reports 
hannon was required to file monthly operating reports mors on a standardized form with the united states trustee office.he did so from may through september of.hannon says that he provided his counsel with bank statements from the accounts and,based on those statements,counsel completed the necessary forms for him.hannon then reviewed the forms and signed a certification on each mor which declared under penalty of perjury that the report was true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief.
the mor forms require,among other things,that a debtor affirmatively disclose whether funds have been disbursed for the debtor benefit from any account other than a account,and,if so,to provide an explanation for such payments.here,that would include disclosure of disbursements made by recycling and ware real estate for hannon benefit.the mor form also instructs the debtor to report the amount of estate disbursements made by outside sources.on all of the relevant mors,hannon reported that funds had been disbursed for his and his wife benefit from an account other than a account.in may and june of,for example,hannon mors identified and,respectively,as payments from for rent and utilities.hannon september mor also disclosed that funds had been disbursed from for rent and utilities,but reported that no amount had been disbursed for the estate benefit from outside sources.hannon july and august mors contained no reference to disclosable payments from recycling,and reported estate disbursements made by outside sources.
companies object to discharge 
on july,abcd holdings,recycling,and ware real estate the companies filed an adversary complaint against hannon in the bankruptcy proceeding,objecting to his discharge in bankruptcy.based upon a forensic accounting analysis of the books and records of recycling and ware real estate,the companies alleged that while hannon was in control of the businesses,he diverted a substantial amount of business revenue to his own benefit,without authority.according to the companies,business funds were diverted by means of hannon use of business accounts to pay hannon entirely personal expenses hannon withdrawal of funds from business bank accounts for entirely personal use and hannon and his family members use of business debit cards to cover entirely personal expenses.the companies asserted that hannon did not disclose receipt of the majority of those diverted funds on his mors,as required.they charged that hannon diverted approximately from recycling and ware real estate between may and september of,during which period he only identified approximately in disbursements made on his behalf on the mor forms.
on november,the companies moved for partial summary judgment on their claim that,because hannon made a false oath or filed a false account in connection with his bankruptcy proceeding,he should be denied a discharge.a a.hannon,acting pro se opposed the motion but did not deny that the disbursements identified by the companies actually occurred.instead,he contended that virtually all of the identified expenditures were made for business purposes,and not for his personal benefit.and,he argued,some expenditures that appeared to be for his personal benefit were actually made by,or on behalf of,other employees.
hannon proffered defenses 
a hearing was held in the bankruptcy court on the companies motion.the bankruptcy court questioned hannon about the transactions at issue.hannon denied that the identified disbursements were made for his personal benefit,stating that nearly all of them percent of them had a business purpose.the bankruptcy court took the matter under advisement,but offered hannon the opportunity to spell out in detail his defenses to the multiple diversion claims.
hannon then retained new legal counsel,who filed a further brief in opposition to the companies motion for partial summary judgment.hannon retreated from his earlier claim that percent of the disbursements had a business purpose,but included an affidavit in which he declared that many of the disbursements and withdrawals from business accounts actually had a business purpose.he also filed an affidavit by jeffrey dennis,cpa,in which dennis opined that laypersons like hannon,who had a high school education typically lack the necessary training to accurately complete mors.finally,hannon provided the court with an unsworn attachment to his memorandum,in the form of a spreadsheet,detailing his explanations for each of the disbursements challenged by the companies.hannon explanations were divided into three categories those expenditures that hannon believe d were incurred for his benefit,those that he believe d were incurred for legitimate business purposes,and those that he claimed were incurred for both a personal and a business purpose.
hannon conceded that in business disbursements were incurred for his benefit.those transactions included eleven cash withdrawals,which hannon labeled as stipends to joint debtor his wife two paychecks to hannon from recycling in rent payments made to hannon landlord in payments to a boat storage facility in maine retail purchases for groceries,clothing,and entertainment and video game and music purchases made by hannon daughters on a business debit card 
hannon identified of the challenged disbursements as having a business purpose,including substantial cash withdrawals used to make cash payments for scrap metal,expenses related to business travel,and expenses associated with transporting and feeding recycling employees he included within that category costs associated with two of his homes,one in wells,maine,and another in truro,massachusetts.according to hannon,those vacation homes were used for entertaining potential clients,so costs associated with maintaining those homes,as well as monies spent entertaining clients while in residence,qualified as business expenses.disbursements were made to cover costs for utilities,landscaping,local hardware and liquor store purchases,and meals at nearby restaurants.
finally,hannon identified of the questioned disbursements as having both a personal and a business purpose.he included within that final category utility payments related to his wells and truro homes.
hannon had previously given testimony concerning his wells and truro homes at a june,meeting of creditors.in response to questioning by counsel to the united states trustee,hannon said that he and his family used the wells home only occasionally and during the day,and that it needed significant work as a result of major leaks and a dysfunctional heating system to make it rentable.the truro vacation home,he said,was used only once in a while and otherwise remained unoccupied.he did not mention any marketing or other business entertainment uses of either property.
procedural history 
on june,after fully considering the matter,the bankruptcy judge granted summary judgment in favor of the companies and declined to grant hannon a discharge in bankruptcy.a a.the court found,as hannon admitted,that over in payments by recycling or ware real estate were made for hannon personal benefit,and that the majority of those payments were not disclosed on the mors,as required.the bankruptcy court found that hannon affidavit explanations for the claimed business expenditures related to his wells and truro homes were directly contradicted by his earlier testimony at the creditors meeting,and that hannon provided no explanation for the substantive change.accordingly,the bankruptcy court determined that hannon failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the business payments relating to his wells and truro houses were in fact incurred solely for his personal benefit.
the bankruptcy court took note of the extent and frequency of hannon omissions,as well as the fact that hannon had partially disclosed payments made for his benefit by recycling in his may and june mors.from the undisputed facts,the bankruptcy court determined that the only plausible conclusion is that hannon acted with reckless indifference to the truth when filing his mors.the court decided that it was unnecessary to consider the additional disbursements at issue,because hannon admitted sufficient unreported payments made on his behalf to resolve the motion for summary judgment.
hannon appealed to the district court.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order on september.this appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
as recently noted in rok builders,llc sfg venture,llc,in re moultonborough hotel group,llc,a lthough we constitute the second tier of appellate review in this case arising out of a decision by the bankruptcy court in an adversary proceeding,we cede no special deference to the determinations made by the district court and instead assess the bankruptcy court decision directly,cir.quoting city sanitation,llc allied waste servs.of,llc in re am.cartage,cir.our review of the bankruptcy court order granting summary judgment is de novo.desmond varrasso in re varrasso,cir.citations omitted see also daniels agin,cir.
the bankruptcy court entered summary judgment under federal rule of bankruptcy procedure,which expressly incorporates into bankruptcy practice the standards of rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.in re varrasso,at.accordingly,the legal standards traditionally applicable to motions for summary judgment apply without change in bankruptcy proceedings.in re moultonborough hotel,llc,at citations omitted.summary judgment in bankruptcy proceedings,then,should be granted only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the movant has successfully demonstrated an entitlement to judgment as a matter of law.in re varrasso,at.a ll reasonable inferences from the facts must be drawn in the manner most favorable to the nonmovant.id.
iii.discussion 
we begin with a basic principle.under a a,a debtor can be refused his discharge only if he i knowingly and fraudulently made a false oath,ii relating to a material fact.boroff tully in re tully,cir.as the moving parties,the companies must establish that there is no genuine dispute about any material fact,and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law,because hannon made a false statement under oath in the course of his bankruptcy proceeding he did so knowingly and fraudulently and the false statement related to a material fact.perry warner in re warner,cir.as we have previously recognized 
by its very nature,invokes competing considerations.on the one hand,bankruptcy is an essentially equitable remedy.as the supreme court has said,it is an overriding consideration that equitable principles govern the exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction.bank of marin england.in that vein,the statutory right to a discharge should ordinarily be construed liberally in favor of the debtor.matter of vickers,cir.in re leichter,cir,cert.denied,roberts ford son,cir.the reasons for denying a discharge to a bankrupt must be real and substantial,not merely technical and conjectural.dilworth boothe,cir.
on the other hand,the very purpose of certain sections of the law,like a a,is to make certain that those who seek the shelter of the bankruptcy code do not play fast and loose with their assets or with the reality of their affairs.the statutes are designed to insure that complete,truthful,and reliable information is put forward at the outset of the proceedings,so that decisions can be made by the parties in interest based on fact rather than fiction.as we have stated,t he successful functioning of the bankruptcy act hinges both upon the bankrupt veracity and his willingness to make a full disclosure.matter of mascolo,cir.
in re tully,at parallel citations omitted.with these principles in mind,we turn to hannon arguments on appeal.
false oath 
the bankruptcy court,invoking the principle that an unsworn declaration made under penalty of perjury is the equivalent of a verification under oath,determined that,because hannon signed the mors under penalty of perjury,his statements on those forms were made under oath.smith grondin in re grondin,cir.hannon challenges that determination on appeal,arguing that the certification required by mors is not the type of certification covered by,which contemplates a certification as true and correct,and not one based on a subjective understanding.therefore,he argues,his mor certifications were not made under oath,as necessary to support a false oath claim.
hannon concedes that he presents the argument for the first time on appeal.t herefore,we can consider the argument waived.hoover harrington in re hoover,cir.quoting in re,cir.a bsent the most extraordinary circumstances,legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court can not be broached for the first time on appeal.however,even if hannon had presented the argument to the bankruptcy court,it would have likely failed.the verification language used on the mor is nearly identical to the verification language used on debtor bankruptcy schedules other circuit courts that have addressed the point have consistently found the language used on the debtor schedules sufficient to constitute a verification under oath for purposes of a a.see,retz samson in re retz,cir.a false statement or an omission in the debtor bankruptcy schedules or statement of financial affairs can constitute a false oath.quoting khalil developers sur.indem.in re khalil,cir.beaubouef beaubouef matter of beaubouef,cir.false oaths sufficient to justify the denial of discharge include a false statement or omission in the debtor schedules internal quotat
