on october,dean harold westlund the debtor filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy relief.dwight lindquist,the chapter trustee,filed suit against wells fargo home mortgage,under to avoid the transfer of a mortgage from the debtor to wells fargo.the bankruptcy granted summary judgment in favor of the trustee and ordered wells fargo to pay the bankruptcy estate.the district affirmed the bankruptcy court decision,and wells fargo now appeals.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
on may,wells fargo loaned the debtor.in return,the debtor executed a promissory note payable to wells fargo for the principal amount of the loan and granted wells fargo a mortgage on his home in hennepin county,minnesota.on october,the debtor filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy relief,claiming in assets,in unsecured priority claims and in unsecured nonpriority claims.although wells fargo never recorded the mortgage,the debtor erroneously listed wells fargo as a secured creditor.on the date he filed for bankruptcy,the unpaid principal balance on the note was.
soon after the debtor filed his bankruptcy petition,wells fargo sold a bundle of mortgage loans to emc mortgage corporation in this transaction,wells fargo assigned,sold and transferred its rights under the debtor note and mortgage to emc.the bankruptcy court granted the debtor a discharge on march,and closed the case on march.emc recorded the mortgage on or about october.the trustee subsequently learned that wells fargo had not recorded the mortgage before the debtor filed his bankruptcy petition,meaning that wells fargo should have been listed as an unsecured creditor in the petition.at the trustee request,the bankruptcy court reopened the case on january.see b.
on april,the trustee filed a complaint against wells fargo in bankruptcy court,seeking to avoid the debtor grant of the mortgage to wells fargo.the trustee argued that e c deems the transfer of the mortgage to wells fargo to have occurred immediately before the debtor october,bankruptcy filing because wells fargo did not perfect its security interest in the property by recording the mortgage before the debtor filed for bankruptcy.see e a.according to the trustee,the transfer of the mortgage from the debtor to wells fargo should be avoided as a preference under b.as a result,the trustee claimed that wells fargo should pay the value of the mortgage to the debtor bankruptcy estate under a.alternatively,the trustee sought to avoid and recover wells fargo interest in the mortgage under a and a.the trustee moved for summary judgment,and wells fargo filed a for summary judgment.
the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion for summary judgment.it held that the transfer of the mortgage occurred immediately before the debtor october,bankruptcy filing by operation of e c.the court therefore avoided the transfer of the mortgage to wells fargo as a preferential transfer under b and ordered wells fargo to pay the debtor bankruptcy estate.as a result,the bankruptcy court dismissed the trustee a claim as moot.the district court affirmed,and wells fargo now appeals.
ii.discussion 
on appeal from a district court review of a bankruptcy proceeding,we sit as a second court of review,reviewing the bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo and any factual findings for clear error.henning mainstreet bank,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when,viewing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.
wells fargo argues that the bankruptcy court erred in avoiding the transfer under b.in the alternative,wells fargo argues that the bankruptcy court erred in holding that the trustee could recover the value of the mortgage from wells fargo under a and in calculating the value of the mortgage to be.
under the bankruptcy code preference avoidance section,the trustee is permitted to recover,with certain exceptions,transfers of property made by the debtor within days before the date the bankruptcy petition was filed.barnhill johnson,d.this rule is intended to discourage creditors from racing to dismember a debtor sliding into bankruptcy and to promote equality of distribution to creditors in bankruptcy.lindquist dorholt in re dorholt,cir quoting jones truck lines,cent.states,se.sw.areas pension fund in re jones truck lines,cir.
title b requires that in order for a transfer to be subject to avoidance as a preference,there must be a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property,on account of an antecedent debt,to or for the benefit of a creditor,made while the debtor was insolvent,within days prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case,that left the creditor better off than it would have been if the transfer had not been made and the creditor asserted its claim in a chapter liquidation.buckley,in re interior wood prods,cir.the trustee must establish each of these elements by a preponderance of the evidence.stingley alliedsignal,in re libby int l.
as an initial matter,wells fargo argues that the preferential transfer in this case is emc recording of the mortgage,rather than the debtor transfer of the mortgage to wells fargo.the bankruptcy court and the district court,however,rejected this argument and concluded that the debtor grant of the mortgage to wells fargo is the transfer at issue under b.this transfer of the mortgage is deemed to have occurred immediately before the debtor october,bankruptcy filing by operation of e c because wells fargo failed to record the mortgage.see e c a transfer is made immediately before the date of the filing of the bankruptcy petition,if such transfer is not perfected at the later date of i the commencement of the case or ii days after such transfer takes effect between the transferor and the transferee.wells fargo,however,asserts that the district court opinion makes clear that the b preferential transfer inquiry in this case focuses on emc recording of the mortgage.according to wells fargo,the transfer could not have been preferential under b because it occurred after the debtor filed his bankruptcy petition.
in making this argument,wells fargo misrepresents the district court opinion.wells fargo quotes the district court statement that emc was the beneficiary and transferee of the actual later transfer of the mortgage and asserts that the court adopted its view that the transfer at issue is the recording of the mortgage.this quote supports wells fargo position only when taken out of context.in its entirety,the sentence clarifies that the district court is not focusing on emc recording of the mortgage while wells fargo is correct that emc was the beneficiary of and transferee of the actual later transfer of the mortgage,under the statute,the court is addressing a statutorily created transfer from the debtor to wells fargo that occurred in october.emphasis added.at another point in the opinion,after discussing wells fargo transfer argument,the district court stated,the court rejects wells fargo argument,and went on to analyze the transfer of the mortgage from the debtor to wells fargo under b.
we note that the recording of a mortgage can also be considered a transfer of an interest in property,see bergquist fid.mortgage decisions in re alexander,but there can be no doubt in this case that the trustee filed suit under b to avoid the debtor transfer of the mortgage to wells fargo.accordingly,we reject wells fargo argument that emc recording is the subject of the b preferential transfer inquiry and conclude that the relevant preferential transfer in this case is the debtor transfer of the mortgage to wells fargo.we now examine whether the trustee has established that the transfer of the mortgage to wells fargo meets the requirements of a preferential transfer under b.see in re interior wood prods,at.
there is no dispute that the debtor grant of a mortgage to wells fargo was a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property,that the transfer was made while the debtor was insolvent,or that e c deems the transfer of the mortgage to have occurred within days before the date of the filing of the bankrupt
