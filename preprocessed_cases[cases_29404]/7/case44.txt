this case requires us to explore the contours of a bankruptcy trustee lien avoidance and preservation powers under and when a debtor homestead exemption has been invoked.
in,six years before filing a petition for chapter bankruptcy,virginia traverse secured a loan with a mortgage on her home.in the years before her bankruptcy and continuing since filing her petition,traverse has remained current on all mortgage payments on the property.because traverse home is subject to a homestead exemption under massachusetts law,in these circumstances the bankruptcy code would ordinarily allow traverse to pass through bankruptcy in possession of her home.yet because traverse bank failed to record the mortgage with the appropriate registry,the bankruptcy trustee contends that his power to avoid and preserve the mortgage justifies him in selling traverse home as property of the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy judge and bankruptcy appellate panel accepted the trustee view.we reverse.
facts and background 
virginia traverse resides in a home in lynn,massachusetts.she has been the title owner of the property since april,when she recorded her ownership with the essex county south district registry of deeds.on july,traverse executed a mortgage on the home in favor of washington mutual bank to secure a loan of.on september,jp morgan chase acquired this mortgage as part of its blanket acquisition of washington mutual assets.at no point did either mortgagee record the mortgage on traverse home with the registry of deeds.meanwhile,in march of,traverse executed a second mortgage in favor of citibank to secure a loan of,which citibank recorded in due course.traverse has kept current on her mortgage payments to both jp morgan and citibank.
on august,traverse filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code.on her bankruptcy schedules,traverse valued her home at she listed the remaining claim secured by jp morgan mortgage as and the claim secured by citibank mortgage as.finally,pursuant to the massachusetts homestead act,traverse claimed a homestead exemption in the property in the amount of.traverse homestead exemption,which traverse had formally recorded in a declaration of homestead in january,went unchallenged by any interested party.
on december,mark degiacomo,acting as the chapter trustee of traverse bankruptcy estate,filed a complaint to avoid jp morgan unrecorded mortgage and to preserve it for the benefit of the estate.in response,traverse filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment that,even if he preserved the mortgage,degiacomo could sell only the mortgage itself and not her underlying property.traverse argued that because the trustee preservation of jp morgan mortgage gave the estate only the rights of the original mortgagee,it created no right to sell her home until she defaulted on her payments and triggered the right of foreclosure.after degiacomo moved for summary judgment,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in his favor on all counts and the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirmed.both tribunals concluded that,having preserved jp morgan interest in traverse home for the bankruptcy estate,the trustee was entitled to sell the home in order to liquidate that interest.while not disputing that traverse current mortgage payments prevented degiacomo from foreclosing on her home in his capacity as mortgagee,the bankruptcy court and the bap concluded that degiacomo could nevertheless sell the home pursuant to his core powers as a trustee administering a debtor property under the bankruptcy code.
traverse now challenges that conclusion as a matter of law.

on appeal from the bap,we train our analysis on the underlying bankruptcy court decision,reviewing factual findings for clear error and conclusions of law de novo.in re canning,cir.under the de novo standard,we do not defer to the bankruptcy court ruling,but consider the matter anew as though no decision were rendered below.id.at.neither do we cede any deference to the conclusions of the bap.in re hill,cir.
iii.discussion 
under of the bankruptcy code,all of the debtor legal and equitable interests in property at the time of her bankruptcy petition automatically become the property of the bankruptcy estate.a in re barroso herrans,cir when an individual files for bankruptcy,all of his property becomes property of the estate.nevertheless,of the code allows a debtor to exempt certain property,based either on an enumerated list of federal exemptions or on any alternate exemptions provided by her state.see.b in re cunningham,cir in re hildebrandt,cir.among the state exemptions incorporated by is the massachusetts homestead act,which allows a debtor to claim an interest of up to in a home being used by the debtor as her principal residence.in re peirce,see also.laws ch.the debtor declared homestead exemption is insulated from conveyance,sale,or levy to help satisfy the debtor debts in bankruptcy,with the exception of as relevant here a debt secured by a lien on the property,such as a mortgage.laws ch,b in re swift,a debtor homestead exemption is not effective against a mortgagee where the mortgage in question was executed before the debtor recorded a declaration of homestead.the final working of the scheme is that,when a debtor declares a property as her homestead,proceeds realized from the sale of that property must be used first to pay off any secured claims and subsequently to satisfy the debtor claimed exemption before,at last,being turned over to her bankruptcy estate.
a core power of a bankruptcy trustee under b of the code is the right to sell property of the estate for the benefit of a debtor creditors.b the trustee,after notice and a hearing,may use,sell,or lease,other than in the ordinary course of business,property of the estate.because a debtor exempted property interests are effectively removed from the estate,however,see owen owen,does not empower the trustee to sell exempted interests.in re carmichael,w here the debtor interest is exempted,the estate no longer has an interest that it may sell.quoting collier on bankruptcy ed see also in re parker,the trustee abandons property of the estate in a chapter case usually because there is no equity in the property or the property is exempt.nor does a bankruptcy trustee ordinarily sell property solely for the benefit of secured creditors.see in re scimeca,a bankruptcy trustee should not liquidate fully encumbered assets,for such action yields no benefit to unsecured creditors.collier on bankruptcy it is not the proper function of the trustee to liquidate property solely for the benefit of secured creditors.consequently,where a debtor claims a homestead exemption in her home,a trustee will typically sell the home only where its value exceeds both the mortgage liens on the property and the debtor homestead exemption.in re ellerstein,where t he debtors interest is subject to a mortgage and the debtors equity is significantly more than the amount of the homestead exemption the trustee would sell the property in re early,wl,at.june,i f the amount of the debtor exemption was less than the value of the property,a trustee is free to sell the property,so long as she distribute s the proceeds first to the debtor in payment of the debtor claimed exemption.this excess benefit for the unsecured creditors,calculated as the value of the estate minus any secured claims and exemptions,represents the bankruptcy estate remaining equity in the property.in re hyman,cir,aff,cir t he equity available for the estate would be any amount exceeding encumbrances plus the homestead exemption in re mckeever,defining the estate equity as that which would be left for unsecured creditors after payment of secured claims and the debtors homestead exemption.
where,on the other hand,a property fails to yield any remaining equity for the estate beyond the value of its secured encumbrances and the debtor homestead exemption,a trustee generally should not sell the home,but should leave the secured creditors to their own legal means of recovering their claims.see scimeca,at i t is appropriate for a chapter bankruptcy trustee to allow the secured creditors to exercise their right to recover possession of their collateral.this is because,by definition,a secured creditor can protect its own interests in the collateral subject to the security interest.department of justice,executive office for united states trustees,handbook for chapter trustees at.if a debtor defaults on her mortgage payments,the secured creditor options include its contractual right to foreclose on the debtor home.if,however,a debtor continues to satisfy her contractual obligations to the benefit of the creditor,the mortgagee has no grounds to foreclose and the debtor may retain her home through the bankruptcy proceedings.see ellerstein,at if t he debtors home is subject to a mortgage which is not in default and the debtors equity is less than the properly claimed homestead exemption the trustee would abandon the interest and the debtors would retain the home.
traverse homestead exemption leaves no residual equity for her unsecured creditors,and her lack of default on her monthly payments precludes both citibank and jp morgan from foreclosing on her property.there is consequently no dispute that,if traverse mortgages remained with their respective banks,the foregoing analysis would dispose of the case the bankruptcy trustee would have no claim to sell traverse property and traverse would retain possession of her home.indeed,this appears to be the trustee precise position with regard to citibank second mortgage.in the case of jp morgan,however,the trustee notes a further wrinkle neither washington mutual nor jp morgan perfected the first mortgage on traverse home by recording the lien with the registry of deeds.
where a creditor has an unperfected lien on a debtor property,the bankruptcy code empowers a trustee to avoid and preserve the lien for the benefit of the estate.the trustee exercises this power through two provisions.first,the trustee right of avoidance under vests the trustee with the powers of a bona fide purchaser of real property for value,and allows the trustee to invalidate unperfected security interests.in re sullivan,cir.second,his right of preservation under automatically preserves the benefit of the avoided interest for the estate by put ting the estate in the shoes of the creditor whose lien is avoided.in re carvell,cir.together,these provisions benefit the unsecured creditors by allowing the trustee to eliminate unperfected liens on a debtor property and subsequently to apply the value represented by those liens to the general estate,bypassing any junior lienholders.see in re french,cir t he code avoidance provisions protect creditors by preserving the bankruptcy estate against illegitimate depletions.in re nistad.wch,wl,at,the purpose of is to allow a trustee to preserve the avoided interest for the estate so that junior interest holders do not benefit from the avoidance to the detriment of the estate and its creditors.in this case,the trustee exercised his powers to avoid and preserve jp morgan mortgage on traverse home he now argues that,by preserving the mortgage lien,he may sell the property that is subject to the lien in order to realize the value of the mortgage for the bankruptcy estate.
before addressing the trustee argument,it is important to clarify what the trustee does not argue.first,he does not suggest that his preservation of jp morgan mortgage empowers him to sell traverse home in his position as mortgagee.nor could he,since traverse correctly notes that her current payments on her mortgage insulate her property from foreclosure rather,the trustee suggests that,even in the absence of default,his preservation of the mortgage has given the bankruptcy estate an equity interest in the home that triggers his core power of sale as bankruptcy trustee.
second,the trustee does not argue that the preserved mortgage freed up equity in traverse home for the bankruptcy estate by eliminating a secured debt to be satisfied before the home value can begin accruing to unsecured creditors.nor,again,could he do so,because traverse unchallenged exemption of swallows the full value of her home regardless of whether the sale proceeds are first used to satisfy the mortgage claim.rather,the trustee insists that the preserved mortgage itself,as a senior lien on the home,has created equity in the home for the estate.he suggests,in short,that the preserved mortgage has turned some corresponding share of the home value into the property of the estate to be liquidated through sale.
the trouble with the trustee argument is that his preservation of an undefaulted mortgage on traverse home for the benefit of the bankruptcy estate is not with an ownership right over the underlying property.under,the trustee preserves any liens or transfers avoided under by claiming those liens for the benefit of the estate,but he preserves the benefit of only that which has been avoided in this case,the mortgage.when the trustee avoided the lien granted by debtor,the avoided lien and only the avoided lien became property of the estate under a.carmichael,at in re haberman,a bankruptcy trustee who successfully avoids a lien pursuant to and preserves for the bankruptcy estate the value of the avoided lien.preservation gives the bankruptcy estate an exclusive interest in the avoided lien,but it does not give the estate any current ownership interest in the underlying asset.see early,wl,at t he only interest recovered via avoidance is the avoided lien,not an ownership interest in the property.as far as the trustee powers are concerned,avoidance and preservation thus empower the trustee to sell the newly avoided mortgage as property of the estate.but if the underlying property has been exempted and withdrawn from the property of the estate for the purposes of,the preservation of a mortgage does not resurrect the trustee powers over that property itself.see carmichael,at the only property interest which the trustee may sell under b is the estate interest in the unperfected lien in re early,wl,at.may,order amended and supplemented,wl,at t he avoided lien here does not give the trustee a right to sell the debtor interest in the property itself.
the trustee makes much of the supreme court holding in schwab reilly,in which the court held that exemptions claimed under the code remove only a monetary interest in a debtor asset,rather than the asset itself,from the property of the bankruptcy estate.various courts have applied this same principle to homestead exemptions,including that in massachusetts.see peirce,at.laws ch.only protects the owner interest in the home to the extent of the monetary exemption.in re gebhart,cir the homestead exemptions available to the debtors do not permit the exemption of entire properties,but rather specific dollar amounts.the trustee reasons that,if traverse home remains part of the bankruptcy estate despite traverse homestead exemption,he may dispose of it like any other property so long as he repays traverse the value of her exemption from the proceeds.
as a preliminary matter,we note that the rule articulated in schwab does not apply directly to this case.in each of the cases above,the debtor exemption could not prevent the trustee from selling the underlying asset because that asset value surpassed the exemption amount,creating additional equity for the bankruptcy estate.schwab,at peirce,at gebhart,at.by contrast,where a debtor homestead exemption equals or surpasses the total value of her property,the bankruptcy court has construed the massachusetts homestead exemption to protect the debtor physical ownership of as well as her financial rights in her home.peirce,at s o long as the available monetary exemption is greater than or equal to the value of that property,the owner possessory and pecuniary interests are both fully protected.this reading accords with the established policy behind the massachusetts homestead exemption,which favors preservation of the family home regardless of the householder financial condition and inclines courts to construe the exemption liberally in favor of debtors.shamban masidlover,see also hildebrandt,at homestead laws are designed to benefit the homeste
