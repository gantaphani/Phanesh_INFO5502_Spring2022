in the course of these proceedings,it became apparent to the trustee that ronald had more assets than he had disclosed in his petition that he had transferred virtually all of his income and assets to his wife mary through various marital property agreements.and several of his entities,such as the xtant foundation,had received considerable earnings that had not been disclosed in his petition.mary served as a director of xtant,a business that purportedly sold recycled paper.
mary,with the help of her husband,filed a claim for against ronald bankruptcy estate.this claim was filed as a stipulation,signed by ronald and mary,acknowledging that ronald was indeed indebted to mary for her various managerial,charitable and legal services.
the bankruptcy trustee,suspicious of the couple transfers,filed an adversary action against ronald.ultimately,ronald agreed to waive the discharge of doyle judgment and settled the trustee action for.this,in the couple view,put the matter to rest.
the circumstances of the bankruptcy proceeding,however,had not gone unnoticed.a grand jury indicted ronald on counts of bankruptcy fraud and money laundering conspiracies,as well as various substantive fraud and money laundering offenses based on his and mary efforts to conceal his assets from the bankruptcy trustee and his creditors mary was charged on eleven of these counts.ronald and mary each agreed to waive their right to a jury trial.
during the trial,the couple mounted a joint defense,claiming that the transfers of the assets were legitimate and not an effort to hide assets.according to the couple,ronald transferred his interests in most individually and jointly owned assets,as well as assets and income,to mary pursuant to a marital agreement executed on january,and subsequent agreements executed on august,and january.
the district court,in a findings of fact and verdict order,found that ronald had utilized the bankruptcy system in an attempt to discharge the doyle judgment and foil other creditors.the court found that,with the assistance of his wife mary,ronald created and used phony entities,as well as sham marital agreements,to hide his assets and income from the trustee,doyle,and his other creditors,and repeatedly lied during the course of the bankruptcy proceeding.the court found that the couple had deposited funds,which should have been disclosed in the bankruptcy petition,into the bank accounts of the corporations deposited assets into mary personal accounts used the entities,such as xtant,to conceal assets and engaged in other unusual financial moves in an effort to conceal assets.also,the court found that mary inflated ronald liabilities by filing a false claim.
specifically,the court found mary guilty of bankruptcy debtor property illegally and filing a false claim.this finding was based on mary deposit of a check,issued by a thompson consulting to ronald for work previously rendered,into their firm business account titled arthur arthur the purchase of a sea doo,a personal watercraft,for personal use with a xtant check and mary deposit of a check,representing the proceeds of ronald interest in another business,g k investment,into her own bank account.
the money laundering convictions were based on the transfer of ronald assets and the proceeds of the bankruptcy fraud into the bank accounts of the dummy corporations,and mary personal accounts,to hide ronald income.
the district court found ronald guilty of of the counts,and sentenced him to months imprisonment.as part of this sentence,the district court applied several enhancements one enhancement was a offense level increase under b f based on ronald attempt to discharge the doyle judgment.
the court found mary guilty of nine counts of the eleven charged and sentenced her to twelve months and of imprisonment.
