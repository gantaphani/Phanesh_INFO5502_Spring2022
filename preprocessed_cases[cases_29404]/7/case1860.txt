robert and paea olah sued robert baird for malpractice,based on alleged injuries to their daughter.while the state malpractice litigation was still in pretrial stages,baird declared bankruptcy.the olahs asked the trustee of baird bankruptcy estate to sell them baird right to consent to settlement under his medical liability insurance policy.the trustee balked,writing that by the terms of the insurance contract he did not believe that there was any asset which the trustee could assume and assign to the olahs.the olahs filed suit in district court,seeking a declaration that the right to settle was indeed part of the estate.they lost,and now appeal.
we reverse,holding that the liability policy is properly part of the estate.we further hold that the trustee has discretion to exercise baird rights under the policy,or to assign those rights to the olahs.
factual background 
the legal issues in this case are complicated,but the facts are not.in march,robert and paea olah filed a complaint in utah state court against robert baird,alleging that he was negligent in the delivery of their daughter,olena,causing substantial injuries including permanent brain damage at the time the olahs made their claim,baird was insured under a liability policy liability policy issued by the utah medical insurance association umia,with a policy term of january,to january,and a policy limit of million.the policy provided that umia would defend baird and provide insurance protection against medical professional liability claims for damages which are brought against him.under the policy,umia was obligated not to settle any claim against baird without his consent in addition,the policy restricted baird ability to assign the policy to a third party without the consent of the umia.
two years later,in july,baird filed for bankruptcy,causing an automatic stay in the state court malpractice proceedings.he was discharged in bankruptcy in october of that year,and the automatic stay was lifted.prior to the discharge,but after baird filed for bankruptcy,the olahs offered the trustee of baird bankruptcy estate for the estate interest in the liability policy and all powers exercisable under the policy by the debtor or the estate.the attorneys representing baird sent the trustee a letter recommending he reject the offer,arguing,among other things,that baird right to consent to a settlement was.
the trustee,kevin bird,rejected the offer.he wrote in a letter to the olahs attorney that it was his conclusion that any contract rights held by baird under the insurance contract were.as a result,bird reasoned,he was unable to accept the offer.he suggested that if the olahs disagreed with this conclusion they could file for a determination as to the extent of the estate interest in the contract.in the event that the olahs were able to obtain a judgment declaring baird rights under the policy to be assignable,he would certainly be willing to entertain the olahs offer again.
the olahs filed suit in bankruptcy court,seeking a declaration that the liability policy was part of baird estate and that the trustee may administer it pursuant to provisions of the bankruptcy code.baird moved to dismiss,making the argument and adducing public policy considerations against allowing the assignment of rights to consent.umia in its brief contended that the policy could not be assigned without its written consent.umia asserted,as well,that baird policy was most probably an executory contract and,because the trustee had not assumed the contract into the estate within days of baird bankruptcy discharge,rejected it 
in their response,the olahs first disagreed with umia that baird policy was an executory contract they argued that an executory contract exists only when there are ongoing material obligations on both sides,and nonperformance of one party would excuse the of the other.baird,the olahs claimed,had already fulfilled all of his obligations under the policy accordingly,there was no time bar to assigning the asset.they further argued that the provision of the policy was no longer enforceable because the they defined as the injury to their already occurred,and under utah law,provisions are enforceable only prior to the occurrence of loss.in addition,they asserted that public policy reasons did not forbid the assignment of baird policy rights to them.
the bankruptcy court ruled against the olahs.the court saw the case as turning on whether or not the policy was an executory contract.if the contract was executory,then the trustee would have had sixty days to decide whether to accept or reject the contract.because the trustee did not act,the contract must be deemed to have been rejected.in reaching this conclusion,the bankruptcy court first discussed a decision by the united states district court for the district of utah,which adopted the definition of an executory contract developed by professor vern countryman in.vern countryman,executory contracts in bankruptcy part.the countryman definition looks to whether 
the obligation of both the bankrupt and the other party are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach excusing performance of the other.
bkrptcy quoting thomas american stone,white.but the court also noted that a tenth circuit decision had held that an executory contract is a contract that has not as yet been fully completed or performed and in which future obligations remain.bkrptcy citing in re myers,cir.the court thought the tenth circuit definition might be broader than the countryman test,because it seemed that the tenth circuit definition might find a contract executory if any obligations were remaining.because the bankruptcy court found that not all of the obligations owing under the policy had been fully performed,the contract was executory.because the contract was executory,and the trustee of the estate did not timely assume the policy,the bankruptcy court ruled that it was not the property of the estate.bkrptcy.
the olahs appealed to federal district court,urging that a contract is executory only when the obligations on both sides are material or complex.they contended that baird obligations remaining on the policy were neither material nor complex in the alternative,they asked for a remand to the bankruptcy court for a determination of whether the remaining obligations were either material or complex.in its brief,umia countered that the remaining obligations of both baird and umia were significant.baird contended that under the tenth circuit decision in myers,if there are future material obligations due by both sides under a contract,then the contract is an executory contract.he then proceeded to list the remaining obligations baird and umia had under the insurance contract.
the district court affirmed the judgment of the bankruptcy court and adopted its reasoning.the olahs now appeal to this court.
ii.defining an executory contract 
the appellants argue that this case hinges on the correct definition of executory contract under d.section d specifies that if the trustee of an estate in bankruptcy does not assume an executory contract within sixty days of the order of relief,then that contract is deemed rejected.accordingly,if we determine that baird policy was an executory contract,then the contract was rejected.we agree that this is a key issue in the case.
the first step is to determine the proper definition of executory contract,something that was the subject of much back and forth in the prior proceedings.the bankruptcy court saw a tension between the two definitions offered in the cases it discussed.countryman to count only the remaining material obligations of both parties in determining whether a contract is executory.thomas american stone building,at.the myers definition,at least on the bankruptcy court interpretation of it,holds that if there are any remaining obligations on both sides then the contract is executory.in re myers,at.
we do not agree with this interpretation of myers.to be sure,myers stated that a n executory contract is a contract that has not as yet been fully completed or performed and in which future
