we must decide whether and to what extent debtors must pay federal income tax on the gain from the sale of their farm during bankruptcy proceedings.
lynwood and brenda hall filed a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code,which governs family farmer bankruptcies,in august.shortly thereafter,the halls moved to sell their farm for,which the bankruptcy court approved.
in december,the halls proposed a plan of reorganization,under which they sought to pay off their outstanding liabilities using the proceeds from the sale.the internal revenue service irs objected to the proposed plan,asserting a federal income tax of on the capital gain from the sale.the halls then amended their proposed plan to treat the tax as an unsecured claim to be paid to the extent funds are available,with the balance discharged.the irs again objected.
the bankruptcy court sustained the irs objection.in re hall.the district court reversed.hall united states in re hall.the united states timely appealed.
the united states contends that the district court erred by reversing the bankruptcy court decision to sustain the irs objection,asserting that the tax on the gain from the sale of a farm during bankruptcy is not dischargeable.
we begin,as always,with the text of the applicable statute.chapter of the bankruptcy code,allows family farmers and fishermen to reorganize their business affairs while keeping creditors at bay.but the benefits of this arrangement come with responsibilities.in chapter bankruptcy cases,the debtor must file a plan of reorganization,id,and the contents of that plan are prescribed in section a.in particular,section a a states 
the plan shall 
provide for the full payment,in deferred cash payments,of all claims entitled to priority under section unless 
a the claim is a claim owed to a governmental unit that arises as a result of the sale,transfer,exchange,or other disposition of any farm asset used in the debtor farming operation,in which case the claim shall be treated as an unsecured claim that is not entitled to priority under section,but the debt shall be treated in such manner only if the debtor receives a discharge 
thus debtors may well treat certain claims owed to a governmental unit arising from the sale of farm realty as payable in less than full,and dischargeable.
but,by its terms,subsection a applies only to claims entitled to priority under section of the bankruptcy code.section,in turn,lists numerous categories of claims that receive special treatment in bankruptcy.id.a.two of the categories include taxes.the first such category,section a,includes various taxes incurred on or before the date of the filing of the petition,prepetition,id.a a involving prepetition income taxes indeed,there is no dispute that section a a allows chapter debtors to treat taxes incurred by selling farm assets before the filing of a bankruptcy petition as payable in less than full and dischargeable a tax incurred prepetition is a claim entitled to priority under section by way of section a.here,by contrast,the tax was incurred after the filing of the petition.
the second category that includes taxes,section a,consists of administrative expenses allowed under section b.id.a.this provision arguably includes the tax on the gain from the sale of the farm because section b,which is by section a,allows for administrative expenses including any tax incurred by the estate.id.b b i emphasis added.
which,of course,raises the question whether the tax on the sale of the farm at issue in this case was incurred by the estate.we are satisfied that the answer is no.the internal revenue code provides that a chapter estate can not incur taxes.title states that no separate taxable entity shall result from the commencement of a case under title of the united states code the bankruptcy title e xcept in any case to which section applies.section applies only to any case under chapter relating to liquidations or chapter relation to reorganizations of title of the united states code in which the debtor is an individual.it follows that a chapter estate is not a taxable entity.
since the chapter estate is not a taxable entity,the chapter estate can not incur a tax.we agree with those courts that have reached the same conclusion for the same reason with respect to chapter estates,which are treated identically to chapter estates by sections and.in re whall,in re brown,wl,in re gyulafia.because a chapter estate can not incur a tax,it can not get the benefit of section a a,which provides that the tax on the gain from the sale of a farm during bankruptcy is dischargeable and payable in less than full.
we recognize that our conclusion that the chapter estate can not incur a tax necessarily implies that the debtor is responsible for any taxes incurred after the bankruptcy petition is filed in a chapter case because the chapter trustee,the only other potentially responsible party,is not liable for the tax.section provides that in chapter and individual chapter cases,where there can be taxable income of the estate,any tax shall be paid by the trustee.c.the omission of any provision in the requiring the trustee to pay taxes in cases to which section does not apply,such as chapter cases,implies that the trustee does not pay taxes in such cases.in re lindsey,it is clear that,pursuant to and,the standing chapter trustee neither files a return nor pays federal income tax.that makes sense since the chapter estate is not a taxable entity and thus there can not be taxable income of the estate,c,and the debtor remains in possession in chapter bankruptcy absent extraordinary circumstances,the trustee is not associated with any taxes.see holywell smith,shifting tax burden to trustee in corporate chapter case because chapter bankruptcy created a separate entity overseen by the trustee 
the halls primarily rely on knudsen irs,cir,in which chapter debtors proposed a plan to sell farmland and farm equipment to fund their reorganization.like the case before us,the plan treated the income taxes arising from these postpetition sales as unsecured claims under section a a and thus dischargeable.id.at.the irs objected there as well.id.but the eighth circuit ruled for the debtors,holding that a a applies to the postpetition sale of farm assets,so that the taxes arising from such sale could be treated as unsecured claims and dischargeable.id.at emphasis added.in its view,the taxes arising from the postpetition sale met the requirement in section a a that they be a claim entitled to priority under section.id.at.specifically,the court held that the taxes fell under section a as administrative expenses because they satisfied the relevant definition of administrative expenses in section b tax incurred by the estate which means merely tax incurred postpetition.id.at.the court expressly declined to give weight to internal revenue code sections and when interpreting the phrase tax incurred by the estate,and took comfort in the fact that the bankruptcy code did not indicate that a chapter estate could not incur taxes.id.at we are not persuaded.
the halls first argue,relying on the cases collected by knudsen,at,that incurred by the estate in section b means incurred postpetition.in their view,it does not matter whether the estate can incur a tax because the key is when the tax was incurred.
it is true that the cases the halls and knudsen cite state that all taxes incurred by the estate are incurred postpetition.they must because an estate does not exist until after a bankruptcy petition is filed,any taxes an estate incurs are necessarily incurred postpetition.but just because all apples are fruits does not mean all fruits are apples.likewise,although all taxes incurred by the estate are incurred,not all taxes incurred postpetition are incurred by the estate.the cases the halls and knudsen cite simply do not support the halls view,as a close reading of the language in the cases indicates.see.state dep t of tax revenue irs in re columbia gas transmission,cir the priority for taxes incurred by the estate extends only to taxes incurred postpetition.emphasis added in re ne.ohio hosp.ass n,taxes incurred by the estate are adminis
