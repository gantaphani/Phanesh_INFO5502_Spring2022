opinion of the court 
lazy days center,and ldrv holding collectively,the reorganized debtors appeal an order of the united states district court for the district of delaware that vacated an order of the united states bankruptcy court.according to the district court,the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the motion to reopen filed by the reorganized debtors.because we disagree with the district court conclusion that the bankruptcy court issued an advisory opinion,we will reverse the judgment of the district court.
appellee i land holding limited owns a parcel of land in florida.in july,i leased that land to lazy days pursuant to a written lease lease that gave lazy days an option to purchase the property subject to certain conditions not relevant here.the lease also prohibited lazy days from assign ing or transfer ring its interest in the lease without the prior written consent of i,except to related entities under certain circumstances.app.beginning in,lazy days failed to pay rent as it came due and informed i of its intention to file for chapter bankruptcy and assign the lease to ldrv.
prior to filing a petition under chapter,lazy days negotiated with i and reached a settlement agreement in october the settlement agreement,pursuant to which i consented to lazy days assignment of the lease to ldrv.as part of the settlement agreement,lazy days agreed not to argue against the bankruptcy court abstaining from consideration of lease interpretation issues except to the extent necessary in connection with the assumption and assignment of the lease as contemplated herein.app.the settlement agreement also provided that there is no intent to,nor is the lease modified in any respect and the lease and all terms and conditions thereof remain in full force and effect.app.it did not explicitly state whether the purchase option would survive,however.
in november,lazy days filed a chapter petition.the bankruptcy court confirmed a reorganization plan incorporating the settlement agreement in december and closed the case in march.thereafter,the lease was assigned to ldrv.
on may,ldrv attempted to exercise the purchase option,but i refused to honor it.on june and june,the parties each filed lawsuits in florida state court seeking a determination of their respective rights under the lease.also on june,the reorganized debtors filed an emergency motion to reopen in the bankruptcy court,seeking a ruling that the lease provision was unenforceable pursuant to f,which renders unenforceable any provision in an unexpired lease of the debtor that terminates or modifies a right under such lease on account of an assignment of the lease.nine days later,after allowing i to file an opposition and holding a hearing,the bankruptcy court held that the provision was unenforceable and that i refusal to honor the purchase option violated the settlement agreement.the bankruptcy court then ordered i to honor the option.
i appealed to the district court,which vacated the bankruptcy court order,holding that the bankruptcy court judgment was an advisory opinion directed at the florida state courts.the reorganized debtors now appeal.
the reorganized debtors invoked the bankruptcy court jurisdiction under b.the district court had jurisdiction over the appeal of the bankruptcy court decision under a,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to d and.in reviewing the bankruptcy court proceedings,we apply the same standard as the district court.accordingly,we review the bankruptcy court legal determinations de novo,its findings of historical fact for clear error,and its decision to reopen for abuse of discretion.see in re zinchiak,cir.
we first consider whether the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to reopen the proceedings.the district court held that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction because the bankruptcy court issued an advisory opinion.in addition to the district court holding,i offers alternative grounds for affirmance.in i view,the bankruptcy court lacked statutory subject matter jurisdiction and constitutional authority to reopen the case and it was required to abstain under c.we will address these three arguments seriatim.
federal courts have no jurisdiction to render advisory opinions.put another way,they may not decide questions that can not affect the rights of litigants in the case before them or give opinions advising what the law would be upon a hypothetical state of facts.chafin chafin,citation,internal quotation marks,and alteration omitted.in this case,the bankruptcy court issued a decree,declaring the clause invalid and ordering i to honor the purchase option.because this decree actually invalidated the clause and ordered the parties to do something,it affect ed the rights of litigants,and was not an advisory opinion.see in re mcdonald,cir bankruptcy court opinion was not advisory when it resolved the litigation.
relying on the opinion of a panel of this court in in re martin aquarium,app x cir,i argues that the bankruptcy court issued an advisory opinion because the reorganized debtors sought the bankruptcy court judgment in order to influence the state proceedings.apart from the fact that it has no precedential value,martin aquarium is easily distinguishable from this case.there,the bankruptcy court issued a judgment that was entered in the pennsylvania state courts.id.at.one party filed motions to stay execution claiming that the judgments were fraudulently entered.id.while those motions were pending in state court,the other party moved to reopen in the bankruptcy court for the purpose of seeking confirmation of the judgment.id.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.the bankruptcy court acknowledged that the underlying dispute centers around the interpretation of pennsylvania law,not federal bankruptcy law,yet agreed to reopen for the limited purpose of ruling that its earlier order was a judgment within the meaning of federal rule of civil procedure a.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the bankruptcy court opinion that its earlier judgment was a judgment under the federal rules of civil procedure did nothing to resolve whether the pennsylvania courts would be required to abide by it under pennsylvania procedural rules.thus,the opinion had no legal effect it was merely advisory.
unlike in martin aquarium,here the bankruptcy court order had the legal effect of voiding the clause.thus,its opinion was not advisory,regardless of whether the reorganized debtors sought to impact the state proceedings.see matter of shondel,cir bankruptcy court decision modifying its previous injunction to allow a wrongful death claimant to proceed in state court against a bankrupt estate gave actual relief and was therefore not advisory travelers indem.bailey,bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to enjoin direct actions pending in state courts when those actions violated its order.accordingly,even were we inclined to follow martin aquarium in this appeal,it would be unavailing to i.
having determined that the bankruptcy court did not issue an advisory opinion,we next address i contention that the bankruptcy court lacked statutory subject matter jurisdiction over the motion to reopen.
as a preliminary matter,we note that the question of whether the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to confirm the reorganization plan that included the settlement agreement in the first place is not before us,as no party challenged the bankruptcy court jurisdiction over that proceeding.see travelers,at,once the initial orders became final on direct review whether or not proper exercises of bankruptcy court jurisdiction and power,they became res judicata to the parties and even jurisdiction may not be attacked collaterally.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.thus,the only question left is whether the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to enter the order that is the subject of this appeal.see id.at.
under b,a bankruptcy court may reopen a closed case to administer assets,to accord relief to the debtor,or for other cause.we have interpreted b to give bankruptcy courts broad discretion to reopen cases after an estate has been administered.zinchiak,at.in exercising its discret
