this appeal arises out of a creditor quest to block a debtor discharge in bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court declined to default or sanction the debtor for claiming her fifth amendment privilege against,determined that she had not transgressed the strictures of a,and granted the discharge.the district court affirmed these rulings,and the creditor now appeals.
we agree with the creditor that there are suspicious circumstances here.as an appellate court,however,we are not free to the management of pretrial discovery,weigh the evidence afresh,or make independent judgments about the credibility of witnesses.instead,our function is to examine the record with care,defer to the properly supported factual findings of the court of first instance,determine the applicable law,and ensure that the trier properly applied it to the facts as found.having performed these tasks,we conclude,as did the district court,that the decision of the bankruptcy court is impervious to the creditor attack.consequently,we affirm the judgment below.
background 
the underlying bankruptcy proceeding has been pending since.we do not here attempt to rehearse the entire history of the case,but,rather,offer a synopsis of the facts designed to give needed context to the issues on appeal.
joan carp the debtor and her husband,stephen carp,filed a joint petition for chapter bankruptcy relief in february.see.among the affected creditors was the appellant,richard gannett.gannett filed a timely proof of claim for,plus interest and costs,arising out of the rendition of legal services.
several months later,gannett commenced an adversary proceeding,objecting to the carps proposed discharge in bankruptcy.he relied on a and,arguing that the carps had willfully failed to disclose their ownership interests in a number of assets,including a parcel of real property located at dedham street,newton,massachusetts the newton property and three automobiles.with regard to the newton property gannett asserted that the carps owned an equitable interest in it even though legal title reposed in one mordechay pupkin.gannett further asserted that the carps were using pupkin as a straw in order to defraud creditors that they had funded pupkin mortgage payments and that any semblance of rental payments was a sham.with respect to the cars,gannett alleged that the carps had attempted to defraud their creditors by giving their children legal title to the automobiles.he argued that it was absurd to think that the children owned three vehicles while the parents themselves owned none.the carps denied the material allegations of gannett complaint.
to say that matters did not proceed smoothly would be a gross understatement.gannett served deposition notices and interrogatories in october and added a request for production of documents in january of the following year.on february,he moved to compel,pointing out that the carps had not replied to these discovery requests.the bankruptcy court granted the motion.when the carps still did not cooperate,gannett moved for the entry of a default judgment.the carps responded that they would not submit to discovery because they were the targets of a criminal investigation for bankruptcy fraud being conducted by the united states department of justice.
on may,the bankruptcy court again ordered the carps to provide discovery.the court also imposed a monetary sanction and continued gannett motion for entry of a default judgment.on august,the bankruptcy court denied that motion.
meanwhile,the criminal investigation went forward.on october,the government filed a criminal information against stephen carp,charging him with one count of bankruptcy fraud,related to his alleged failure to disclose an equitable ownership interest in the newton property.on april,stephen carp pled guilty to this charge.the district court sentenced him the next day 
the bankruptcy court had wisely continued the case until the outcome of the criminal prosecution was finally determined.in the interim,the court maintained careful watch,holding no fewer than five status conferences from the fall of through the spring of.from time to time,gannett mentioned that he was still awaiting discovery materials but no action was taken.at a status conference held on april,gannett again raised the issue,and the debtor acknowledged that she had not yet complied with the discovery orders because of her asserted fifth amendment privilege.the court stated that there was no point in attempting to press forward with discovery if the debtor was going to plead the fifth amendment and directed the parties to file a joint status report following stephen carp sentencing.
once the criminal prosecution had ended and the adversary proceeding against stephen carp had been resolved,see supra note,the bankruptcy court set a trial date for the adversary proceeding against the debtor.prior to the scheduled start of trial,the trustee in bankruptcy moved to consolidate that proceeding with an adversary proceeding that he the trustee had brought against pupkin.the court consolidated the two actions and vacated the scheduled trial date.the trustee eventually settled with pupkin,thus undoing the consolidation.
the next bump in this long and winding road occurred in april of when the bankruptcy court scheduled an evidentiary hearing on the debtor discharge for october of that year.gannett dawdled for several months and then,on august,filed a renewed motion for entry of a default judgment or,in the alternative,for additional time to conduct discovery.at a hearing held on september,the court denied both prayers on condition that the debtor submit to a deposition prior to trial and produce the previously requested documents before the deposition.the debtor delivered the designated documents and appeared for a deposition on october.although she did not assert her fifth amendment privilege,she nonetheless refused to answer certain questions pursuant to her counsel instructions.
gannett made no further complaint about inadequate or untimely discovery,and the bankruptcy court conducted the previously scheduled bench trial on october.the debtor testified without asserting any privilege against.in an ore tenus decision,the bankruptcy court found the debtor credible and concluded that there was insufficient proof that she had either knowingly concealed property or vouchsafed a false oath.discerning no basis for the denial of a discharge,the court entered judgment accordingly.the district court affirmed,see gannett carp in re carp,unpublished,and this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction under d.

notwithstanding the fact that we are the reviewers,we cede no special deference to the district court determinations.brandt repco printers lithographics,in re healthco int l,cir.rather,our review directly addresses the bankruptcy court decision.gronan watman in re watman,cir.we scrutinize that court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.id.
the application of the bankruptcy code to a particular case poses a mixed question of law and fact,which this court reviews for clear error unless the bankruptcy court analysis was based on a mistaken view of the legal principles involved.see miller peterson in re indep.eng g,cir.under the clear error standard,the trier findings of fact and the conclusions drawn therefrom ought not to be set aside unless,on the whole of the record,we form a strong,unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.cumpiano banco santander,cir.it follows that if the bankruptcy court findings are supportable on any reasonable view of the record,we are bound to uphold them.see boroff tully in re tully,cir see also anderson beatrice foods,cir warning that appellate review of issues can not be allowed to descend to the level of quarterbacking.
the merits 
although gannett asseverations are not neatly segregated,we distill them into two principal lines of argument.first,he challenges the bankruptcy court decision to allow the debtor to testify without penalty after repeatedly having invoked the fifth amendment to insulate herself from furnishing he couples this challenge with a more general objection to the court oversight of the discovery process.second,he calumnizes the bankruptcy court for its refusal to block the debtor discharge under a.we discuss these two lines of argument sequentially.
the fifth amendment 
we turn first to those contentions related to the debtor invocation of the fifth amendment.we review a bankruptcy court discovery decisions for abuse of that discretion is very wide.brandt wand partners,cir.the fact that the fifth amendment is implicated in gannett litany of complaints does not serve to alter this standard of review.see cartagena,cir see also serafino hasbro,cir.unless we can fairly say that the bankruptcy court abused this wide discretion,its management of the pretrial discovery process must be respected.
as a matter of law,gannett claim that the bankruptcy court should not have allowed the debtor to testify without sanction lacks force.gannett does not could a debtor in a bankruptcy proceeding can invoke the fifth amendment.see,mccormick banc one leasing in re mccormick,cir belford in re,cir.he does not could he on this the debtor invocation of the privilege was chimerical or otherwise improper.rather,gannett thesis is that pleading the fifth amendment in a civil proceeding should yield consequences,and that the condign consequence of the debtor action should have been preclusion.in other words,the bankruptcy court ought not to have allowed the debtor to testify because she did not provide discovery until the eve of trial.
the short answer to this importuning is that gannett did not preserve the issue for appeal.after the documents were finally tendered and the deposition held,gannett never complained to the bankruptcy court that the discovery was either too scanty or too tardy.by the same token,he did not question the propriety of the objections interposed by the debtor counsel during the deposition.to cap matters,far from asserting that the debtor testimony should be precluded by her longstanding invocation of the fifth amendment,he himself called the debtor to the witness stand.if delayed discovery,once received,is incomplete,inadequate,or timed so as to impede effective trial preparation,the aggrieved party must object in advance of trial.the failure to do so constitutes a failure to raise the issue at the proper time and in the proper setting.that failure bars the aggrieved party from raising the issue on appeal.see hemingway,kahn in re hemingway,cir laroche amoskeag bank in re laroche,cir.
to be sure,gannett did assert at the september hearing that the debtor should not be permitted to testify at trial because she had persistently invoked the fifth amendment.in response to that assertion,the bankruptcy court ordered that the debtor produce documents and submit to an immediate deposition.if this was not a satisfactory ameliorative,gannett was obliged to renew his complaint following the receipt of the documents and the taking of the deposition.desrosiers moran,cir stating that when a party proceeds with trial without complaining about delayed discovery,the court will not permit that party to complain after judgment.he did not do so.
gannett fallback position is that the bankruptcy court erred by refusing to enter a default judgment against the debtor.in the last analysis,however,the decision as to whether discovery sanctions are warranted and the choice of what sanctions should be imposed are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court poulin greer,cir.the disallowance of a would have been the effective result of a default judgment in this strong medicine.there is no basis either in the record or in the law for us to the bankruptcy court discretionary refusal to prescribe so harsh a penalty.
in a modest variation on this theme,gannett suggests that the bankruptcy court at least should have drawn a negative inference against the debtor due to her repeated invocation of the fifth amendment privilege.but in a civil proceeding,the drawing of a negative inference is a permissible,but not an ineluctable,concomitant of a party invocation of the fifth amendment.see ponte,cir.while the law does not forbid adverse inferences against civil litigants who refuse to testify on fifth amendment grounds,see baxter palmigiano,d,it does not mandate such inferences.when all is said and done,the trial court has discretion over whether a negative inference is an appropriate response to the invocation of the fifth amendment in a particular civil case.
the bankruptcy court,in the exercise of this discretion,chose not to draw such an inference here.the record evinces no special factors suggesting that this choice was arbitrary or capricious,and we are hesitant to overturn a trial court discretionary decision to afford an extra measure of protection to a litigant constitutional right against.serafino,at emphasizing that courts must take special pains to ensure that the fifth amendment privilege is safeguarded.there was no error 
we give short shrift to gannett final point that the bankruptcy court failed to balance gannett right to a fair trial against the debtor fifth amendment interests.once again,the specter of a procedural default looms.although gannett did object generally to the bankruptcy court management of the discovery process,he never specifically asserted an infringement of his right to a fair trial.more importantly,he did not make any claim regarding the unfairness of proceeding after he had secured discovery.thus,the bankruptcy court had neither the occasion nor the opportunity to decide whether the discovery that gannett belatedly received was sufficient to cure any prior harm.if that,the document production and not rectified the situation and restored the balance,gannett had an affirmative obligation to come forward and request further relief from the court.see macaulay anas,cir holding that a party who has the opportunity to ask the trial court for relief but fails to do so forfeits the right to claim,on appeal,that the relief should have been granted anderson,at similar.
even were we to reach the merits of this claim,gannett cause would not prosper.he relies chiefly upon our serafino decision to undergird the argument that the bankruptcy court failed adequately to consider his right to a fair trial.but that decision simply can not support the weight that gannett places upon it.
it is true that serafino stands for the proposition that one party assertion of his constitutional right should not obliterate another party right to a fair proceeding.at.it is also true,however,that the balancing of these factors is left largely to the informed discretion of the trial court.see id.the court need not make an elaborate series of written findings.united states de la cruz,cir holding that explicit findings as to the probative effect balance under evidence rule are not always required.what counts is that the court implicit gannett would receive a fair trial notwithstanding the delayed satisfactorily anchored in the record.after all,the bankruptcy court made significant efforts to ensure that gannett could gain access,prior to trial,to the information necessary to prosecute his case.moreover,gannett never identified what information he coveted that was not available from other sources.under these circumstances,we are at a loss to see how gannett rights were unfairly impugned.
gannett next contends that the bankruptcy court erred on the merits in granting the debtor a discharge.as the objecting party,gannett had the burden of proving that the debtor should be denied a discharge.see commerce bank trust burgess in re burgess,cir,abrogated on other grounds by field mans,d.although the ultimate decision about whether to grant or withhold a discharge is a mixed question of law and fact,gannett takes dead aim at the district court factual findings.accordingly,we review only for clear error,with due regard to the opportunity of the bankruptcy court to judge the credibility of witnesses.in re burgess,at quoting fed.alteration in original.
gannett identifies two statutory bases for denying a discharge in this case.we treat these in the ensemble.in doing so,we note that one of the bankruptcy code core purposes is to give worthy
