this appeal arises out of an action brought by bankruptcy trustee diane mann trustee,seeking avoidance of the transfer of a parcel of real property from a debtor in bankruptcy,william bender,to the defendant,congrejo investments,llc congrejo,a washington limited liability company formed and managed by bender.congrejo appeals from a portion of the decision by the bankruptcy appellate panel of the ninth circuit bap,in which the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court determination that the doctrine of equitable tolling applied to the trustee filing of this adversary proceeding.the trustee from a different portion of the bap order in which it vacated the bankruptcy court summary judgment in favor of the trustee and remanded to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.because we hold that the bap decision was not final under d,we therefore lack jurisdiction to hear this appeal and remand the case to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings.
sometime before,bender became the owner of a plot of land in hawaii.in,bender executed a quitclaim deed that purported to convey title to this land to an entity named the william bender trust trust.there is very little evidence regarding the nature of the trust or its operations,aside from bender assertion that the beneficiaries of the trust are himself,his brother,and his sister.the trust provided no consideration to bender in exchange for the hawaii property.the property was mortgaged,developed,and divided into three parcels,lots,and.lots and were sold and are not involved in this appeal.
in,bender filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code.in,the case was converted to a chapter proceeding,and later,in,to a chapter proceeding.mann was appointed as the chapter trustee of the bankruptcy estate.
in february,while bender bankruptcy petition was pending,the trust executed a quitclaim deed purporting to convey title to lot back to bender.again,no consideration was exchanged for the conveyance.bender never disclosed an interest in lot in any of his bankruptcy schedules or statements,either before or after the february transfer of the property from the trust to bender.bender bankruptcy schedule b contained a reference to a trust,but did not assign a value.bender schedules did not list the holder of a mortgage on the property as a creditor.
on may,in exchange for no consideration and without the approval of the bankruptcy court,bender recorded a quitclaim deed purporting to convey title to lot to congrejo,a company he managed.congrejo members are bender,his brother,and his same three individuals who,bender has claimed,are the beneficiaries of the trust.on june,the trustee filed an adversary complaint against congrejo seeking to avoid the transfer of lot from bender to congrejo pursuant to,which authorizes a trustee to avoid a transfer of estate property occurring after commencement of the bankruptcy action and without authorization by the court.a,a b.
the trustee moved for summary judgment against congrejo.in a for summary judgment,congrejo argued that the trustee action was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in d,because it was not filed within two years of the deed execution.see id.d.congrejo also argued that the transfer could not be avoided because lot was not property of the bankruptcy estate.congrejo asserted that a bankruptcy estate is generally comprised of all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case,id.a emphasis added,and property acquired by the debtor after the date of filing belonged to the debtor.see smith kennedy in re smith,cir.thus,congrejo urged,lot was not part of the bankruptcy estate because bender did not own it at the time he filed his bankruptcy petition.rather,at the time of filing,lot was owned by the trust and bender of title to the property occurred.
the bankruptcy court agreed with congrejo that the trustee action had been filed outside of the statute of limitations,but held that there were disputes of material fact relating to the application of the doctrine of equitable tolling.after conducting an evidentiary hearing on that issue,the bankruptcy court concluded that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled.turning to the trustee assertion that lot was property of the estate,the bankruptcy court,relying on rau ryerson in re ryerson,cir,held that lot was so sufficiently rooted in bender past that it should not be excluded from property of the bankruptcy estate.thus,the bankruptcy court concluded,lot was property of the estate and the trustee could avoid the transfer of that property from bender to congrejo.
congrejo appealed to the bap,seeking review of the bankruptcy court conclusion that the statute of limitations was tolled and that lot was property of the estate.the bap affirmed the bankruptcy court holding that equitable tolling was appropriate.on the second issue,whether lot was estate property,the bap held that the bankruptcy court had incorrectly applied in re ryerson,and vacated that portion of the bankruptcy court order.the bap determined that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the trust was valid or a sham.if the trust was the alter ego of bender,then lot would have been the property of bender at all relevant times prior to the transfer and therefore the property of the bankruptcy estate.accordingly,the bap remanded the case to the bankruptcy court for trial regarding these issues.
congrejo appeals from the bap decision to our court,arguing that the bap erred in affirming the bankruptcy court application of equitable tolling.the trustee from the bap decision to vacate the bankruptcy court summary judgment in her favor.the trustee also maintains that our court lacks jurisdiction to hear this appeal because the bap decision does not constitute a final,appealable order.we now turn to that jurisdictional question.
under d,circuit courts have jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees entered by a bap.the question here is whether the bap order was final.d.
in the context of other appeals,such as those pursuant to,finality is a relatively straightforward inquiry we ask whether the decision presented for review ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the district court to do but execute the judgment.firestone tire rubber risjord,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.in the past,however,we have taken a more flexible approach to jurisdiction in the context of bankruptcy appeals pursuant to section d,because t he unique nature of bankruptcy procedure dictates that we take a pragmatic approach to finality and use a more liberal finality standard for section d than for section.bonner mall bancorp mortgage in re bonner mall,cir.
in connecticut national bank germain germain,the supreme court cast doubt on our application of a flexible standard to section d,by reasoning that sections d and were coextensive in their application to district courts acting as bankruptcy appellate courts,d.if our appellate jurisdiction pursuant to sections d and is functionally coextensive,then,t o afford the same jurisdiction,both statutes would have to have the same finality standards in bankruptcy proceedings.vylene,naugles,in re vylene,cir vylene citation omitted see also saxman educ.credit mgmt.in re saxman,cir wallace,dissenting observing that germain invalidates cases that treat finality under section d differently than finality under section.but see in re bonner mall,at stating in dicta that nothing in germain casts doubt upon the liberal standard for finality we have adopted regarding section d.no case has concluded,however,that our earlier precedent must be overturned.vylene avoided the challenge presented by germain to our circuit case law by holding that jurisdiction was lacking even under the older,more flexible finality standard.vylene,at.similarly,in stanley crossland,crossland,chambers,macarthur lastreto in re lakeshore village resort,lakeshore,our court stated that,germain implies that a decision appealable under section d also should be appealable under traditional applications of section in nonban
