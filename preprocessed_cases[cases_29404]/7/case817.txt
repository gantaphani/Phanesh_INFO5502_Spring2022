this factually complex bankruptcy case asks us to determine whether a debtor is entitled to exempt from claims of creditors approximately acres of rural property upon which he lives and operates a mobile home park,by claiming it as his rural homestead.
background 
in,robert perry,and his wife estella purchased an approximately tract of land six miles outside of del rio,texas.the perrys operate a mobile home and rv park on the property,and have lived behind the park office and convenience store on a acre plot within the tract ever since they subsequently purchased an approximately tract of land that directly adjoins the tract.the tract contains a sewage treatment plant and recreation facilities,all used in conjunction with the park.
in october,perry incorporated his business as american campgrounds,the corporation.on december,in exchange for all of the stock in the corporation perry executed a general warranty deed recorded in the val verde county deed records conveying the tract to the corporation.the corporation,with perry as president,then applied for a loan from the bank and trust,the bank,formerly del rio bank and trust.the loan was approved and secured by a lien on the tract.proceeds from the loan were used,in part,to pay off a unsecured line of credit that perry had previously received from the bank in his individual capacity in,perry,in his capacity as the corporation president,signed an agreement with the bank reaffirming the loan.
on june,the perrys individually refinanced the corporation loan for.the new loan,which was in the perrys names,was also secured by the tract.no deed had reconveyed the property to the perrys from the corporation.instead,perry and his wife executed an affidavit declaring that american campgrounds,their wholly owned corporation,was defunct,and that they had personally assumed all of the corporation assets and liabilities.the proceeds of the loan were used,in part,to pay off the corporation loan from the bank.three years later,in may,perry and his wife filed a homestead designation for the tract,claiming the property as their homestead.
on march,perry filed for bankruptcy under chapter.on may,perry,electing the state exemption scheme authorized in the bankruptcy code,claimed a rural homestead exemption for both the and the tracts 
dennie and ellen dearing the dearings are judgment creditors of perry.in december,the dearings obtained a judgment of approximately against perry for breach of contract.the dearings timely objected to perry homestead designation on may,on the grounds that the corporation owns the tract.the bankruptcy court held a hearing on the objection on september and.at this time,the bank had not filed an objection and did not participate in the hearing.the court,however,recognized that if it found the perrys conveyance of the tract to the corporation void,the validity of the bank lien on the property might be called into doubt.consequently,the court ordered that the bank be given notice of the proceedings and an opportunity to respond.on october,the bank filed what it labeled its objections to perry claimed homestead exemption.the court heard the testimony of two witnesses of the bank on january.
at the conclusion of the second hearing,the court found that the conveyance had validly transferred title to the tract to the corporation,and took other issues under advisement.on april,the bankruptcy court issued an order holding that the tract qualified as exempt rural homestead,and that the tract could not qualify as a rural homestead because it had been abandoned by both the sale to the corporation and the operation of a business on the property.
perry and the dearings moved to alter or amend the judgment.on may,the bankruptcy court issued an amended judgment holding that the tract was not exempt because it was insufficiently related to the acre tract on which the perrys live.the court then held that perry had a beneficial interest in the tract,permitting perry to seek homestead protection with respect to that portion of his property alone.the court confirmed that perry had waived his right to claim the remainder of the tract as a rural homestead by operating a business on the property.
ii.standard of review 
a district court,in reviewing the findings of a bankruptcy court,acts in an appellate capacity.in re webb,cir.accordingly,the weight we assign to the district court conclusions is subject to our discretion.in re cpdc,cir.we review the bankruptcy court rulings and decisions under the same standards employed by the district court.in re kennard,cir.conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.in re killebrew,cir in re argo financial,cir.a finding of fact,however,may be disregarded only if it is clearly erroneous.in re barron,cir.the bankruptcy judge opportunity to make credibility determinations entitles its assessment of the evidence to deference by both the district court and this court alike.firstbank pope,aff,cir.neither may weigh the evidence anew.id.rather,we must determine whether the evidence supports the bankruptcy court findings and set them aside only if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.in re dennis,cir in re williams,cir.
iii.discussion 
a.the testimony of january,
we first address perry procedural point of appeal.perry contends that the bankruptcy court erred by receiving and taking into consideration testimony presented by the bank on january.
under federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b,a party in interest who disputes an exemption claimed by the debtor must file an objection no later than days after the meeting of creditors or days after any amendment to the list of exemptions or supplemental schedules is filed.perry contends,and the district court agreed,that the bankruptcy court erred when it permitted the bank to file its objections to perry claimed homestead exemption well after the filing deadline.see in re stoulig,cir holding that a bankruptcy court may not extend the objection period.
a review of the record,however,indicates that perry and the district court mischaracterize the role of the bank in the proceedings.perry and the district court elevate form over substance by relying upon the bank pleading objection to debtor claimed exemptions to define the bank involvement.see in re transtexas gas,cir ins.of am.dealy,cir.as counsel for the bank noted,and the district court acknowledged,the bank sought in its pleading not necessarily to object to perry claimed homestead exemption,but to respond in writing to the court notice of pending litigation,as requested,and to express its willingness to participate in the proceedings to the degree that the court may desire.
rule a of the federal rules of evidence grants the court control over determining the mode and order of presenting evidence we have held that judges are to be permitted wide discretion in exercising their power to control federal trials.see united states fusco,cir united states sanchez,cir.this court has held that rule a permits reopening a hearing for further testimony upon its own motion.see united states acres of land,more or less,situated in galveston county,texas,cir.the bankruptcy court decision to do so,and to continue the september and,hearing on the dearings objection to january,did not constitute an abuse of this discretion.the district court erred in holding that testimony from the january,hearing was improperly considered by the bankruptcy court.
homestead exemption 
pretended sale 
texas permits a family who has filed for bankruptcy protection to exempt up to rural acres of land from the bankruptcy estate if the property is used for the purpose of a rural home.ann.b vernon.see also.const.art.xvi,vernon.the homestead designation precludes property from forced sale in order to satisfy the bankrupt debts,unless those debts are for the purchase money thereof,or a part of such purchase money,the taxes due thereon,or for work and material used in constructing improvements thereon.const.art.xvi,vernon.
in his bankruptcy schedule,perry claimed as an exempt homestead the tract and the contiguous tract.the dearings timely objected to this designation.under texas generous homestead law,homestead rights may be lost only through death,abandonment or alienation in re moody,cir.see also resolution trust olivarez,cir.the dearings allege that perry alienated title to the acre tract by conveying it to the corporation,and in the process extinguished his homestead interest.perry responds that the conveyance was a sham,or pretended sale intended to circumvent texas homestead laws,and thus void under the texas constitution.see.const.art.xvi,vernon a ll pretended sales of the homestead involving any condition of defeasance shall be void.
the bankruptcy court determined that the conveyance was not a sham.the district court disagreed,and reversed.a bankruptcy court determination as to whether a debtor sale of his home to a corporation was a pretended sale is a question of fact to be reversed only if it is clearly erroneous.firstbank,at.applying this standard,we are unable to agree with the district court that the bankruptcy court conclusion regarding the validity of the conveyance is deserving of reversal.
the claimant has the initial burden of establishing homestead status.burk royalty riley,lifemark merritt.this is accomplished by presenting evidence of both i overt acts of homestead usage and ii an intent to claim the land as a homestead.in re kennard,at.perry completed this short hurdle prior to the transfer to the corporation by occupying it for more than twenty years.see in re bradley,cir possession and use of land by one who owns it and who resides upon it makes it the homestead in law and in fact.accord in re claflin,cir finding that use and occupancy of the property establishes a homestead in re kennard,at noting that intent to claim property as homestead is presumed where the homestead claimant resides on the property.a claimant homestead designation,such as the one made by perry in,is also considered prima facie evidence of what constitutes the family homestead.wade first bank.
once the claimant has made a prima facie case in favor of homestead status,the objecting party has the burden of demonstrating that the homestead rights have been terminated.c in re rubarts,cir in re niland,cir.the dearings thus carry the burden of proof on this issue.
when a homestead is conveyed to a corporation,the stock of which is owned by the grantors,the property loses its homestead character regardless of whether the grantors continue to occupy the property.nash conatser.accord eckard citizens nat.bank in abilene,nowlin cameron.valid title then vests in the corporation,and the property becomes subject to the debts of the corporation.id.
the dearings assert that this is precisely what occurred when perry transferred title of the tract to the corporation.perry,however,argues that the transfer was made at the suggestion of the bank and solely to secure the loan with the homestead,in violation of the texas constitution.as such,he contends,the transfer was a pretended sale and is thus void see.const.art.xvi.perry argument lacks merit.
perry relies heavily upon rubarts first gibraltar bank,fsb,cir to support his argument.the issue in rubarts was whether homestead claimants,after transferring their property to their corporation in order to facilitate a loan,secured by the property,could be estopped from challenging the validity of the lien by asserting their homestead rights as against the bank after they reconveyed the property to themselves.id.rubarts is thus an estoppel case,not a pretended sale case.furthermore,rubarts addresses the viability of the claimants asserted homestead interest as against the bank from whom they took out the loan,not as against a purchaser,such as the dearings,who were not involved in either the sale of the property to the corporation or the loan from the bank.id.at.compare eylar eylar,with moore chamberlain.rubarts,thus,does not assist perry with respect to his claim that the transfer of the tract was a pretended sale 
perry also emphasizes that the corporation never filed tax returns or,issued stock certificates,recorded minutes of meetings,or operated the campground.while these facts are certainly evidence that the corporation fell out of good standing with the state of texas,and may have been formed solely to facilitate the acquisition of the loan,they do not challenge the legitimacy of the corporation existence on december,or make the transfer of the tract to the corporation anything less than bona fide.
as a texas court of appeals noted in mayfield first state bank of holland,
we know of no inhibition against incorporating a business and conveying to the corporation the property on which the business is conducted,even if it constitutes a business homestead and the purpose is to obtain credit by making the business homestead an asset of the corporation.
shepler kubena,disapproved on other grounds,holy cross church of god in christ wolf,noting that because a corporation can not have a homestead interest,it may borrow money and pledge the realty as security without violating the texas constitution.the mere fact that the tract may have been transferred to the corporation solely in order to avoid the prohibition against encumbering the homestead does not alone convert a legitimate sale into a pretended or sham transaction.id.rather,a sale is pretended if the parties to the sale did not intend for title to vest in the purchaser.hardie campbell,wl.
the testimony of perry,bill lewis,the title company officer who handled the closing,and mike healy,the bank loan officer on the transaction,provide conflicting evidence of what the bank and perry intended the conveyance to accomplish.the bankruptcy court ultimately found healy characterization of the circumstances of the transfer more credible.first,healy testified that perry had initiated the idea of forming a corporation in order to limit his personal liability.second,he noted that the bank probably would have made the loan to perry in the absence of the transfer of the tract to the corporation.both healy and lewis testified that perry had told them that he had intended to convey the property to the corporation in.the bankruptcy court also credited lewis statement that perry was an honorable gentleman who would not engage in a sham transaction as confirmed by testimony from perry himself.in the absence of any evidence,other than the testimony of perry,that the parties did not intend for title to vest in the corporation,the bankruptcy court decision that the transfer of the tract was legitimate was not clearly erroneous.
moreover,texas prohibits only those pretended sales that include a condition of defeasance.const.art.xvi,hardie campbell,red river bank in clarksville latimer.a condition of defeasance permits the seller to reclaim the title to the property conveyed after the loan is repaid.see black law dictionary ed.perry testified that there was no condition of defeasance attached to the transfer to the corporation.therefore,even if the parties did engage in a pretended sale of the tract,it was not the kind of pretended transaction that the texas constitution prohibits.
the affidavit 
perry contends that even if the conveyance legitimately transferred title to the tract to the corporation,he reacquired title to the property upon the corporation dissolution.while perry is correct that when a corporation is dissolved,its property becomes the property of its stockholders subject to the rights of the corporation creditors,humble oil refining blankenburg,his argument fails because american campgrounds,as of the filing of bankruptcy had not been dissolved.
on june,in the course of individually refinancing the corporation loan for,perry and his wife executed an affidavit representing that american campgrounds,was their wholly owned corporation,that it was defunct and no longer doing business,and that they had assumed all of the corporation assets and liabilities perry presented no evidence from the secretary of state office indicating that the corporation had been dissolved,either voluntarily or otherwise.see.bus.act et.vernon supp describing requisites and procedures for voluntary dissolution.rather,he relies solely upon the affidavit to support his assertion that the corporation has been voluntarily dissolved.
a corporation is not considered defunct or dead until it is dissolved.lowe farm credit bank of texas.texas law provides for voluntary dissolution only through the execution and filing of articles of dissolution with the secretary of state.see.bus.act.see also.bus.act et describing requisites and procedures for involuntary dissolution.bus.act e stating that a corporation may be dissolved by the expiration of the period of duration stated in the corporation articles of incorporation.the articles must be approved by the secretary of state,who will then issue a certificate of dissolution.id.at a c,a.there is no evidence that articles of dissolution were ever prepared,much less filed and approved by the secretary of state with respect to american campgrounds.nor did perry produce a certificate of dissolution.in the face of an explicit statutory scheme that directs the manner in which a corporation may be dissolved,we agree with the bankruptcy court that perry did not accomplish the dissolution of american campgrounds,by his execution of the affidavit.
perry interest in the tract 
title to the tract was thus in the name of the corporation at the time of the bankruptcy filing,as evidenced by a title search presented to the bankruptcy court.perry no longer possesses an ownership interest in the tract.under texas law,however,a claimant need not hold the property in fee simple in order to invoke homestead protection.resolution trust olivarez,cir.villarreal laredo bank.following the transfer,perry continued to reside on the property.he thus maintained a possessory interest in the tract 
as the district court correctly held,when coupled with occupancy of the property,a homestead may attach to any possessory interest,subject to the inherent characteristics and limitations of the right,title or interest in the property.harris county flood control dist.glenbrook patiohome owners ass n,
according to the texas supreme court,i t is a principle of law that one homestead right in property can never rise any higher than the right,title,or interest that he owns in the property attempted to be impressed with a homestead right.olivarez,at quoting sayers pyland.perry interest in the property,immediately following the transfer,became one of a.see olivarez,at noting that couple who occupied property without title,but with permission of the title holder,became tenants at will citing degrassi degrassi.accord shepler,at holding that claimants who transferred title to a corporation,but continued to reside on the property,became tenants at will.perry may thus claim a limited homestead interest in the tract premised upon his tenancy.a homestead interest in the possessory estate of a tenancy at will protects perry possessory interest in the tract against all the owner,or one with better title.cleveland milner.
t he homestead interest in the possessory estate of a tenancy at will would survive judicial foreclosure of the deed of trust and sale of the property,but the longevity of that estate would depend ultimately upon the decision of the new fee title owner,at whose option the tenancy at will might be terminated or extended.
olivarez,at quoting shepler,at.thus,just as perry currently remains on the tract with the permission of the corporation,his continued possession of the property will depend upon the will and whim of any subsequent owner 
operation of a business on a rural homestead 
the bankruptcy court held that regardless of his interest in the and tract,perry could not claim either as exempt homestead except for the acres on which he resides because he forfeited homestead protection by operating a business on the property.the district court did not dispute that perry mobile home and rv park constitute a business,but reversed the bankruptcy court decision on the grounds that texas permits the operation of a business on a rural homestead.
the bankruptcy court based its holding upon the broad premise that a business can never be part of a rural homestead.after a thorough review of texas homestead law,however,we are unable to say that texas would necessarily adopt such an unequivocal statement regarding the effect of business activity on a single contiguous piece of rural homestead property.
we accept responsibility for the bankruptcy court misstatement of texas law.in reaching its conclusion,the bankruptcy court relied upon a statement contained in a footnote in one of our prior decisions,in re bradley,cir.footnote states,u nlike the urban homestead,the rural homestead does not encompass a business homestead,and indeed,the operation of a business on part of a rural homestead forfeits the homestead protection on that part of the property.id.at.
we are not bound,however,to follow bradley.bradley did not concern the operation of a business on claimed rural homestead property.id.there,we were asked to decide whether the claimants had abandoned a portion of their rural homestead by lack of use or by disclaimer.id.at.the statement in footnote was not relevant to the holding,and is therefore dictum that we are not bound to follow.united states,cir curacao drydock akritas,cir.moreover,the single case we cited in support of the statement in bradley is an undeniably weak reed upon which to rest such a sweeping pronouncement of texas homestead law 
homesteads are favorites of the law,and are liberally construed by texas courts.in re bradley,cir whiteman burkey.we are therefore obligated to interpret the texas homestead laws equally broadly in order to effectuate their purpose of protecting the family home and a place where the head of the household may pursue his calling or business.see wynne hudson,stating the purpose of the homestead exemption.
at first blush,the plain meaning of the texas constitution and texas property code appear to support the conclusion that a business may not be included as part of a rural homestead.the laws require that a rural homestead must be used for the purposes of a rural home and may include up to acres of land for a family.ann.b.the urban homestead,in contrast,must be used for the purposes of an urban home or as both an urban home and a place to exercise a calling or business,and may include no more than acres id.at a emphasis added.const.art.xvi,emphasis added.the bankruptcy judge inferred that,in light of a phrase expressly sanctioning the operation of a business on an urban homestead,the absence of similar language purposely denied the inclusion of property utilized for business purposes in a rural homestead.see id.
it appears,however,that a business element has historically been embedded within the definition of a rural homestead.see,painewebber murray.the statement permitting the inclusion of business property in the urban homestead was added in to the texas constitution in order to ensure that property essential to the livelihood of urban dwellers would be as equally protected from creditors as that of rural residents.due to the agrarian nature of rural society at the time,property designated as a rural residential homestead served the dual purpose of protecting the family means of survival,farming,as well as its home see foust sanger.certainly,some of the farming activity that was done on rural homestead property was tantamount to operating a business.the urban residential homestead,however,often protected only the family shelter,and not necessarily the property essential to the pursuit of the debtor livelihood.as a texas court of appeals explained,
undoubtedly the purpose of the homestead exemption is to shield from creditors a place for the family to live and a place for the head of the family to exercise his calling or business to enable him to support the family.it was contemplated that a rural homestead would serve both purposes,and,therefore,no separate provision was made for a residence and a business homestead,although it was permitted that the homestead consist of separate and detached parts,if used for the purposes of a home.as to the urban homestead,it was not contemplated that the exemption of a place of residence would be sufficient as the exemption of a place to ex
