marjorie mungo filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code and listed maureen sullivan taylor,her former divorce attorney,as a disputed creditor.taylor filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court with respect to the fees that she claimed mungo owed as a result of the divorce representation.mungo objected to taylor proof of claim,declaring that taylor had coerced her into signing the marital settlement,and then filed an adversary proceeding against taylor alleging legal malpractice in the divorce action.
the bankruptcy court consolidated the adversary proceeding and the objection to the proof of claim and held a four and a half day bench trial.despite finding that taylor had committed various breaches of duty to mungo as her divorce counsel,the bankruptcy court found for taylor in the adversary action because it found that mungo had suffered no damages.on reconsideration,however,the court awarded mungo in damages,granted taylor bill of costs,and denied costs to mungo.the bankruptcy court also sustained in part mungo objection to taylor proof of claim by reducing the amount of the claim to a figure that mungo argued was permissible.mungo later sought to have the claim judgment reconsidered,arguing that she had not actually agreed to that figure but rather that it was the only permissible amount that could be awarded.the court considered that argument waived.
mungo and taylor both appealed to the district court,which found that the bankruptcy court had erred in awarding damages to mungo but affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment on all other grounds.both parties now appeal and raise essentially the same arguments that they raised in the district court.because the district court issued a thorough and memorandum opinion and order that does not contain any error,we adopt the district court opinion dated march,as our own and affirm the judgment of the lower court on all counts.the district court decision is appended below.

standard of review 
in the course of a district court decision to affirm,modify or reverse an order of the bankruptcy court,f indings of fact shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous,and due regard shall be given to the opportunity of the bankruptcy court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.fed.thus,a bankruptcy court factual findings can not be disturbed simply because the district court is convinced it would have decided the case differently.in re weber,cir quoting anderson city of bessemer city,d.both questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact,however,are reviewed de novo.see in re ebbler furniture and appliances,cir.
mungo proof of damages 
in order to recover damages for a legal malpractice action in illinois,a plaintiff must establish what the result would have been in the underlying action where the plaintiff former attorney committed the alleged malpractice.see eastman messner.a plaintiff need not prove to a certainty that she would have prevailed absent legal malpractice,but she must show that a victory of some sort was more likely than not in the underlying action.see praxair,hinshaw culbertson,cir jones motor holtkamp,liese,beckemeier childress,cir.in this case,the underlying action was a divorce action,and the measure of damages for mungo legal malpractice claim is the difference between her recovery under the settlement agreement and what she would have recovered in the divorce action but for taylor legal malpractice.
mungo attacks judge wedoff analysis of the value of her underlying divorce action,arguing that he undervalued the marital estate.in a divorce action,the issues of damages and the valuation of the marital estate are factual questions to be resolved by the trier of fact.in re marriage of lee,d.under the clearly erroneous standard,if the bankruptcy court factual findings are plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety,a reviewing court may not reverse even if it would have weighed the evidence differently.matter of love,cir.
judge wedoff began his damages analysis by calculating the value of the marital assets and determining the value of mungo dissipation claim.based on the record evidence,judge wedoff determined that the value of the estate was,including the value of the dissipation claim and the value of the marital assets.judge wedoff determined that mungo would have received of the marital property,or,had the case gone to trial.judge wedoff then determined that the settlement agreement was worth,and he awarded the difference,or as damages.
mungo raises a host of challenges to judge wedoff valuation of the marital estate.specifically,she claims judge wedoff erred by determining that the value of the marital estate was just rather than because he ignored evidence for many of the assets in the marital estate and improperly valued others applying the wrong legal standard to her dissipation claim and improperly valuing that claim excluding gifts to the children from their grandfather when calculating the value of the marital estate and holding that taylor was barred by the doctrine of equitable estoppel from claiming a value of the marital estate less than the value taylor claimed in the underlying divorce action in state court.
first,mungo argues that judge wedoff ignored evidence for many of the assets in the marital estate.mungo principal evidence for these other assets was based on a pretrial statement and a settlement proposal from the underlying divorce proceeding that reflected what mungo expected the evidence would show at trial.as judge wedoff correctly noted,however,the pretrial statement was not evidence but rather simply a statement of position by a party as to what the evidence might show.see,record,vol.viii,october,ruling at.likewise,the settlement proposal was not evidence of the value of the estate but rather a reflection of one litigant views on that issue mungo also argues that a summary exhibit,exhibit,see,record,vol.xiv,exhibit,she prepared for trial supports her calculation of the value of the marital estate.as judge wedoff noted,however,mungo failed to introduce any of the underlying evidence supposedly supporting this summary exhibit.see,record,vol.i,mem.of decision at.because judge wedoff decision to reject the pretrial statement,the summary exhibit and mungo testimony was not clearly erroneous,mungo objection to the bankruptcy court calculation of the value of the marital estate fails.
mungo also challenges various specific valuations of particular portions of the marriage estate calculated by judge wedoff,including the value of stock in clp group,and the value of the marital home.regarding the value of the stock,the relevant time for the valuation of stock is as close as practicable to the date of the trial.see ilcs f.mungo argues for a stock valuation of prepared by an accounting firm rather than a subsequent valuation prepared by the same accounting firm of just.given the evidence that the stock declined in value because of the generally unprofitable nature of the company operations,judge wedoff decision to base his damages calculation on the subsequent valuation was not clearly erroneous likewise,regarding the value of the marital estate,judge wedoff use of an appraisal offered into evidence by taylor to value mungo marital home,rather than mungo testimony,which he deemed not credible,was not clearly erroneous.
second,mungo claims that judge wedoff improperly valued her dissipation claim during the period that her marriage was irretrievably broken.under illinois law,dissipation is the use of marital property for the sole benefit of one of the spouses for a purpose unrelated to the marriage at the time that the marriage is undergoing an irreconcilable breakdown.in re marriage of cerven,d.mungo claims that judge wedoff applied the wrong standard because he measured the dissipation claim from late in august when he determined that the marriage suffered irreconcilable breakdown.see,record,vol.viii,october,ruling at.mungo suggests that her marriage like all others undergo es irreconcilable breakdown before it actually suffers such an irreconcilable breakdown.thus,mungo argues that judge wedoff should have measured her dissipation claim from when her marriage started to undergo an irreconcilable breakdown rather than late august when the breakdown was essentially complete.
even assuming that judge wedoff applied the wrong legal standard to her dissipation claim,however,mungo evidence supporting the date is,as he noted,very limited.moreover,mungo assertions of the onset of irreconcilable breakdown during the period between and are belied by her admission that when she and her former husband separated in it was intended to be for just a little while,suggesting that the couple hoped to reconcile.indeed,mungo testified that she and her former husband attempted to reconcile as late as march of.given these admissions,judge wedoff decision to measure the dissipation from was not clearly whether he applied the wrong legal standard.it was,at most,harmless error.
even if judge wedoff was correct to date the dissipation claim from,mungo argues that the bankruptcy court improperly valued that claim by omitting the swimming pool from this calculation.as taylor points out,however,there is no evidence that the pool was constructed using marital funds,which is an essential element of a dissipation claim.moreover,judge wedoff found that the pool was not unrelated to the marriage another element of a dissipation claim.see,record,vol.i,mem.of decision at.finally,the bankruptcy court noted that the pool was itself subsumed into the valuation of the marital estate.id.thus,judge wedoff specific calculation of the value of the dissipation claim was not clearly erroneous.
third,mungo argues that judge wedoff improperly excluded gifts to her children from their grandfather when calculating the value of the marital estate.under illinois law,funds in the marital estate are presumed to be marital property unless that presumption is rebutted by proof of a gift.in re lee,d,ilcs b.property acquired by gift is not considered marital property,and the court may set it aside in a separate trust or fund for the benefit of children.
the parties stipulate that in may and july mungo former husband transferred a total of from the marital estate to trust accounts for their three children.the parties did not stipulate that these were marital funds but simply that the funds came from the marital account.significantly,however,taylor testified that the source of the funds was a gift from mungo grandfather.thus,judge wedoff conclusion that these funds were not part of the marital estate was not clearly erroneous.moreover,regardless of the source of the funds,the transfer to the trust accounts occurred in may and july of the beginning of mungo dissipation claim.
fourth,mungo argues that judge wedoff erred as matter of law because he refused to find that taylor was barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel from arguing that the marital estate was less than the value she claimed in the pretrial statement she submitted in connection with the underlying state court divorce action.mungo argues that taylor filed the pretrial statement containing an assertion concerning the value of the marital estate and that mungo relied upon the representation.as taylor points out,however,mungo did not supply any evidence that she relied to her detriment on taylor representations,which is an essential element of any collateral estoppel argument.see,quake,american airlines.mungo might have a collateral estoppel claim if,for example,she rejected a settlement offer in reliance on taylor statements before recovering an award or agreeing to a settlement that was somehow less.instead,mungo apparently disregarded the valuation of the marital estate from the order and accepted a lower settlement offer.
ii.mungo attempt to compel discovery relating to a gift or expectancy prior to the divorce 
mungo claims that within ten days of entry of the divorce decree,her former husband was gifted shares of stock in his family business,which was valued in the millions of dollars.under illinois law,such a stock gift could conceivably be considered part of the marital estate.see ilcs d one of the factors when assessing the value of the marital property includes the reasonable opportunity of each spouse for future acquisition of capital assets and income see also in re marriage of h
