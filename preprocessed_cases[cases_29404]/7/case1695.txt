the parties in this case appeal and the order of the district court vacating an injunction issued by the bankruptcy court.we affirm in part and reverse in part.
the success of an industry often depends on generating demand for its goods,so it is perhaps not surprising that litigation in the paper manufacturing industry would require a prodigious quantity of its product.this appeal concerns a small,but nonetheless important,cogwheel in the legal machinery of the crown vantage,bankruptcy,which itself was a byproduct of various corporate organizational fabrications and deconstructions.
through a series of mergers and acquisitions,the james river corporation james river,a corporation,ultimately became the successor in interest to such business entities as the corporation and the northern paper mills company.james river,in turn,merged with the fort howard paper company to form the fort james corporation fort james.fort james was eventually acquired by the corporation,but this development would not occur until years after the events that form the basis of our story.
in,james river decided to spin off certain assets related to its communications papers and packaging business crown assets.to that end,it formed crown vantage,crown vantage,as a subsidiary holding company,and crown paper,crown paper,an operating entity wholly owned by crown vantage james river transferred all of the crown assets to the crown entities,and then spun off all its shares of stock in crown vantage as a dividend to james river shareholders,and crown vantage became a,corporation.a large portion of this transaction was accomplished through various means,including an agreement contribution agreement between james river and the crown entities by late,a number of disputes concerning the contribution agreement had arisen between the crown entities and james river,which had now through merger become fort james.in,the crown entities and fort james entered into an agreement to resolve these issues settlement agreement.the settlement agreement contained extensive mutual releases and provided that the sole forum and venue for any action arising out of the settlement agreement would be the federal or state courts of delaware 
in,the crown entities filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california.as part of the bankruptcy proceedings,the unsecured creditors committee filed motions seeking authority to investigate the james river transaction to determine whether an adversary proceeding should be commenced against fort james.approximately a year later,fort james filed an adversary proceeding seeking a declaration,inter alia,that the transactions did not constitute a fraudulent conveyance and that,in any event,the settlement agreement had released fort james from any liability in connection with the contribution agreement and related transactions.
subsequently,the crown entities,as,filed an adversary proceeding against fort james,alleging the settlement agreement release constituted a fraudulent transfer.the crown entities also alleged claims for conversion,negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,unjust enrichment,and unlawful distribution.pursuant to stipulation of the parties,the bankruptcy court consolidated all of the claims between the parties into one action the james bankruptcy action.
eventually,efforts to reorganize the company failed,and the crown entities proposed a liquidating plan of reorganization.under the plan,a liquidating trust crown liquidating trust would be established and a trustee liquidating trustee appointed to liquidate the assets of the crown entities and distribute the proceeds to creditors in accordance with an agreement liquidating trust agreement that was approved by the bankruptcy court.according to the plan,all assets of the crown entities were to be transferred to the crown liquidating trust,and the liquidating trustee was substituted as successor to the debtor as to all actions pending or thereafter commenced relating to the bankruptcy estate.the plan named jeffrey beck as the liquidating trustee.the plan acknowledged that the liquidating trustee would bring authorized causes of action for fraudulent conveyance,among other claims,against fort james.the plan also acknowledged that the trustee would be asserting claims against certain directors and officers of fort james,crown vantage and crown paper,underwriters,auditors,and other professionals.the plan expressly noted that potential recoveries from a fraudulent conveyance action against fort james could provide a substantial recovery to creditors of the estate.
after notice and a hearing,on november,the bankruptcy court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to a and confirmed the proposed plan.in the confirmation order,the court retained exclusive jurisdiction over all matters arising out of,and related to,the chapter cases and the plan to the fullest extent permitted by law,including but not limited to,the matters set forth in article xii of the plan.article xii provided,in relevant part,that 
n otwithstanding the entry of the confirmation order or the occurrence of the effective date,the bankruptcy court shall retain exclusive jurisdiction,as legally permissible,over all matters arising out of or relating to the chapter cases,including without limitation,jurisdiction to 
g decide or resolve any dispute or other matter that may arise in connection with or related to the recovery proceeds,available cash or distributable cash,including distributions thereof 
k hear and determine all applications,motions,adversary proceedings,including those in respect of the avoidance actions,contested matters,and other liquidated matters that may be pending in the bankruptcy court on or initiated after the confirmation date,arising out of,under or related to the chapter cases 
x recover all assets of the debtors and property of the estates,wherever located,including any causes of action 
the confirmed plan itself further provided that the bankruptcy court shall retain jurisdiction over this agreement and the liquidating trust established hereby,including without limitation the interpretation and enforcement of its provisions,for the purpose of determining all amendments,applications,claims or disputes with respect to this agreement and the liquidating trust.
a few days prior to the confirmation of the plan,fort james filed a motion to dismiss the james bankruptcy action.in april,after briefing and oral argument,the bankruptcy court denied fort james motion to dismiss.ultimately,the reference was withdrawn with respect to this action,and it was transferred to the united states district court in and for the northern district of california.
in march,the crown liquidating trust filed an action in california state court against mcguire woods llp mcguire woods,the law firm that had represented james river in connection with the corporate of the crown entities and other entities.the defendants removed this action the removed action to the united states district court in and for the northern district of california.the crown liquidating trust moved to remand the case,but the district court declined to do so because of the substantial overlap of fact patterns between the removed action and the james bankruptcy action.the court then consolidated the cases which will now be collectively referenced as the california actions.
in october,fort james and mcguire woods the fort james entities filed a lawsuit the delaware action in the chancery court of delaware seeking,inter alia,a declaration that the california actions were barred by the settlement agreement.in the delaware action,the fort james entities contend that the liquidating trustee breached the settlement agreement in proceeding with the california actions.the delaware action seeks to compel the liquidating trustee to dismiss all pending actions against the fort james entities.the delaware action also seeks damages from the liquidating trustee,along with costs and attorneys fees.
the liquidating trustee removed the delaware action to the united states district court for the district of delaware in november.the liquidating trustee then filed a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,to transfer.the fort james entities filed a motion to remand.in february,the district court granted the fort james entities motion to remand the delaware action to delaware chancery court,and denied the liquidating trustee motion to dismiss or transfer as moot.after remand,the liquidating trustee filed a motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,to stay proceedings pending resolution of the california actions.
the fort james entities then filed a motion in the district court of california seeking an order that the delaware action did not violate the automatic stay or the barton doctrine in august,the district court held that the bankruptcy court should determine those questions in the first instance.thereafter,the liquidating trustee filed an adversary complaint in bankruptcy court and moved for an order enjoining the fort james entities from prosecuting the delaware action.the fort james entities argued in response that the barton doctrine was not applicable that the delaware action was against the liquidating trustee,not in his personal capacity,but as the legal representative of the crown entities and that there was a presumptively valid forum selection clause in the settlement agreement.the delaware chancery court then issued an order staying a ruling on the liquidating trustee motion to dismiss pending resolution of the adversary proceeding.
after notice and a hearing in the adversary proceeding,the bankruptcy court enjoined the fort james entities from pursuing the delaware action.the bankruptcy court held that the delaware action violated barton and that the settlement agreement forum selection clause did not control.
the fort james entities appealed the bankruptcy court grant of a preliminary injunction to the district court.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court in part and reversed in part.the district court held that the bankruptcy court correctly found that the liquidating trustee was likely to prevail on his claim that the fort james entities violated the barton doctrine by initiating the delaware action without permission.however,the district court held that the bankruptcy court erred in granting the preliminary injunction because the liquidating trustee had failed to establish irreparable harm.the district court therefore vacated the preliminary injunction issued by the bankruptcy court.this appeal and followed.the liquidating trustee appealed the district court order vacating the injunction fort james the district court conclusions concerning application of the barton doctrine.
the first question presented by this case is whether,and to what extent,a bankruptcy trustee of a liquidating trust may be sued in a foreign jurisdiction without permission of the court appointing the trustee.
we join our sister circuits in holding that a party must first obtain leave of the bankruptcy court before it initiates an action in another forum against a bankruptcy trustee or other officer appointed by the bankruptcy court for acts done in the officer official capacity.see muratore darr,cir carter rodgers,cir in re linton,cir lebovits scheffel in re lehal realty assocs,cir allard weitzman in re delorean motor,cir.in our circuit,the doctrine was recognized by our bankruptcy appellate panel in kashani fulton in re kashani.
this holding is firmly grounded in the barton doctrine,established by the supreme court over a century ago,which provides that,before suit can be brought against a receiver,leave of the court by which he was appointed must be obtained.at see also davis gray,wall.holding that the court appointing a receiver will not allow him to be sued touching the property in his charge,nor for any malfeasance as to the parties,or others,without the court consent.the court held that if leave of court were not obtained,then the other forum lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the suit.barton,at.part of the rationale underlying barton is that the court appointing the receiver has in rem subject matter jurisdiction over the receivership property.id.at.as the supreme court explained,allowing the unauthorized suit to proceed would have been a usurpation of the powers and duties which belonged exclusively to another court.id 
the barton doctrine applies in bankruptcy,because t he trustee in bankruptcy is a statutory successor to the equity receiver,and j ust like the equity receiver,a trustee in bankruptcy is working in effect for the court that appointed or approved him,administering property that has come under the court control by virtue of the bankruptcy code.linton,at.
indeed,the policies underlying the barton doctrine apply with greater force to bankruptcy proceedings than to other proceedings involving receivers.the filing of a bankruptcy petition creates a bankruptcy estate,consisting of all of the debtor legal or equitable interests in property wherever located and by whomever held.a.thus,t he district court in which the bankruptcy case is commenced obtains exclusive in rem jurisdiction over all of the property in the estate.hong kong and shanghai banking,simon in re simon,cir.the court exercise of in rem bankruptcy jurisdiction essentially creates a fiction that the of actual legally located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the district in which the court sits.id.citations omitted.thus,the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court exceeds that of any other receiver.the requirement of uniform application of bankruptcy law dictates that all legal proceedings that affect the administration of the bankruptcy estate be brought either in bankruptcy court or with leave of the bankruptcy court.
the fort james entities argue that the barton doctrine has been superseded by statute.it is true that a limited statutory exception to the barton doctrine is codified at a.however,that exception is not applicable here.section a provides that 
trustees,receivers or managers of any property,including,may be sued,without leave of the court appointing them,with respect to any of their acts or transactions in carrying on business connected with such property.such actions shall be subject to the general equity power of such court so far as the same may be necessary to the ends of justice,but this shall not deprive a litigant of his right to trial by jury.
by its terms,this limited exception applies only if the trustee or other officer is actually operating the business,and only to acts or transactions in conducting the debtor business in the ordinary sense of the words or in pursuing that business as an operating enterprise.muratore,at.section a does not apply to suits against trustees for administering or liquidating the bankruptcy estate.carter,at.a ctions taken in the mere continuous administration of property under order of the court do not constitute an act or transaction in carrying on business connected with the estate.muratore,at citing field kansas city refining,cir.the few examples of suits that have been allowed under a include a wrongful death action filed against an operating railroad trustee and suits for wrongful use of another property.id.citing thompson texas mexican ry.and valdes feliciano,cir.
here,the liquidating trustee was not operating the business previously conducted by the debtor he was liquidating the assets of the estate.this is precisely the type of activity that the barton doctrine was designed to protect.thus,the limited exception to the barton doctrine contained in a does not apply.
the fort james entities also contend that the barton doctrine does not apply because the bankruptcy court had confirmed a plan,and therefore the crown liquidating trust was operating separately from the bankruptcy itself.similar arguments,involving lawsuits operating separately from their related bankruptcy cases,were firmly rejected by the first circuit in muratore,at applying barton to a lawsuit filed after the bankruptcy case was closed and the estate assets no longer in the receiver hands,and by the seventh circuit in linton,at applying barton to a state court lawsuit filed eleven months after the bankruptcy case was closed,and we agree with the analysis of our sister circuits that the doctrine serves additional purposes even after the bankruptcy case has been closed and the assets are no longer in the trustee hands.muratore,at citing barton,at.both muratore and linton involved closed estates here the rationale for continuing jurisdiction and supervision is stronger because the estate is still open,with a liquidating trust operating pursuant to the confirmed plan,and subject to continuing bankruptcy jurisdiction.
in addition,a confirmed reorganization plan operates as a final judgment with res judicata effect.unsecured creditors comm.southmark in re robert helms construction development,cir see also stoll gottlieb.same.here,the confirmed plan provided for the continuation of the james bankruptcy action by the liquidating trustee.if the fort james entities had any objections to this,those objections should have been registered before plan confirmation.i f a creditor fails to timely object to a plan or appeal a confirmation order,it can not later complain about a certain provision contained in a confirmed plan,even if such a provision is inconsistent with the code.enewally.mut.bank in re enewally,cir quoting great lakes higher educ.pardee in re pardee,cir quoting andersen unipacnebhelp in re andersen,cir.if a court preserves issues for later adjudication by adversary proceeding,then the merits of those actions are preserved for later adjudication.id.however,the confirmed plan distributed the cause of action to the liquidating trust.to raise the identical issues in a different forum in contravention of the liquidating procedure approved in the confirmed plan is an impermissible collateral attack on the confirmed plan.see billmeyer del mar news agency in re universal display sign,cir citing chicot county drainage dist.baxter state bank.
further,the fact that the officer involved is not a bankruptcy trustee,but rather a liquidating trustee,is of no moment.as the sixth circuit has observed,under the barton doctrine,court appointed officers who represent the estate are the functional equivalent of a trustee delorean,at.here,as part of a liquidating chapter reorganization proceeding,the bankruptcy court chose the mechanism of a liquidating trust to liquidate and distribute the assets of the estate.the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction over the case.in this context,the liquidating trustee is the functional equivalent of the bankruptcy trustee and is entitled to barton protection.id.
thus,the fact that the bankruptcy assets are now being liquidated through the vehicle of a liquidating trust with an appointed liquidating trustee does not prevent the application of the barton doctrine.
the fort james entities also argue that morris jones,either overruled or substantially limited barton,and permits the delaware action to continue.morris was a full faith and credit case concerning a judgment obtained against the debtor it did not involve the question of whether an entity suing the trustee or receiver required leave of the appointing court before commencing such an action in a foreign jurisdiction.id.at.there is no conflict between morris and barton.see,sec united financial group,cir distinguishing barton from actions involving full faith and credit 
absent a final judgment,the full faith and credit clause has no application.lynde lynde.the fort james entities do not have judgment upon which they seek recognition they simply wish to race to obtain one.barton precludes them from doing so without leave of court 
nor did morris limit the barton doctrine to suits not involving proofs of claims.long after morris was decided,we held without limitation that a trustee is not subject to suit without leave of the appointing court for acts done in his official capacity and within his authority as an officer of the court.leonard vrooman,cir.as we have noted,the bap declined to draw such a distinction in kashani.more recently,we stated the barton doctrine without any proof of claim qualifications,holding that 
without leave of the bankruptcy court,no suit may be maintained against a trustee for actions taken in the administration of the estate.a court other than the appointing court has no jurisdiction to entertain an action against the trustee for acts within the trustee authority as an officer of the court without leave of the appointing court.
curry castillo in re castillo,cir.
there are good policy reasons for rejecting the limitation urged by the fort james entities.if the barton doctrine is limited,barton will not protect trustees from suit unless the suit has the potential to affect the ratio of distribution.see,muratore darr,cir noting other potential costs in such suits.as judge posner noted in linton 
just like an equity receiver,a trustee in bankruptcy is working in effect for the court that appointed or approved him,administering property that has come under the court control by virtue of the bankruptcy code.if he is burdened with having to defend against suits by litigants disappointed by his actions on the court behalf,his work for the court will be impeded.this concern is most acute when suit is brought against the trustee while the bankruptcy proceeding is still going on.the threat of his being distracted or intimidated is then very great 
this concern does not dissipate with the conclusion of the bankruptcy,as judge posner also underscored 
without the barton requirement,trusteeship will become a more irksome duty,and so it will be harder for courts to find competent people to appoint as trustees.trustees will have to pay higher malpractice premiums,and this will make the administration of the bankruptcy laws more expensive and the expense of bankruptcy is already a source of considerable concern.furthermore,requiring that leave to sue be sought enables bankruptcy judges to monitor the work of the trustees more effectively.it does this by compelling suits growing out of that work to be as it were prefiled before the bankruptcy judge that made the appointment this helps the judge decide whether to approve this trustee in a subsequent case.
see also carter,at.
more importantly in this context,morris and its progeny have no application to bankruptcy proceedings.as the supreme court has stated,t he broad purpose of the bankruptcy act is to bring about an equitable distribution of the bankrupt estate.united states embassy restaurant,d quoting kothe taylor trust.as justice douglas noted,t he power of the bankruptcy court to subordinate claims or adjudicate equities arising out of the relationship between the several creditors is complete.sampsell imperial paper color.under the bankruptcy code,a bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over all civil proceedings arising under title,or arising in or related to cases under title.b.thus,whatever limited application morris may have on barton in a context,morris does not affect the jurisdiction and power of the bankruptcy court to adjudicate claims directly or to provide a mechanism for the adjudication of claims through a confirmed chapter plan of reorganization 
in sum,the bankruptcy court correctly held that prosecuting the delaware action without obtaining leave of the bankruptcy court violated the barton doctrine.neither a,nor morris,nor the fact that the bankruptcy court used the vehicle of a liquidating trust provides an exception in this case.simply put,the fort james entities are attempting to circumvent the processes established by the bankruptcy court in the confirmed plan by filing an action in a foreign jurisdiction without seeking leave of court.thus,this is simply a run of the mill barton case.carter,at.before filing the delaware action,the fort james entities were required to first obtain consent of the bankruptcy court and absent that leave,the delaware courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the suit.id.
although the district court agreed with the bankruptcy court that the liquidating trustee was likely to prevail on his claim that the fort james entities had violated the barton doctrine,it erroneously vacated the preliminary injunction granted by the bankruptcy court.the district cou
