this longstanding family dispute about the ownership of a rental house has spawned years of litigation in both this circuit and the second,occupying innumerable hours of bankruptcy,district,and circuit court time.at this point,the question is simple did the bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois err when it dismissed the petition of maurice salem,the debtor,or when it made various rulings in conjunction with the case defending the court judgment is michael neshewat,the creditor and brother of salem.we conclude,as did the district court before us,that the bankruptcy court actions were correct,and we therefore affirm 
briefly put,the current bankruptcy proceeding arose out of litigation between the brothers that took place in the state courts of new york.in,neshewat obtained a judgment in the amount of against his brother that judgment was recorded against a rental house salem owned located at gellatly drive,wappinger falls,new york.salem responded with a chapter bankruptcy petition in new york in,the adjudication of which involved two appeals to the southern district of new york and the court of appeals for the second circuit.one outcome of those proceedings was a holding that neshewat judgment against salem is nondischargeable.see in re salem,aff.cir unpublished.
following the termination of his chapter petition in new york,salem,now identifying himself as an illinois resident,filed a chapter petition in the northern district of illinois.the plan he offered was a zero percent plan that made no provision for payments to unsecured creditors and treated neshewat judgment as unsecured.neshewat objected,claiming that salem had sufficient equity in the gellatly drive house to permit neshewat judgment to attach to it,thereby making the claim secured but unaccounted for in the plan.within the chapter petition proceedings,salem filed a motion to convert his chapter petition from new york into his illinois chapter case,which the bankruptcy court denied.then,in a separate decision months later,the bankruptcy court found that the house had sufficient value to make neshewat claim secured.it therefore rejected the chapter plan for failing to account for the secured claim and dismissed the case.we explain more about the progression of this case below,as needed.
before proceeding to the merits,we must address a question of appellate jurisdiction noticed by the panel.see doctor,duree,cir wingerter chester quarry,cir.this court has jurisdiction over appeals from final judgments of the district courts.in the bankruptcy context,t he general rule is that a court of appeals has jurisdiction over a bankruptcy appeal only if the bankruptcy court original order and the district court order reviewing the bankruptcy court original order are both final.in re rimsat,cir.a judgment affirming a bankruptcy court decision to deny confirmation of a chapter plan and dismiss a case is typically a final order of the bankruptcy court,as there are no proceedings left to occur.however,procedural oddities within this case might lead one to think that this appeal comes too late.we therefore explain here why we have concluded that the judgment issued march,by the district court is final.
we begin with the new york cases we take judicial notice of these dockets and opinions.see,radaszewski ex rel.radaszewski maram,cir taking judicial notice of administrative findings menominee indian tribe of thompson,cir judicial notice of historical documents,documents contained in the public record,and reports of administrative bodies is proper.
on april,salem filed an action under and against several defendants,including neshewat neshewat attorney,paul goldstein and named public officials.salem basic contention was that these individuals abused the judicial process in the litigation resolved by the default judgment that led in turn to the lien on the gellatly drive house.salem separately filed a chapter petition in the southern district of new york on february.on may,salem filed an adversary proceeding complaint as part of his bankruptcy case,seeking injunctive relief and damages.see salem paroli.the bankruptcy court dismissed the adversary complaint.after salem appealed to the district court,the court consolidated the bankruptcy case with the civil rights suit.it affirmed the bankruptcy court decision,id.at,and dismissed the civil rights claim under the doctrine,which divests federal district and appellate courts of subject matter jurisdiction over a case if the result of the case could be the reversal or modification of a state court judgment,id.at.salem appealed,and the second circuit affirmed.cir unpublished.meanwhile,the chapter petition continued,and the bankruptcy court held on august,that neshewat default judgment was not dischargeable.the district court affirmed on march,see at,and the second circuit affirmed on april,see.the mandate issued may,and was received by the district court on may.according to the bankruptcy court docket,that court took no action after march,when the case closed,and march,when a final decree issued.
while salem second appeal was pending before the second circuit,his wife clodia filed a chapter petition in the northern district of illinois,which was docketed at and assigned to bankruptcy judge sonderby.salem,who is an attorney,represented his wife.the dispute in that case also related to whether the property on gellatly drive would be sold.in the adjudication of clodia petition,the bankruptcy court ordered the property auctioned off.
in the meantime,in november,neshewat sued salem in the supreme court of new york seeking to set aside as fraudulent salem conveyance of a in the gellatly drive house and a car to his wife.salem removed that case to federal court,and it was stayed during the proceedings of the bankruptcy court in illinois in both salems cases.on april,the district court for the southern district of new york noted that although the court in clodia illinois bankruptcy case ordered the sale of her interest in the gellatly drive house,it never addressed whether the conveyances were fraudulent and thus whether she had any interest.the new york district court held that the conveyances were indeed fraudulent.neshewat salem,d.the appeal of that decision is pending before the second circuit.the court also sanctioned salem for engaging in frivolous litigation,enjoining him from filing or prosecuting,without leave of this court,further actions or proceedings in the federal courts against neshewat or his counsel seeking review of or relief from the default judgment entered against him in new york state supreme court.
the sale of the real property itself as opposed to particular interests in it never took place because of salem own chapter petition,which he filed in chicago the day after the district court in new york received the mandate from the second circuit affirming dismissal of his chapter petition.we note in passing that although it appears that salem was cutting it close,he did not pursue relief under chapter and chapter simultaneously in his new york and illinois petitions.when a chapter petition is filed after a chapter petition,it has been nicknamed a chapter filing.see generally johnson home state bank,d permitting a chapter filing after a chapter case had closed.salem petitions did not overlap,but rather were barely successive.simultaneous chapter petitions are barred in this circuit,see in re sidebottom,cir.on may,salem chapter petition was docketed as case b.salem paid the docketing fee,then,for a chapter petition.in addition to new chapter petition,salem filed a separate motion to convert his closed new york chapter proceeding into the illinois chapter proceeding.when salem petition was filed,it was assigned to judge sonderby,probably because of bankruptcy local rule a,which provides that t wo or more cases are related if the debtors are husband and wife.
on june,judge sonderby denied the motion to convert the new york chapter petition into the case before her,reasoning that the new york case was both closed and not within her district.no notice of appeal was filed within days of that order,nor was there a request for an interlocutory appeal filed with the district court at that time.see fed.we consider the appealability of the denial of conversion separately below.judge sonderby did not dismiss the chapter petition or issue a final judgment at this point.
as the case proceeded,it appears to have been transferred for some reason,undocumented in the record,from judge sonderby to chief bankruptcy judge wedoff.chief judge wedoff both conducted the hearing and issued the judgment of the bankruptcy court.since neither party raised issues about the transfer which appears to have caused some confusion from time to time,our only concern is to ensure that this was one singular case with one final order,rather than two separate,the conversion of the new york chapter rejected by judge sonderby and the filing of the illinois chapter rejected by chief judge wedoff.we conclude,based on a number of indicia in the record,that there has never been more than one case here.salem paid only one filing fee the case proceeded under only one case number and the denial of salem motion to convert the chapter petition from new york into the chapter petition appears no different from a ruling on any other interlocutory motion.it follows from this conclusion that the bankruptcy court december,order dismissing the case and denying confirmation of salem chapter plan was a final judgment.this triggered salem right to appeal to the district court under a.similarly,the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court order was final,reflecting the termination of the bankruptcy case.with this predicate,our appellate jurisdiction over the case,which encompasses both challenges to the final judgment and challenges to various interlocutory orders,is also proper.see d.
salem argues that the bankruptcy the district court in affirming several errors in the handling of his chapter petition.we review legal issues in a bankruptcy case de novo and factual findings for clear error.see in re heartland steel,cir.essentially,our review is the same as that performed by the district court.see in re midway airlines,cir.
chapter conversion 
jurisdiction 
after filing his initial chapter petition before the bankruptcy court in the northern district of illinois,salem filed a motion to convert his chapter petition from new york into the chapter petition in illinois pursuant to a.this is salem terminology we do not wish to be understood as endorsing the idea that conversion is the right word to use for a request to transfer a case from one bankruptcy court to another,and then to convert the case from chapter to chapter.we are merely reporting what it is that salem asked the bankruptcy court in chicago to do.at a hearing on the motion,judge sonderby questioned how the bankruptcy court could have jurisdiction over a closed new york case.before anyone could think of converting,she held,the chapter case had to be an open,pending,viable case in this district.arguing that the bankruptcy court erred,salem takes the extreme position that a debtor has an absolute right to convert a chapter petition to a chapter petition at any time,even after the chapter proceeding is closed,and even though it is not just in another district,but is in another state and another circuit.
before we can reach the merits of this issue,we must decide whether it is properly before this court that in turn depends on whether it was properly before the district court.a court of appeals jurisdiction over a district court review of a bankruptcy court order can only be based on a proper exercise of the district court jurisdiction.whether the district court had jurisdiction over any particular matter is a question of law,reviewable de novo.in re vlasek,cir internal citations omitted.
neshewat argues that salem forfeited the right to appeal this issue to the district court and consequently to this court when he did not file a notice of appeal within days of judge sonderby order rejecting his conversion a move he thinks was required by federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.in the proper circumstances,this rule is more than merely procedural it is jurisdictional.see in re bond,cir.if,for example,salem had failed to file a notice of appeal within days of the final order dismissing the petition,and he could not show excusable neglect,then the district court would have had no power to hear salem appeal.see fed.c permitting short extension of time for excusable neglect.see also matter of schultz fabricating,cir finding no district court jurisdiction in the absence of a timely notice of appeal from the bankruptcy court.
but the order refusing to convert the chapter proceedings from new york into the chapter proceedings in illinois was not a final order.it did not bring the illinois chapter petition to an end virtually the entire dispute remained,involving the same parties and the same issues.even though the concept of finality is relaxed in the bankruptcy context,see in re jartran,cir,this order was interlocutory in the purest sense of the word.see parsons,cir holding that,where an adversary proceeding continues,t he order is no more a final decision than an order denying summary judgment or denying a request for additional discovery the litigation proceeds and the issue will be reviewed if it turns out to make a difference to an order that is independently appealable.see also in re young,cir holding that the conversion of a chapter petition to a chapter petition was not final until the plan itself was approved matter of kutner,cir holding that an order striking a standing trustee motion to convert a chapter petition to a chapter is interlocutory,not final.normally,a party does not have an absolute right to take an interlocutory appeal from the bankruptcy court.there are limited exceptions,but they do not apply here.see a.instead,the party must seek the leave of the district court.see a.
the question here is whether the failure to file a notice and to seek leave to file an interlocutory appeal,as required by federal rules of bankruptcy procedure,also prevents a district court from addressing the interlocutory order upon final appeal,when a proper notice of appeal was filed following the final judgment of the bankruptcy court.as a general rule,the failure to file an interlocutory appeal does not waive the ability to have an issue reviewed upon final appeal.see calvesbert law offices psc,cir national union wilson,cir.to the contrary,one of the purposes of the final judgment rule is to permit consolidated review of all interlocutory decisions that still matter.one reason for denying permission to take an interlocutory appeal,or for passing up the opportunity to ask for such an appeal,is because many issues may be effectively reviewed on final appeal.see matter of cash currency exchange,cir.
this court took exactly that tack in vlasek,at.on april,the bankruptcy court issued an order refusing to dismiss vlasek petition later,on may,the court issued another order closing the estate and discharging the trustee.vlasek filed a notice of appeal from the latter order,and on appeal he sought apparently for the first time to challenge the earlier order.the trustee argued that the april,order was final and therefore that the notice of appeal was untimely as it related to that order.in deciding the case,we reasoned that denials of motions to dismiss are generally not final orders even in the bankruptcy context.id.at quoting jartran,at.since the order was not final,there was no appeal as of right to the district court pursuant to a.although we eventually found that most of vlasek appeal was moot for other reasons,the notice of appeal from the may,order was sufficient to bring the entire case before the district court,and then this court.
furthermore,although we note that salem notice of appeal to the district court identified only the december,order dismissing the case and not the earlier order refusing conversion,we conclude that the conversion issue was properly before the district court.a notice of appeal under rule a of the bankruptcy rules must conform substantially to the appropriate official form,and contain the names of all parties to the judgment,order,or decree appe
