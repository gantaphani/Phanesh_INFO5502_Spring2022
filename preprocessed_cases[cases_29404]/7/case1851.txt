on may,sovereign bank gave robert james roser a secured loan to purchase a motor vehicle,and he took possession of the vehicle that day.nineteen days later,on june,the bank filed its lien in compliance with the colorado certificate of title act ccta.because the colorado uniform commercial code colorado ucc,which closely tracks the uniform commercial code ucc,gives priority over other security interests to a security interest that is filed within days of the purchaser taking delivery of the collateral,see.e,the bank felt secure.
but there was a complication.on may roser filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of colorado.relying on the prior opinion of the bankruptcy appellate panel for the tenth circuit bap in in re,cir,the bankruptcy court held that the trustee in bankruptcy the trustee could avoid the bank lien,see a authorizing trustee to avoid certain liens.it noted that the ccta supersedes the colorado ucc with respect to perfection of liens and held that colorado ucc e does not apply to the bank lien in this case.because the bank lien was not perfected before the filing of roser bankruptcy petition,the court held that the trustee interest is superior to the bank lien.the court added that the bank postpetition perfection of its lien violated the automatic stay under a.the district court affirmed.
the bank appeals.see d jurisdiction over bankruptcy appeals from the district courts.rejecting,we reverse.misconstrued colorado law.the ccta does not supersede colorado ucc e because the provision does not govern the manner or timing of the perfection of liens.it governs only the priority of a lien and is not inconsistent with the ccta.as a generally applicable law,e gave the lien of the bank priority over the trustee interest in roser vehicle.and the automatic stay did not prohibit the bank from its postpetition perfection of its lien under the ccta because such perfection is excepted from the stay by.b.

priority of interests 
the bankruptcy code gives the bankruptcy trustee the rights and powers of a hypothetical person who acquired a judicial lien on the debtor property at the time that the bankruptcy petition was filed.see a he can avoid any lien inferior to his interest in an asset of the bankruptcy estate.see in re haberman,cir trustee has the power to avoid any transfer or obligation that a hypothetical creditor with an unsatisfied judicial lien on the debtor property could avoid under relevant state nonbankruptcy law.in general,the trustee can avoid liens that are unperfected when the petition for bankruptcy is filed.see in re charles,at.but in some circumstances a lien that is perfected after the bankruptcy filing may nevertheless have priority.under b of the bankruptcy code a trustee avoidance rights are subject to any generally applicable law that permits perfection of an interest in property to be effective against an entity that acquires rights in such property before the date of perfection.b a.the term generally applicable law relates to those provisions of applicable law that apply both in bankruptcy cases and outside of bankruptcy cases,at,as reprinted in see makoroff.city of lockport,cir collier on bankruptcy a,at lawrence king,ed.the applicable law in this case is the law of colorado.see in re charles,at.
the bank presents a straightforward argument why its lien would have priority under colorado law over a lien of a judgment creditor who obtained judgment at the time roser filed for bankruptcy.under the colorado ucc 
i f a person files a financing statement with respect to a security interest before or within twenty days after the debtor receives delivery of the collateral,the security interest takes priority over the rights of a buyer,lessee,or lien creditor which arise between the time the security interest attaches and the time of filing.
e.as discussed below,this section was amended after roser filed his petition.there is no doubt that the bank satisfied the requirements of this section.the filing of a lien under the ccta constitutes the filing of a financing statement.see.b compliance with the requirements of a statute is equivalent to the filing of a financing statement.and there is no dispute that the bank complied on june,with the requirements for filing a lien under the ccta.see id.nor is there any dispute that the bank held a security interest in roser vehicle.see id.a b defining security interest.thus,because the bank filed its lien within days of roser obtaining the vehicle,it contends that colorado ucc e gives its lien a priority over any rights in the the trustee interest as a hypothetical arose between the time that the bank security interest attached may,when it closed the loan and its ccta filing on june.
the trustee argues,however,that we should follow the holding of the bap in.although there were complications in not present in this case,the bap ultimately held that the bankruptcy trustee could avoid a security interest in an automobile that had been filed under the ccta within days of the purchase but after the purchaser had filed for bankruptcy.see,at.the bap reasoned that colorado ucc e does not apply to liens perfected under the ccta.see id.at.as did the bap in,the trustee relies on the following sentence in the ccta except as provided in this section,the provisions of the uniform commercial code,title,relating to the filing,recording,releasing,renewal,and extension of chattel mortgages,as the term is defined in section,shall not apply to motor vehicles.
we do not read ccta as broadly as did.to be sure,the ccta provides its own distinct methods for filing,recording,and perfecting liens,see,releasing such liens,see id,and extending them,see id.it thus clearly supersedes the colorado ucc with respect to those procedural matters regarding liens.but the subject matter of colorado ucc e is not encompassed within the procedural matters preempted by filing,recording,releasing,renewal,and extension of liens.indeed,the colorado ucc adopts the ccta own methods for filing,recording,releasing,renewing,or extending liens.see id.b compliance with requirements of a statute constitutes filing of a financing statement for purposes of colorado ucc,c similarly incorporating rules for duration and renewal of perfection of security interest.accordingly,in applying the colorado ucc,the date of perfection for a properly filed lien is established by the ccta.what colorado ucc e does is then govern the priority of the rights of creditors in light of that perfection date.here,for example,the perfection date under the ccta was june.given that perfection date,e states that the bank lien had priority over rights of other lien as the arose after roser acquired his vehicle on may.
the trustee three arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.first,he argues that the supersession of colorado ucc e by the ccta is clear from another ccta provision,which states 
the liens or mortgages filed for record or noted on a certificate of title to a motor vehicle,as provided in section,shall take priority in the same order that they were filed in the office of the authorized agent.
but any supersession of the priority provisions of the colorado ucc by this provision can only be partial.we recognize that ccta establishes priority among liens filed under the ccta.perhaps it even overrides colorado ucc e when a security interest is filed under the ccta after another lien is filed under the ccta a matter we need not resolve.but says nothing about the priority of a lien filed under the ccta relative to interests in a motor vehicle not perfected under the ccta such as a judgment lien,which is the issue confronting us.we think it unlikely that the legislature intended to create a legal limbo in that situation.the obvious inference is that the priorities u
