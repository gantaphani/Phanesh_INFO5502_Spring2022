with these appeals,consolidated for purposes of decision,the court is asked to decide whether certain real property taxes are properly considered administrative expenses under b b i of the bankruptcy code.the court is also asked to decide whether new york law creates an interest in property under b on its tax status date.
at the bankruptcy court,the city of white plains the city,filed a claim to collect back real property taxes from a s galleria real estate,a s galleria.in its claim,the city said the back property taxes were an administrative expense entitled to priority.alternatively,the city argued that if the back taxes were not an administrative expense,the taxes should receive priority as a prepetition interest in the real property that was capable of being perfected postpetition by operation of a generally applicable state law.
the bankruptcy court for the southern district of ohio denied the city application to have the taxes paid as administrative expenses under b b i by operation of a b.the district court for the southern district of ohio affirmed the decision.the bankruptcy court also held that the city did not have a prepetition interest subject to postpetition perfection in the real property taxes.the bankruptcy appellate panel of the sixth circuit affirmed that decision.
the city now appeals the district court affirmation of the bankruptcy court denial of its back taxes as an administrative expense.the city also appeals the bankruptcy appellate panel affirmation of the bankruptcy court denial of the city claim that the taxes were a prepetition interest in the real property subject to being perfected postpetition.
because the city assessed the taxes within the meaning of a after the debtor bankruptcy petition was filed,the court finds the debtor estate incurred the property taxes.because the debtor estate,not the debtor,incurred the property taxes,we find that the taxes should be paid as an administrative expense.we reverse the district court order denying payment of the back taxes as an administrative expense.because the back taxes are properly paid as an administrative expense,we do not reach the issue of whether the city had a prepetition interest in the taxes.
this case centers on the determination of what date,under the bankruptcy code,the city assessed the real property taxes under its taxing process and the debtor estate incurred those taxes.because the date when the real property taxes were incurred and assessed is critical,the temporal relationship between events in the city taxing process and the filing of the bankruptcy petition is important in deciding whether the city assessed the tax before the commencement of the case under a b 
the city and the city of white plains school district the school district use similar tax assessment procedures.the city and the school district utilize a fiscal year that runs from july of each year to the following june.under new york law,city taxing authorities use march as the taxable status date,except when a city or town local law sets a different date.see real prop.tax law.with this flexibility,white plains uses a different taxable status date.white plains city charter b sets the taxable status date for real property within its boundaries.real property in the city shall be assessed according to its condition and ownership as of january of each year.white plains,b.under this provision,a property taxable status is determined by reference to its condition and ownership on january,regardless of whether the property is sold or destroyed after that date.
on january of each year,the city files its tentative assessment roll.see white plains,b c.after notice and the opportunity to challenge the assessed values,the city certifies its assessment roll,including any changes,and files the assessment roll with the city clerk by march.see white plains,d h.
the city enacts its budget on or before may.see white plains,b.concurrently with passing a budget,the city causes sufficient money to be levied and raised by general tax on all taxable property in the city,according to the valuation upon the assessment roll for the budget year,so that the budget is balanced.white plains,d.in this case,the city adopted its budget on may.
of the taxes levied when the budget is adopted,of the tax is due on july,the start of the fiscal year.the remaining of the taxes are due on january of the following year.white plains.the taxes become liens on the real estate when they become due and payable.id.monthly interest at percent begins to accrue on any unpaid tax thirty days after it is due.see white plains.
the real property tax is both an in rem and in personam obligation.the in rem nature of the tax is clear all assessments shall be against the real property itself which shall be liable to sale pursuant to law for any unpaid taxes or special ad valorem levies.real prop.tax law.new york law also establishes the tax as an in personam tax.the owner of real property shall be personally liable for the taxes levied thereon.real prop.tax law.
the school district uses a similar procedure.a separate tax for the school district situated within the city shall be ascertained from the latest final assessment rolls of the city or town.real prop.tax law.the school district also uses a fiscal year running from july to the following june.the school district uses the same tax status date adopted by the city.see real prop.tax law.
the school tax comes into being when voted by the school district.see real prop.tax law.in this case,the school district voted the tax on june.immediately upon voting a tax,the school authorities shall levy it,make out a school tax roll therefore and annex thereto a warrant.id.the school tax becomes a lien when adopted by the school district.see real prop.tax law.the taxes are payable in installments and if not paid before the date when due,interest is included in and deemed part of the unpaid tax.real prop.tax law.
as is the case with the city taxes,the school tax is also both in rem and in personam.the levy of school taxes shall be deemed as against the real property itself.real prop.tax law.the in personam nature of the tax exists because the owner of real property is personally responsible for any tax levied against that property.see real prop.tax law.
on january,a s galleria filed a chapter bankruptcy petition for relief.the bankruptcy court established august,as the claims bar date.the city filed a timely proof of claim for certain taxes and water charges.the debtor estate paid these claims following plan confirmation.the city did not file a proof of claim for the city and school taxes at issue in this appeal.the city argues the taxes were administrative expenses for which no proof of claim was required certain county taxes arising from the same assessment roll as the taxes at issue were paid postpetition by the debtor estate without proof of a claim having been filed for them.
on august,the city filed a motion to recover the city and school taxes as an administrative expense claim under b b i the city argued the taxes were incurred by the debtor estate under b b i because the taxes in question were not assessed,according to a b until after the bankruptcy petition was filed.concurrent with the filing of the motion to recover the taxes as an administrative expense,the city instituted an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court.in the adversary proceeding,the city took the alternative position that if the taxes were not administrative expense claims because of prepetition assessment,then the city had an interest in the real property capable of postpetition perfection by a lien on the property from which the claims arose.see b,b a.
the bankruptcy court held that under a,the city assessed the taxes prepetition.because it found that the taxes were assessed prepetition,the bankruptcy court held that the taxes were not administrative expense claims under b b i.
the district court disagreed with the bankruptcy court holding on the meaning of assessed,but affirmed the decision on other grounds.the district court held that a tax is assessed on the date an entity is made liable for it,regardless of when the tax is calculated and due.interpreting new york law,the district court held that a s galleria was liable for the tax on the tax status date of january.because it found that the debtor was liable for the tax on the tax status date of january,the district court found the taxes were prepetition debts and not an administrative expense under b b i.
with respect to the alternative claim,the bankruptcy court held that the city did not have a prepetition interest in the real property that could be perfected postpetition.in reaching its decision,the bankrupcty court acknowledged that the courts of appeals for the second and third circuits have reached different conclusions on the same issue of new york law.compare lincoln sav.bank suffolk county treasurer in re parr meadows racing ass n,cir with makoroff city of lockport,cir.the bankruptcy court adopted the third circuit reasoning in makoroff and held that on the tax status date,the city did not have an interest in the real property allowing postpetition perfection of that interest into a lien under b a.
the bankruptcy appellate panel for the sixth circuit affirmed the bankruptcy court decision.it found that makoroff was the better reasoned decision.
the city now appeals the rulings of the district court and the bankruptcy appellate panel.
we review a bankruptcy appeal differently than a typical appeal from the district court.the bankruptcy court makes initial findings of fact and conclusions of law.the district court then reviews the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and the bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo.wesbanco bank barnesville rafoth in re baker getty fin.servs,cir citing fed.we review the factual findings of the bankruptcy court for clear error and review the district court conclusions of law de novo.unsecured creditors comm.of highland superstores,strobeck real estate in re highland superstores,cir.
with regard to the city appeal as to whether it had a prepetition interest in the taxes,w hether an appeal comes to our court by way of a district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel,our review is of the bankruptcy court decision.koenig sporting goods morse.in re koenig sporting goods,cir quoting corzin fordu in re fordu,cir.as before the district court and the bankruptcy appellate court,a bankruptcy court conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.in re highland superstores,at.
section of the bankruptcy code gives priority to certain unsecured claims of creditors.the bankruptcy code gives a first priority to the administrative expenses necessary to preserve the debtor estate during the bankruptcy.see a.
administrative expenses include any tax incurred by the estate,except a tax of a kind specified in section a of this title.b b i.claims for administrative expenses under b are strictly construed because priority claims reduce the funds available for creditors and other claimants.in re alumni hotel,citing mfrs.hanover trust bartsh in re flight transp.sec.litig,cir.
in determining whether a claim is a valid administrative expense,a court must decide whether the taxes were incurred by the estate and whether the taxes are of a kind specified in a.see marion county treasurer blue lustre,in re blue lustre.
section a b gives an eighth priority to property taxes assessed before the commencement of the case and last payable without penalty after one year before the date of the filing of the petition.a b.if a tax qualifies for the eighth priority under a,it is disqualified from the first priority accorded to administrative expenses.
the standard of b b i has been difficult to use,primarily because the tests under the two prongs uses two different key words incurred and assessed which are not necessarily mutually exclusive.as one commentator has noted 
depending on the characterization of when a tax is incurred and assessed,it is possible that under a strict reading of the code,a tax could be incurred before bankruptcy,and thus be ineligible for first priority treatment,but not be assessed until after bankruptcy,and thus be disqualified as a n eighth priority.
william norton,bankruptcy law and practice ed emphasis added hereinafter bankruptcy law and practice.
we first look at whether the debtor estate incurred the property taxes according to b b i.if the estate incurred the taxes,we then decide whether the taxes were assessed within the meaning of a.
incurred by the estate under b b 
state law determines when a tax is incurred.dep t of tax revenue irs in re columbia gas transmission,cir citing butner united states,d.in affirming the bankruptcy court decision,the district court held that new york law imposed liability for the property taxes on the tax status date.because the district court found the liability for taxes arose on the tax status date,the district court found that the taxes were a claim against prepetition debtor a s galleria and not incurred by the debtor estate.
before turning to new york law to determine the date on which the property taxes were incurred,we describe what the bankruptcy code means by incurred.the bankruptcy code does not define when property taxes are incurred by a debtor estate.however,most courts considering the issue have found that a tax is incurred when it accrues and becomes a fixed liability.see bankruptcy law and practice see also in re columbia gas transmission,at midland cent.appraisal dist.midland indus.serv.in re midland indus.serv,cir in re soltan,the significant event is the date the tax accrues and becomes a fixed obligation.in re blue lustre,at stating for purposes of section b b i,a property tax is incurred as soon as the tax accrues and the debtor is liable for the tax in re northeastern ohio hosp,for purposes of administrative expense allowance,a tax claim is incurred on the date it accrues rather than the date it is assessed or becomes payable.a tax obligation accrues when the event triggering liability occurs.see in re midland indus,at.
using this standard for incurred,the district court erred when it held that new york law imposed liability for property taxes on the tax status date.in finding that taxes were incurred on the january tax status date,the district court relied on spiegel board of assessors.in spiegel,fire destroyed property after the tax status date but before the final assessment role was prepared.the spiegel court held that the value of real property was to be assessed based on its condition and ownership at the time of the tax status date and was not modified by the subsequent fire.spiegel,at.in this case,the district court misinterpreted spiegel as holding that new york law imposes liability for the taxes on the prepetition debtor even if the property in question is sold to a third party subsequent to the tax status date.
likewise,the appellee also misinterprets new york law when it asserts that spiegel,along with plains lanes,glaser,and hunter college student social community religious clubs ass city of new york,hold that the tax status date fixes tax liability based on ownership regardless of whether the property is subsequently sold.
neither spiegel nor plains lanes hold only that real property value and taxability is assessed based on its condition on the tax status date.see spiegel,at plains lanes,at.the assessed value does not change even if improvements on the property are destroyed after the tax status date.see spiegel,at.in spiegel,the owner of the property on the tax status date paid the disputed taxes.however,that is because the owner kept the property during the entire tax year at issue.neither spiegel nor plains lanes addressed whether a property owner is liable for the taxes assessed on the tax status date if the ownership of the property changed.
in hunter college,the court found that the ownership of property on the tax status date determines whether real property is exempt from taxes.see hunter,at see also county of suffolk grumman aerospace,misc d,the rule is that ownership of real property on the taxable status date determines whether the property is subject to real property taxation for the ensuing year.the identity of the owner on the tax status date determines whether the property is exempt from property taxes for the upcoming year.
none of these decisions relied upon by the district court hold that the owner of property on the tax status date is personally liable to pay taxes for the tax year beginning six months into the future.instead,these cases hold that the taxability and valuation,but not personal liability,are determined on the tax status day,subject to a challenge.
the white plains city charter only calls for property to be assessed according to its condition and ownership.see white plains,b.under new york law,assessment means that a determination is made of the valuation of real property,including the valuation of exempt real property and whether or not real property is subject to taxation or special ad valorem levels.real prop.tax law.
the cases cited by the district court and appellee only confirm that the value and taxability of real property are established on the tax status date.liability for the property taxes assessed on the tax status date is not determined on that date.
for example,tax exempt organizations that purchase property after the tax status date are still responsible for the property taxes assessed on that property.see long island power auth.river cent.sch,citing lutheran high sch.ass city of new york,young israel of far rockaway,city of new york.this result is only possible if an owner liability for real property taxes is not set on the tax status date.
the error in the district court and appellee interpretation of new york law is highlighted by the following hypothetical 
property owned by the prepetition debtor on tax status date 
bankruptcy filing 
debtor sells the real estate to a third party 
taxes are levied 
first installment of tax is due and payable 
tax year begins 
second installment of tax is due and payable 
tax year ends 
if the tax liability of the owner is imposed on the tax status date as the district court and the appellee say it is,then an owner of property on the tax status date is liable to pay property taxes on real property for a fiscal year not yet begun,on property it will not own either on the date the taxes are levied or on the date the taxes are due and payable.neither the district court nor the appellee provide any authority that supports this proposition.
other courts have reached the same conclusion that we reach today.in in re macy,the district court interpreted new york law and reversed the bankruptcy court decision that the city claim for administrative expenses had arisen on the tax status date.the district court reasoned 
while the city,under parr meadows acquired an interest in the real property in question on the tax status date,january,it is hard to see how the tax itself can be said to have been incurred before july,the beginning of the tax year,before which date the debtors were under no obligation to pay real property taxes.to incur means to become liable or subject to.plainly,debtors were not liable or subject to the real property taxes at issue prior to the bankruptcy filing dates.
t he distinction between rights in rem and rights in personam must be borne in mind.as parr meadows teaches,on the tax status date a taxing authority acquires an interest in real property leading to in rem rights against the property for taxes becoming due in the ensuing tax year,so that an in rem right can be said to mature on the tax due date.but nothing in parr meadows suggests that in personam rights against the opposed to in rem rights against the in any way acquired,or arise,on the tax status date.if the debtors had sold the real property in question between the tax status date and the bankruptcy filings,there is no question but that the city would have retained a lien on the property notwithstanding the change in ownership but there is equally no question but that the city would not have had even an arguable claim against the debtors personally for payment of real property taxes due for a period subsequent to their ownership i t is ownership of the real property subject to taxation during the period with respect to which taxes are imposed that gives rise to the personal obligation to pay the tax,and that situation can not arise until the tax due date.
in re macy,at citations and footnote omitted see also in re garfinckels,holding that maryland property tax law,which has a similar timetable as new york property tax law,causes taxes to be incurred within the meaning of b b on the taxes due date,when a tax lien first attaches and liability is first imposed.
the present case is essentially identical to the situation in in re macy.the property at issue was tentatively valued on january,the tax status date.however,the final value of the property was not set until march,and the taxes were not levied for the city until may,and for the school until june.until the city levied the taxes,it had merely a vested in rem interest in the real property.while the property would be taxable according to its condition on january,the property owner would not be personally liable for the taxes if the property was transferred to a third party before the taxes were levied.while the city acquired an in rem interest,a right to payment from the real property itself on january,it did not acquire an in personam right to payment from the debtor.see real prop.tax law all assessments shall be against the real property itself which shall be liable to sale pursuant to law for any unpaid taxes.
the city did not acquire an in personam claim against a s galleria on january.not until the postpetition levy did the city acquire a right to payment from the debtor estate.see real prop.tax law the owner of real property shall be personally liable for the taxes levied thereon.the right to payment remained unmatured until july,when the taxes became due and payable.at the time the levy took place,the debtor estate oversaw the property and is therefore responsible for paying the tax.thus,the tax was incurred by the estate for purposes of b b i.
assessed under a b 
we next must decide if the property taxes at issue are the kind specified in a,that is,whether the claim is for a property tax assessed before the commencement of the case.a b.if so,the taxes are not administrative expenses.
there has been a great deal of confusion in determining congress meaning of assessed under a b.assessed has many different meanings and can refer to nearly every step in the process of imposing a property tax while many states define assessment,it is federal law that determines what actions constitute an assessment under a b.in re garfinckels,at citing king franchise tax bd.in re king,cir.
in interpreting assessed under a b,the bankruptcy court merely imported new york definition of the term.in finding this wrong,the district court correctly determined that simply importing a state definition is inappropriate.because states have varying definitions of assessed,the use of different definitions while interpreting a b would destroy the uniformity of the statute 
in reaching its decision on the meaning of assessed under a b,the district court recognized a split of authority on the issue 
one school of thought is in line with the position essentially espoused by the city a tax is not assessed within the meaning of a until all things necessary to create the tax liability have of the property value,determination of applicable tax rate,and attachment of a lien on the property.the other school of thought,and the one adopted by the court here,is that a tax is assessed on the date the entity is made liable for it,regardless of when the tax is calculated and due.
city of white plains v.a s galleria real estate,in re federated dep t stores,no,at,citations omitted.
the district court cited several cases that adopted the same definition of assessed that it did.the district court noted that those cases found it relevant that the governmental entities involved could have preserved their right to payment by filing a claim for a contingent,unliquidated amount under the definition of claim in the bankruptcy code 
the district court went on to hold that,under new york law,because a s galleria was liable for the property taxes on january,the taxes were
