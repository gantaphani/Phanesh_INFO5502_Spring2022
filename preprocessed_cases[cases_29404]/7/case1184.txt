background 
chambers attended uic from until may of to pursue a master degree.while at uic,chambers incurred tuition and related fees under an open student account.her final account balance was,plus accruing interest chambers failed to pay this amount.
in october,chambers filed a voluntary petition for chapter bankruptcy relief.in connection with the bankruptcy,chambers listed uic as a creditor and included the account balance on her bankruptcy schedules as a unsecured claim.the chapter trustee later designated chambers bankruptcy a no asset case,and in january,chambers received a discharge of her debts.after the discharge,chambers was unable to obtain her transcripts and other papers from uic.university officials notified her that uic considered the account balance due and owing despite the bankruptcy discharge.
in response,chambers filed an amended complaint against chancellor manning in her official capacity,in which she sought declaratory relief that the debt did not qualify as an educational loan excepted from discharge under a chancellor manning filed a motion to dismiss,which the bankruptcy court converted into a motion for summary judgment.chambers filed a cross motion for summary judgment.after a hearing,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to chambers.
the bankruptcy court concluded that the a discharge exception did not extend to chambers account balance at uic.although chancellor manning argued that the debt was the substantive equivalent of a loan,the bankruptcy court noted that the majority of courts to consider this issue had rejected such an expansive interpretation of the term loan.it noted that the leading case on the issue,cazenovia college renshaw in re renshaw,cir,held that an extension of credit should qualify as a loan under a when a contract to transfer money,goods,or services is reached prior to or contemporaneous with the transfer.the bankruptcy court found the renshaw analysis consistent with congress use of the term loan.accordingly,applying this standard,the bankruptcy court found no evidence of intent by either party to enter into a loan arrangement rather,the debt arose from chambers failure to pay the tuition and expenses when due.
the bankruptcy court therefore declared the debt discharged.on appeal,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court.chancellor manning timely appealed to this court.
discussiona.section a 
the primary purpose of bankruptcy discharge is to provide debtors with a fresh start.educ.credit mgmt.in re,cir.congress has decided,however,that some public policy considerations override the need to provide the debtor with a fresh start,and it has excluded certain debts from discharge.unpaid student loans are among those debts excluded from discharge.the student loan exception is codified in the bankruptcy code at 
a a discharge under section,a,b,or b of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt 
for an educational benefit overpayment or loan made,insured or guaranteed by a governmental unit,or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution,or for an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit,scholarship or stipend

despite this original focus on student loan programs,congress has consistently expanded a.the legislative developments are thoroughly explored in johnson missouri baptist college in re johnson,and are also discussed in renshaw,at.in brief,congress has expanded a in the following ways in,congress effectively equalized the treatment of loans administered by educational institutions and educational institutions by amending the language of the provision under the original version,only loans administered by educational institutions were covered.see bankruptcy loan debts,pub,stat.also,deferment periods were excluded from the calculation of the repayment period.see id.in,congress amended the language to include educational loans from nonprofit institutions rather than only nonprofit institutions of higher education.see bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of,pub,a,stat.in,congress expanded the exception to cover educational benefit overpayments and funds received as educational benefits,scholarships,or stipends,see federal debt collection procedures act of,pub,stat,and increased the period of from five to seven years,see id,stat.at.it also applied a to chapter cases.see student loan default prevention initiative act of,pub,b,stat.thus,although concern for the federally guaranteed loan programs provided the original impetus for a,the exception has consistently expanded to cover other educational debts.with this legislative history in mind,we turn to the merits of this appeal.
standard of review 
disposition of cross motions for summary judgment is reviewed de novo.see hoseman weinschneider,cir ozlowski henderson,cir citing excel,cir.all facts and inferences are viewed in the light most favorable to each nonmoving party summary judgment is appropriate when the record reveals no genuine issue of material fact,and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see hoseman,at citing.c.
interpretation of a 
the question presented by this appeal is whether an unpaid balance on a student account meets the definition of an educational loan under a and is therefore excepted from discharge in bankruptcy proceedings.exceptions to discharge are confined to those plainly expressed in the code and are narrowly construed in favor of the debtor.dekalb county div.of family children servs.platter in re platter,cir internal citations omitted.
in interpreting statutory provisions,we begin with the language of the statute itself.see in re merchants grain,cir.section a excepts from discharge any debt for an educational loan made by a governmental unit,but the statute leaves the term loan undefined.we therefore must turn to the traditional understanding of the term loan under common law.see nlrb amax coal,d where congress uses terms that have accumulated settled meaning under either equity or the common law,a court must infer,unless the statute otherwise dictates,that congress means to incorporate the established meaning of these terms.in re clark,cir absent a persuasive reason to the contrary,we are to attribute to the words of a statute their common meaning.
this court has not previously addressed the scope of the term loan in a.the second and third circuits,however,have determined that unpaid student debts like chambers do not qualify as educational l
