this appeal from diverging decisions of the bankruptcy and district courts involves a cautionary tale about the dangers of ignoring the automatic stay that takes effect upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition.all would have been routine had fleet national bank fleet declined to avail itself of certain postpetition payments tendered to it by its bankrupt borrower bankvest capital bankvest.but having accepted those payments,fleet,pursued by its adversaries,found itself in something of a legal labyrinth.while we have yet to receive the guidance of ariadne golden thread,we seek in the following to chart a reasonable path.
background 
we base the following on undisputed facts as set forth in the opinions of the bankruptcy and district courts and in the record.
debtor,bankvest,was a lessor of commercial equipment and a buyer and seller of portfolios of leases.bankvest financed its operations,in part,by borrowing from appellee,fleet.an involuntary chapter petition was filed against bankvest on december.on that date,bankvest had three principal credit arrangements with fleet,consisting of a warehouse line dated august,fbna warehouse obligation,a warehouse line by fleet predecessor in interest,bankboston,dated june,bb warehouse obligation,and a conduit facility dated september.these credit arrangements were secured by substantially all of bankvest assets.fleet secured interest was perfected.
during the gap period between the filing of the involuntary petition and the entry of the bankruptcy court order for relief on january,fleet,aware of the bankruptcy filing and in apparent violation of the automatic stay,a accepted the sum of from assets or property of bankvest estate and applied these gap payments against the bb warehouse obligation.on february,the official committee of unsecured creditors the committee was formed.following discovery of the payments made to fleet after the filing of the bankruptcy petition,the committee moved,inter alia,for sanctions against fleet for violations of the automatic stay and discovery obligations pursuant to sections a and of the bankruptcy code.on january,fleet filed an opposition to the sanctions motion 
in december of,fleet sold a billion portfolio of loans to ark clo,limited ark.the parties agree that this portfolio included at least the balances of the loans between bankvest and fleet.the purchase and sale agreement ark contract purported to transfer to ark,inter alia,all of fleet claims and rights,including bankruptcy claims whether known or unknown,against bankvest or any entity arising under or in connection with the related loan documents,as well as all property received by fleet under these loan documents after october,
on may,the bankruptcy court confirmed a joint liquidating plan of reorganization plan for bankvest.neither fleet nor,as fleet successor,was negotiating the plan with to the plan.
both the committee and fleet sought summary judgment on the emergency motion for sanctions,but the bankruptcy court denied both motions.an evidentiary hearing was scheduled,but shortly before the hearing,on november,the committee liquidating supervisor,stephen gray,filed a complaint pursuant to section of the bankruptcy code requesting that the gap payments made to fleet be avoided.fleet moved to dismiss the avoidance proceeding and for judgment on the pleadings under.b and c,asserting that gray avoidance claim was not preserved under the confirmed plan,was barred by laches,and was of no benefit to the estate.the liquidating supervisor and the committee,following oral argument,also sought judgment on the pleadings.the bankruptcy court denied the motions and consolidated the avoidance claim with the committee emergency motion for sanctions.all matters were tried together with the consent of the parties in february of.
during the trial,fleet moved for judgment as a matter of law,arguing that avoidance would be for naught.fleet based the latter point on its contention that if the court avoided the gap payment fleet to turn over to the estate the gap payments it had would simultaneously acquire by virtue of section h of the bankruptcy code a valid claim against the estate to recover those very same payments,as fleet claims against the bankrupt had been fully secured prior to the filing of the involuntary petition.the motion was denied.
on april,the bankruptcy court issued an opinion finding for gray against fleet in the avoidance proceeding and granting the committee emergency motion for sanctions.bankvest capital fleet boston in re bankvest capital.the bankruptcy court ordered fleet to pay over to the liquidating supervisor the amount of the gap payments,plus interest,for a total of.in re bankvest,at.the court further ordered the liquidating supervisor to hold this judgment in escrow pending a determination of whether ark had a claim to any part of the monies from fleet.id.the court ruled that fleet transaction with ark divested fleet of any claim upon return of the gap payments,and,therefore,found no need to conduct any further proceedings to determine whether fleet behavior warrants subordination pursuant to section c sic.id.the court found this remedy,which caused fleet to lose the full amount of the gap payments,harsh enough that it may defer similar future behavior,so it did not rule on the contempt contentions.id.at.
fleet appealed to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.the district court vacated the portion of the bankruptcy court judgment pertaining to the avoidance claim.contrary to the bankruptcy court,the district court determined that fleet had never sold to ark its own claim to the gap payments and was thus not divested of that claim.the district court went on to rule that,because the postpetition payments transferred to fleet by bankvest had been secured,fleet,as a secured creditor,could now recover them under its h claim,to which it had become entitled following avoidance,thus rendering futile gray right to avoidance.the district court remanded the matter to the bankruptcy court to determine what sanction,if any,should be imposed upon fleet to punish its conduct in connection with its acceptance of the gap payments.fleet bank gray in re bankvest capital,and,wl,at.
from the district court judgment,gray,as liquidating supervisor for bankvest,and the committee collectively,appellant,now appeal.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
while not earlier raised by either party,we have asked for briefing of this court appellate jurisdiction,noting that the district court appealed order might lack finality as required by d and thus be,given the remand of the open sanctions issue to the bankruptcy court.see in re spillane,cir in re recticel foam,cir stating,a court has an obligation to inquire sua sponte into its subject matter jurisdiction.the parties have responded,and,even more to the point,they have notified us that they have settled the sole issue left open upon remand,to wit,what sanction would be appropriate against fleet for its conduct in connection with its receipt and retention of the gap payments in violation of the automatic stay.the parties settlement has since been approved by the bankruptcy judge 
other than the issues determined by the district court and presented on this appeal,there are now no issues remaining open in the case we accordingly see no finality problem with the appealed order.see,estancias la ponderosa dev.harrington in re harrington,cir.even if the open sanctions issue caused the order to lack finality when first appealed,a matter we do not decide,the sanctions issue has been finally resolved and is now moot,leaving no possibility that,if we decide the appeal,more will be left to determine.since the fact of finality is clear enough now,and the parties are desirous that the case be resolved,we see no impediment to the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction.
whether the receiver has the right to bring the avoidance action 
reiterating its argument before the bankruptcy and district courts,fleet contends that the liquidating plan plan did not preserve the right of gray to bring this avoidance action.we,like the bankruptcy and district courts,find this argument lacking in merit.
review is de novo.brandt repco printers and lithographics,in re healthco int l,cir stating,w hether such an appeal comes to us by way of the district court or the bankruptcy appellate panel,our regimen is the same we focus on the bankruptcy court decision,scrutinize that court findings of fact for clear error,and afford de novo review to its conclusions of law.pursuant to section of the bankruptcy code,the confirmation of a plan of reorganization binds the debtor and any entity issuing securities or acquiring property under the plan to the provisions of the plan and,except as otherwise provided in the plan,precludes parties from raising claims or issues that could have or should have been raised before confirmation but were not.see a and b lawrence king et,collier on bankruptcy ed.moreover,section b b of the bankruptcy code states that a plan may provide for the retention and enforcement by the debtor,by the trustee,or by a representative of the estate appointed for such purpose of any claim or interest.several circuits have concluded that,pursuant to sections and,confirmation of a plan is given res judicata effect,which bars a debtor or trustee from bringing avoidance actions not expressly reserved in the plan.see,bergner bank one,milwaukee,in re bergner,cir mcfarland leyh in re texas petroleum,cir harstad first american bank in re harstad,cir in re mako,cir.the requirement that retention of the avoidance powers be clear serves to protect the unsecured creditors and to ensure that avoidance proceedings are for their benefit.in re mako,at cir.
assuming,without deciding,that we follow the reasoning of these decisions,fleet argument fails because the plan expressly provides that gray has the right to pursue avoidance actions 
the liquidating supervisor,under the supervision of the date committee is authorized to investigate,prosecute and,if necessary,litigate,any cause of action the definition of which expressly includes avoidance actions on behalf of the debtor and shall have standing as an estate representative to pursue any causes of action and claim objections,whether initially filed by the debtor or the liquidating supervisor 
fleet contends that this language does not preserve the right to pursue claims as it fails specifically to mention the claim against fleet.compare d k props.crystal lake mut.life ins.of,cir stating,a blanket reservation that seeks to reserve all causes of action reserves nothing.we disagree.see bergner,at stating,t he courts that have spoken of the need for specific and unequivocal language have focused on the requirement that plans unequivocally retain claims of a given type,not on any rule that individual claims must be listed specifically.citations omitted harstad,at ruling that debtors should have specifically reserved the right to pursue claims of this sort postconfirmation.cohen tic fin.in re ampace,stating,the bankruptcy code contemplates that debtors may seek confirmation of their plans prior to litigating all avoidance actions t herefore,in my opinion,a general reservation in a plan of reorganization indicating the type or category of claims to be preserved should be sufficiently specific to provide creditors with notice that their claims may be challenged.citations omitted.the cases upon which fleet primarily relies involve provisions of a far more general nature.see d k properties crystal lake,at plan purported to reserve all causes of action existing in favor of the debtor.harstad,at plan purported to reserve any right of debtors to recover assets pursuant to the provisions of the bankruptcy code.the plan,we believe,adequately preserves gray right to bring avoidance actions.
judicial estoppel and laches 
fleet argues that the doctrine of judicial estoppel bars appellant from arguing that fleet is divested of its claim to the avoided gap payments fleet argues that appellant has taken a position here that contradicts its position in a prior adversary proceeding against ark,in which gray argued that ark did not have an interest in the avoided gap payments.fleet contends that appellant now takes the position that fleet is divested of its claim to these proceeds because it transferred the claim to.even assuming that appellant current position contradicts its position in the ark adversary proceeding,fleet argument fails 
the doctrine of judicial estoppel takes effect when the proponent has shown that the party to be estopped succeeded previously with a position directly inconsistent with the one it currently espouses.lydon boston sand gravel,cir see also new hampshire maine,d stating,t his rule,known as judicial estoppel,generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.quoting pegram herdrich,d.in determining whether the party succeeded in a prior proceeding,we look to whether the prior forum accepted the legal or factual assertion alleged to be at odds with the position advanced in the current forum gens resolution trust in re gens,cir.
gray and the committee did not succeed in the adversary proceeding against.on june,gray filed a complaint containing the factual allegations that fleet believes contradict appellant position here.on july,ark answered,denying those allegations.on october,before any substantive proceedings were scheduled to begin,the action was settled.on november,the bankruptcy court approved the settlement.at no time did the bankruptcy court accept the legal or factual assertions of the complaint.see also bates long island,cir stating,settlement neither requires nor implies any judicial endorsement of either party claims or theories,and thus a settlement does not provide the prior success necessary for judicial estoppel.quotations omitted water technologies calco,edwards aetna life ins,cir stating,i f the initial proceeding results in settlement,the position can not be viewed as having been successfully asserted.citations omitted.accordingly,the doctrine of judicial estoppel does not bar appellant from arguing that fleet is divested of its claim to the gap payments.
further,fleet argues that because bankvest did not seek avoidance of the gap period payments before fleet sale to ark,the avoidance action came too late.this argument fails.rejecting a similar contention below,the bankruptcy court said,fleet argument that it was lulled into believing that no adversary proceeding would be commenced and therefore it was somehow duped into withdrawing its objection to confirmation is simply wrong.the court did not abuse its discretion.see ansin river oaks furniture,cir stating,w e review the district court determination as to laches for abuse of discretion.
in determining whether laches applies,we ask whether the plaintiff delay in bringing suit was unreasonable and whether the defendant was prejudiced by the delay.puerto ins.benjamin shipping,cir.the analogous statute of limitations determines where the burden of proof falls if a plaintiff files a complaint within the analogous statutory period,the burden of proving unreasonable delay and prejudice falls on the defendant.id.here,gray brought the avoidance action well within the statute of limitations.d stating,a n action or proceeding under this section may not be commenced after the earlier of two years after the date of the transfer sought to be avoided or the time the case is closed or dismissed.accordingly,the burden is on fleet to prove unreasonable delay and prejudice.puerto ins,at.it has not met this burden.
gray was not appointed until months after the sale to.thereafter,gray brought this action only ten months after fleet disclosure of the gap payments and little more than five months after he was appointed.any delay was not unreasonable.
lastly,fleet argues that the committee silence in the face of its consensual offer to reverse the transaction bars the avoidance action.fleet relies,however,entirely on cases that are distinguishable and largely immaterial here.see patriot cinemas,general cinema,cir party represented that it would not pursue an antitrust count and subsequently repudiated this intention lydon,at defendant argued to first circuit that federal law was plaintiff exclusive remedy where,at underlying arbitration proceeding,defendant had succeeded with precisely the opposite argument hurd dimento sullivan,cir plaintiff who wrote to district court in a motion for continuance that defendant was unable to represent plaintiff was estopped from claiming in front of first circuit that defendant had agreed to represent her.we therefore reject this argument.
d.the avoidance action 
whether fleet divested itself of the h claim 
we next consider whether fleet would have a valid h claim upon avoidance of the gap payments see footnote,supra.
gray brought this avoidance action pursuant to section of the bankruptcy code,which provides that a trustee may avoid certain transfers of property.except as otherwise provided in this section,to the extent that a transfer is avoided under section the trustee may recover,for the benefit of the estate,the property transferred from the initial transferee of such transfer or the entity for whose benefit such transfer was made or any immediate or mediate transferee of such initial transferee.a.
here,the transaction at issue is bankvest postpetition transfer of in assets or property to fleet and fleet application of this sum to bankvest bb warehouse obligation.if avoidance were in order,gray would ordinarily be entitled to recover the from fleet and to return it to bankvest estate.id.see also,max sugarman funeral home,investors,cir.
when grounds for avoidance are found,however,a creditor in fleet shoes becomes entitled to pursue whatever claim it may have had in the avoided sum against the debtor,here bankvest,unless,of course,as the bankruptcy court,in fact,found in fleet case the creditor has somehow relinquished its claim to the avoided interest.h stating,that the claim that arises from the recovery of property under section shall be determined,and shall be allowed the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition.ralar,rubbermaid,in re ralar,cir stating,f inally,arguably no unjust enrichment would result were to recover from transferee.if transferee were required to disgorge,it could file a proof of claim for the amount of the avoided transfer which would be entitled to a pro rata distribution from the estate.verco indus.spartan plastics in re verco indus,cir stating,a lthough we acknowledge that has a valid claim for the unpaid amount of the note from spartan,we also believe that transferee would have a claim against for the loss it suffered when the transfer was set aside.we have stated that even where the transferee is responsible for the transfer being invalidated as fraudulent,that factor does not prevent the transferee from asserting a claim against the transferor a ccordingly,transferee has a claim against the estate which may be against recovery on the note transferee concedes that is entitled to invalidate the transfer and retain the property for the benefit of its creditors.citations omitted cohen eiler in re cohen,cir.bap stating,n or does recovery from a transferee under avoiding powers unfairly deprive the transferee of rights against the estate.upon recovery,the transferee has a claim that is treated as a prepetition claim.h.it is timely to file such a proof of claim within days after the judgment becomes final the debt will not be discharged unless it is provided for by the plan.quoting a citations omitted in re dunes hotel associates,no,wl,at,stating,the bankruptcy code and rules set out a specific procedure for the filing and allowance of a claim by the transferee of an avoided transfer congress intended that such creditors should have a claim against the estate by reason of the avoidance.see collier on bankruptcy.lh at discussing expansion by congress of the reach of section h bringing it more in line with prior law i t is clear to the court that even upon avoidance,an event which has not yet occurred and which in fact is contrary to the present law of the case,the creditor from whom the avoidance would recover property would have a claim which would provide it standing to seek dismissal of the case.citations omitted in re toronto.
in the instant case,the bankruptcy court held that fleet,by reason of its transaction with ark,had divested itself of its h claim to the avoided sums.in the court view,that claim,although contingent at the time of the sale,was included within the assets fleet sold to ark along with its loan portfolio.under this analysis,fleet was left without any h claim to invoke after avoidance.it was thus bereft of any avenue of relief as a creditor of bankvest.as ark appears to have released all of its own claims against bankvest and its representatives,the bankruptcy court decision resulted in the gap sums becoming property of the estate.
the district court disagreed with the bankruptcy court analysis.instead,it read the ark contract as not having resulted in the sale to ark of fleet then inchoate h claim.that claim,the court held,now entitles an original secured creditor of prevail over gray avoidable right.appellant asks us to endorse the bankruptcy court result and to reject that of the district court.
to resolve the question of whether in the ark transaction fleet divested itself of its h claim,we must interpret fleet contract with.in so doing,we apply new york law,following a stipulation written into the ark contract providing that the law of the state of new york governs its interpretation.see mccarthy azure,cir concluding court should generally honor reasonable provision in a contract matter of stoecker,cir stating,c ontractual stipulations concerning choice of law ordinarily are honored.
according to new york law,construction of an agreement presents a question of law.trading,braddis.accordingly,we review the issue of contract interpretation de novo.see sormani orange county comm.college.
we do so notwithstanding fleet contention that these proceedings are not the appropriate place to consider the meaning of a contract between ark and fleet,ark not being a party,no extrinsic evidence concerning the contract having been presented,and appellant being a stranger to the contract.we reject fleet contention.the terms of the ark sophisticated,detailed legal document drawn up to guide a business to us sufficiently unambiguous to allow interpretation without extrinsic evidence and in ark absence.see bethlehem steel turner constr,see also,ronnen ajax,lui park ridge at terryville ass n,stating,i t is settled that the responsibility to interpret a contract falls upon the court,which must ascertain the intention of the parties from the language which they have employed.the interpretation of an unambiguous contract provision is a function for the court,and matters extrinsic to the agreement may not be considered when the intent of the parties can be gleaned from the face of the instrument.citations omitted.
the ark contract governed fleet sale to ark of a billion portfolio of loans,including the loans to bankvest.it is,in effect,two contracts in one.first,it is an agreement between fleet and jjdd llc,an intermediary,through which fleet sold to jjdd llc a undivided participation interest in the participated loans and the transferred rights related thereto and the nonparticipated transferred rights.second,it is an agreement between jjdd llc and ark,through which jjdd llc sold to exchange for the purchase price and assumption of the assumed obligations the undivided participation interest in the participated loans,the nonparticipated transferred rights,and all of jjdd llc rights remedies,interests,powers and privileges under its agreement with fleet.since jjdd transferred to ark everything transferred to it from fleet,the contract,for present purposes,operates essentially as an agreement between fleet and.
the ark contract defines transferred rights as,inter alia,any and all of fleet and jjdd llc right,title and interest in the related loans and commitments,but excluding the retained interest,if any related thereto.the definition of transferred rights further includes,inter alia,to the extent related to the aforementioned right,title and interests,the following 
all claims including claims as defined in bankruptcy code,suits,causes of action,and any other right of fleet whether known or unknown,against the related borrower under each loan transferred,the related entity other than the borrower and lender that is obligated under each loan transferred,if any,or any of their respective affiliates,agents,representatives,contractors,advisors,or any other entity that in any way is based upon,arises out of or is related to any of the foregoing 
the bankruptcy court concluded that fleet then unknown and inchoate h claim fell within the broad definition of transferred rights,but the district court disagreed,being of the opinion that the h claim fit within the definition of retained interest.fleet bank,wl at.as discussed below,we think the bankruptcy court erred in determining that fleet h claim fell within the transferred rights definition.we also question the district court view that the h claim fell expressly within the retained interest clause but since fleet,in any event,neither sold to ark the gap payments themselves,nor,as discussed below,its h claim relating to them,we conclude that it never divested itself of the latter.that being so,fleet is entitled,as the district court ruled,to retain and pursue its h remedy now.
in support of its contention that the h claim fit within the transferred rights definition,appellant argues that the h claim is a claim of right of fleet,either known or unknown at the time of the agreement,against a borrower,bankvest,of a loan transferred in the ark contract and,therefore,fell squarely within the definition of transferred rights.
the clause defining transferred rights,however,must be read in light of the ark contract definitions of other terms contained within or related to that clause.thus,while it may well be that claims known or unknown encompass claims such as a subsequent h claim,the loans transferred under the ark contract,as defined,did not include the portions thereof that were not outstanding under schedule,nor did they include claims unrelated to schedule loans.neither the gap payments nor claims relating to them formed part of the scheduled loans.
under the ark contract,ark received fleet right,title,and interest in,to and under the related loans and commitments,if any,and to the extent related thereto all claims including claims as defined in bankruptcy code,suits,causes of action,and any other right whether known or unknown emphasis added.loans are defined as,with respect to each loan agreement,the loan s outstanding under such loan agreement in the amount s specified in schedule,and includes the note s if any evidencing such loan s issued under such loan agreement emphasis added.loan agreement is defined as any document identified as such on annex a of the contract.the bankvest loans are listed as loan agreements on annex schedule incorporates the amounts of the loans as listed in annex 
thus,in selling to ark the related loans and commitments,fleet sold only the loan s outstanding under such loan agreement in the amount s specified in schedule,and in selling claims it did so only to the extent related thereto related to the outstanding loans specified in schedule.
under this same provision in schedule is provided a definition of commitments.similar to loans,commitments are,with respect to each loan agreement that provides for a commitment by fleet to make a loan or loans,the principal balance of the commitments set forth on annex emphasis added.
it is undisputed that fleet sold to ark the amount outstanding on the bb warehouse obligation after deduction of the gap payments from that amount.the amount listed in annex b as outstanding on the bb warehouse obligation reflects the deduction of caused by the application of the gap payments.from the definition of transferred rights together with the definitions of loans and commitments,it is apparent that transferred rights includes only those claims and rights under the bankvest loan relating to the aforementioned outstanding amount,which does not include the gap payments.a fortiori,any intangible rights,like fleet h claim relating to the gap payments,were not transferred to ark by the transferred rights provision.we interpret the ark contract,therefore,as not resulting in a transfer by fleet to ark of fleet h claim relative to the gap payments.we conclude,therefore,that fleet has not divested itself of the h claim.we reach the same result on this point as the district court,albeit by a slightly different path.
whether fleet h claim is secured 
we next ask whether fleet h claim is secured or unsecured.the district court concluded that,by operation of section h,fleet would receive a secured claim upon same secured status that it had prior to the date the petition was filed here.the district court stated,s ection h in turn provides that a claim arising from the recovery of property under such circumstances is to be addressed the same as if such claims had arisen before the date of filing,prior to october.in re bankvest capital,wl at.
appellant argues that section h merely provides that a claim thereunder shall be allowed as if it had arisen prepetition and does not relate to whether the claim is secured or unsecured.
section h provides as follows 
a claim arising from the recovery of property under section,or of this title shall be determined,and shall be allowed under subsection a,b,or c of this section,or disallowed under subsection d or e of this section,the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition.
contrary to appellant,we believe the natural import of this the words,shall be determined,and shall be allowed the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition is that the h claim takes on the characteristics of the original claim,including,in this case,its secured status.while allowed would seem to refer mainly to claimant right to participate in any dividend from the bankruptcy estate,determine is used variously in the bankruptcy code,with one usage being the determination of secured status.we think the statute can be fairly read to imply that the secured or unsecured nature of the claim will be determined the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition.certainly,we can see no reason,nor any indication of legislative intent in h,to strip a secured creditor of its secured claim in these circumstances.indeed,to do so would seem manifestly unfair.infra.
such case law as there is provides general support to our interpretation.in in re verco,the ninth circuit stated,h serves to reinstate existing claims where property is recovered by the trustee,thereby suggesting that the h claim would have the same secured status as the transferee prepetition claim.at cir.the verco court went on to say the modern view is that a transferee guilty of fraudulent behavior may nevertheless prove a claim against a bankrupt estate a rule to the contrary would allow the estate to recover the voidable conveyance and to retain whatever consideration it had paid therefor.such a result would clearly be inequitable.id.at quoting misty management lockwood,cir.a similarly inequitable result would occur here if fleet prepetition secured claim became an unsecured h claim after avoidance for the gap payments would then presumably be distributed among other creditors,thus providing a windfall to the estate and depriving fleet of the amount to which it was entitled.fleet,it is true,acted improperly,but that impropriety can be remedied,and under the recent settlement will be remedied,by an appropriate sanction.see footnote,supra.
in county of sacremento hackney in re hackney,the bankruptcy court,applying section h to a prepetition nondishargeable claim,expressed the opinion that the language of section h was less than clear on whether the claim given a transferee was the same claim as existed earlier.nonetheless,the court concluded that the policies of bankruptcy are best satisfied if a nondischargeable claim is reinstated under h.id.at.the court noted that,w hile it is difficult to anticipate what policy arguments might be made in connection with other types of transfers and claims,the court can see no obvious injustice that would result from such a rule in other contexts.id.at see also,in re moody,stating that the trustee is not entitled to avoid transfer while retaining the consideration received.
scholars likewise appear to support this interpretation see rafael pardo,on proof of preferential effect,p referred creditor is granted the same legal rights it had before the transfer david gray carlson,security interests in the crucible of voidable preference law,payments received by a secured party are analytically different.prior to bankruptcy,the payment extinguished the antecedent debt.once the payment is returned,it ought to be the case that the old debt,once dead,is now revived.this is universally assumed to be true,and h more or less supports this conclusion harry flechtner,preferences,transfers,and transactions involving a debtor downstream affiliate,to the extent a transfer satisfied a claim against the debtor,recovery of the transfer as a preference or voidable transfer restores the claim.michael jones,structuring the deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction,real prop.prob.tr,should the transaction ultimately be avoided under sections,or,then the lender will be returned substantially to the status quo ante with its status being that of a holder of a prepetition claim existing at the time of the filing of the debtor petition.
the foregoing seems to us sensible.we hold that upon avoidance of the gap payments,fleet would become entitled to a secured claim to the gap payments pursuant to section h.
appellant argues,however,that this is no ordinary section h case since fleet,postpetition,sold to ark any and all of its right,title,and interest in the bankvest loans and all lender collateral and security of any kind in respect of those loans.fleet,appellants insists,relinquished the very same property that had made it a secured creditor.appellant notes that to be a secured creditor fleet must be the owner of a lien,which is defined in the code as a charge against or interest in property to secure payment of a debt or performance of an obligation.
we see little merit to this contention.as already noted,fleet entitlement to be treated as a secured creditor relative to its h claim rests on section h proviso that its claim shall be determined and allowed the same as if such claim had arisen before the date of the filing of the petition.at such time,fleet claim to what were to become the gap payments was fully secured.it is fleet status as a secured creditor at that time,not later,that determines the nature of its present h claim.as the case law and commentators cited above indicate,the trustee recovery of the transfer restores the original claim,with the transferee status becoming that of the holder of a prepetition claim existing at the time of the filing of the debtor petition.at that time,fleet interest in the bankvest loans was fully secured.what happened to fleet security after it received the gap payments is essentially irrelevant.
by the time the ark contract was consummated,fleet was in possession of the gap payments themselves which,under its loan arrangements with bankvest,had,of course,been owed to it by bankvest and,but for the bankruptcy,were properly received by it in extinction of bankvest debt.fleet,having ostensibly been paid off as to the gap indebtedness by the debtor,had no further interest in the security relative to those payments.indeed,fleet did not purport to transfer any security relating to the gap payments themselves to.as discussed earlier,the gap payments and claims pertaining thereto were not included in the transferred assets.
in any event,what is crucial under section h is fleet undoubted status as a fully secured creditor relative to the gap payments as of the time of the filing of the petition.it is this which validates fleet current claim.the present issue is not a claim against security existing at the time of avoidance but a claim as to the gap payments themselves.see adams hartconn,in re adams,secured creditor received postpetition rent payments.subsequently,property was sold in foreclosure sale presumably extinguishing creditor secured interest.in action to avoid those transfers,the court concluded,despite possible intervening loss of security interest,that because the transferee would simply receive the payments back upon disbursement nothing would be achieved by recovering payment to a secured creditor who in any event is entitled to the payment ahead of other creditors.the court did not discuss whether creditor had security interest at time of avoidance,thereby supporting the notion that such an inquiry is not germane.
lastly,appellant argues that even if fleet would otherwise receive a secured claim,it is barred from litigating this issue because the confirmed plan rendered bankvest assets free and clear of liens and the confirmation of a plan of reorganization is given res judicata effect.the plan provides that,upon confirmation,all of bankvest assets including causes of action and proceeds and recoveries on causes of action,wherever situated,vest in the debtor free and clear of all liens,claims,and encumbrances,other than those specifically reserved in the plan.fleet did not object to the plan.appellant argues that since the term proceeds and recoveries clearly encompasses the amounts received under the avoidance action,these amounts return to the estate free and clear of all liens save those specified in the plan.accordingly,it argues,fleet failure to preserve the possibility of asserting a security interest after being forced to return the gap payments bars it from asserting that interest here.the district court did not address this argument,but even if it had,our review would be de novo.jamo katahdin fed.credit union in re jamo,cir.even assuming that appellant construction of the plan is correct,its argument fails.
the term res judicata is frequently used to refer to either claim preclusion or issue preclusion,but appellant does not specify the theory upon which it relies.it does,however,rely solely on a case in which we applied the issue preclusion,monarch life ins.ropes gray,cir.accordingly,we analyze this issue under the issue preclusion standard.in order to invoke issue preclusion,appellant must demonstrate that both the current proceedings and the confirmation proceedings involved the same issue of law or fact the parties actually litigated the issue in the confirmation proceedings the bankruptcy court actually resolved the issue in a final and binding judgment,its confirmation order and its resolution of that issue of law or fact was essential to its judgment,necessary to its holding.id.citing grella salem five cent sav.bank,cir piccicuto dwyer,cir restatement second of judgments.
here,the parties did not actually litigate the issue of whether the gap payments should be avoided during confirmation,let alone whether the h claim was secured or unsecured,so issue preclusion does not apply.at the time of confirmation,fleet had already sold the balance of its outstanding bankvest loans to ark and was therefore not a creditor.accordingly,than in the negotiation of the plan.moreover,at that time,it was unclear that an avoidance action would be filed against fleet only a motion for sanctions had been filed.indeed,at no time prior to the confirmation of the plan did bankvest or appellant advise fleet that they would pursue this avoidance action.nor could the issue of avoidance have been litigated at the confirmation proceeding.the confirmation process constitutes a contested matter under the bankruptcy rules whereas an avoidance action such as this one must be commenced as a separate adversary proceeding under federal rule of bankruptcy.see peltz worldnet,in re usn communications,discussing same with preference action sunrise energy maxus gas mktg.in re sunpacific energy,see also grella five cent sav.bank,cir.accordingly,fleet did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of whether the h claim was secured or unsecured until,at the earliest,appellant successfully avoided the gap payments in an adversary pro
