in this chapter bankruptcy matter filed by the debtor nerland oil,nerland oil,superpumper,superpumper appeals from a final order entered in united states district court for the district of north dakota affirming the bankruptcy court grant of summary judgment in favor of the united states,through the internal revenue service irs,on the ground that federal tax liens previously assessed by the irs against nerland oil took priority over a north dakota state court judgment affirming an arbitration award enabling superpumper to setoff its debt to nerland oil.see in re nerland oil,wl,no.june,memorandum and order.for reversal,superpumper argues that the district court erred in determining that superpumper did not complete a valid setoff under state law in,unfiled federal tax liens prevented superpumper setoff of debt,and superpumper could not assert the same defenses against the irs as it could against nerland oil.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the order of the district court.
jurisdiction 
jurisdiction in the bankruptcy court was proper based upon b transferring jurisdiction of cases arising in or related to title from district court to bankruptcy court,pursuant to providing original federal jurisdiction for title bankruptcy cases.jurisdiction in district court was proper based upon a enabling district court to consider interlocutory orders of bankruptcy courts.jurisdiction in this court is proper based upon d authorizing appeals from final district court judgments reviewing bankruptcy court appeals.the notice of appeal was timely filed pursuant to fed.a.
background 
the parties stipulated to the following facts in the bankruptcy court record.in the,brent nerland founded nerland oil,a petroleum products wholesale marketing business.nerland oil established a jobber relationship with conoco,in which it contracted with conoco to distribute conoco products to conoco retail stations and to forward credit card receivables to conoco retail stations after conoco processed the credit card transactions.over time,nerland oil acquired several convenience stores,including a conoco retail station and convenience store called the dakota fuel stop in jamestown,north dakota.
in june,superpumper,an owner and operator of convenience stores,bought the dakota fuel stop from nerland oil.to partially finance the purchase,superpumper executed a promissory note payable to nerland oil in the amount of and secured by a second mortgage on the dakota fuel stop.the note required superpumper to make quarterly payments of to nerland oil at an annual interest rate of nine percent.the balance of the note was to be paid on september,or earlier if superpumper sold the dakota fuel stop.
as a condition of the purchase,superpumper agreed to arrange future fuel supply and freight in a form acceptable to nerland oil,and therefore entered into two contracts with west fargo truck stop,wfts,another company owned by brent nerland.together the contracts credited superpumper with toward the purchase price of the dakota fuel stop.the first agreement designated wfts as the exclusive supplier of the dakota fuel stop conoco brand fuel requirements.the second contract required wfts to haul fuel products to various superpumper locations in the red river valley both contracts contained clauses requiring disputes to be submitted to binding arbitration.although neither contract established nerland oil as the conoco jobber to service the dakota fuel stop,nerland oil acted in that capacity.consequently,nerland oil was responsible for forwarding from conoco to superpumper the credit card receivables generated by the dakota fuel stop.superpumper and nerland oil did not have a contract governing this relationship,but it is a industry practice which is generally not recognized in writing.
by the spring of,nerland oil began failing to remit the dakota fuel stop credit card receivables from conoco to superpumper,and the amount of the arrearage grew over the course of the year.as of october,nerland oil owed superpumper in credit card receivables,and superpumper owed nerland oil under the promissory note and mortgage.on october,superpumper terminated its jobber relationship with nerland oil.at that time,superpumper desired to apply the outstanding balance of credit card receivables against the amount due under the promissory note and mortgage held by nerland oil.nerland oil refused the proposed debt setoff.
on january,superpumper commenced a lawsuit against nerland oil in north dakota state court seeking to setoff the debts.because the contracts at issue contained arbitration clauses,the state court ordered that the dispute be submitted to arbitration.after superpumper unsuccessfully appealed the arbitration order to the state supreme court,the dispute went to arbitration before a panel of attorneys.on august,the arbitration panel granted superpumper request for setoff.
on november,before judgment confirming the arbitration award was entered in state court,nerland oil filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.as a result,nerland oil bankruptcy estate was subject to an automatic stay which barred issuance or enforcement of any state court judgment affecting the estate.see a.therefore,on november,nerland oil and wfts resisted confirmation of the arbitration decision in state court and wfts moved to vacate the arbitration award.although the state trial court originally adopted the arbitration award,the state supreme court reversed the trial court decision,holding that,due to the automatic stay triggered by the bankruptcy filing,the arbitration award was not final or enforceable.superpumper,nerland oil.
superpumper then initiated this adversary proceeding on april,seeking summary judgment to adopt the arbitration award in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of north dakota.see,enabling creditor of bankruptcy estate to offset a mutual debt arising before commencement of bankruptcy filing.nerland oil counterclaimed,seeking reversal of the arbitration award and monetary damages resulting from superpumper breach of the supply and freight agreements with wfts.
additionally,the united states,through the irs,for summary judgment against nerland oil,arguing that it possessed a superior interest in the promissory note payments on the basis of several prior federal tax liens against nerland oil.the federal tax liens originated in the early,when the irs assessed unpaid federal excise and employment taxes against nerland oil for the following dates august,august,september,december,january,december,december,november,december,and september.nerland oil did not pay these tax assessments,and the irs filed proper notice of its federal tax liens against nerland oil on september and.at the time nerland oil filed its bankruptcy petition,it owed the irs for federal tax liens covering the and time period,which occurred prior to the sale of the dakota fuel stop to superpumper.the irs argued that it should not be bound by the arbitration award since it was not a party to the arbitration.
on september,the bankruptcy court conducted a hearing to consider the for summary judgment.at the hearing,the parties agreed to rely on the record established during the arbitration proceeding,supplemented by evidence regarding the federal tax liens.the bankruptcy court addressed for the first time the impact of the federal tax liens on superpumper right of setoff.on october,the bankruptcy court denied superpumper motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of the irs,concluding that the federal tax liens became choate when the federal taxes were assessed against nerland oil in and,thus giving the irs priority over superpumper in collecting its debt from nerland oil,and because superpumper did not qualify as a holder of an implied security interest,the irs lien collection right was not invalid under a.see superpumper,nerland oil.
superpumper appealed the bankruptcy court decision to the district court.the district court affirmed,agreeing with the bankruptcy court that the federal tax liens took priority over superpumper setoff.the district court also clarified that,because a setoff does not introduce any new money into the estate,it is treated as a lien,not a payment,for purposes of determining priority,and therefore must be treated as a lien inferior to the federal tax liens.further,the district court concluded that because superpumper was unable to identify or trace the credit card receivables,as a result of nerland oil commingling the receivables with its general funds,superpumper must be classified as a general creditor of the nerland oil bankruptcy estate and therefore assume an inferior position for debt repayment.last,the district court refused to categorize superpumper as a purchaser under because the asset in question was not the convenience store itself,but nerland oil right to receive payments under the promissory note.see in re nerland oil,wl,no.june.this appeal followed.
on august,pursuant to.a and cir,nerland oil bankruptcy trustee moved to dismiss this appeal on the ground that the bankruptcy judgment was not a final appealable order.on september,pursuant to.b,the bankruptcy court certified that its october,judgment was final.see superpumper,nerland oil.the district court affirmed.on november,this court denied nerland oil bankruptcy trustee motion to dismiss the appeal for lack of a final appealable order.see superpumper,nerland oil,cir,denial of motion to dismiss.
on october,the bankruptcy court lifted the bankruptcy stay.as a result,nerland oil moved to vacate and modify the arbitration award in state court,and superpumper renewed its motion to confirm the arbitration award in state court.the state trial court denied the motion to vacate the arbitration award on june,and affirmed the arbitration award on june.superpumper accordingly supplemented the record in this appeal to reflect the state court favorable order.see superpumper,nerland oil,cir.july,order.
discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,to determine whether there is no genuine issue of material fact so that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.c minnesota dep t of revenue united states,cir minnesota dep t of revenue reviewing de novo a grant of summary judgment regarding priority of federal tax lien.
priority of federal tax liens 
priority for purposes of federal law is governed by the principle that the first in time is the first in right.minnesota dep t of revenue,at quoting united states mcdermott,d.according to federal law,the priority of a lien depends on the time the lien attached to the property in question and became choate.id.at quoting cannon valley woodwork,malton construction.a federal tax lien attaches and becomes choate at assessment.see consequence of unpaid taxes after assessment is a lien in favor of the united states upon all property and rights to property,whether real or personal,belonging to such person,lien arises at the time assessment of unpaid taxes is made against delinquent taxpayer.therefore,a federal tax lien priority order is based upon the time when the lien is assessed,not when it is filed.see united states jepsen,cir tax assessment creates a lien in favor of the united states on all property and rights to property pursuant to,minnesota dep t of revenue,at the lien arises automatically when the assessment is made and continues until the taxpayer liability is either satisfied or becomes unenforceable due to the lapse of time.horton dairy united states,cir horton dairy federal law determines choateness,and the federal rule is that liens are perfected in the sense that there is nothing more to be done to have a choate the identity of the lienor,the property subject to the lien,and the amount of the lien are established.quoting united states new britain.internal quotations omitted.
in this case,federal tax liens totaling against nerland oil were assessed and became choate over the course of and.a competing state interest can not take priority over those assessments unless the state interest became choate before the federal tax assessment,see minnesota dep t of revenue,at,or the state interest falls within the exceptions to the irs lien priority order.see.
ii.inferiority of the attempted setoff transaction 
we apply federal law to determine the priority order of liens competing with federal tax liens.see minnesota dep t of revenue,at citing aquilino united states,d.however,we apply state law to determine the nature of the competing legal interest at stake.see bremen bank trust united states,cir.
superpumper asserted its claim under a,which preserves rights of creditors to offset mutual debts arising before a bankruptcy petition is filed.see united states gerth,cir.however,a only preserves setoff rights that are otherwise valid under applicable nonbankruptcy law.see in re sauer.when superpumper demanded a setoff of the mutual debts from nerland oil in october,its interest in the attempted setoff transaction became choate.see horton dairy,at right of setoff becomes choate when it is exercised.
however,by october,in unpaid federal taxes already had been assessed against nerland oil some as early as.as a result,any subsequent transaction,including superpumper attempted setoff transaction,must take an inferior position to the federal tax liens.see id.treating the holder of an inchoate setoff right as a lienholder inferior to a choate federal tax lien.as an inferior lienholder,superpumper may not effect a setoff transaction to compensate it for the loss of the credit card receivables until after the superior federal tax liens are satisfied.see federal tax lien remains in effect until liability is satisfied or becomes unenforceable.as a practical matter in the present case,satisfaction of the federal tax liens will deplete entirely the nerland oil bankruptcy estate.see in re nerland oil.
moreover,the scope of the federal tax liens includes all the delinquent taxpayer property interests,including interests acquired after the liens were assessed.see shawnee state bank united states,cir t he lien attaches to all the property of the defaulting taxpayer,including property acquired by the taxpayer after the lien arises citing glass city bank united states.consequently,the federal tax liens attached to all of nerland oil property interests,including the promissory note acquired in exchange for the sale of the dakota fuel stop,which was signed after the federal tax liens were assessed.
superpumper attempts to distinguish this case from a typical lien priority case,arguing that as nerland oil debtor,not its creditor,superpumper debt was not part of the property subject to the federal tax liens because the funds used to complete the setoff credit card actually superpumper own funds held in trust by nerland oil,not the property of nerland oil,those funds were not part of the property subject to the federal tax liens and because the bankruptcy filing occurred after superpumper completion of the setoff transaction only the remaining amount on the promissory note and mortgage should be considered part of the bankruptcy estate 
we find these arguments unpersuasive.nothing distinguishes this case from typical lien priority cases.first,superpumper debt in the form of the promissory note constitutes the type of property typically subject to a federal tax lien.see louis union trust united states,cir considering escrow agreement providing income payable to to be property available to satisfy federal tax lien.we apply federal law to determine whether or not the interest at stake constitutes property for purposes of federal tax lien satisfaction.see drye united states,d whether a right constitutes property or rights to property under is a matter of federal law quoting united states national bank of commerce,d internal quotations omitted.property broadly includes every species of right or interest protected by law and having an exchangeable value.id.the promissory note clearly has right to collect payments on well as transferability.see black law dictionary ed defining promissory note as a negotiable instrument see also ucc categorizing a promissory note as a negotiable instrument.
