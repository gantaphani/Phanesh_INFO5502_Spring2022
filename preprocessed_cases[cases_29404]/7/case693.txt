when spartan international,incorporated,and its subsidiaries collectively spartan closed their doors for business,their major creditor commenced this action in the district of south carolina under state law.to facilitate the foreclosure of the creditor lien interest in spartan assets,the district court appointed a receiver for all of spartan assets.it also issued an injunction directed to all persons,commanding them not to file any action that affects spartan assets.
a week later,over creditors in the southern district of georgia the georgia creditors filed a petition against spartan for involuntary bankruptcy.the district court in south carolina declined to recognize the automatic stay of all judicial proceedings imposed by a with the filing of the bankruptcy petition and found the georgia creditors in contempt of court,but allowed them to purge their contempt by withdrawing their bankruptcy petition.
on this interlocutory appeal taken by the georgia creditors,we conclude,in the circumstances of this case,that the district court erred in failing to recognize the stay imposed by a,and therefore we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
on or about may,spartan closed its doors and turned over its assets to general electric capital corporation ge,which had extended spartan a line of credit of million,secured by substantially all of spartan assets.at the time,spartan owed ge approximately million.
spartan had been engaged in the manufacture of textiles for over years,and its headquarters were located in spartanburg,south carolina.it operated textile mills in six different locations,four in south carolina and two in georgia.spartan closed its business because it was unable to meet its obligations to ge,largely as a result of the generally deteriorating business conditions faced by the domestic textile industry.
invoking the district court diversity jurisdiction,ge promptly filed a verified complaint commencing this action against spartan for collection of the indebtedness and for the appointment of a receiver to take custody of spartan assets,dispose of them,and pay ge the amounts owed.spartan did not object to the receivership,and,on may,on ge motion and without notice to creditors of spartan,the district court appointed a receiver and required him to file a bond.paragraph of the district court may order provides in relevant part 
the defendants spartan,as well as their agents,servants,employees,attorneys and any persons acting for or on behalf of the receiver estates,and any persons receiving notice of this order,by personal service or otherwise,having possession or control of any of the property,business,books,records,accounts,or assets of the defendants or the receiver estates are hereby directed to deliver the same to the receiver,and all persons are enjoined from in any way commencing or prosecuting any action,suit or proceeding that affects the receiver estates or the defendants.
emphasis added.the order required that the receiver serve a copy of the may order on all persons identifiable from the books and records of the defendants as either employees as of may,or persons listed in the defendants accounts payable registers as soon as reasonably practicable by mail.
the receiver duly filed a copy of this order in each district where spartan had assets,including the southern district of georgia where one of its mills was located.the receiver also promptly commenced the liquidation of spartan assets,selling the mill in the southern district of georgia on may,for million.this sale was also made without notice to creditors.the receiver formally notified creditors and employees of the receivership in early june.
acting with actual notice of the may order but before receiving formal notice,over former employees of spartan georgia mill who had claims against spartan for wages,health care benefits,and amounts alleged to be due under the warn act,et,filed an petition against spartan in the southern district of georgia,where these petitioning employees had worked for spartan.these georgia creditors also filed,with their petition,a motion for the appointment of an interim trustee.ge objected to the appointment of an interim trustee and filed a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy petition or to transfer it to the district of south carolina.similarly,the receiver,on behalf of spartan,filed a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy proceeding or to transfer the case to south carolina based on improper venue.following a hearing on june and,the bankruptcy court overruled the objections of ge and the receiver,denied their motion to dismiss or transfer,and appointed an interim trustee.
while that hearing in georgia was in progress,the receiver obtained a temporary restraining order from the district of south carolina dated june,which specifically enjoined listed georgia creditors from undertaking any action in furtherance of the involuntary petition filed against spartan international in the southern district of georgia.this order was brought to the attention of the bankruptcy judge during the course of the hearing,and in response,the bankruptcy judge stated 
the tro did not enjoin this court from acting.i received a copy of the tro after all parties had completed their presentation on june,on the issues now determined but prior to my ruling from the bench.an interim trustee now appointed is not covered under the scope of the tro.additionally,the act of petitioning judge seymour district judge in the district of south carolina for the tro by beal,attorney on behalf of tourtellot,the receiver appointed by judge seymour,violated the provisions of a and.any act taken in violation of the automatic stay of is void.
the bankruptcy court also directed the interim trustee to show cause on june,why he or she should not be immediately directed to pay benefits from the assets recovered by the interim trustee to the petitioning creditors and all other similarly situated former employees under the warn act.
a few days later,on june,the district court in south carolina held a hearing,at which the receiver,the interim trustee,and the lawyer for the georgia creditors presented their positions and following which the court issued an order,dated june,finding the georgia creditors in contempt of the district court may order.but the court added,the georgia creditors may purge themselves of contempt by withdrawing the involuntary petition in bankruptcy within five days of the date of this order.the district court also directed that any persons desiring to proceed in bankruptcy court or otherwise evade the restrictions of paragraph of the may order appointing receiver may do so only upon prior application to this court for permission.in response to the interim trustee argument that the district court was bound by the automatic stay imposed by a,the district court stated that it had jurisdiction to determine not only its own jurisdiction but also the more precise question whether the proceeding pending before it is subject to the automatic stay,quoting in re.litigation,cir.exercising this power,the district court concluded that it was not subject to the stay imposed by a.rather,relying on the all writs act,the court declared that it had authority to issue writs necessary to aid in protecting its jurisdiction.it explained that because it had properly entered the receivership order,its injunction of may,was authorized under the all writs act 
the court finds and concludes that issuance of an injunction pursuant to the all writs act is a necessary means of allowing the court to discharge its duties and to prevent creditors of defendants from collaterally attacking the court order appointing receiver the may order.the court finds use of the all writs act to be justified under the facts presented,wherein the georgia creditors have made no showing that they will obtain relief in bankruptcy court for their unsecured claims,or that their claims may be paid over and above those claims of secured creditors and those of other unsecured creditors.
after entry of the district court june order,the georgia creditors,in an effort to purge their contempt,filed a petition in the bankruptcy court to withdraw their involuntary petition in bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court,however,denied the petition,concluding that the statutory requirements for dismissal of an petition had not been met.it did,however,stay further proceedings in the bankruptcy case pending our review of the south carolina district court orders.
the georgia creditors filed this appeal to review the district court may,june,and june orders,and they filed a motion to expedite the appeal.by order dated july,we granted the petition to expedite the appeal and heard oral argument from the parties on august.
at the outset,we must resolve ge challenge to our jurisdiction,made on the ground that the georgia creditors did not have standing to appeal because they were not parties to the action below,having never intervened there to challenge the district court injunctions.as ge states its position,because the appellants have elected not to intervene or to otherwise become parties to this action,they lack standing to appeal.ge also argues that because the georgia employees purged their contempt by filing a motion to withdraw their petition in bankruptcy,their appeal is moot.
appearing informally before the district court during the june hearing,two of the georgia creditors,who worked and now live in the southern district of georgia,contended that they were not subject to the district court may order and therefore could not have violated it when they filed their petition in bankruptcy.first,they argued that the language of the order did not prohibit the filing of a petition in bankruptcy.second,they suggested that the district court did not have power to enjoin them because they were not in the district of south carolina and,to be effective,all creditors had to be made parties.as counsel for these georgia creditors argued,i think your honor would have to make all the people parties to the lawsuit as opposed to a bankruptcy in order to address the warn act claims.in other words,you would have to make employees party to this particular lawsuit.finally,counsel for these georgia creditors argued that the district court receivership order,directing the receiver to pay ge on its secured claim,violated south carolina code,which gives manufacturing employees a lien in the products on which they worked superior to that of secured creditors,as does similar georgia law,and that therefore the may order was illegal in directing a violation of that priority.
although ge is correct in pointing out the general rule that only parties may appeal an adverse judgment,it must also recognize that in limited circumstances courts have held that nonparties have a right to challenge on appeal an order directed against them in a proceeding to which they were not a party.see generally lincoln thrift ass n,cir see also zenith radio hazeltine research,d noting that a parent company was entitled to appeal judgments and an injunction entered against it,when its subsidiary,but not it,was the named party to the action below.in titanic,haver,cir,we faced a circumstance similar to that presented here.the district court entered a preliminary injunction against a person who had never been served process and probably would not have been subject to service of process.even though the persons against whom the order was directed had notice of the district court order,we concluded that d ue process dictates and principles of fairness counsel that appellant be given an opportunity to challenge the district court assertion of jurisdiction over it,particularly when the court specifically entered an injunction against appellant.id.at.we also noted in titanic that the plaintiff position in seeking an injunction against the nonparty in the district court was inconsistent with its position that the persons covered by the injunction did not have standing to challenge the injunction on appeal.see id.
in the case before us,the district court clearly had personal jurisdiction over the,spartan,and the well as in rem jurisdiction over the assets of spartan.and while a district court in rem jurisdiction ordinarily extends only to property within its jurisdiction,in the case of a federal receivership,congress has conditionally extended the scope of a court jurisdiction.see.section provides that a receiver may be appointed for property situated in different districts,who thereby becomes vested with jurisdiction and control over such property subject to the condition that the receiver file a copy of the complaint and order of appointment in the district where the subject property is located,within ten days.it also provides that the receiver may sue and be sued in any district where such property is located without leave of the appointing court.see.but such in rem jurisdiction over property in other districts does not give a district court personal jurisdiction over persons in such other districts absent an express congressional grant of personal jurisdiction.while the court has power to protect the res before the court,any injunction entered against individuals is an in personam action that may be enforced against individuals only over whom the court has personal jurisdiction.see titanic,at.thus,unless the district court had personal jurisdiction over the georgia creditors and they were served with process,the district court could be without power to enforce an injunction against them,unless,of course,they could be shown to have been in active concert or participation with parties over whom the court had jurisdiction.see.d.
while an absence of personal jurisdiction has not yet been explicitly asserted nor been addressed by the district court,the georgia creditors had several nonfrivolous reasons on which to question the district court authority to issue an injunction directed against them personally,which would reasonably justify their reluctance to intervene below.but when they were faced with a contempt finding,made in the june order,they obviously had a legitimate reason to want to challenge the order on appeal.
ge argues that even if the georgia creditors have that right,their appeal is moot because the georgia creditors purged the contempt finding by filing a motion to withdraw their petition in bankruptcy.the georgia creditors note,however,that they filed their motion to withdraw only because the district court took a position that it had effectively ordered them to do so when it found them in contempt and declared that this finding could be purged only upon compliance with the court order to withdraw the petition.but they continue to disagree with and challenge the district court authority both to enter the injunction against them and to find them in contempt.
moreover,while the georgia creditors did file a motion to withdraw their bankruptcy petition,they could not withdraw the petition because their motion was denied by the bankruptcy court.therefore their efforts may not in fact have been sufficient to purge themselves of contempt.the district court order authorized relief from contempt only by withdrawing the involuntary petition in bankruptcy.
more importantly,however,the injunctive orders directed against these georgia creditors have not been withdrawn and remain in effect.ge did not hesitate,in oral argument,to take the position that if the georgia creditors were again to violate the july order,they could again be found in contempt.
accordingly,we conclude that both the contempt finding,as well as the continuing effect of the injunctions,provide a sufficient threat to the georgia creditors to give them standing to appeal.in doing so,we do not rule on the question whether the district court has personal jurisdiction over the georgia creditors.that issue has been addressed neither by the parties nor by the district court.
we come now to the question of whether the district court erred in concluding that its receivership proceeding was not subject to the automatic stay provisions of a and that therefore the receivership should be given preference as the case.the district court concluded that it did have preference because when the receivership was commenced,it took legal custody of spartan assets and was ther
