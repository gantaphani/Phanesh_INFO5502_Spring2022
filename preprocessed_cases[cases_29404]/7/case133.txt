ralph and lola sayer owned a farm in canton,maine.between and,a predecessor to the farm service agency the fsa a federal government several loans to the sayers,taking mortgages on the farm and security interests in their farming equipment,crops,and livestock.in the sayers filed for bankruptcy,leading in to a confirmed plan under chapter of the bankruptcy code,in which their debt of about to the fsa was reduced to just under.the government says that this was about the value of the real and personal property on which the fsa held liens.
the sayers committed to make monthly payments for three years to a trustee who in turn would pay various creditors,and thereafter to make payments themselves directly to creditors the fsa was to receive per month for years and then reduced payments for an additional period.the sayers made the required payments to the trustee for the three years possibly late in some instances and received a discharge in or.thereafter,they failed to pay the fsa and also failed to pay certain real property taxes on the farm to the town of canton.
under maine law a mortgage is subordinate to a tax lien on real property,and when the sayers failed to pay their delinquent taxes,the town foreclosed on the farm on april.ann.tit.on may,the town sold the property by quitclaim deed to robert reisner and his wife for,the amount of taxes due.at this time,according to the government,the property was worth.by its terms the quitclaim deed conveyed to reisner whatever interest the town possessed.
on january,the united states brought suit in the federal district court in maine to foreclose its mortgages,claiming that the sayers now owed the fsa well over,with interest continuing to accumulate.reisner having become sole owner was named as a defendant along with the sayers he took the position that the fsa period to redeem the property had passed and it had no interest left to foreclose.the sayers,initially proceeding pro se,contested the amount that the fsa said they still owed.
after extensive proceedings before a magistrate judge and the district judge,the district court eventually entered a judgment determining that the fsa held valid mortgages and foreclosing the mortgages reisner was held to be entitled to a priority over the fsa for the that he had paid to discharge the tax lien.the district court adopted the government computation of the amount then due from the sayers,now risen to over because of accumulating interest.both reisner and the sayers now appeal.
we begin with reisner claim that the district court erred in sustaining the fsa mortgages as against his own title to the farm.under maine law a municipality may file a certificate creating a tax lien on real property if an assessed tax is more than eight months overdue.ann.tit.at the time of the recording of the tax lien certificate in the registry of deeds,the tax collector is required to send notice to the taxpayer and any mortgagee of record.id.no such notice was sent to the fsa in this case.
filing the certificate creates a tax lien mortgage on the real estate having priority over all other mortgages,liens,attachments and encumbrances of any nature,and the municipality is given all the rights usually incident to a mortgagee save that it can not take possession until the right of redemption shall have expired.ann.tit.the redemption period,during which the real estate can be redeemed by paying taxes due plus interest and costs,lasts months from the filing.id.
if this amount is not paid within months,the tax lien mortgage shall be deemed to have been foreclosed and the right of redemption to have expired.ann.tit.however,the municipal treasurer must notify the taxpayer and mortgagees of record to days before the automatic foreclosure date if the treasurer is late in providing notice,redemption is allowed within days after untimely notice is provided.id.the fsa was not given notice by the town prior to the automatic foreclosure date.
where no redemption occurs within the period prescribed,that the statutory procedures have been interest of the taxpayer and mortgagees is extinguished.morissette connors,me taxpayer ocwen fed.bank,fsb gile,me mortgagee.in this instance,while neither of the required notices of the foreclosure were given to the fsa,the government concedes that by the fsa did obtain actual knowledge of the tax lien and foreclosure.
in the district court,reisner argued that the statute directly addresses such a situation by providing 
after the expiration of the period for redemption,the mortgagee of record of said real estate or his assignee and the owner of record if the said real estate has not been assessed to him or the person claiming under him shall,in the event the notice provided for said mortgagee and said owner has not been given as provided in section,have the right to redeem the said real estate within months after receiving actual knowledge of the recording of the tax lien certificate by payment or tender of the amount of the tax lien mortgage,together with interest and costs,and the tax lien mortgage shall then be discharged by the owner thereof in the manner provided.
ann.tit,emphasis added.
the government concedes that after the fsa had obtained actual knowledge of the tax lien certificate in,it did not pay or tender the taxes due within three months or at any time thereafter.instead,the fsa waited several years and then sought in the present case to foreclose its mortgages and other security interests,as if its mortgage interest had never been supplanted by the town foreclosure and subsequent sale to that the government is willing now to pay reisner out of the proceeds of its own mortgage sale the amount that he paid in taxes.
the government admits that under the maine statute the town itself had title to the property,subject to the fsa mortgages which would terminate if the fsa gained actual knowledge of the tax lien and failed to redeem the property within three months.but,the government argues,once the town sold to reisner,the a mortgagee who had not gotten the statutory maintain its mortgages against reisner without having to comply with the redemption provision,so long as it refunded to him what he had paid.the government deems it irrelevant that the town quitclaim deed explicitly conveyed to reisner all rights that the town possessed.
there are rare situations where a seller can not convey all of what he himself possessed,but we do not read the maine statute as contemplating such an outcome.section language appears to cut off after months the redemption rights of mortgagees who learn of foreclosure,even though not properly notified at the outset,unless within three months of receiving actual knowledge they pay or tender the taxes which the owner of the tax lien mortgage shall discharge the tax lien mortgage.ann.tit,emphasis added.
this wording suggests,albeit obliquely,that the owner of the tax lien mortgage or the property if foreclosure occurred,and not merely the town as owner,has reciprocal rights to defeat redemption claims by unnotified mortgagees who did not so pay or tender within three months of actual knowledge.the magistrate judge said that section did not apply because the fsa could not pay or tender the sayers taxes to the town,reisner having already paid them but the short answer is that the fsa could have paid them to the owner reisner and then it did so within three months.
the inferences in reisner favor from ordinary practice the ability to convey what one owns and from the specific reference to the owner are reinforced by even more potent arguments from purpose and policy.the town ability to collect taxes through a foreclosure sale would surely be impaired if the government position prevailed.were the tax lien amount close to the value of the property,no reasonable purchaser would be likely to pay anything close to the full taxes due for a property that could,if the value went up,be redeemed by the mortgagee not merely for three months after notice but forever.
further,once a mortgagee has actual knowledge of the foreclosure,as the fsa did here,it is hard to see why it should not be expected to act within three months,whether th
