john douglas smith smith appeals the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court,which denied his effort to exempt from his bankruptcy estate property that he characterized as a private retirement plan.his appeal raises two questions,both of which are novel in this circuit first,whether the indefinite continuance of a bankruptcy code a meeting of creditors tolls the period for filing objections to property claimed as exempt under l and second,whether conversion of the case from chapter to chapter triggers a new period within which to file objections to property already excluded as exempt during the chapter proceeding.we answer both questions in the negative.
background 
the following facts are undisputed.on august,smith filed a petition for bankruptcy under chapter.on august,smith timely filed exemptions for various assets,including pursuant to l of the bankruptcy code,his limited partnership interest in bellwood limited partnership bellwood.the assets in bellwood consist of three real estate properties that were purchased by smith and his wife during the period from through.smith contends that these investments were held exclusively for retirement purposes,and that he transferred the properties to bellwood for tax and estate planning reasons.on this basis,smith claimed that bellwood is a private retirement plan under california law and is therefore exempt from the bankruptcy estate.we express no view as to the merits of that claim.
objections 
the trustee convened a meeting of creditors,pursuant to a,on september.the meeting was continued to september and then to october.at the conclusion of the october meeting,the trustee announced time been noted at.this a meeting in john douglas smith is hereby adjourned until further notice.thank you very much.no further notice was ever given and no subsequent meeting ever took place under chapter.the appellees objected to smith exemptions on june,almost eight months later.smith filed a motion to dismiss these objections on the ground that they were not timely filed,which the bankruptcy court denied.the bankruptcy court also sustained the creditors objection to smith exemption of bellwood.smith appealed this decision on november.
objections 
on april,the case was converted to a chapter proceeding,pursuant to b,and a chapter trustee was appointed,pursuant to.on june,another meeting of creditors was convened.the trustee continued the creditors meeting until july,and again until august.the creditors filed supplemental objections in july of,and the trustee objected to smith exemptions on august.both sets of objections were filed within thirty days of the continued creditors meeting.on september,the bankruptcy court entered an order sustaining the objections to smith exemptions and smith appealed.
district court opinions 
smith appealed the bankruptcy court pre and rulings.on february,the district court entered an order denying smith november,appeal of the rulings.the district court ruled that it need not determine whether the creditors objections were timely.because conversion requires a new creditors meeting to be held,the district court found that conversion started a new period for filing objections,and that the creditors may object to any exemptions claimed pre or.since smith had converted his chapter bankruptcy to chapter,the objections period had restarted,and the timeliness issue was ruled moot.accordingly,the court deferred ruling on the merits of smith claimed exemption until it addressed the appeal from smith chapter action.smith kennedy,no.cal.
on september,the district court entered its opinion in the chapter action.the district court rejected smith argument that the october,chapter creditors meeting should not have been continued indefinitely,and that the period within which the creditors could object to smith exemptions ran from the date of that meeting.instead,the court found that the trustee continued the meeting indefinitely,and that objections were appropriate until the meeting was finally concluded.the court then reaffirmed its february holding that,because conversion renews the objection process,the subsequent objections were timely.reaching the merits of the case,the court ruled that bellwood did not qualify as a private retirement plan,and on that basis sustained the creditors objections to the plan.smith kennedy,no.smith filed a timely appeal.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court decision on an appeal from a bankruptcy court de novo.see richmond united states,cir.thus,we apply the same standard of review that the district court applied.see in re chang,cir.we review the bankruptcy court findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.see in re filtercorp,cir.
iii.analysis 
when an individual debtor petitions for bankruptcy he is entitled to claim certain property as exempt from the estate.see b allowing debtor to elect to take exemptions provided by state or federal law id.l requiring debtor to file list of property claimed as exempt see also fed.a.any creditor and the bankruptcy trustee may file objections to the debtor list of properties claimed as exempt.see fed.b.however,absent special circumstances,these objections must be filed within days after the conclusion of the meeting of creditors held pursuant to rule a.id.if no objections are made,then the property claimed as exempt is exempt.l.
the commencement of a voluntary case under chapter constitutes an order for relief.see.the bankruptcy code provides that w ithin a reasonable time after the order for relief in a case under this title,the united states trustee shall convene and preside at a meeting of creditors.a.rule includes provisions governing the time during which the meeting must be convened and the manner of its continuance.see rules a,e.although it does not provide a rule expressly stating the manner in which a meeting is to be concluded,rule e provides that t he meeting may be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the meeting of the adjourned date and time without further written notice.
smith voluntarily filed for chapter bankruptcy on august.the original creditors meeting,on september,was timely,and the first two adjournments,to september and october,are not at issue.however,smith argues that the october,meeting of creditors was not adjourned but concluded,because the trustee failed to specify a new meeting date,and that the creditors objections,almost eight months later,were untimely.the creditors claim that smith exemptions were meritless.however,we may not reach the merits of the claimed exemptions absent a finding that the creditors objections were timely made.in taylor freeland kronz,d,the debtor claimed a meritless exemption.had the trustee or creditors objected to the claim within days after the initial creditors meeting,as required under rule b,the property could have been retained in the bankruptcy estate.at.however,their failure to do so within that period,the supreme court ruled,prevented them from challenging the validity of the exemption later whether or not the debtor had a colorable statutory basis for claiming it.id.at.thus,before we may reach the merits of smith purported exemption,we must determine whether the creditors objections were timely.
the creditors argue that rule e permits a trustee to continue indefinitely a meeting of creditors,and,alternatively,that under bankruptcy code section,conversion of the proceedings from a chapter reorganization into a chapter liquidation begins a new period for objections to property already exempted.rule e permits adjournment from time to time italics added,and requires the trustee to announce the adjourned date and time if he chooses to exercise this option.the plain language of the statute requires that for a rule e adjournment to be effective,it must be accompanied by an announcement of the adjourned date and time.see in re hurdle,in re levitt.no other procedure for adjournment is provided by rule or statute,and no other method of adjournment is permitted under rule e 
as the supreme court observed in taylor,d eadlines may lead to unwelcome results,but they prompt parties to act and they produce finality.at.to a
