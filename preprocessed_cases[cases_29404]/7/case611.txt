the issue presented by this appeal is whether an order denying the trustee motion to dismiss a debtor chapter bankruptcy case as abusive under b is a final order appealable under a.the district court dismissed the trustee appeal,ruling that the bankruptcy court order was interlocutory and therefore not appealable to the district court.
because of the particular effect that an order denying a motion to dismiss a chapter bankruptcy case as abusive has on the bankruptcy proceedings,we conclude that a bankruptcy court order denying such a motion is appealable to the district court.accordingly,we vacate the district court order dismissing the trustee appeal and remand for further proceedings.
david and anne dudley filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code on august.when the chapter trustee moved to dismiss the case or to convert it to a chapter case,the dudleys filed a motion to convert their case to a chapter case,which the bankruptcy court granted.thereafter,the trustee,clarkson mcdow,filed a motion to dismiss the chapter case under b as abusive.in support of his motion,the trustee asserted that the dudleys failed the means test under b,claiming that their income,after the deduction of appropriate expenses,would leave the dudleys with over per month to pay creditors.the trustee also relied on b,alleging that the dudleys overall circumstances demonstrated abuse because they had the financial ability to repay their creditors.
the dudleys opposed the trustee motion to dismiss and filed a motion for summary judgment,contending that b did not apply to a case such as theirs where the petition was initially filed under chapter and thereafter converted to a chapter case.they relied on the language of b,which authorizes the bankruptcy court to dismiss a case filed by an individual debtor under this chapter,arguing that this chapter refers to chapter.
the bankruptcy court agreed with the dudleys.although it recognized that it was ruling against the considerable weight of authority,it held that the plain meaning of filed under this chapter only included cases in which the petition was originally filed under chapter and did not encompass converted cases,such as the dudleys case.in re dudley.thus,the bankruptcy court denied the trustee motion to dismiss the bankruptcy case under b and entered summary judgment on the issue in favor of the dudleys.id.at.
the trustee appealed the bankruptcy court order to the district court,and the district court,acting sua sponte,dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.mcdow dudley.the district court held that the bankruptcy judge order was not final within the meaning of a conferring appellate jurisdiction on district courts for review of final judgments,orders,and decrees of bankruptcy judges.id.at.
this appeal followed.
while this appeal was pending,the bankruptcy court continued with the case and ultimately entered an order,over the trustee objection,discharging the dudleys debts.the trustee argued that the order of discharge was improper because the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction while the case was on appeal and bankruptcy rule c d prohibits discharge if a motion to dismiss the case under is pending.the bankruptcy court responded to the trustee argument,stating that should the court of appeals reverse the district court and the district court reverse this court decision to deny the motion to dismiss,which would dismiss the debtor case,the discharge granted by this court could be vacated.in re dudley.the trustee appealed the bankruptcy court discharge order,as well as all prior interlocutory orders that are merged into the final discharge order,and the district court has stayed that appeal pending resolution of this appeal.
the district court appellate jurisdiction over bankruptcy orders is governed by a,which provides,as pertinent here,that the district courts of the united states shall have jurisdiction to hear appeals from final judgments,orders,and decrees entered in cases and proceedings referred to the bankruptcy judges under section of this title.a.the district court concluded that a bankruptcy order denying the trustee motion to dismiss a bankruptcy proceeding under b as abusive is not a final order.the court explained that because the bankruptcy court had not yet decided whether the dudleys would receive a discharge in bankruptcy,the decision to be reviewed here is subject to being overtaken or superseded by other proceedings in the bankruptcy court and hardly seems ripe for appellate review.mcdow,at.
thus,the question presented is whether a bankruptcy judge order denying a b motion to dismiss a chapter bankruptcy case as abusive is a final order within the meaning of a.
we have recognized as a general matter,as have other courts of appeals,that the concept of finality in bankruptcy cases has traditionally been applied in a more pragmatic and less technical way than in other situations.in re computer learning,cir quoting robins piccinin,cir alteration in original see also in re asarco,cir in re marcal paper mills,cir ritchie special credit,trustee,cir in re mckinney,cir in re rudler,cir.as we explained in robins 
the special or unique reason for this relaxed rule of appealability in bankruptcy is that b ankruptcy cases frequently involve protracted proceedings with many parties participating.to avoid the waste of time and resources that might result from reviewing discrete portions of the action only after a plan of reorganization is approved,courts have permitted appellate review of orders that in other contexts might be considered interlocutory.
at quoting in re amatex,cir.thus,because of the special nature of bankruptcy proceedings,which often involve multiple parties,claims,and procedures,the postponing of review by the district court and the court of appeals of discrete issues could result in the waste of valuable time and already scarce resources.see id.at see also in re northwood,cir.we have concluded,therefore,that orders in bankruptcy cases may be immediately appealed if they finally dispose of discrete disputes within the larger case.in re computer learning,at quoting in re saco local dev,cir.
noting this jurisprudence,the trustee contends that,in this case,an order denying a b motion to dismiss should be treated as a final order because it resolves a discrete dispute within a larger bankruptcy proceeding and therefore would be immediately appealable.the particular nature of a b motion,the trustee argues,distinguishes such a motion from motions to dismiss generally,such as those under federal rule of civil procedure b or under b authorizing an action to dismiss a chapter proceeding for cause.focusing on a b motion,the trustee suggests that it functions as a complaint that alleges a statutorily mandated cause of action for dismissal of a case that is abusive,and the denial of the motion therefore effectively extinguishes that claim.without immediate review,the bankruptcy proceedings would continue with the liquidation and distribution of the debtors assets,with the effect that the issue of bankruptcy abuse would be resolved only after the assets of the debtor have been liquidated and distributed.this scenario would result in significant inefficiency by depleting the resources of the judicial system and by exhausting debtor resources that could otherwise be used to pay creditors.in addition,the trustee points out,the postponing of review of the denial of a b motion until the assets have been liquidated and distributed could result in substantial unfairness and inefficiency because the bankruptcy proceedings and distributions would then have to be unwound after appeal,if that were then possible.
the dudleys contend that the denial of a b motion to dismiss is not a final order because it does not represent the conclusive resolution of a discrete dispute within the larger bankruptcy case.they argue that the denial simply permits the case to continue in the same way that denial of a federal rule of civil procedure b motion to dismiss in civil cases permits the case to continue.the dudleys claim that allowing immediate appeal from the
