laying the groundwork 
what happened in this bankruptcy case is probably every homeowner worst nightmare.we start,naturally,with the facts,which are either undisputed or based on the bankruptcy judge findings.
having just moved with his year old son from anchorage,alaska to acton,massachusetts,david sharfarz started talking to contractors in the summer of about building an addition to his new home.sharfarz ended up hiring peter goguen,who drafted up a contract.stripped to its essentials,the contract specified different construction phases,requiring goguen to pour the foundation by october,for example.it required goguen to obtain the necessary town permits too.it also required sharfarz to make progress payments to goguen totaling roughly.and it set a completion date of march.
sharfarz made no secret of the fact that he needed goguen to start the project right away,for these reasons first,he wanted his son to settle into his new life as quickly as possible,and second,he wanted the foundation poured before winter because he feared that a concrete pouring could cause the foundation to crack.sitting in sharfarz living room,the two signed the contract and sharfarz handed goguen a check as the first installment payment.and sharfarz again stressed why sticking to the schedule was so important to him.
a week or so later goguen emailed sharfarz that he had filed a application with the town and was in wait mode.but that was not true,and goguen did his best to keep sharfarz from finding that out.over the next couple of months,for example,every time a worried sharfarz asked him for a permit update,goguen blamed the delay on town bureaucrats.and when sharfarz offered to talk to the town manager or a member of the board of selectmen,a nervous goguen called it the worst thing we could do.no need to aggravate the building inspector by going over the inspector head,goguen said.we just have sit tight until the town acts,he added.
that did little to calm sharfarz,who had a gnawing belief that project delays would expose him to the risk of concrete damage due to the onset of winter.one of sharfarz november emails to goguen made this perfectly plain i would like a better understanding as to how we will keep the foundation warm to help the concrete strengthen and harden after a pouring,he wrote.i know there are ways to do it,but i assume that they all cost money.this,he wrote,is pretty much the only aspect of a wintertime that is concerning me.goguen replied that weather protection wo be an issue until night time temperatures dip below freezing.
with the cold season fast approaching,goguen did little to advance the project.misled into thinking that the town was at fault for the permit holdup and still convinced that they would be inviting trouble if they poured concrete in the cold,sharfarz proposed the following solution they would shut down the project for now.goguen would keep of the payment for his troubles and refund the remaining money to sharfarz.when the warm weather returned,they would restart the project,and goguen would get back the rest of the initial payment.this made good sense,sharfarz said.but not to goguen.he assured sharfarz that the foundation would not crack from a pouring,explaining that new england is a lot warmer than alaska and that we put additives in the concrete to prevent cracking.pourings are done routinely throughout new england all winter long it no big deal,goguen said or words to that effect.and rather than give sharfarz any money back,goguen instead offered a year warranty against structural defect s in the new footing and concrete foundation.all of this persuaded sharfarz to continue with the contract.goguen was the expert,sharfarz later explained,and i just relented.
goguen finally applied for the building permit on november,two months after he said he had and he asked the town to expedite things so that he could move forward on the foundation before the cold of winter sets in.he knew that it gets tougher and tougher to pour concrete with each passing winter day,you see.the town issued the permit days later,on december.critically,had goguen not duped sharfarz into thinking that he had filed the application way back in september,sharfarz would have confronted goguen and depending on how that went either canceled the contract or put the project off to the spring.but not knowing the truth,sharfarz let goguen pour the concrete around christmas,despite the very cold weather.unfortunately,the foundation would eventually crack just as sharfarz feared it would.and sharfarz did and does blame goguen and his concrete pouring for this.
in any event,sharfarz continued making progress payments,even though goguen made little progress goguen would start a new phase of the project,ask for and receive money without finishing the work,and then do the same thing over and over again all the while trying to keep sharfarz in the dark.at one point goguen asked sharfarz for more money so that he could hire another worker to get the project back on track.sharfarz ponied up the extra money,but goguen never hired extra help.goguen also recommended that sharfarz upgrade the home electrical service.sharfarz came up with the additional cash for the upgrade,but goguen never did the work.
things went from bad to worse for sharfarz.by november he had paid goguen the full contract price,and then some.yet goguen threatened not to finish the project unless he got more money.sharfarz said no.goguen walked.and sharfarz had to pay other contractors to finish the job.
sharfarz sued goguen in massachusetts state court,relying on certain laws.see.laws ch.laws ch.goguen did not appear.after entering a default judgment against him,a state judge held an evidentiary hearing to assess damages.sharfarz testified there.but goguen was a,despite being notified about the proceeding.
as part of his findings of fact and conclusions of law a document admitted as an exhibit at the bankruptcy trial,the state judge wrote that goguen was both deceptive and unfair,almost from the beginning and to the end,and that his violations had been willful and knowing.turning to the concrete issue,the state judge found that 
t he concrete foundation walls for the basement and the garage were poured christmas week,in very cold weather,and subsequently cracked.they admitted a substantial amount of water,which because goguen had not poured the concrete floors drained into the gravel subfloors.
there is a particularly aggravated character to several of goguen violations,the state judge said,pointing to among other things goguen d elaying the building permit application for nearly three months and lying about it,thereby delaying the start date till the onset of winter the state judge also found that sharfarz had spent close to on contractors and suppliers to complete most of the work that goguen had left undone.and,the state judge added,sharfarz would have to spend another to finish the project.so the state judge set sharfarz damages at,which he trebled to as state law allowed,and set sharfarz attorney fees and costs at.ultimately,then,the state judge awarded sharfarz judgment in the amount of.
at some point goguen filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.quite predictably,sharfarz reacted by petitioning to have his judgment against goguen declared nondischargeable,relying on a bankruptcy code provision that bars discharge of any debt for money to the extent obtained by false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud a a 
both sharfarz and goguen who represented himself took the stand during the trial before the bankruptcy judge.sharfarz testified in line with the facts as we have presented them.goguen disagreed with pretty much everything sharfarz said,and he blamed the project failure on his misestimating what it would cost to do the job.and he owned up to some project mismanagement too.no one else testified.
having heard from them and examined the exhibits,the bankruptcy judge sided with sharfarz.his reasoning ran this way.accurately stating the law,the bankruptcy judge stressed that a creditor must establish six things to exclude a debt from discharge under this provision 
the debtor made a knowingly false representation or one made in reckless disregard of the truth,the debtor intended to deceive,the debtor intended to induce the creditor to rely upon the false statement,the creditor actually relied upon the false statement,the creditor reliance was justifiable,and the reliance upon the false statement caused damage.
in re spigel,cir footnote omitted explaining that the first two components of this test describe conduct and scienter required to show fraudulent conduct generally while the last four embody the requirement that the claim of the creditor arguing nondischargeability in an adversary proceeding must arise as a direct result of the debtor fraud.moving on,the bankruptcy judge found that sharfarz had made it crystal clear to goguen how important the timing of construction was to him.but goguen still lied to sharfarz about the status to keep sharfarz from cancelling the contract.had goguen not lied,the bankruptcy judge added,sharfarz would have canceled the agreement and received all or most of his initial payment.and,according to the bankruptcy judge,goguen false representations about the permit which sharfarz justifiably relied on kept sharfarz from doing just that.ultimately,sharfarz incurred in damages because of goguen breach of the construction contract,damages which he incurred because goguen had lied to him in september to keep him from cancelling the contract.all of this made the nondischargeable,the bankruptcy judge ruled,though he did not say what part of the went to fixing the foundation sharfarz simply testified that the fix cost thousands of dollars and what part went to finishing the project.also,the judge did not say why he deemed only nondischargeable and not the rest of sharfarz claim a number reached we remind the reader after the state judge trebled the in damages and awarded attorney fees and costs.see cohen de la cruz,d holding that a a prevents the discharge of all liability arising from fraud,stressing that this provision applies to treble damages and to attorney fees and costs.more on that a little later.
goguen now represented by counsel appealed to the bankruptcy appellate panel bap,which reversed.the whole case turned on causation no one contested the other elements,the bap said.and,the bap correctly observed,causation here has two components.the first is cause in fact,which means that goguen misrepresentations must have played a substantial part,and so were a substantial factor,in affecting sharfarz course of conduct that result ed in his loss.see restatement second of torts cmt.the second is legal cause,which means that sharfarz loss must have been one reasonably expected to result from his reliance on goguen misrepresentations.see id.foreseeability is the watchword.see id.cmt.
the bankruptcy judge did not differentiate between cause in fact and legal cause,the bap noted.noting that a comment to the restatement says that i f the misrepresentation has not in fact been relied upon by the recipient in entering into a transaction in which he suffers pecuniary loss,the misrepresentation is not in fact a cause of the loss under the rule stated,id.cmt,the bap held that the rule required that sharfarz show that goguen permit misrepresentations induced him to enter into the construction contract.true,the timing of the project was critical to sharfarz,and goguen lies might have prevented sharfarz from canceling the contract,the bap wrote.but goguen misrepresentations the contract signing and so could not possibly have induced sharfarz to enter into the contract in the first instance.cause in fact was absent then.same for legal cause,the bap added,since goguen could not have foreseen that sharfarz would have to pay an extra over the original contract price because he goguen had misrepresented the status of the permit application for a period after the contract,as a fallback,it was foreseeable that goguen could have finished the project in a timely,manner,even after lying about the permit,thereby preventing sharfarz pecuniary loss.wrapping up,the bap explained that goguen negligence in the project cost and the resulting breach of contract may have caused sharfarz harm,but,the bap said,debts arising from situations like that are not excepted from discharge under.
sharfarz now appeals to us.
highlighting some legal principles 
in cases like this one we zero in on the bankruptcy judge ruling,affording review to any challenges and de novo review to any legal ones.see,in re bank of new eng,cir in re werthen,cir.we give the bap decision no formal deference,but we do draw on its expertise in bankruptcy matters.see,in re bank of new eng,at in re bankvest capital,cir.
the parties dispute here centers on causation,and we review a bankruptcy judge causation finding for clear error unless he applied the wrong legal standard,in which case our review is de novo.see clement united states,cir see also in re am.bridge,cir.also,because one of the bankruptcy code chief aims is to give the deserving debtor a fresh start,we read exceptions to dischargeability narrowly.see,in re spigel,at internal quotation marks omitted.that means that a person in sharfarz shoes must show that his claim fits squarely within a specific exception set out in the bankruptcy code.see,id.internal quotation marks omitted.and as the party seeking an exception to discharge,sharfarz had the burden of proving nondischargeability by a preponderance of the evidence.see,grogan garner,d.
working through the issues 
an admittedly confusing concept,see united states hatfield,cir posner,causation is composed of cause in fact and legal cause,as we said earlier.in the typical case,the causal relation between the defendant conduct and the plaintiff injury need only be probable.see,samos imex nextel commc ns,cir explaining that tort causation requires that the plaintiff show that it is more probable than not that the injury was caused by the action or event or a combination of them for which the defendant is responsible.of course,a superseding cause something that intervenes between the defendant wrongful act and the plaintiff injury,snap ping the causal chain that links the act to the injury can wip e out the defendant liability but the burden of proving this is on the defendant.bcs,heartwood,llc,cir posner,citation and internal quotation marks omitted accord wojciechowicz united states,cir declaring that p roximate cause is not proven if the defendant can show the occurrence of an intervening cause that was foreseeable parker gerrish,cir noting that the defendant has the burden of showing an independent intervening event.
the bankruptcy judge in his opinion did not home in on the differences between cause in fact and legal cause.neither does sharfarz in his brief.but our de novo review leads us to conclude that sharfarz satisfied his causation burden.
cause in fact 
the issue is fairly easy,given the bankruptcy judge factual finding had goguen not lied to sharfarz about the status,the judge stressed after canvassing the evidence,sharfarz would have canceled the construction contract and gotten back all or most of the initial payment.of course,we must accept this finding unless clearly erroneous a formidable standard,requiring a strong,unyielding belief that the bankruptcy judge made a mistake.see cumpiano banco santander,cir.viewing the record as a whole,as we must,see,we see nothing resembling clear error here.and given this finding,we have no trouble concluding that goguen conduct played a substantial role,and thus was a substantial factor,in shaping the course of conduct that result ed in sharfarz loss meaning that we can put a check mark next to cause in fact on the causation list.see restatement second of torts cmt.
wait a minute,says goguen.echoing the very restatement comment that the bap had quoted that if a party has not in fact relied on the misrepresentation in entering into a transaction in which he suffers pecuniary loss,then the misrepresentation is not in fact a cause of the loss,id.cmt.a emphases added goguen implies that the construction contract here is an example of what the comment refers to as a transaction.and,arg
