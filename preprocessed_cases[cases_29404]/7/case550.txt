opinion of the court 
the issues in this bankruptcy appeal involve the doctrine of successor liability and arise out of the bankruptcy court order approving the sale of the assets of trans world airlines twa to american airlines american.the primary question is whether the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court order,which had the effect of extinguishing the liability of american,as successor to twa,for employment discrimination claims against twa and for the travel voucher program awarded to twa flight attendants in settlement of a sex discrimination class action.because section f of the bankruptcy code permits a sale of property free and clear of an interest in such property,and because the claims against twa here were connected to or arise from the assets sold,we affirm the bankruptcy court order approving the sale free and clear of successor liability.
facts and procedural background 
we first review the factual background as it relates to the two types of claims under consideration here,the travel voucher program and the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc claims.
a.the travel voucher program 
in regard to the travel voucher program,two separate federal actions were filed.in,the eeoc filed an action in the united states district court for the central district of california against twa and against twa flight attendant collective bargaining representative.the collective bargaining representative subsequently aligned itself with the eeoc as a plaintiff.in,linda filed a separate suit on her own behalf and on behalf of other female flight attendants,solely against twa,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.the principal contention of the two lawsuits was that twa former maternity leave of absence policy for flight attendants,including placing female flight attendants on leave immediately upon becoming pregnant,constituted sex discrimination in violation of title vii of the civil rights act of,as amended,et.in,the case was certified as a class action and thereafter consolidated with the eeoc suit filed in the central district of california.
eventually,in,both lawsuits were settled under a settlement agreement.the terms of the agreement required twa to provide ten travel vouchers for each covered pregnancy to eligible class members who timely submitted a notarized proof of claim form to the eeoc hereafter the travel voucher program.the agreement provided that travel vouchers could be used by the class member or her family at any time during her life subject to certain age limitations for dependent children.under the program,anyone traveling on one of these vouchers could be bumped by a paying passenger.approximately class members each received on average twenty five vouchers under the settlement agreement.most flight attendants,as was their prerogative,elected to save the vouchers for long trips to be taken after retirement when they had more time to travel and would receive more favorable tax consequences for use of the vouchers.
eeoc claims 
in addition to the claims arising out of the travel voucher program,as of march,charges of discrimination had been filed against twa with the eeoc or simultaneously filed with both the eeoc and a state or local fair employment practices agency the charges alleged various violations of several federal employment discrimination statutes,including title vii,the americans with disabilities act,and the age discrimination in employment act.the appellants,the eeoc and the united states collectively the eeoc,assert that they are unable to estimate the value,if any,of these claims,or the likelihood that the eeoc would commence litigation on the basis of any of these claims.
american purchase of twa assets 
on january,twa filed a chapter bankruptcy petition although it was the nation eighth largest airline at the time,it had not earned a profit in over a decade months earlier,in the spring of,twa determined that it could not continue to operate as an independent airline and that it needed to enter into a strategic transaction,such as a merger with,or sale of,twa as a going concern to another airline.see in re trans world airlines,et,slip op.at,wl,hereafter order on emergency stay motions.throughout,twa held intermittent discussions with american concerning the possibility of a strategic partnership.on january,american contacted twa with a proposal to purchase substantially all of twa assets.on january,american agreed to a purchase plan subject to an auction and bankruptcy court approval.
though twa assets were being sold under a bidding process,as of february,the deadline for the submission of bids,twa had not received any alternate proposals other than american that conformed with the bidding procedures.accordingly,twa board of directors voted to accept american proposal to purchase twa assets for million.
bankruptcy court and district court approval of sale 
the eeoc and the class objected to the sale to american.after conducting an evidentiary hearing,the bankruptcy court approved the sale to american over the objections of the eeoc and the plaintiffs.in approving the sale order,the bankruptcy court determined that there was no basis for successor liability on the part of american and that the flight attendants claims could be treated as unsecured claims.in keeping with the bankruptcy court conclusions,the sale order extinguished successor liability on the part of american for the travel voucher program and any discrimination charges pending before the eeoc.specifically,the order provided that,in accordance with f of the bankruptcy code 
the free and clear delivery of the assets shall include,but not be limited to,all asserted or unasserted,known or unknown,employment related claims,payroll taxes,employee contracts,employee seniority accrued while employed with any of the sellers and successorship liability accrued up to the date of closing of such sale.
sale order,app.at.the sale order also enjoined all persons from seeking to enforce successor liability claims against american.the court order provided that 
pursuant to sections a and of the bankruptcy code,all persons are enjoined from taking any action against purchaser or purchaser affiliates including,without limitation,twa airlines llc,to recover any claim which such person had solely against sellers or sellers affiliates.
sale order,app.at.
immediately after the sale order was entered,the eeoc filed a notice of appeal.on october,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court decision,finding that twa assets were properly transferred free and clear of the travel voucher program and the charges of employer misconduct filed with the eeoc.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court holding that the claims against the debtor twa were interests in property within the meaning of f,and therefore,the debtor assets could be transferred free and clear of those claims.the district court determined that the bankruptcy court findings of fact were not clearly erroneous and that the bankruptcy court legal conclusions were supported by the factual record.the district court further noted that 
there is record evidence supporting the bankruptcy court conclusions that a pursuant to a bidding procedure,debtors determined that american offer was the highest and best offer for the purchase of substantially all of debtor assets b it was unlikely that debtors and american would have consummated the sale if appellants claims were not extinguished c if the sale did not go forward,it was highly likely that debtors would have been liquidated with resulting material harm to creditors,employees and the louis,missouri region,as well as rendering debtors unable to satisfy its sic obligations under the travel voucher program and d the travel vouchers may be reduced to a monetary satisfaction.
district court order affirming the bankruptcy court sale order,app.at citations omitted.on november,the class filed a notice of appeal.on december,the eeoc also appealed the district court order.the appeals have been consolidated.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
this court has jurisdiction to review the district court order of october,affirming the bankruptcy court sale order of march,pursuant to d and a.
our standard of review over the district court bankruptcy decision is the same as that exercised by the district court.see in re woskob,cir.accordingly,we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error and exercise plenary review over the bankruptcy court legal determinations.see see also in re continental airlines,cir.
iii.analysis 
the parties dispute in this case concerns the meaning of the phrase interest in such property hereafter interest in property as that phrase is used in f of the bankruptcy code.this section permits sale of property free and clear of any interest in the property of an entity other than the estate,at,code cong.admin.news at.appellants assert that the travel voucher program and the pending eeoc charges are not interests in property within the meaning of this section and that,therefore,these claims were improperly extinguished by the sale order.they assert that interests in property are limited to liens,mortgages,money judgments,writs of garnishment and attachment,and the like,and can not encompass successor liability claims arising under federal antidiscrimination statutes and judicial decrees implementing those statutes.federal appellants br.at.appellants also assert that their claims are outside the scope of f,and therefore can not be extinguished,because they could not be compelled,in a legal or equitable proceeding,to accept a money satisfaction of their interest s.f.the airlines,on the other hand,argue that,while congress did not expressly define interest in property,the phrase should be broadly read to authorize a bankruptcy court to bar any interest that could potentially travel with the property being sold,even if the asserted interest is unsecured.they also assert that appellants claims lie within the scope of f,and therefore,can be extinguished because appellants can be compelled to accept a money satisfaction of their claims.we agree with the airlines 
interest in property 
the contentions of the parties require us to consider whether the claims in this case constitute an interest in property as understood within the meaning of f.section f of the bankruptcy code provides,in pertinent part 
the trustee may sell property free and clear of any interest in such property of an entity other than the estate,only if 
applicable nonbankruptcy law permits sale of such property free and clear of such interest 
such entity consents 
such interest is a lien and the price at which such property is to be sold is greater than the aggregate value of all liens on such property 
such interest is in bona fide dispute or 
such entity could be compelled,in a legal or equitable proceeding,to accept a money satisfaction of such interest.
f emphasis added.some courts have narrowly interpreted interests in property to mean in rem interests in property,such as liens.see,in re white motor credit,general unsecured claimants including tort claimants,have no specific interest in a debtor property.therefore,section is inapplicable for sales free and clear of such claims.in re new england fish,same.however,the trend seems to be toward a more expansive reading of interests in property which encompasses other obligations that may flow from ownership of the property.collier on bankruptcy 
in folger adam,jv,cir,we addressed the issue of whether certain affirmative defenses to a claim for breach of contract constituted an interest in property within the meaning of section f.specifically,we were asked to decide whether the affirmative defenses of setoff,recoupment,and other contract defenses constitute an interest under section f of the bankruptcy code such that a sale of the debtors assets in a consolidated bankruptcy court auction free and clear,extinguished such affirmative defenses id.at.we observed that there was no support in the case law for the proposition that a defense may be extinguished as a result of a free and clear sale.see id.at.accordingly,we held that a right of recoupment is a defense and not an interest and therefore is not extinguished by a f sale.id.
in arriving at this conclusion,we explored the significance of the fourth circuit decision in in re leckie smokeless coal,cir.in leckie,the fourth circuit held that,irrespective of whether the purchasers of the debtors assets were successors in interest,under f,the bankruptcy court could properly extinguish all successor liability claims against the purchasers arising under the coal act by entering an order transferring the debtors assets free and clear of those claims.see id.at.the fourth circuit held that the two benefit plans that sought to collect coal act premium payments from the debtors successors in interest were asserting interests in property that had already been sold through the section sale.the fourth circuit explained that 
while the plain meaning of the phrase interest in such property suggests that not all general rights to payment are encompassed by the statute,congress did not expressly indicate that,by employing such language,it intended to limit the scope of section f to in rem interests,strictly defined,and we decline to adopt such a restricted reading of the statute here.
id.at.the court explained that the benefit plans had interests in the property of the debtors which had been transferred under section f in the sense that there was a relationship between their right to demand premium payments from the debtors and the use to which the debtors had put their assets.see id.importantly,in the course of our review of leckie,we noted that the term any interest is intended to refer to obligations that are connected to,or arise from,the property being sold.folger adam,at citing collier on bankruptcy.
here the airlines correctly assert that the travel voucher and eeoc claims at issue had the same relationship to twa assets in the f sale,as the employee benefits did to the debtors assets in leckie.in each case it was the assets of the debtor which gave rise to the claims.had twa not invested in airline assets,which required the employment of the eeoc claimants,those successor liability claims would not have arisen.furthermore,twa investment in commercial aviation is inextricably linked to its employment of the claimants as flight attendants,and its ability to distribute travel vouchers as part of the settlement agreement.while the interests of the eeoc and the class in the assets of twa bankruptcy estate are not interests in property in the sense that they are not in rem interests,the reasoning of leckie and folger adam suggests that they are interests in property within the meaning of section f in the sense that they arise from the property being sold.
indeed,to equate interests in property with only in rem interests such as liens would be inconsistent with section f,which contemplates that a lien is but one type of interest.section f provides 
the trustee may sell property free and clear of any interest in such property of an entity other than the estate,only if 
such interest is a lien and the price at which such property is to be sold is greater than the aggregate value of all liens on such property.
f.in this regard,we find ourselves in agreement with collier observation that 
section f permits the bankruptcy court to authorize a sale free of any interest that an entity has in property of the estate.yet the code does not define the concept of interest,of which the property may be sold free.certainly a lien is a type of interest of which the property may be sold free and clear.this becomes apparent in reviewing section f,which provides for particular treatment when such interest is a lien.obviously there must be situations in which the interest is something other than a lien otherwise section f would not need to deal explicitly with the case in which the interest is a lien.
