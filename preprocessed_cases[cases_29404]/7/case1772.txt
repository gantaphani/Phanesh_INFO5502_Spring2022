debtor norman majewski incurred large medical expenses at the hospital where he was employed,and he did not pay them.after repayment negotiations failed,he told the hospital he intended to file for bankruptcy,and the hospital fired him before he did so.the trustee in majewski bankruptcy,william leonard,now contends that the firing violated the bankruptcy code provision barring termination of an individual who is or has been a bankruptcy debtor solely because the individual is or has been a debtor in bankruptcy.b.
the bankruptcy court dismissed the trustee claim against the hospital for violation of the statute,holding that the statute did not protect persons who had not yet filed for bankruptcy.the district court affirmed.we affirm as well.
the provision of the bankruptcy code provides 
no private employer may terminate the employment of,or discriminate with respect to employment against,an individual who is or has been a debtor under this title,a debtor or bankrupt under the bankruptcy act,or an individual associated with such debtor or bankrupt,solely because such debtor or bankrupt 
is or has been a debtor under this title or a debtor or bankrupt under the bankruptcy act 
has been insolvent before the commencement of a case under this title or during the case but before the grant or denial of a discharge or 
has not paid a debt that is dischargeable in a case under this title or that was discharged under the bankruptcy act.
b.in this appeal,leonard contends that we should interpret the provision of subparagraph liberally to apply to debtors before they file a bankruptcy petition.
in support of his argument,leonard calls our attention to our cases interpreting the provisions of remedial statutes such as title vii of the civil rights act of,et,and the fair labor standards act,et.we have interpreted those statutes to protect persons who report illegal conduct to government agencies or complain about such conduct to their employers,even though they have not yet instituted a formal proceeding.for example,in lambert ackerley,we held that the flsa provision protected an employee who protested about the failure to pay overtime wages.lambert ackerley,cir en banc.we so held even though the language of the relevant flsa provision does not seem to expressly extend to persons who have not actually filed a formal complaint.that statute provides that it is unlawful 
t o discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter,or has testified or is about to testify to in any such proceeding,or has served or is about to serve on an industry committee.
we pointed out,as the supreme court has noted,that the flsa relies for its enforcement on the complaints of employees,rather than on monitoring payroll records or other government surveillance.lambert,at quoting mitchell robert demario jewelry,d.in line with the remedial purposes of the statute,we therefore held that the provision should be interpreted broadly,to give effect to the statute remedial purpose.id.quoting tennessee coal,iron muscoda local.in so doing,we agreed with six of the seven other circuits to address the issue.id.at.we also noted that other courts had interpreted the provisions of other remedial statutes equally broadly,in order to facilitate the enforcement of those statutes,which also rely on employee complaints about employer misconduct.id.at citing cases involving the federal mine health and safety act,the federal railroad safety act,and the clean water act.by protecting complaining employees jobs,we intend to encourage reports of illegal activity.
the bankruptcy context of this case is very different.while we encourage reporting of statutory violations,we do not wish to encourage persons to file for bankruptcy or to threaten bankruptcy.we wish only to protect those persons who have invoked the bankruptcy law protections to obtain a fresh start.sliney battley in re schmitz,cir.the formal act of filing is more significant in bankruptcy than in the other contexts relied upon by the dissent.filing a petition in bankruptcy triggers an automatic stay of actions against the debtor,the creation of an estate,and the appointment of a trustee.see,and.
the dissent relies heavily on the legislative history from a bankruptcy bill that was never enacted.however,the statute enacted in one now before clear in its exclusive application to anyone who is or has been a debtor in bankruptcy.see b.we therefore interpret the statute according to its terms,as the supreme court has instructed.see ron pair,d in interpreting bankruptcy statutes,if the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.w e are not free to substitute legislative history for the language of the statute.aronsen crown zellerbach,cir citations omitted.we also express our suspicion that the legislative history upon which the dissent relies inaccurately reflects the intent of the bill drafters.it is unlikely that congress would have chosen the words is or has been to mean has been or will be.compare omnibus bankruptcy improvements act of obia,cong.and,at.in arden motel partners,cir,we explained that bankruptcy provisions will be interpreted according to their plain meaning except in the rare cases in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intention of its drafters.this is not such a case.
the bankruptcy provision at issue in this case forbids firing an employee solely because that person is or has been a debtor.b.at the time the hospital fired majewski,he was not,and had not been,a debtor in bankruptcy.the bankruptcy statutes therefore did not forbid the hospital from firing him.we reject leonard proposed reading of the statute,which is both inconsistent with the statute text and incompatible with its purpose.
bankruptcy fresh start comes at the cost of actually filing a bankruptcy petition,turning one assets over to the court and repaying debts that can be paid.one is not entitled to the law protections,including employment security and the automatic stay of litigation,before being bound by its other consequences.we therefore affirm the bankruptcy court dismissal of leonard action against the hospital.
norman majewski was hospitalized at rose dominican hospital,and incurred substantial medical expenses.he later went to work for rose,but in three years was unable to earn enough to discharge his medical debt.he then advised his employer that he intended to file for before he could actually file a formal petition,he was summarily fired.
despite congressional intent to enact legislation banning precisely such retaliation,the majority opinion gives employers free license to punish an employee efforts to become a protected debtor.indeed,under today holding,an employer may take advantage of a debtor honesty by eliminating his most likely means to financial recovery.the majority adopts an unnaturally rigid and formalistic construction of the bankruptcy code that contravenes congress clear intent to insulate debtors from unfair employment practices directly tied to their attempts to get a fresh start.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
the question whether an employee must have won the race to file a formal bankruptcy petition before he is fired in retaliation for his insolvent status is one of first impression in this circuit.because this is a question of first impression,we must look first to the plain language of the statute,construing the provisions of the entire law,including its object and policy.united states miller,cir quoting united states mohrbacher,cir.
section b of the bankruptcy code provides 
no private employer may terminate the employment of,or discriminate with respect to employment against,an individual who is or has been a debtor under this title,a debtor or bankrupt under the bankruptcy act,or an individual associated with such debtor or bankrupt,solely because such debtor or bankrupt 
is or has been a debtor under this title or a debtor or bankrupt under the bankruptcy act 
has been insolvent before the commencement of a case under this title or during the case but before the grant or denial of a discharge or 
has not paid a debt that is dischargeable in a case under this title or that was discharged under the bankruptcy act.
the majority reads this provision to limit relief from employer discrimination to those who have succeeded in actually filing formal proceedings before they are victimized.the majority reading is certainly one conceivable construction of the statute,but it is neither the only construction nor the construction most consistent with congress declared object and policy.
with respect to the sequence in which an individual must have become a debtor under this title to receive protection from discrimination,the statutory language is not unambiguous.see robinson shell oil,d finding similar ambiguity in title vii regarding whether claimants must be employed at the time of filing to enjoy antiretaliatory protection in re hudson,cir finding similar ambiguity in the bankruptcy code regarding whether tort claims must have been reduced to judgment at the time of filing to be discharged.it is not entirely clear from the text of b,which forbids discrimination against an individual who is or has been a debtor,whether a debtor must file for bankruptcy before he can be the subject of discrimination,or whether the debtor merely must file for bankruptcy before seeking remedial relief under the statute.
it is possible to read the statute as the majority does,and find that discrimination based solely on an intent to file for bankruptcy remains entirely outside of the statutory purview as long as the discrimination occurs before the moment of filing.however,it can also be read to state that discrimination based on an intent to file for bankruptcy is comprehended by the statute,but becomes unlawful only if the victim of discrimination actually files a formal petition.passantino johnson johnson consumer,cir noting that discrimination may be lawful under some circumstances.it can also be read to declare that discrimination based on an intent to file for bankruptcy is unlawful in all circumstances,but that a victim of discrimination only has a federal remedy under b once he has filed a formal petition.as these three facially plausible interpretations demonstrate,the true meaning of the statute can not be discerned with certainty from the text alone 
when faced with textual ambiguity,our objective must be to ascertain the intent of congress and to give effect to legislative will.united states taylor,cir,cert.denied,d.indeed,even the clear text of the bankruptcy code may be in the rare cases in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.in such cases,the intention of the drafters,rather than the strict language,controls.united states ron pair,d citations omitted quoting griffin oceanic contractors,d,in an interpretation of the bankruptcy code.see also dewsnup timm,d construing the bankruptcy code to effect congressional intent despite text potentially suggesting alternative readings.
the majority construction of b,permitting an employer to fire a debtor after it has been informed of the debtor intention to invoke the bankruptcy code,produce s a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.this court on numerous occasions has stated that o ne of the primary purposes of the bankruptcy act is to give debtors a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort,unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of debt.perez campbell,d quoting local loan hunt.
specifically,congress enacted the provisions of to codify perez campbell and to ensure that employers are not able to frustrate the congressional policy of a fresh start for a debtor,at,reprinted in,as the house report stated,the purpose of is to prevent an automatic reaction against an individual for availing himself of the protection of the bankruptcy laws,at,reprinted in.the hospital automatic reaction against majewski in this case is precisely the type of invidious conduct that congress intended to prevent.
in a precursor to the bill enacting b,congress made its intent even more plain.the precursor bill,proposed one year before b was enacted,contained the same language as b no private employer may terminate the employment of,or discriminate with respect to employment against,a person that is or has been a debtor under this title omnibus bankruptcy improvements act of obia,cong.notably,in the legislative history to that bill,congress made clear what it intended by the phrase a person that is or has been a debtor under this title 
this section amends section of title to extend the protections against discrimination to persons employed in the private sector.under this section,no private employer may terminate employment of or discriminate with respect to employment against any person on the basis that that person has been or will be a debtor in bankruptcy,or has suffered insolvency pending a discharge.
at emphasis added.
congress thus understood the language is or has been to embrace individuals who will be debtors in bankruptcy proceedings although the majority construes b to protect only debtors who have already filed formal bankruptcy petitions,this legislative history shows that congress clearly intended the section to have a broader scope.
a broad interpretation also comports with congress expectations of the latitude with which the judiciary should construe the provision.congress explicitly welcomed an expansive judicial reading of the portions of the bankruptcy code.as the senate report accompanying stated this section is not exhaustive.the enumeration of various forms of discrimination against former bankrupts is not intended to permit other forms of discrimination.the courts have been developing the perez rule.this section permits further development the courts will continue to mark the contours of the provision in pursuit of sound bankruptcy policy,at,reprinted in,
only two other federal courts have construed the provision of b at issue here.in in re tinker,the bankruptcy court determined that a debtor fired seven days after she notified her employer of her intent to file for bankruptcy and two days before mailing her bankruptcy petition qualified for protection under b as the court explained,the court can not believe that it was the intent of congress to set up a footrace between a prospective bankrupt and his or her employer.to follow the employer argument would be to say that if the employer can get the firing done one minute before the petition is filed,there never could be a b complaint.in re tinker,at.
the other federal case to reach the issue was in re kanouse,aff,cir.kanouse involved an employee constructively discharged two months after the employer received notice of his potential bankruptcy filing,and seven months before the employee actually filed for bankruptcy.the kanouse court espoused the same flawed formal construction of b that the majority has chosen in the instant case.in so doing,however,it emphasized that there was no need to address the tinker race scenario since kanouse filed his chapter petition almost seven months after his alleged constructive discharge.in re kanouse,at.
i believe that the tinker application of b more closely comports with congressional will.as tinker recognized,the construction favored by kanouse and the majority sets up a footrace whereby an employer determined to retaliate against an employee for expressing an intent to get a fresh start need only fire the employee before he is able to file his formal petition.according to the majority,the employer efforts to penalize the debtor for exercising federal statutory rights are then insulated from challenge.
in similar contexts,however,congress has made clear that it does not countenance such a race to wrongdoing.indeed,in a amendment to the bankruptcy code,congress explicitly commended the ninth circuit for construing the code its efforts to prevent legal protections from turning on a race to the courthouse,at,reprinted in,approving of the broad construction a
