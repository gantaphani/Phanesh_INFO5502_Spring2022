the plaintiff is the trustee of taurus foods,a small company engaged in the distribution of frozen meats and other foods,which was forced into bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code by three of its creditors.the suit charges the company auditor,ernst young,with negligence and breach of contract in failing to include a qualification in an audit report.the charges are governed by indiana accountancy act of because they arise out of an agreement to provide professional accounting services.the case is before us on the trustee appeal from the grant of summary judgment to the defendant.
in october,ernst young issued its audit report for taurus fiscal year,which ran from january to january.the report did not indicate a substantial doubt about the audited entity ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time,not to exceed one year beyond the date of the financial statements being audited.american institute of certified public accountants,statement on auditing standards see johnson bank george korbakes,cir systems,toshiba america,cir drabkin alexander grant.that date was january.so the report indicated no substantial doubt that taurus would continue as a going concern until at least january.in fact taurus did declare bankruptcy until two years later.
taurus principal banker was bank one.in may,some months after taurus received the audit report from ernst young,the bank became alarmed by the deterioration in taurus financial condition and handed the account to its milwaukee office,which specialized in handling risky loans.that office imposed restrictions on taurus that exacerbated the company business troubles.in an attempt to stave off disaster,lisa corry,the company chief financial officer and the daughter of one of the company two owners,started defrauding bank one by inflating the company sales and accounts receivable in daily reports that taurus was required to make to the bank.she was eventually caught,prosecuted,convicted,and sent to prison.united states corry,cir.the bankruptcy followed closely upon the exposure of her fraud.
the trustee presented expert evidence that ernst young was negligent in failing to include a qualification in its audit report for the fiscal year,and that if it had done so the owners of were not absentees,but managed the have realized that the company had no future and would immediately have liquidated,averting costs of some million that the company incurred as a result of its continued operation under the restrictions imposed by bank one milwaukee office and other adversities.
the trustee damages claim thus is based on the theory of deepening insolvency.this controversial theory see,in re global service group,llc,allows damages sometimes to be awarded to a bankrupt corporation that by delaying liquidation ran up additional debts that it would not have incurred had the plug been pulled sooner.as originally formulated,the theory was premised on the notion that borrowing after a company becomes insolvent would ineluctably hurt the shareholders.schacht brown,cir.that was a puzzling suggestion because by hypothesis a company harmed by deepening insolvency was insolvent before the borrowing spree,so what had the shareholders to lose but a corporation can be insolvent in the sense of being unable to pay its bills as they come due,jeffrey lipshaw,law as rationalization getting beyond reason to business ethics,toledo,equity insolvency,yet be worth more liquidated than the sum of its liabilities and so be worth something to the shareholders this was assumed to be a possibility in schacht,at.
the theory could also be invoked in a case in which management in cahoots with an auditor or other outsider concealed the corporation perilous state,which if disclosed earlier would have enabled the corporation to survive in reorganized form.sabin willet,the shallows of deepening insolvency,bus.law.however,as explained in trenwick america litigation trust ernst young,the theory makes no sense when invoked to create a substantive duty of prompt liquidation that would punish corporate management for trying in the exercise of its business judgment to stave off a declaration of bankruptcy,even if there were no indication of fraud,breach of fiduciary duty,or other conventional wrongdoing.nor would it do to fix liability on a third party for lending or otherwise investing in a firm and as a result keeping it going,when management misused the opportunity created by that investment t hey management could have instead used that opportunity to turn the company around and transform it into a profitable business.they did not,and therein lies the harm to the company.in re citx,cir.
the present case is different from any of the cases that we have cited.the owners of taurus lost their entire investment when the company became insolvent.they had nothing more to lose.the only possible losers from the prolongation of the corporation miserable existence were the corporation creditors.in a state that allows creditors or shareholders of the audited firm to sue the auditor for negligent misrepresentation,provided that the creditors reliance on the auditor report was foreseeable,citizens state bank timm,schmidt,or,in some states,was actually foreseen,rhode island hospital trust bank swartz,bresenoff,yavner jacobs,cir ryan kanne,iowa taurus creditors could sue ernst young directly.but indiana,we have held albeit with only tenuous support in indiana case law,as pointed out in first community bank trust kelley,hardesty,smith,adheres to a close approximation to ultramares touche,cardozo.and under the ultramares doctrine,or what we have taken to be its indiana version,creditors in the position of taurus creditors,not having a contractual relation with the auditor,have no claim against it.decatur ventures,llc daniel,cir indiana law ackerman schwartz,cir same see pricewaterhousecoopers,llp massey.
taurus had the contractual relation,and thus could sue,though because it is in bankruptcy and has been liquidated the suit is really on behalf of the creditors anything that reduces the liquidation value of the corporation hurts them.that does make the suit an impermissible end run around indiana limitation of creditor or shareholder suits against auditors.realistically,a corporation is a conduit for its stakeholders,but that does not affect the corporation legal rights.suppose taurus were solvent,yet still had been injured by the auditor alleged negligence.the ultimate beneficiaries of the suit would be taurus shareholders,but no one would suppose this anomalous even though the shareholders stakeholders in this not have sued the auditor.remember that under indiana law or what we have assumed to be indiana law,ernst young has no duty of care to the creditors.but it does of course have such a duty to its client,taurus,and that duty,on which this suit is founded,does not evaporate just because the client is bankrupt and any benefits from suing will accrue to its creditors.
the trustee claim fails nevertheless,but fails on the facts,though not because taurus survived for more than a year in fact three years after the audit period.a qualification is just a prediction if it should have been included in the audit report and harm resulted as a foreseeable consequence of its omission,the auditor is liable to the firm audited for that harm.johnson bank george korbakes,supra,at see ziemba cascade int l,cir.such cases are rare because it is unusual for the audited firm to be able to make a plausible contention that it could not have been expected to recognize its financial peril on its own even though it supplied the financial information on which the audit was based.devaney chester,civ,wl may.the purpose of an audit report is to make sure the audited company financial are prepared by the company,not by the auditor,jay feinman,liability of accountants for negligent auditing doctrine,policy,and ideology,correspond to reality,lest they either have been doctored by a defalcating employee or innocently misrepresent the company financial situation.the auditor is therefore required to state whether,in his opinion,the financial statements are presented in co
