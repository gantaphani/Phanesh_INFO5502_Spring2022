these appeals arise from the chapter bankruptcy of crown unlimited machine.the trustee in bankruptcy filed an adversary action charging defunct corporation and its shareholders,members of a family named having made a fraudulent conveyance in violation of section a of the uniform fraudulent transfer act,a statute enforceable in a bankruptcy proceeding.see b.after an evidentiary hearing,the bankruptcy judge awarded the trustee plus prejudgment interest.the district judge affirmed and the defendants have appealed.the trustee has,seeking an additional.
crown was a designer and manufacturer of machinery for cutting and bending tubes.most of the machinery it made was to the buyer specifications,and only two other companies manufactured machinery of that type.in january the defendants agreed to sell all of crown assets to kevin smith,the president of a company in a similar line of business.the price was million.crown agreed to employ smith until the closing,so that he could assure himself of the value of the business before committing to buying it.
he decided to go through with the deal.at the closing,on january,crown received from a new corporation,formed by smith,million in cash and a million promissory note.the new corporation also named crown unlimited machine,the name being among the assets sold to the new crown had borrowed the million from a bank.although the loan was secured by all of crown assets,the annual interest rate a floating rate initially exceeded percent.the rate inflation expectations were low at the the bank considered the risk of default nontrivial.
the promissory note was payable on april,with interest at an annual rate of percent.although that translates into an interest expense of a year,the agreement of sale specified that the new corporation would be required to pay only a year on the note,with the first payment due in april,unless new crown sales exceeded a specified high threshold.the note,like the bank loan,was secured by all of crown assets,but the promisee old crown security interest was subordinated to the bank.although the interest rate on the note was lower than the interest rate on the bank loan,even though the note was not as well secured,there was,as we see,little chance that the note would ever be paid and after the first two interest payments,it was.
smith personal assets were meager.he contributed only of his own money toward the purchase.
just prior to the closing,old crown transferred from its corporate bank account to a separate bank account so that it could be distributed to crown shareholders as a dividend.this was done pursuant to an understanding of the parties that,depending on the company performance between the initial agreement and the closing,the stroups would be permitted to keep some of crown cash that would otherwise have been transferred to the new corporation as part of the sale the sale,since it was of all of crown assets,included whatever money was in the corporation bank account.
after the closing,old crown renamed crown stock distribution,distributed the entire million in cash that it had received to its shareholders,and ceased to be an operating company.
new crown was a flop.it declared bankruptcy in july,and its assets were sold pursuant to which authorizes a sale,if approved by the bankruptcy judge,of assets of the debtor for million.the buyer was a new company of which smith is now the president.most of the money realized in the sale was required for paying off the bank very little was left over to pay the claims of new crown unsecured creditors,who were owed some or million and on whose behalf the trustee in bankruptcy brought the adversary action.the action was timely,despite the length of time since the alleged fraudulent conveyance,because the bankruptcy petition was filed within the look back period of the uniform fraudulent transfer act,and the trustee initiated this suit within the period specified in for bringing a section avoidance action and the deadline for bringing a section action to recover improperly transferred funds,a deadline that runs from the date on which the transfer was set aside.f.
the bankruptcy judge ruled that the million that new crown had paid the million in cash,or obligated itself to pay the million promissory note,for old crown assets had been paid without new crown receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange.as a result,new crown had embarked upon a business for which its remaining assets were unreasonably small in relation to the business,in the language of the uniform fraudulent transfer act.the judge did not think the assets,including intangible assets such as goodwill that made old crown a going concern and not just a pile of machinery,had been worth more than million tops on the date of the closing.and he thought that new crown had been so depleted by the debt it had taken on that it had been,in his words,on life support from the.so old crown and its shareholders could neither enforce the promissory note nor keep either the million in cash received at the closing or the two interest payments made on the note.
but the dividend,the judge ruled,was legitimate,because it had been paid out of cash that belonged to old crown rather than to the debtor new crown.in so ruling he rejected the trustee argument that the purchase of old crown assets had been an lbo a leveraged buyout,that it should be collapsed and the sale thus recharacterized as a sale by the shareholders of old crown,and that once it was collapsed in this fashion the dividend would be seen as an asset of the debtor estate and thus would be available to help satisfy the claims of the unsecured creditors.if the transaction was not the bankruptcy judge thought it should not be because he refused to recharacterize the sale of assets as an debtor was not entitled to the return of the dividend because,when it was paid,the money out of which it was paid belonged to old crown.
we begin our analysis with the trustee argument for recharacterizing the transaction.in a conventional lbo,an investor buys the stock of a corporation from the stockholders with the proceeds of a loan secured by the corporation own assets.in re image worldwide,cir in re edc,cir mellon bank,metro communications,cir.it follows that if all the assets are still fully secured when the corporation declares bankruptcy,the unsecured creditors can not satisfy any part of their claims from a sale of the assets.if the trustee loses this suit,the unsecured creditors will have recovered only than cents on the dollar.
should the acquired company be doomed to go broke after and because of the the burden of debt created by the transaction was so heavy that the corporation had no reasonable prospect of payment to the shareholders by the buyer of the corporation is deemed a fraudulent conveyance because in exchange for the money the shareholders received they provided no value to the corporation but merely increased its debt and by doing so pushed it over the brink.hbe leasing frank,cir moody security pacific business credit,cir mellon bank,metro communications,supra,at united states tabor court realty,cir.a corporate transfer is fraudulent within the meaning of the uniform fraudulent transfer act,even if there is no fraudulent intent,if the corporation did receive reasonably equivalent value in return for the transfer and as a result was left with insufficient assets to have a reasonable chance of surviving indefinitely.rose mercantile national bank,vacated in part on other grounds,see also donell kowell,cir.
some courts have been reluctant to apply the act as written to leveraged buyouts.see kupetz wolf,cir united states tabor court realty,supra,at wieboldt stores,schottenstein.they sympathize with minority shareholders who have no power to prevent such a deal.they may also agree with the scholars who have argued that many lbos are transactions because by making the managers owners managers are often the buyers in an lbo and thus fusing ownership with control,an lbo increases the managers incentive to operate the corporation with a view to maximizing its value rather than their salaries and perks.these scholars also argue that devices that facilitate transfers of corporate control increase the mobility of capital.see bengt holmstrom steven kaplan,corporate governance and merger activity in the united states making sense of the and,journal of economic perspectives,spring,steven kaplan jeremy stein,the evolution of buyout pricing and financial structure in the,quarterly journal of economics,douglas baird,fraudulent conveyances,agency costs,and leveraged buyouts,journal of legal studies,frank easterbrook,debt as an incentive device,international review of law economics douglas baird thomas jackson,fraudulent conveyance law and its proper domain,vand.
the reluctance of the courts in the decisions we cited is not easy to square with the language of the uniform fraudulent transfer act.and anyway the equities,as we shall see,do not favor lenient treatment in this case.moreover,although before the lbo smith was briefly a member of crown management,the lbo did not close a gap between managers and shareholders.lbos,though by burdening the acquired corporation with additional debt they increase the risk of bankruptcy because debt is a fixed cost,and therefore unlike a variable cost does not shrink when the debtor output shrinks,can indeed have redeeming economic value when the corporation is publicly held and the managers have a low equity stake prior to the transaction.in a publicly held corporation there is a separation of ownership from control,and the managers may use their control to manage the company in a way that will increase their personal wealth rather than maximize the profits of the corporation the conflict of interest is eliminated by making the managers the owners.but this rationale for an lbo is missing from this case because both old and new crown were closely held corporations.and while the economic literature also argues that the increased risk of bankruptcy that an lbo creates concentrates the minds of the managers just as,according to samuel johnson,the prospect of being hanged concentrates the mind of the condemned person,this is hard to take seriously in the present case for the had only a stake in the company.
but the critical difference between the lbo in this case and a bona fide lbo is that this lbo was highly likely to plunge the company into bankruptcy.there was scant probability that the transaction would increase the firm value on the contrary,it left the firm with so few assets that it would have had to be extremely lucky to survive.
the transaction differed,however,in two formal respects from a conventional lbo the buyer bought the assets of the corporation,rather than stock in the corporation and despite a load of debt and a dearth of cash,the corporation limped along for years before collapsing into the arms of the bankruptcy court.the defendants urge these as grounds for not reclassifying the asset purchase as an lbo.
now whether one calls it an lbo or not is not critical,although both the bankruptcy court and the defendants thought it was.some lbos are legitimate others are fraudulent conveyances.f raudulent conveyance doctrine is a flexible principle that looks to substance,rather than form,and protects creditors from any transactions the debtor engages in that have the effect of impairing their rights,while ensuring that the debtor can continue to do business and assuring third parties that transactions done with the debtor at arm length will not be.douglas baird,elements of bankruptcy ed.if the dividend was part and parcel of the transaction that fatally depleted new crown assets,it was part and parcel of a fraudulent conveyance.but if one has to call the overall transaction something,the something is an lbo.
the first formal difference to which the defendants point is of no conceivable significance.an lbo can take the form of an asset acquisition,in re oodc,llc,norton bankruptcy law practice,ed see also in re aluminum mills,as the defendants lawyer conceded at argument.the purchase was nominally of the assets of old crown,but actually of the ownership of the company for old crown distributed the money it received in the sale forthwith to its shareholders and from then on existed only as a shell.new crown operated under the same name as its predecessor,and its trade creditors and other unsecured creditors were not even told about the transaction.that reticence would be normal if the stock of a corporation were sold,rather than its assets but in a sale of its assets,the seller creditors would expect to be notified that they would henceforth be dealing with a different firm.
new crown staved off bankruptcy for several years and might have staved it off longer had it not been for mistakes made by smith in running the business.his biggest mistake was shifting from the production of to standardized machinery,a market in which new crown faced competition from hundreds of firms rather than from just two.but to assess the significance of this point one must distinguish between insolvency and the acknowledgment of insolvency and between insolvency and a lack of adequate capital.a firm might be insolvent in the bankruptcy sense of negative net liabilities exceeded its assets,a buncher official committee of unsecured creditors of genfarm limited partnership iv,cir baird,elements of bankruptcy,supra,at yet it might continue operating as long as it was able to raise enough money to pay its debts as they became due,or even longer if its creditors were forbearing.
by encumbering all the company assets,the sale reduced its ability to borrow on favorable terms,as it could offer no collateral to lenders.and by surrendering most of old crown cash the cash that was paid as a dividend and obligating itself to pay a year to the defendants and a year to service the million bank loan,without receiving anything in return except smith,new crown was forced to engage in continual borrowing during its remaining life,and on unfavorable terms.seven months before it declared bankruptcy it had run up million in debt and its assets were worth less than half that amount.
new crown thus had made payments and incurred obligations without receiving reasonably equivalent value in return.even if it was not actually insolvent ab initio,as a result of the lack of equivalence it began life with unreasonably small assets given the nature of its business.that was what the bankruptcy judge meant when he said that new crown survived as long as it did only on life support.that was a finding of fact to which we defer.
the difference between insolvency and unreasonably small assets in the lbo context is the difference between being bankrupt on the day the lbo is consummated and having at that moment such meager assets that bankruptcy is a consequence both likely and foreseeable.moody security pacific business credit,supra,at,kipperman onex.focusing on the second question avoids haggling over whether at the moment of the transfer the corporation became technically insolvent,a question that only accountants could relish having to answer.moody security pacific business credit,supra,at bruce markell,toward true and plain dealing a theory of fraudulent transfers involving unreasonably small capital.
but one has to be careful with a term like unreasonably small.it is fuzzy,and in danger of being interpreted under the influence of hindsight bias.one is tempted to suppose that because a firm failed it must have been inadequately capitalized.the temptation must be resisted.see kipperman onex,supra,at fidelity bond mortgage brand,life yield series van dusen airport services,baird,fraudulent conveyances,agency costs,and leveraged buyouts,supra,at.as we said in a related context in baldi samuel son,cir,of course many fail,but if a significant probability of failure sufficed to pronounce a insolvent,how would any finance its operations but new crown started life almost with no assets at all,for all its physical assets were encumbered twice over,and the dividend plus new crown interest obligations drained the company of virtually all its cash.it was naked to any financial storms that might assail it.so the statutory condition for a fraudulent conveyance was so at least the bankruptcy judge coul
