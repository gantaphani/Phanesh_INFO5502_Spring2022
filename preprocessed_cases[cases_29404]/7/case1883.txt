michael morris,trustee in bankruptcy trustee,appeals from an order of the district court reversing a decision of the bankruptcy court that granted his complaint for lien avoidance.we conclude that the bankruptcy court correctly determined that the lien the trustee sought to avoid was not perfected as of the date the debtors filed for bankruptcy.the trustee should therefore have been permitted to avoid the unperfected lien.this being the case,we reverse the decision of the district court and remand for further proceedings.
the lien in question arose when the debtors,jon anthony hicks and amy elizabeth hicks,borrowed funds from boeing wichita credit union bwcu to buy a ford expedition automobile.the debtors granted bwcu a purchase money security interest in the vehicle.the parties have stipulated to the following facts concerning this transaction and the subsequent history of bwcu security interest 
on september,debtors purchased a ford expedition with the vin of hereinafter vehicle from innovative auto sales.the credit union was granted a purchase money security interest in the vehicle.
on september,amy hicks signed a notice of security interest nosi in favor of the credit union on the vehicle.
the credit union mailed a check in the amount of for recording fees to the kansas department of revenue with nosi forms,including the one on the hick sic vehicle.the check was deposited on september.
kdor kansas department of revenue acknowledges receiving the nosi dated september,from the credit union on september.
on october,the debtors made a submission to the kansas department of revenue in applying for title on the vehicle pursuant to b.this submission by the debtors failed to note the lien of the credit union.
a paper document denominated title was subsequently printed by the kansas department of revenue,indicating its issued date to be december.this document did not list the credit union or anyone else as a lienholder.this document was mailed to the debtors and it was in their possession on the date of the bankruptcy.
from at least december,through may,the digital records of the kansas department of revenue showed the debtors to be the owners of the vehicle,with no lien.
on december,debtors filed for chapter bankruptcy protection.
on or about december,the debtors made submission of documents to the kansas department of revenue.this submission of the debtors listed the lien of the credit union.the debtors surrendered the december,title to the kansas department of revenue as part of this submission.

on march,the trustee filed this adversary proceeding,contending that he was entitled to avoid bwcu lien the bankruptcy court concluded that the filing of a nosi only perfects a security interest until a certificate of title has been issued.bwcu lost its temporary perfection once a title was issued that failed to denote its lien,the court reasoned,and was therefore unperfected at the time the debtors filed for bankruptcy.the bankruptcy court therefore entered a memorandum decision granting the trustee complaint for lien avoidance.
bwcu appealed to the district court.the district court concluded that the lien the nosi created continued in effect even though kdor had issued an inappropriate title certificate to the debtors.it reasoned that the title certificate,which did not identify the lien specified in the nosi,could not make the nosi ineffective.the trustee therefore could not avoid bwcu lien.accordingly,the district court reversed and remanded the case to the bankruptcy court.
jurisdiction 
in response to the trustee complaint in this action,bwcu filed a third party complaint against kdor.bwcu sought to hold kdor liable for improperly issuing a title certificate that omitted bwcu lien.after the bankruptcy court ruled in favor of the trustee,in order to facilitate an immediate appeal from its decision granting the trustee complaint for lien avoidance notwithstanding the unresolved third party complaint,it entered a certification and judgment under.b.
we ordered the parties to brief whether,in light of the district court order remanding the case to the bankruptcy court,and given bwcu unresolved third party complaint,the district court order was a final decision that could be appealed to this court.see d.we now conclude that the order was final and appealable.as the parties acknowledge,the bankruptcy court only task on remand would have been to dismiss the trustee complaint,and to dismiss the complaint as moot.these ministerial actions would not have involved significant further proceedings on remand.a district court order that leaves the bankruptcy court with no significant further proceedings to conduct on remand is final and may be appealed to this court.office of thrift supervision overland park fin.in re overland park fin,cir quotation omitted.we therefore have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.
standard of review 
our review of the bankruptcy court decision is governed by the same standards of review that govern the district court review of the bankruptcy court.accordingly we review the bankruptcy court legal determinations de novo and its factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard.

governing law 
trustee status as lien creditor 
the strong arm powers of a grant the trustee the status of a hypothetical lien creditor once the bankruptcy petition has been filed.see lms holding,cir discussing lien creditor status assumed by.the rights of such a lien creditor are determined under state law.id.kansas law subordinates an unperfected security interest to the rights of a person who became a lien creditor prior to perfection.stat.ann.a.thus,if bwcu security interest was unperfected under state law at the time the debtors filed for bankruptcy,the trustee may exercise his power to avoid bwcu lien.
perfection by notation on certificate of title 
under kansas law,a security interest in a vehicle may be perfected only by compliance with that state laws.see id.a,b.the kansas statute provides that a n application for certificate of title shall be made by the owner or the owner agent upon a form furnished by the division and shall state all liens or encumbrances thereon,and such other information as the division may require.id.c.once the application is received,t he county treasurer shall use reasonable diligence in ascertaining whether the facts stated in such application are true,and if satisfied that the applicant is the lawful owner of such vehicle,or otherwise entitled to have the same registered in such applicant name,shall so notify the division,who shall issue an appropriate certificate of title.id.the certificate thus issued shall be in a form approved by the division,and shall contain a statement of any liens or encumbrances which the application shows,and such other information as the division determines.id.here,the certificate of title that had been issued at the time the debtors filed for bankruptcy did not reflect bwcu lien.
perfection by filing of a nosi 
the kansas official ucc commentary notes that the interplay of with certain statutes may create a gap period between the time a certificate of title is applied for and when it is issued,during which a security interest is technically unperfected.see,cmt.kansas has ameliorated this problem in the case of a purchase money security interest by providing for the filing of a nosi.see mid american credit union bd.of county comm rs,d,stating legislature created nosi procedure to cover the period between the sale and the purchaser obtaining a certificate of title.the applicable statute provides
