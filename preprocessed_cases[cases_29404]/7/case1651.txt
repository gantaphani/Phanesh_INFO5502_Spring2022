this appeal requires us to consider the effect of the federal communications commission fcc cancellation of licenses held by a licensee in bankruptcy proceedings.donald thacker,in his capacity as trustee to the bankruptcy estate of magnacom wireless,llc magnacom,appeals the district court decision to deny his claim to the proceeds from the fcc auction of new licenses for the radio spectrum previously covered by magnacom cancelled licenses.we conclude that the fcc cancellation of magnacom licenses extinguished magnacom interest in those licenses and the underlying spectrum.such cancellation did not result in any traceable proceeds,and did not constitute a remedy.therefore,magnacom is not entitled to such proceeds.we have jurisdiction under d and affirm the decision of the district court.
under the terms of the communications act of act,the fcc grants licenses for use of the radio spectrum.the licenses give licensees the right to use segments of the spectrum in various geographic areas for specified terms,in accordance with fcc provisions.see pursuant to the act,the licenses do not give licensees an ownership interest in the spectrum.id.
beginning in,the fcc began selling the licenses based on a competitive bidding process.see id.j.with exceptions not relevant to the instant case,all proceeds from these auctions are deposited into the treasury.id.j.as part of this new licensing process,the act requires the fcc to ensure that small businesses,rural telephone companies,and businesses owned by members of minority groups and women are given the opportunity to participate in the provision of services id.j d.to fulfill this mandate,the fcc earmarks certain blocks of spectrum for auction to small,entrepreneurial companies known as designated entities.a.other license purchasers must pay the entire bid price at the time of the successful bid,but the fcc allows designated entities to pay only a down payment and then complete their purchase by making installment payments during the term of the license.g.fcc regulations condition these licenses upon the full and timely performance of the licensee payment obligations under the installment plan.g see also g iv.thus,in relation to designated entities,the fcc plays the dual role of regulator and creditor.
magnacom,one such designated entity,was created for the purpose of obtaining licenses to the spectrum in order to provide personal communications services.in september,magnacom purchased a number of radio spectrum licenses from the fcc under an installment payment plan.magnacom made down payments of ten percent of the purchase price for licenses to use c block spectrum segments and twenty percent of the purchase price for licenses to use f block segments.in total,magnacom paid approximately million on a purchase price of approximately million.for each license,magnacom signed the fcc standard promissory note and security agreement the security agreement,promising to pay the rest of the purchase price in quarterly installments throughout the license term.
in the security agreement,magnacom acknowledged it possessed no underlying right to the spectrum the fcc security interest in the licenses did not derogate from the fcc regulatory authority over the licenses the licenses would be automatically cancelled if an event of default occurred magnacom would not be entitled to any proceeds from the sale of new licenses following cancellation and the security agreement would be subject to the act,fcc regulations,and federal law 
not long after purchasing its licenses,magnacom began to experience financial difficulties.in an attempt to meet its installment payment obligations,magnacom restructured its debt by returning some licenses to the fcc,modifying other licenses,and using the resulting down payment credits to prepay for other licenses.following this restructuring,magnacom held eighteen licenses subject to the installment payment requirements and owed the fcc approximately million.despite this restructuring,magnacom financial difficulties continued.
on october,the day before magnacom would have defaulted on its remaining installment payments,magnacom filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter.in response,on april,the fcc asked the bankruptcy court for relief from the automatic stay imposed by.the bankruptcy court granted the request.in may,the court lifted the stay on the fcc and ruled that the fcc may pursue immediately any and all of its remedies,including its right to cancel the defaulted licenses if such licenses have not already been canceled as a matter of law.thereafter,the fcc cancelled the licenses.on july,magnacom bankruptcy case was converted from chapter to chapter.
in january,the fcc filed a proof of claim as an unsecured creditor to obtain the approximately million dollars that the magnacom bankruptcy estate still owed for the licenses.with the acquiescence of magnacom trustee,the court approved the fcc proof of claim.
in,while the fcc claim against the bankruptcy estate was pending,the fcc auctioned licenses to the spectrum segments formerly licensed to magnacom.see public notice,c and f block broadband pcs spectrum auction scheduled for december.the new licenses offered by the fcc for auction did not have the same terms as the cancelled magnacom licenses.among other things,the new licenses were for a new term ending in magnacom licenses had been set to expire in and and had different construction deadlines.in addition,the fcc would not accept installment payments for the licenses.as it turned out,market conditions had changed since the time magnacom had won its licenses at auction.the winning bidders in the auction paid a total purchase price of million,substantially more than magnacom had paid for licenses to the same spectrum segments.pursuant to j,the proceeds of the auction were deposited into the treasury.
in light of the subsequent sale of new licenses,on february,magnacom trustee filed a motion to reconsider the fcc allowed claim against magnacom bankruptcy estate.in his motion,the trustee opposed the fcc unsecured claim on the ground that the reauctioned licenses were sold for a substantially higher price than was required to cover magnacom default.despite the fcc opposition,the bankruptcy court granted this motion on september,holding that the fcc was not entitled to any distribution from the estate.
on december,the trustee filed a complaint against the fcc in bankruptcy court,seeking the return of any proceeds from the auction of the new licenses that exceeded the amount magnacom owed to the fcc.the bankruptcy court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.the trustee appealed this decision to the district court,which affirmed the decision on june.the trustee now appeals the decision of the district court.

the principal issue in this appeal is the legal effect of the fcc cancellation of magnacom licenses.it is undisputed that magnacom licenses were cancelled following the bankruptcy court original decision to lift the stay.what the parties debate is the effect of this cancellation.magnacom trustee argues that the cancellation and subsequent spectrum auction is subject to bankruptcy code and uniform commercial code ucc rules that give the magnacom estate entitlement to surplus proceeds.the fcc argues that under applicable statutes and regulations,once the licenses were cancelled,they ceased to exist and any right in the underlying spectrum was extinguished.therefore,the proceeds from the auction of the new licenses were not property of the bankruptcy estate.
the plain language of the act supports the fcc position.under,licenses provide for the use of the spectrum,but not the ownership thereof.in other words,licensees have a property interest only in the use of the spectrum,not in the underlying spectrum itself.moreover,provides that the property interest created by a license is limited to the terms,conditions,and periods of the license itself.id.consistent with the act,the security agreement states that licenses are extinguished upon,and convey no rights to the underlying spectrum.see security agreement,see also g iv if an eligible entity obligated to make installment payments fails to pay the total required installment payment it shall be in default,its license shall automatically cancel,and it will be subject to debt collection procedures.because licenses provide for the use of the spectrum and convey no ownership interest beyond the terms,conditions,and periods of the license,it follows that once the licenses are cancelled for nonpayment,the licenses cease to exist along with any interest in the spectrum for which the license was issued.see fcc nextwave pers.commc ns,d describing cancellation as eliminating the licenses.thus,under the plain language of the statute and applicable regulations,once an fcc license is cancelled,a licensee no longer has any right derived from that license and therefore has no entitlement to the proceeds from the auction of a new license 
there is one wrinkle to this analysis,but it does not change the result in this case.section of title states that a governmental unit may not revoke a license to a person that is a debtor under this title solely because such debtor has not paid a debt that is dischargeable in the case under this title applying in a factual situation similar to ours,the supreme court held that the fcc regulatory authority to cancel licenses did not trump the provision of rather,the fcc was precluded from cancelling a license solely because of the licensee failure to pay on a debt dischargeable in bankruptcy.nextwave,at.thus,the fcc decision to cancel magnacom licenses for nonpayment would be subject to challenge under.
nextwave is not applicable here,however,because magnacom trustee does not challenge the fcc cancellation of the licenses and does not seek relief based on.magnacom trustee did not object to the fcc motion for relief from the automatic stay to allow the fcc to cancel the licenses.nor does the trustee now argue that the fcc cancellation of the licenses violated in his opening brief trustee explicitly accepts the fcc cancellation,stating that magnacom is not trying to recover its licenses or set aside their transfer to new licensees.section is not applicable when,as here,an entity does not challenge the cancellation of its license 
although the plain language of the statute and applicable regulations indicate that magnacom had no entitlement to proceeds from a new auction,the trustee argues that cancellation did not eliminate the bankruptcy estate right to collect surplus proceeds from the auction of new licenses covering the same spectrum.the trustee asserts that both the bankruptcy code and the ucc provide independent bases for the return of surplus proceeds from the second auction.
the trustee argument under the bankruptcy code is as follows.once magnacom entered bankruptcy,its interests in the licenses,as well as the proceeds of those licenses,became property of the bankruptcy estate.a,a.the term proceeds includes all funds traceable to or substituted for the original property.see a.because magnacom licenses gave it the exclusive right to use a portion of the spectrum,the fcc cancellation of the magnacom licenses freed up that portion of the spectrum.as a result,the trustee argues,the fcc was enabled to sell new licenses,and the proceeds from the sale of the new licenses are traceable proceeds of the cancelled magnacom licenses,and thus property of the bankruptcy estate.
we are unpersuaded by the trustee argument based on the bankruptcy code.this argument is based on the premise that magnacom retained an interest in the spectrum after the fcc cancelled its licenses,a premise we have already rejected.if a bankruptcy estate includes a valuable property interest that is sold,or swapped for a different piece of property,the proceeds remain part of the estate.see catalano comm r,cir.thus,if the fcc had sold magnacom licenses,the magnacom estate might have rights to proceeds from such a sale.alternatively,if magnacom retained rights to the spectrum covered by its licenses,the magnacom estate might have rights to proceeds from the sale of new licenses to use the underlying spectrum.however,in this case,magnacom extinguished and had no value once they were cancelled by the fcc.and as we have previously noted,magnacom had no interest in the underlying spectrum or any subsequent licenses for the spectrum.see a.when the property of an estate no longer exists and has not been disposed of in any way that generated proceeds,the trustee has no remedy.see generally george gleason bogert et,the law of trusts and trustees ed.here the licenses were extinguished and were simply not disposed of in any way.
it is true that the fcc had to cancel magnacom licenses before the fcc could sell new licenses for the underlying spectrum.however,this fact alone does not give magnacom any rights to proceeds from the new licenses.a creditor lawful extinction of a property right in the bankruptcy estate does not give the trustee in bankruptcy rights to other property created by that creditor.see in re gull air,cir w hen a debtor proprietary interest expires by operation of an express condition,the bankruptcy code does not preserve that interest and prevent termination.therefore,the fcc sale of new licenses for the use of spectrum segments to which magnacom had no rights did not generate any proceeds traceable to magnacom licenses.
we are also unpersuaded by the trustee ucc argument.the trustee contends that the security agreement gave the fcc a security interest in the licenses that could be enforced only pursuant to the terms of the ucc.see security agreement,i giving the fcc any remedies of a secured party under the uniform commercial code.article of the ucc sets forth a secured creditor remedies.under article of the ucc subject to multiple procedural requirements,after a borrower defaults,the secured creditor may sell its collateral subject to the borrower right to any surplus from the sale.ucc.if a creditor held a security interest in the proceeds of magnacom licenses,and the licenses had been sold,the creditor would have owed the magnacom estate any proceeds beyond what was necessary to satisfy the debt owed to the creditor.see mlq investors,pac.quadracasting,cir.the trustee contends that the ucc likewise applies to the fcc enforcement of the security agreement and requires the fcc to return the excess proceeds from its auction of new licenses to the bankruptcy estate.
if we assume that the ucc is applicable to the security agreement an issue we do not reach,the ucc would support the trustee claim of entitlement to proceeds from the fcc sale of new licenses only if the fcc cancellation of the licenses was a remedy under the ucc.the trustee argues that both the applicable regulations and the security agreement make cancellation a remedy.we look at both in turn.
by its terms,the security agreement does not make cancellation a remedy.however,the trustee relies on nextwave personal communications,aff by,nextwave,d,to support this argument.as noted above,nextwave personal communications,involved a debtor who raised various challenges to the fcc cancellation of its license,including the ultimately successful argument that prevented the fcc from cancelling its licenses.in response,the fcc made a highly technical argument.the fcc first pointed out that under usc b,the automatic stay does not prevent the government from taking certain regulatory actions.the fcc argued that such allowable regulatory actions include cancelling a debtor licenses.if it interpreted as precluding the fcc from cancelling a debtor licenses,the court would create a conflict with b.the court rejected this argument on the ground that b did not apply to license cancellation in this case.the court noted the fcc concession t
