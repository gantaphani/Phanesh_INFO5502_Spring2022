both the bankruptcy and district courts here held that appellees james arcara,frederick cronin,robert smith and thomas thompson collectively,the appellees former senior executives of appellant general datacomm industries and its affiliates datacomm were retired employees within the meaning of and were therefore entitled to their retiree benefits.section of the united states bankruptcy code bankruptcy code affords certain procedural protections to retired employees of chapter debtors.see a,e.when applicable,these procedural protections are held to override the provisions of,which generally allow a debtor in possession,subject to the court approval,to reject any executory contract of the debtor in order to relieve the estate of onerous and burdensome future obligations.see a.
the questions presented in this appeal are whether the term retired employees,as contemplated by,encompasses the concept of forced retirement,at least in situations where,as here,employees on the verge of voluntary retirement are strategically and deliberately terminated without cause by a debtor and if so,may datacomm executory agreement providing benefits for retirees be rejected pursuant to.as stated,both courts rejected datacomm attempt to terminate or otherwise modify the appellees retiree benefits without first complying with the mandates and procedural requirements of.
we hold that involuntary termination of employees on the verge of retirement can not deprive such employees of the procedural protections of.accordingly,the district court did not err in affirming the bankruptcy court order,which denied rejection of datacomm agreement to provide such benefits.
the material facts on appeal are not in dispute.on or about september,the board of directors of datacomm approved a benefit agreement for long term senior executive officers and other senior level employees the benefit plan.datacomm originally entered into the benefit plan with appellees arcara,cronin,and smith.thompson,the remaining appellee,was added as an eligible executive subsequent to the establishment of the benefit plan.
the benefit plan provided for two discrete forms of benefits.first,datacomm was required to pay the annual premiums of up to for long term care insurance coverage for the lifetime of each eligible executive and his spouse long term care benefits second,the benefit plan also provided that,upon retirement,each eligible executive and his spouse would receive,at datacomm sole cost,a lifetime continuation of the health insurance benefits that datacomm was then furnishing to the eligible executive retirement health benefits 
the benefit plan listed at least five actions which,if taken by eligible executives,would lead to discharge and loss of all benefits.it essentially provided that datacomm,in its sole judgment,could effectively terminate all benefits thereunder if,among other things,the eligible executive violated any confidentiality agreement disclosed any proprietary information refused cooperation with datacomm in litigation directly or indirectly became employed by,or purchased stock of a competitor brought suit against datacomm except as to claims relating to the benefit plan or disparaged the company.benefit plan aside from the grounds for terminating benefits specified in paragraph of the benefit plan,datacomm reserved no other right to rescind or amend the benefit plan.
on november,datacomm filed for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code,and pursuant to sections and of the bankruptcy code,datacomm continued to possess its properties and manage its businesses as debtor s in possession.thereafter,on november,datacomm advised the appellees that they would be terminated on november,and that the benefit plan would be terminated on that same date.
ten days later,on november,datacomm filed its motion with the bankruptcy court to reject the benefit plan pursuant to section of the bankruptcy code the motion.a day later,on november,the appellees were formally terminated.datacomm concedes that the termination was without cause.at the time of their termination,the appellees were all over years of age thompson was,cronin was nearly,smith was over,and arcara was near.
the appellees objected to the motion,claiming that the benefit plan qualified for treatment under of the bankruptcy code,and that datacomm was therefore required to comply with the procedural requirements of that statute before terminating or modifying the benefit plan.the bankruptcy court conducted a hearing on april,to determine whether or governed the benefit plan.the bankruptcy court held that governed,and entered an order denying datacomm motion to reject the benefit plan.the bankruptcy court stated that i n the event datacomm seek s to terminate or otherwise modify any of the benefits of the appellees provided for in the benefit plan datacomm shall be required to first comply with the mandates and procedural requirements of.
the district court affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court,essentially holding that the appellees were retirees within the meaning of because datacomm action in terminating the appellees the day after it purported to reject the benefit plan constituted a forced retirement.this timely appeal followed.
the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under b and.the district court had appellate jurisdiction pursuant to a,and we have jurisdiction under d and.exercising the same standard of review as the district court,w e review the bankruptcy court legal determinations de novo,its factual findings for clear error and its exercise of discretion for abuse thereof.in re trans world airlines,cir citing in re engel,cir fellheimer,eichen braverman,charter,cir.inasmuch as the parties agree that there are no relevant facts in dispute,our review is limited to the legal determinations of the bankruptcy court as affirmed by the district court.we will thus employ a de novo review of those legal determinations.
section a of the bankruptcy code provides except as provided in sections and of this title and in subsections b,c,and d of this section,the trustee,subject to the court approval,may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor.a.the exceptions noted in have no relevance in this case.
on the other hand,section of the bankruptcy code was enacted to protect the interests of retirees of chapter debtors.collier on bankruptcy,ed.that section prohibits a debtor in possession or a trustee from unilaterally modifying or terminating retirement benefits unless the court orders modification or the trustee and the authorized representative of the retired employees agree to modification.e prior to filing an application seeking modification,the trustee must engage in good faith negotiations with the authorized representative of the retired employees regarding the proposed modification,and must provide the authorized representative with relevant information to allow for fair evaluation of the proposal.id.f only after the foregoing requirements have been met,and such negotiations have occurred,is the court empowered to grant the modification motion,if,among other things,modification is necessary to permit reorganization of the debtor.id.g accordingly,a debtor in possession or the trustee must continue to pay retiree benefits unless modification of such payments has been ordered by the court or the trustee and the authorized representative of the retired employees have agreed to such modification.id.e 
the procedural protections of apply to retiree benefits,which are defined with reference to the class of persons entitled to the benefits,retired employees.as we have indicated,the overarching question here is whether the provisions of apply to the benefit plan.stated differently,the question is whether the appellees constitute retired employees for purposes of invoking the protections of the statute.
datacomm main contention on appeal is that appellees never retired,but rather were still employed and were terminated as employees without cause.as such,datacomm argues,the provisions of,which accord protection only to retired employees,never come into play here,leaving permitting rejection of executory contracts as the only operative statute.we are persuaded that this contention elevates form over substance,and is thus unavailing and unacceptable 
moreover,as a contractual matter,we note that datacomm can not escape its obligations under the benefit plan by arguing that appellees were terminated rather than retired.as the district court held,retirement was the condition precedent to the appellees receipt of certain benefits under the plan,and datacomm prevented the appellees from voluntarily retiring by discharging them without cause.the benefit plan explicitly and unambiguously states that only the particular proscribed actions by an eligible executive could result in the justifiable forfeiture of retirees benefits.we believe that the district court reasoning was sound intent of both datacomm and the appellees was that the appellees would receive the retirement benefits of the plan unless they were terminated for cause.they were not.see williston on contracts ed.where a promisor prevents,hinders,or renders impossible the occurrence of a condition precedent to his or her promise to perform,or to the performance of a return promise,the promisor is not relieved of the obligation to perform.
section,when it applies,allows datacomm to terminate executory contracts,with the bankruptcy court approval,notwithstanding any contractual obligations thereunder.see,in re spectrum info.at issue then,is whether congress intended the term retired employees in to encompass the concept of forced retirement.
in contending that forced retirement does not implicate the provisions of,datacomm relies heavily on a reductio ad absurdum.according to datacomm,the district court holding,taken to its logical conclusion,means that would apply to a retirement health benefit when datacomm discharged an employee without cause at the age of.
recognizing that the employees affected here were all over the age of arcara smith cronin thompson,and were purposefully discharged only one day after datacomm filed its motion,we can only conclude that datacomm action was taken deliberately and was designed to thwart the purposes of.therefore,accepting the concept of forced retirement does not and can not lead to the absurd result posited by datacomm that an employee could be retired at age if discharged without cause.the contours of such a concept as forced retirement may receive appropriate interpretation,when it occurs,by a development.what matters here is that the particular facts of this case are compelling enough to warrant the application of such a concept.
as the record reflects,the appellees were on the verge of retirement receiving a minimal paycheck for basically hanging around.tr.of at.they were founders and senior executives of datacomm,and each was of retirement age and was qualified to warrant entitlement to the benefits prescribed by datacomm benefit plan,which was designed to compensate senior level employees.see benefit plan.as such,our holding in no way countenances the year old horrible scenario envisaged by datacomm.
under the circumstances presented here,to allow datacomm to deliberately interfere with appellees retirement benefits would operate to frustrate and nullify the objectives of,which,as we have stated,was enacted to protect the interests of retirees of chapter debtors.collier on bankruptcy,ed.
we address one final issue not raised or initially briefed by the parties.at oral argument,we asked the question whether the benefit plan was an executory contract for purposes of which involves only contracts that are executory in substance and which are not trumped by and so could be considered by the bankruptcy court for rejection on an appropriate application.if the benefit plan was not executory,would have no application as it could not be rejected under that section.we requested supplemental briefing on the question.after reviewing the parties submissions,we are satisfied that the benefit plan is indeed an executory contract.
we set forth the controlling definition of executory contract in sharon steel national fuel gas distribution,cir an executory contract is a contract under which the obligation of both the bankrupt and the other party to the contract are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach excusing performance of the other.id.at citations and internal quotations omitted.
the crucial issue for determining whether the instant benefit plan was executory is whether the appellees had material obligations that remain unperformed at the time the bankruptcy petition was filed.see in re columbia gas system,cir the time for testing whether there are material unperformed obligations on both sides is when the bankruptcy petition is filed.citations omitted.thus,our focus is on the restrictive covenant obligations of the appellees,their obligations,set forth in paragraph of the benefit plan see note supra.paragraph,among other things,requires eligible executives to not compete to maintain confidentiality to refrain from instituting litigation to agree to participate in litigation initiated by datacomm and to refrain from negative publicity.
while we have held that the determination of what constitutes a material breach under the sharon steel definition is governed by relevant state law,in re columbia gas system,at,we need not look beyond the benefit plan itself to make that determination.the benefit plan expressly defines certain acts or events as constituting material breaches of the contract.it states that 
i n the event in the sole judgment of the board of directors of the corporation,an eligible executive or his spouse directly or indirectly fails to comply with any of the covenants set forth in paragraph,then,in any such event,the board of directors may terminate the status of such person as an eligible executive hereunder and all benefits hereunder for such eligible employee and his or her spouse shall terminate.
benefit plan and note supra thus,if an eligible executive breached one of those provisions,it would excuse the future performance of datacomm.by contractual definition,therefore,such obligations are material.see generally restatement second of contracts uncured material breach by one party discharges other party duty under contract see also williston on contracts ed.where the contract itself is clear in making a certain event a material breach of that contract,a court must ordinarily respect that contractual provision.we are thus satisfied that the appellees obligations are material,and that the benefit plan is an executory contract.
we conclude that deliberate and involuntary termination of an employee on the verge of retirement,where the employee has otherwise met all qualifications for retirement,can not deprive such an employee of the procedural protections of.we therefore hold that the datacomm appellees are retired employees within the meaning of.this being so,datacomm benefit plan providing retirement benefits to such employees was an executory agreement and could not be rejected pursuant to.accordingly,we will affirm the judgment of the district court in favor of the appellees 
i concur in the court judgment in all but one small particular.but i do not join the court opinion.
i arrive at substantially the same as the,i agree with the court that the bankruptcy court and the district court were right in disallowing datacomm proposed rejection of appellees benefit plan.but i arrive at the same destination via a different route i do not agree with the court that protects the appellees from datacomm intended unilateral rejection of the benefit plan in my view,appellees are not protected by because they were not retired employees the category of persons sheltered by the time datacomm undertook to terminate the benefit plan.however,i conclude that datacomm could not reject the benefit plan pursuant to,because that provision authorizes rejection of an executory contract and,in my view,the benefit plan was not an executory contract.
the court affirms that portion of the bankruptcy court order requiring datacomm to abide by the provisions of,which provides procedural safeguards against modification of benefits for retired employees.adverting to the purpose of,which was enacted to protect the interests of retirees of chapter debtors,collier on bankruptcy,ed,and pointing to appellees termination without cause,the court holds that appellees ought to be considered retirees within the meaning of.the court argument in favor of treating appellees as,in effect,constructive retirees can not fail to strike a sympathetic chord.nonetheless,i am not persuaded that appellees can properly be deemed as coming within the category of individuals protected by the statute.
section is entitled,payment of insurance benefits to retired employees,id.emphasis added,signifying that it is the status of the employee,and not the nature of the benefit,that determines the scope of.the wording of can not be said to give definitive guidance on whether,to claim protections,employees must have retired by the date that their employer files for bankruptcy or,alternatively,whether they must have retired by the date upon which the debtor seeks to terminate retiree benefits the relevant point for purposes of this appeal,however,is that appellees had not retired by either date appellees were employees of datacomm when datacomm filed under chapter,and they remained employees until they were dismissed one day after datacomm filed its motion seeking to terminate the benefit plan.
to be sure,the court does not argue that appellees had in fact retired by either date.instead,it adopts the district court argument,which relies on the prevention doctrine,and concludes that appellees are constructive retirees who ought thus to receive protections.the prevention doctrine states that i t is a principle of fundamental justice that if a promisor is himself the cause of the failure of performance,either of an obligation due him or of a condition upon which his own liability depends,he can not take advantage of the failure.williston,contracts,at ed see also apalucci agora syndicate,cir when one party to a contract unilaterally prevents the performance of a condition upon which his own liability depends,the culpable party may not then capitalize on that failure.the court argues that,since retirement was the condition precedent to receipt of benefits,and since datacomm willfully thwarted fulfillment of this condition when it dismissed appellees who were at or near retirement age on the day after datacomm filed its motion,appellees ought to be considered retirees within the meaning of.
while the pedigree and wisdom of the prevention doctrine are unquestionable,the conclusion that the court draws from,that ought to extend to unwarranted.the prevention doctrine entails that,where one party to a contract takes an action that prevents the other party from being able to fulfill a condition precedent to that contract,the first party may not use its own action as a mechanism for avoiding performance of its contractual obligations.the prevention doctrine does not entail that,as a result of the first party culpable obstruction,that party is not entitled to avoid performance of its obligations for any reason.there may well be reasons other than the failure of the condition precedent that would allow the first party to withdraw permissibly from the duties it contracted to perform.
applying the prevention doctrine here signifies that datacomm could not use the fact that appellees had not retired as a ground for withdrawing from its obligation to pay retiree benefits,since datacomm,by firing appellees,prevented them from retiring on the day of their dismissal or at any subsequent time.on the basis of the prevention doctrine,then,the benefit plan remained in place despite appellees.but there might have been other reasons lending support for datacomm asserted entitlement to withdraw.indeed,datacomm claims that provides one such reason.thus,the prevention doctrine does not lead to the conclusion that appellees are or ought to be treated as retirees or the conclusion that ought to apply to appellees.the prevention doctrine can do no more than return the parties to the situation that existed prior to appellees dismissal.since,for the reasons advanced above,that situation can not be characterized as one in which appellees had retired,the prevention doctrine does not afford appellees the protections of.
in sum,applies only if the beneficiaries of the agreement in question have retired before their employer seeks to terminate or otherwise modify that agreement.since that is not the situation here,i conclude that is inapplicable.
the court finds that applies to appellees and trumps.accordingly,the court holds that the protections conferred by prohibit rejection of the benefit plan pursuant to,and require compliance with the terms of prior to any modification of the plan.i agree that datacomm may not reject the benefit plan,but i rest this conclusion on the ground that the benefit plan was not an executory contract,and hence fell outside the coverage of 
an executory contract is a contract under which the obligation of both the bankrupt and the other party to the contract are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach excusing the performance of the other.sharon steel national fuel gas distribution,cir citing countryman,executory contracts in bankruptcy part i.thus,for purposes of ascertaining the nature of the benefit plan,the relevant question is whether the obligations enumerated in paragraph of the plan,which requires that the plan beneficiaries forbear from competing with or disparaging the company,are material.
state law determines whether breach of a contract provision is material.see,fineman armstrong world,cir.delaware,where the underlying dispute arose,incorporates the test of materiality found in the restatement.see biolife solutions,endocare,cross country bank,wl.lexis.to define materiality,the restatement provides a list of circumstances deemed to be significant in an assessment of whether a failure to render or to offer performance is material,restatement second of contracts 
a the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected 
b the extent to which the injured party can be adequately compensated for the part of that benefit of which he will be deprived 
c the extent to which the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will suffer forfeiture 
d the likelihood that the party failing to perform or to offer to perform will cure his failure,taking account of all the circumstances including any reasonable assurances 
e the extent to which the behavior of the party failing to perform or to offer to perform comports with standards of good faith and fair dealing.id.
taking these circumstances one by one,i conclude that the balance of considerations lies on the side of 
a benefit reasonably expected from the agreement while datacomm likely expected adherence to the restrictions encompassed in paragraph,it would have harbored this expectation prior to and independent of the benefit plan.some of the obligations contained in this paragraph simply incorporate prior example,the confidentiality agreements in clause ii and it would be these earlier agreements that justified the expectation.other obligations are so intertwined with the executives duties of good faith and,forbearance from investing in a competitor clause i or disparaging the company clause iii that,here too,datacomm expectation would not have been rooted in the benefits plan.in sum,since datacomm would have received the benefit flowing from appellees performance of these obligations independent of the benefit plan,it does not make sense to consider that performance a benefit that datacomm reasonably expected from the agreement.or,to put the point in the terms the restatement uses,performance of the obligations was not a benefit of the agreement.
b adequacy of compensation the restatement states that t he second circumstance,the extent to which the injured party can be adequately compensated for his loss of benefit subsection b,is a corollary of the first.cmt.for the reasons set forth in the previous paragraph,then,this circumstance also does not support a finding of materiality.
c forfeiture the benefit plan permits datacomm to terminate the plan benefits in the face of an eligible executive breach of paragraph it does not state that termination will automatically follow.the fact that an executive could fail to comply with one of the restrictions in paragraph and still continue to receive the benefits package further supports a finding that the restrictions are not material.
d likelihood of cure in describing this circumstance,the restatement states that t he fact that the injured party already has some security for the other party performance argues against a determination that the failure is material.cmt.here,datacomm would have had some security for the executives adherence to paragraph again,some of the obligations contained there,obligations of confidentiality hinge upon prior agreements,breach of which may entail penalties rooted in those agreements.similarly,legal sanctions for breach of the duty of loyalty would motivate adherence to some of the other restrictions,those against competition and disparagement.
e good faith and fair dealing the restatement states that a dherence to the standards stated in subsection e is not conclusive,since other circumstances may cause a failure to be material in spite of such adherence.nor is conclusive,and other circumstances may cause a failure not to be material in spite of such.cmt.f.in other words,this is a less probative consideration than the others.in the absence of an actual breach of paragraph by any of the appellees,the implications of this consideration for the materiality of the appellees obligations would be purely speculative.
in sum,the circumstances supporting a finding of materiality do not appear to be present here.
more generally,we can distill from the restatement list the defining feature of,the connection between materiality and consideration.more to the point,the restatement will deem one party obligation material where it serves as consideration for the other party promised performance.compare frank felix assocs.austin drugs,cir under new york law,for a breach of a contract to be material,it must go to the root of the agreement between the parties.citation omitted.thus,the first element of of the restatement is the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected,and the benefit which he reasonably expected is the consideration that the contract provides,see also cmt.b since the purpose of the rules stated in and is to secure the parties expectation of an exchange of performances,an important circumstance in determining whether a failure is material is the extent to which the injured party will be deprived of the benefit which he reasonably expected from the exchange subsection a.if the consideration given by either party consists partly of some performance and only partly of a promise see comment a to,regard must be had to the entire exchange,including that performance,in applying this criterion.emphasis added in most commercial bargains the consideration is the object of the promisor desire and that desire is a material motive or cause inducing the making of the promise,and the reciprocal desire of the promisee for the making of the promise similarly induces the furnishing of the consideration.id.at cmt.a misrepresentation is material if it would be likely to induce a reasonable person to manifest his assent or if the maker knows that for some special reason it is likely to induce the particular recipient to manifest his assent.indeed,the reporter notes to the chapter of the restatement containing explain that the term failure of performance,when used in that chapter,see,id.at replace the term failure of consideration.see restat.contracts,ch,introductory note.in sum,a party obligation to perform or forbear will be material if it functioned as consideration,or as the reason inducing the other party entry into the contract.
it seems improbable that the obligations contained in paragraph functioned in some significant way as consideration for the benefits conferred by the benefit plan.the appellees obligations are set forth in the benefit plan in a manner that appears to make them subsidiary to the plan central purpose.more specifically,the bulk of this contract is devoted to setting forth datacomm obligations paragraphs,and,describing the benefits that the eligible executives will receive paragraphs and,and specifying the protections available to these executives in the event that datacomm undergoes a change in control paragraph paragraph is the only paragraph addressing the executives obligations it sets forth a list of restrictions on the eligible executives conduct,but it does so by embedding this list within a provision stating that datacomm may terminate the benefits of an executive who fails to fulfill one of these obligations.this placement of appellees obligations suggests that appellees forbearance is not what motivates or compensates datacomm performance.instead,the plan memorialized a promise by datacomm to furnish its executives with certain benefits.
indeed,the plan preamble amply supports this reading,as it contains language signifying that the purpose of the plan is to compensate appellees for their past years of service to datacomm.see app.at whereas,the corporation desires to provide to certain of its employees the eligible executives with sic certain additional benefits based upon their many years of service to the corporation emphasis added.the preamble makes no mention of an intent to secure appellees compliance with the restrictive provisions of paragraph,or to otherwise bind appellees in any way.the real crux of the agreement,then,is a commitment undertaken by datacomm to reward appellees for past consideration.
finally,third circuit precedent further supports a finding that the obligations set forth in paragraph are not material.in enterprise energy united states in re columbia gas,cir,this court appealed to the restatement to evaluate materiality 
in order to determine the materiality of the class members obligations,we turn first to basic contract principles.there is a distinction in the law between failure of a condition and a breach of a duty of a condition is not a breach by a party unless he is under a duty that the condition occur.restatement second of contracts.this distinction between a condition and a duty or promise is important here.the restatement makes clear that while a contracting party failure to fulfill a condition excuses performance by the other party whose performance is so conditioned,it is not,without an independent promise to perform the condition,a breach of contract subjecting the nonfulfilling party to liability for damages.merritt hill vineyards,windy heights vineyard,citing restatement second of contracts.
at footnotes omitted columbia gas greatly clarifies the nature of appellees obligations under the benefit plan.paragraph permits datacomm to terminate an executive benefits should that executive have been found to have violated one of the listed restrictions.in other words,a breach by one of the appellees would excuse continued performance by datacomm.however,such a breach would not,by itself subject the nonfulfilling executive to liability for damages.accordingly,the appellees obligations should be seen as conditions,and not duties.and,if the remaining obligations in the contract are mere conditions,not duties,then the contract can not be executory for purposes of because no material breach could occur.id.at.
for the foregoing reasons,i conclude that the benefit plan was not executory.since section permits rejection only of those contracts that are executory,i would affirm denial of appellants motion on the ground that section does not apply to the contract at issue.accordingly,i concur in judgment of the court,subject to the small reservation noted in footnote,supra.
eligible executives included the individuals designated in the benefit plan,arcara,cronin,johnson,as well as any other senior corporate officer elected to the office of senior vice president or any higher office,and
