the united states trustee appointed douglas kelley,as chapter trustee for the debtors in the jointly administered bankruptcy proceedings for certain companies established by thomas petters,including petters company,pci,and petters group worldwide,llc pgw.objected to the appointment,arguing that kelley did not qualify as a disinterested person as required by d and as defined by c and that kelley appointment as the common trustee for the jointly administered estates would prejudice ritchie.ritchie also moved for expedited discovery,seeking to require kelley to respond to discovery requests and to appear for a deposition.
the bankruptcy denied the discovery motion,overruled the objection,and approved kelley appointment as trustee for all debtors.see in re petters,overruling the objection and approving the appointment.the district affirmed the bankruptcy court orders.ritchie appeals,arguing that disabling conflicts of interest prevent kelley from serving as an unbiased common trustee for the jointly administered estates and that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in denying the discovery motion.we affirm.
background 
before his arrest and conviction,petters owned pci and pgw,both of which were privately held limited liability companies.pci was the venture capital arm of the petters enterprises that utilized single purpose entities to obtain billions of dollars of funding,purportedly to acquire merchandise for sale to wholesalers and retailers nationwide.pgw held investments in numerous companies,and its principal asset was its stock in polaroid.as explained more fully below,pci,pgw,and certain related companies have petitioned for chapter bankruptcy relief.ritchie is an investment group that has filed more than million in claims against pgw.
civil action 
in october,the government commenced a civil action against petters,several of his business associates,and his companies,pci and pgw.the complaint alleged a massive ponzi scheme that generated more than billion in fraudulent proceeds.the government sought to freeze the defendants assets under the authority of the injunction statute,thereby preserving the assets for victim restitution and potential forfeiture.the district court issued a temporary restraining order,essentially freezing the assets of pci,pgw,and other related entities.
thereafter,the district court approved a stipulated preliminary injunction that maintained the asset freeze over pci,pgw,and the companies subsidiaries,affiliates,and wholly owned or controlled entities.the assets were placed in receivership and kelley was appointed to serve as the receiver.as receiver,kelley serves as an agent of the district court and has been vested with the powers necessary to take immediate custody,control,and possession of the assets of the estates in receivership.united states petters,order appointing receiver at receiver order.
the scope of the receivership and kelley duties and authority are set forth in the district court order.see id.at.the order authorizes kelley to file bankruptcy petitions for any of the entities to protect and preserve the assets of any of the entities and requires that any bankruptcy cases be governed by the requirements of the bankruptcy code,et,and the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.id.at.the order further requires kelley to c oordinate with representatives of the united states attorney office and court personnel as needed to ensure that any assets subject to the terms of this order are available for criminal restitution,forfeiture,or other legal remedies in proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the united states.id.at.
ritchie moved to intervene,stating that an illinois state court previously had appointed a receiver for pci and pgw.ritchie had filed suit in illinois alleging that petters,pci,and pgw had defaulted on promissory notes held by ritchie.the complaint alleged that petters,pci,and pgw had fraudulently induced ritchie to sign purchase agreements and to extend the agreement due dates by falsely representing that pci was a successful,viable business and by failing to disclose that pci was involved in a ponzi scheme that used funds obtained from new investors to pay off prior creditors.ritchie speculated that its funds were likely used to pay prior creditors in the ponzi scheme and claimed damages exceeding million.in early october,shortly after it had appointed a receiver,the illinois court determined that its orders freezing assets and appointing a receiver had expired and deferred to the judgments of the federal district court.the district court denied ritchie motion to intervene.
in march,ritchie filed a second motion to intervene,which was also denied.see united states petters,order denying second motion to intervene.we affirmed the denial of that motion,and to date,kelley remains the receiver in the civil case.see united states ritchie special credit,wl cir.
criminal case 
in december,a federal grand jury indicted petters,pci,and pgw on charges of mail fraud,wire fraud,money laundering,and conspiracy.a superseding indictment was issued in june.both indictments sought forfeiture of property involved or traceable to the offenses alleged in the indictment or,if that property is unavailable,the defendants substitute property.petters was convicted of the twenty charges against him and sentenced to fifty years imprisonment.
bankruptcy case 
as receiver,kelley filed chapter bankruptcy petitions for the debtors,and the bankruptcy court authorized joint administration of the bankruptcy cases the companies management had resigned prior to the bankruptcy filings and kelley served as the de facto.in december,the trustee and ritchie brought motions for the appointment of chapter trustee or trustees.ritchie sought appointment of a separate trustee for pgw.the bankruptcy court issued an order authorizing the trustee to appoint one or more trustees.the trustee selected kelley to serve as the sole chapter trustee for the debtors in the jointly administered cases.ritchie objected to the appointment,arguing that kelley was disqualified from serving as trustee because of disabling conflicts of interest,and moved to compel discovery.
with its objection overruled,its discovery motion denied,and its appeal to the district court rejected,ritchie appeals from the approval of the appointment of kelley and the denial of the motion to compel.
ii.jurisdiction 
our jurisdiction to review matters from the district court in bankruptcy matters extends to final decisions,judgments,orders,and decrees entered by the district court under a.d see also in re m s grading,cir kubicik apex oil,cir.we apply a broader,more flexible concept of finality in bankruptcy cases than we do in nonbankruptcy cases.in re m s grading,at.to determine the finality of a bankruptcy court order,we consider the extent to which the order leaves the bankruptcy court nothing to do but execute the order the extent to which delay in obtaining review would prevent the aggrieved party from obtaining effective relief the extent to which a later reversal on the contested issue would require recommencement of the entire proceeding.id.quoting in re farmland,cir internal marks and citations omitted.
we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court decision to overrule the objection and approve the appointment of kelley.in doing so,we join the majority of our sister circuits that have considered the issue and concluded that an order appointing a bankruptcy trustee is final and thus reviewable.see in re marvel entm t group,cir holding that district court appointment of bankruptcy trustee is an immediately appealable final order in re cajun power,cir same,rev on other grounds,cir in re plaza de diego shopping,cir same comm.of dalkon shield claimants robins,cir same.but see in re cash currency,cir holding that the appeal from the bankruptcy court appointment of trustee to the district court was interlocutory in nature and thus unreviewable by the court of appeals.
