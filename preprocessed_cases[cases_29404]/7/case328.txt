there is little doubt that settlements of disputed claims facilitate the efficient functioning of the judicial system.in chapter bankruptcies,settlements also help clear a path for the efficient administration of the bankrupt estate,including any eventual plan of reorganization.before settlements can take effect,however,they must be approved by the bankruptcy court pursuant to bankruptcy rule.
this case requires us to determine whether a creditor bankruptcy code priority scheme for reorganization plan to bankruptcy court approval of a settlement under rule.we hold that in the chapter context,whether a settlement distribution plan complies with the bankruptcy code priority scheme will be the most important factor for a bankruptcy court to consider in approving a settlement under bankruptcy rule.in most cases,it will be dispositive.
iridium operating llc iridium is currently in chapter proceedings.a consortium of lenders represented by jpmorgan chase bank,the lenders asserted liens over much of what is left of iridium.the official committee of unsecured creditors the committee vigorously contested those liens in particular,the committee objected to the lenders claim to iridium remaining cash held in accounts at chase.the committee also sought to pursue claims against motorola,motorola,iridium former parent company,but lacked money to fund the litigation.the committee and the lenders ultimately decided to settle their dispute and sought court approval of their settlement the settlement under bankruptcy rule.the settlement concedes the liens and distributes the estate cash to the lenders and to a litigation vehicle set up to sue motorola.motorola,also an,therefore,objects to the settlement on the grounds that it takes a portion of estate property and distributes it to lower priority creditors the litigation vehicle and the committee before any payments are made to motorola.
background 
motorola envisioned that the iridium system would be the first network to provide voice and data communication anywhere on the globe using a complex scheme that linked handheld wireless devices to a network of low orbit satellites and ground stations.from until,motorola oversaw the system development,with the project first taking form in as a subsidiary of motorola.see in re iridium operating llc.in,motorola spun off iridium after entering into a series of contracts with iridium concerning the design,construction and launch of the iridium system.id.at.by,all of the assets of the iridium system had been shifted into iridium operating llc,a company wholly owned by iridium llc,chase manhattan bank motorola,d,although iridium continued to pay motorola for maintaining and operating the iridium system.iridium commercial services were launched on november.
iridium bankruptcy 
skeptics assertions that there would be little demand for the service were quickly confirmed.as of march,iridium had over billion in debt and only subscribers,far fewer than the one million subscribers observers predicted it would need to be viable.see in re iridium,civ.gbd,wl,chase manhattan bank motorola,d.on august,iridium operating and iridium llc filed voluntary chapter bankruptcy petitions in united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware.those petitions were later transferred to bankruptcy court in the southern district of new york,where involuntary chapter bankruptcy petitions had been filed on the same day.iridium continues to operate its business and manage its properties as.
relevant credit facilities and the lenders purported liens 
in the months before iridium announced its collapse,it borrowed billion from the lenders.chase,d at.although there were a number of agreements,or credit facilities,one executed on december,is most relevant here.that senior secured credit agreement provided for an million loan to iridium.id.this credit agreement served as the basis for the lenders assertion that they obtained valid,enforceable,properly perfected liens on,and security interests in,all of iridium property,including roughly million in cash deposits the satellite operations center and a real property lease in northern virginia million in reserve capital calls the satellites and various causes of action,including claims against motorola.
iridium still needed money to run its daily operations.the lenders and iridium entered into a series of six cash collateral stipulations that allowed iridium to draw out cash to pay for basic operating expenses while the lenders maintained their possessory liens on the remaining balances.each of the stipulations declared that the liens were valid,enforceable,and perfected the stipulations further provided that any party in interest could contest the stipulations,if they filed an adversary proceeding within a specified period both iridium and motorola signed the third cash collateral stipulation,dated december.motorola did not challenge the third cash collateral stipulation out of its desire to avoid liability relating to iridium satellites.at the hearing to approve the settlement,the committee candidly acknowledged that it was unclear whether motorola could challenge the lenders purported liens under the terms of the stipulation had it attempted to file an objection during the prescribed time period.
the committee challenge to the lenders purported liens 
unlike motorola,the committee did challenge the validity of the lenders purported liens.the committee retained special counsel to investigate the validity of the liens and,following what the committee described as an extensive investigation,it determined that the estate possessed several potentially meritorious causes of action against the lenders.the committee specifically objected to any attempts by the lenders to assert liens over iridium remaining cash,held by chase.the committee argued that upwards of of the cash and securities on hand at iridium as of the petition date was transferred to iridium within days of the petition date,august,and therefore any security interest or lien asserted by the lenders in that cash was avoidable under the bankruptcy code.see b.the committee noted that it stood to recover at least million if it was successful on just one of its challenges.the committee also claimed that several interest payments made to the lenders just before the filing of the petition for bankruptcy were avoidable.additionally,the committee contended that any purported liens resulting from the cash collateral stipulations were similarly avoidable.
the bankruptcy court authorized the committee,on june,to commence adversarial proceedings on behalf of the estate against the lenders as to the debt and any lien,pledge or security interest of chase the lenders.
the committee pursues motorola 
the committee was busy on another front as well.just before the committee sought authorization to commence an action against the lenders,it moved for permission to press claims against motorola.the committee argued that iridium had causes of action against motorola for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and avoidance of fraudulent conveyances.in the suit against motorola,the estate,via the committee,seeks billions of dollars in damages.the committee contends that the causes of action grew out of the incredibly unique relationship between motorola and iridium pursuant to which motorola dominated and controlled all critical aspects of iridium operations,finances and corporate governance.according to the committee,while iridium was still a subsidiary motorola caused iridium to execute a series of,overreaching contracts extremely lucrative to motorola and grossly unfair to iridium from a financial,legal and risk allocation perspective.the committee further alleges that even after the spin off,motorola continued to dominate iridium through a parasitic relationship that insulated motorola from any risk associated with iridium.the bankruptcy court granted the committee motion on march.
settling one action to pursue the other 
the estate was thus poised to pursue complicated and expensive litigation on two fronts.but the estate had limited resources and would be gutted if the lenders successfully asserted their liens.the committee decided to seek a settlement with the lenders and to focus its litigation efforts on motorola the committee entered into settlement discussions with the lenders and,after approximately six months of negotiation,completed a settlement agreement on january.this settlement,among other things,resolved the question of the purported liens.the committee and the lenders sought approval of the settlement on january.
the settlement terms 
the settlement is lengthy and complex,but only a few of its provisions are in play here.first,the settlement determines that the lenders liens are senior,perfected,and unavoidable and not subject to offsets,defenses,claims,or counterclaims by the estate.the liens do not enjoy those concessions,however,until court approval of the settlement.
second,the settlement divides up the estate remaining cash into three separate cash funds.cash fund number one splits million two ways the lenders get million and million will be distributed by the estate directly to a entity,the iridium litigation llc the illlc.cash fund number two gets million for professional expenses,including attorneys fees.this fund is also split two ways goes to one of the law firms involved in negotiating the settlement and goes to the illlc for payment of professional expenses.any interest accumulated in cash fund numbers one and two goes to the lenders approximately percent and to the illlc approximately percent.cash fund number three includes income from accounts receivable.percent of cash fund number three goes to the illlc,and the remainder goes to the lenders on the effective date of the settlement.
the illlc was created to serve as a funding vehicle for all litigation see in re iridium,wl at.a litigation trust,whose beneficiaries are the unsecured creditors,owns percent of the illlc.further,the illlc is controlled by committee members and represented by committee counsel.should the committee and the estate prevail against motorola,the settlement provides that the proceeds,after the payment of any of the illlc professional fees,will be split among the lenders,administrative creditors,and the estate.the lenders would take percent of any recovery.the other percent of the recovery would go to the estate,to be distributed according to a future,reorganization plan,with administrative as first id.thus,a large portion of any monies recovered from motorola as a result of the motorola estate action will flow to the estate and be distributed according to the bankruptcy code priority scheme and creditors behind the lenders will receive payment of their claims even if the lenders claims are not fully satisfied by the litigation.any of the initial million remaining in the trust at the end of the litigation will be paid by the illlc directly to the unsecured creditors.the settlement further dictates that its signatories will only support a reorganization plan consistent with the terms of the settlement.
from the committee perspective,the settlement has a number of benefits.the settlement frees up cash from the lenders purported liens to fund the motorola litigation allows creditors behind the lenders to receive payment of their claims before the lenders claims are fully satisfied eliminates the lenders liens on any recovery from the motorola cause of action coordinates litigation against motorola allows the estate to pursue causes of action that would normally belong to the lenders,such as disputes over whether any of motorola administrative claims must be subordinated to the lenders claims frees other assets,such as causes of action which it then ensures are funded,from lenders purported liens and results in an immediate payment of almost million dollars to the estate for resolution of other issues.in addition,the lenders waive any rights they might have as unsecured creditors to receive any of the proceeds of the motorola estate action.according to the committee,the settlement will help maximize the potential recovery against motorola.the committee also points out that if it lost its challenge of the purported liens,unsecured creditors would receive nothing unless and until the lenders were paid at least the million covered by the december,credit facility.the committee was clearly concerned with the risk of litigating with the lenders the litigation process would be long and expensive and involve novel legal issues and a loss would leave the estate all but penniless.
on march,the bankruptcy court held a hearing and approved the settlement over motorola objections.motorola appealed to the district court daniels,which in turn affirmed the bankruptcy court.in re iridium,wl.motorola appealed to this court.
discussion 
whose money was it in re spm 
the lenders and the committee argue that the roughly million in cash fund number one is actually the lenders property to do with as they see fit,including distributing million to the illlc as seed money to pursue motorola in hopes of realizing something more than a return on its million loan.noting that motorola does not contest the validity of the liens,the lenders and the committee point to the reasoning of a first circuit case,official,unsecured creditors comm.stern in re spm,cir,for support.
spm stands for the proposition that in a chapter liquidation proceeding,an lender with a conclusively determined and uncontested perfected,first security interest in all of a debtor assets may,through a settlement,share or gift some of those proceeds to a junior,unsecured creditor,even though a priority creditor will go unpaid.id.at.the lenders and the committee ask us to expand spm to chapter settlements and then apply it here for the first time.
the lenders and the committee assert that spm stands for the proposition that if the cash on hand at chase was perfected collateral of the secured lenders for valid debt,the secured lenders had the right to dispose of such cash in any manner that they chose so long as the cash did not exceed the debt owed to the secured lenders.emphasis added.in their view,the cash belongs to the lenders,not the estate,and the lenders can dispose of that cash as they wish.
here,the settlement perfected and validated the lenders liens only upon the entry of an order approving the settlement and only to the extent authorized by the settlement until the settlement was approved,then,the lenders liens were contested and the money held by the lenders was an asset of the estate this case is quite different from spm,where the creditor had an uncontested,perfected,first security interest in all of spm assets except certain real estate.id.at.
thus,we need not decide if spm could ever apply to chapter settlements,because it is clear that the lenders did not actually have a perfected interest in the cash on hand.id.at.while the approval of the settlement eliminates the disputes regarding the lenders rights to some of the money,it also provides for the distribution of the balance for a number of purposes,most notably,the motorola litigation.bankruptcy rule provides the appropriate scale on which to weigh the settlement.
bankruptcy rule 
bankruptcy rule,unique in that it does not have a parallel section in the code has a clear purpose to prevent the making of concealed agreements which are unknown to the creditors and unevaluated by the court.in re masters.courts have developed standards to evaluate if a settlement is fair and equitable,and,to that end,courts in this circuit have set forth factors for approval of settlements based on the original framework announced in tmt trailer ferry.protective comm.for indep.stockholders of tmt trailer ferry,anderson,d see also collier on bankruptcy ed.citing tmt trailer ferry.those interrelated factors are the balance between the litigation possibility of success and the settlement future benefits the likelihood of complex and protracted litigation,with its attendant expense,inconvenience,and delay,including the difficulty in collecting on the judgment the paramount interests of the creditors,including each affected class relative benefits and the degree to which creditors either do not object to or affirmatively support the proposed settlement whether other parties in interest support the settlement the competency and experience of counsel supporting,and t he experience and knowledge of the bankruptcy court judge reviewing,the settlement the nature and breadth of releases to be obtained by officers and directors and the extent to which the settlement is the product of arm length bargaining.in re worldcom,see also tmt trailer ferry,at.in re drexel burnham,at.
c.the fair and equitable standard 
motorola does not contend that the settlement fails under this test.rather,it argues that the settlement should not have been approved because it provides for the transfer of money from the estate to the illlc,and from the illlc to the unsecured creditors after the litigation.motorola claims that a settlement can never be fair and equitable if junior creditors claims are satisfied before those of more senior creditors.
the phrase fair and equitable derives from section b b ii of the bankruptcy code,which describes the conditions under which a plan of reorganization may be approved notwithstanding the objections of an impaired class of creditors a situation known as a cramdown.see coltex loop cent.three partners pool c assocs.in re coltex loop cent.three partners,cir see also kenneth klee,all you ever wanted to know about the cram down rule under the new bankruptcy code,am.bankr.this provision codifies the absolute priority rule,which provided that any plan of reorganization in which stockholders a re preferred before the creditor,is invalid.in re armstrong world,aff cir quoting pac.ry.boyd.second alteration in original in its current statutory form,the rule provides that the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property.b b ii.
although the statute by its terms applies only to plans of reorganization,the supreme court has held that a settlement presented for approval as part of a plan of reorganization,because it constitutes part of the plan,may only be approved if it,too,is fair and equitable in the sense of conforming to the absolute priority rule.see tmt trailer ferry,at.the requirements that plans of reorganization be both fair and equitable,apply to compromises just as to other aspects of reorganizations.when a settlement is presented for court approval apart from a reorganization plan,however,the priority rule of is not necessarily implicated.without the requirement that settlements conform to the absolute priority rule,only the bankruptcy court invocation of rule factors would protect the interests of any nonsignatory intermediate or impaired creditors 
in response to this concern,the fifth circuit held that the absolute priority rule should also apply to settlements,concluding that a bankruptcy court abuses its discretion in approving a settlement with a junior creditor unless the court concludes that priority of payment will be respected as to objecting senior creditors.united states aweco,in re aweco,cir.the settlement in aweco sought to resolve litigation involving the debtor and a junior unsecured creditor.id.the district court approved the settlement without considering proof from the senior secured creditors that the costs of the settlement could seriously deplete the estate and jeopardize the priority position of the senior creditors.the junior creditor argued that priority creditors claims are often unresolved when settlements with individual creditors occur well in advance of approval of a reorganization plan.thus it pressed that requiring conformity with the absolute priority rule would effectively preclude all settlements prior to a plan of reorganization.the fifth circuit rejected that argument and held that extension of the absolute priority rule to settlements was necessary.
as soon as a debtor files a petition for relief,fair and equitable settlement of creditors claims becomes a goal of the proceedings.the goal does not suddenly appear during the process of approving a plan of compromise.moreover,if the standard had no application before confirmation of a reorganization plan,then bankruptcy courts would have the discretion to favor junior classes of creditors so long as the approval of the settlement came before the plan.regardless of when the compromise is approved,looking only to the fairness of the settlement as between the debtor and the settling claimant contravenes a basic notion of fairness.an estate might be wholly depleted in settlement of junior senior creditors of full still be fair as between the debtor and the settling creditor.
id.at.the fifth circuit accurately captures the potential problem a settlement can present for the rule of priority,but,in our view,employs too rigid a test.
the settlement here differs significantly from the facts in play in aweco,and points out the shortcomings of the aweco rule.the settlement resolves claims of one group of senior creditors while at the same time compromising their preferred position by providing that they be paid only a portion of any monies received from the motorola litigation.the settlement also funds pursuit of the estate most significant motorola claims.lastly,many important facts are still in dispute.motorola claim as an administrative creditor is yet to be established,the costs of the litigation and any balance remaining in the litigation fund at the close of the proceedings are at best estimates,and the claims against motorola are perhaps years from a sum certain judgment.it is difficult to employ the rule of priorities in the approval of a settlement in a case such as this when the nature and extent of the estate and the claims against it are not yet fully resolved.in our view,a rigid per se rule can not accommodate the dynamic status of some bankruptcy settlements.
rejection of a per se rule has an unfortunate side effect,however a heightened risk that the parties to a settlement may engage in improper collusion.thus,whether a particular settlement distribution scheme complies with the code priority scheme must be the most important factor for the bankruptcy court to consider when determining whether a settlement is fair and equitable under rule.the court must be certain that parties to a settlement have not employed a settlement as a means to avoid the priority strictures of the bankruptcy code.
in the chapter context,whether a settlement distribution plan complies with the bankruptcy code priority scheme will often be the dispositive factor.however,where the remaining factors weigh heavily in favor of approving a settlement,the bankruptcy court,in its discretion,could endorse a settlement that does not comply in some minor respects with the priority rule if the parties to the settlement justify,and the reviewing court clearly articulates the reasons for approving,a settlement that deviates from the priority rule.
application of the rule factors to this settlement 
the bankruptcy judge concluded that t he terms of the settlement agreement are fair,reasonable and in the best interests of the estate and made a number of factual findings.with respect to the first two factors for rule approval the balance between the litigation likelihood of success and the settlement future benefits and the chances that the litigation will be complex and court concluded that i n assessing the risk of establishing liability and damages at trial,the court finds that the estate would face serious obstacles in establishing that the lenders liens are invalid.the settlement benefits,however,were substantial,including potentially providing significant recovery to the estate creditors,including administrative creditors,motorola,priority creditors and general unsecured creditors.in short,avoiding the liens involved an expensive and complex lawsuit which,even if ultimately successful,offered little reward.on the other hand,acknowledging the liens while obtaining funding to pursue the estate claims against motorola held out promise for all creditors.we agree with the bankruptcy court that these first two factors support approval of the settlement.
the third factor asks the bankruptcy court to evaluate whet
