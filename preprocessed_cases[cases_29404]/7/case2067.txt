because bankruptcy law allows for discharges of contingent claims,including claims against the debtor for indemnity before the time the indemnity claim against the debtor can be precisely measured,we affirm the trial court judgment precluding the assertion of a prepetition claim for equitable indemnity against the debtor,the respondent and successful defendant at trial,shahrokh ordoubadi.the trial court correctly determined that the plaintiff claim for equitable indemnity was discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding in.
i.the history 
like many mystery stories,legal cases often trace their true origins to sins of the past whose effects are visited on the present.this case is a compilation of three separate wrong decisions,the net effect of which would mean that plaintiff michael sometimes mike boyajian would have no claim for indemnity against the individual,shahrokh ordoubadi,who would turn out to be his coconspirator in a scheme to defraud a dutch law firm 
wrong decision one trying to defraud 
the hague.plan a letters of credit 
in november,an angry mob of young islamic revolutionaries backed by the iranian government overran the american embassy in tehran,taking more than americans hostage.president carter ordered a freeze on all iranian funds.ordoubadi,then an iranian citizen living in the united states,wanted to get money out of iran.so did ordoubadi stepbrother,karl showrai.but claims against the frozen funds could only be made by american citizens,and neither were american citizens at the time.
so showrai,or ordoubadi,or both,came up with this scheme they invented gordon williams,and formed an ohio irrigation equipment company called k s irrigation the irrigation company would sell equipment at inflated prices to showrai contracting company back in iran known as keyhan corporation.the basic idea was to get money out of iran.showrai authorized ordoubadi to take funds from keyhan and deposit it in iranian banks to obtain two letters of credit,each for.
but the scheme did work banks in the united states refused to honor the letters of credit in the wake of the freeze on all iranian assets.
plan b a formal claim to the hague 
ordoubadi went to plan b,which was essentially to make a claim to the hague tribunal based on the two dishonored letters of credit in the name of the nonexistent gordon williams.the tribunal had been set up by the algiers accords to adjudicate disputes between united states nationals and the government of iran.the major obstacle to the scheme was that,not being an american citizen at the time,he had no standing in his own right to present a claim to the tribunal.
the fictitious gordon williams was,at least as he existed on paper,an american citizen.in,a drivers license and an american birth certificate were dummied up for williams,plus other documents,in what would later become claim presented to the hague tribunal.
a front man,however,was needed.and that where mike boyajian came in.boyajian agreed to present the documents to a dutch law firm known as loeff van der ploeg,along with a initial payment.the idea was that the loeff firm would present claim to the hague tribunal.
boyajian presented the documents in september,when,ostensibly traveling on vacation,he met leonard van sandick of the loeff firm.sandick was pleased that gordon williams had a united states birth certificate.while sandick had some early doubts about the williams claim,reassurances from boyajian caused him to believe in its bona fides.
the loeff firm took the case,and,to skip ahead to,obtained an award in favor of gordon williams for exactly 
but again,the scheme did work.in,sandick discovered that gordon williams did exist.sandick called his contact,boyajian,and boyajian confessed that williams was,in fact,ordoubadi.
the jig was up.sandick informed the tribunal of the falsity of the claim.the money,instead of going to ordoubadi,ended up in the federal reserve bank of new york,where,in litigation in the southern district of new york,the federal court would determine that showrai,posing as williams,was not entitled to the money.see williams,supra.ordoubadi,also posing as williams,was not a claimant in that litigation the money ultimately ended up in the settlement bank of the netherlands.
wrong decision two stiffing the dutch law firm 
but this case is not about,at least directly,the scheme to obtain money under false pretenses.another part of the scheme was this other than the initial payment of,ordoubadi and boyajian never intended to pay the loeff firm any of its fees 
the loeff firm was not happy about being duped,and even unhappier at having done about of work on the williams case and then not get paid for it.
accordingly,in,the loeff firm sued boyajian,ordoubadi and showrai in northern california where ordoubadi apparently lived.that litigation after transfer to southern california would eventually,in,yield a judgment against showrai,ordoubadi and boyajian in a decision by judge lourdes baird.
significantly,both boyajian and ordoubadi answered the loeff suit against them and would eventually file against each other for indemnity.
here is what michael boyajian said in his albeit filed in,about his potential liability to the loeff firm to the extent that defendant boyajian acted in connection with the transaction which is the subject of the complaint,loeff not being paid its fees herein,he acted at all times at the request and direction of defendant ordoubadi,also known as gordon williams.if defendant boyajian is held liable to plaintiff the loeff firm for any claims asserted by plaintiff,then the ordoubadi and showrai are liable to defendant boyajian for all claims asserted by plaintiff against boyajian.
but that getting a bit ahead of ourselves in the narrative.in,with the loeff claim pending,ordoubadi filed for chapter bankruptcy,listing a purported claim by boyajian related to the loeff action.the loeff firm filed an adversary action in this bankruptcy to establish that its claim against ordoubadi was not dischargeable.ordoubadi received,in,a discharge in what was supposed to be a case the discharge,however,did not extend to the loeff claim.
for his part,in,boyajian filed for chapter bankruptcy in the central district of california.the loeff firm also filed an adversary action there,to establish the nondischargeability of its claim against boyajian.
wrong decision three not litigating the claim for 
indemnity when boyajian had the chance 
the two bankruptcy adversarial actions,plus the underlying civil suit brought by the loeff firm,were consolidated and moved to southern california,where a trial was conducted in front of judge lourdes baird.but no adversarial actions were ever filed by boyajian contesting the dischargeability of any claims he might have against ordoubadi arising out of the loeff scheme.
in,judge baird gave a judgment in favor of the loeff firm for some against showrai,ordoubadi and boyajian,and the judgment provided for joint and several liability.while the decision details why the debt to the loeff firm could not be discharged in bankruptcy,it did not address any claims that boyajian or ordoubadi might have,or have had,against each other for equitable indemnity.no such claims were presented.
indeed,to this day,boyajian still asserts on appeal that he had no reason to know he had a future indemnity claim against ordoubadi back when ordoubadi filed for bankruptcy.on page of his reply brief,for example,he asserts that he had no way of knowing he would have a future comparative equitable indemnity claim against ordoubadi or even that he would be found to be an intentional joint tortfeasor with ordoubadi.we will have a little more to say about that assertion anon.
in any event,boyajian strategy of not asserting the nondischargeability of his indemnity claim against ordoubadi did work.judge baird written decision found both of them to be not credible,and held them both jointly and severally liable.
d.the fallout boyajian pays the piper 
and wants to share the pain 
we now fast forward to.boyajian had apparently come into some assets.loeff assigned its judgment to a firm known as mayor dune,and mayor dune levied on boyajian bank account for about.after an abortive action dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in the central district,boyajian filed,in august of,this lawsuit in orange county superior court for equitable indemnity.
the case came to a court trial in the summer of.while most of the case was tried on documents and stipulated facts,testimony was taken on the issue of whether boyajian had notice of ordoubadi bankruptcy and,more particularly,his listing of boyajian claim in regard to the loeff claim against them both.the trial court found the bankruptcy discharge to be dispositive,and entered judgment against boyajian.after an unsuccessful new trial motion,boyajian then timely filed this appeal.
the main argument presented in boyajian appeal is this fundamentally legal one because boyajian did not pay any money on the loeff debt until,he argues that by definition he had no claim against ordoubadi in,when ordoubadi discharged all his debts save the one to the loeff firm,and therefore the bankruptcy discharge did not apply to boyajian claim for equitable indemnity based on the payment 
judge fell,of course,thought otherwise.in adjudicating the new trial motion at trial,she asked rhetorically the same debt that was discharged in that chapter bankruptcy is the one that boyajian is trying to claim in this case.what have i gotten wrong 
ii.the analysis 
as we now explain,judge fell got nothing wrong.the discharge in ordoubadi bankruptcy is dispositive.
on appeal,boyajian argument goes like this 
a under california law,no cause of action exists for equitable indemnity until the underlying debt or loss is paid.
b nothing was paid here until.
c ergo,it was legally impossible for boyajian cause of action against ordoubadi for equitable indemnity to have been discharged in.
the fallacy in this syllogism is that it equates causes of action with claims.
it is indeed true,as boyajian now asserts,that a cause of action for equitable indemnity does not exist until the underlying loss is paid,people ex rel.of transportation superior court cal d,of transportation it is well settled that a cause of action for implied indemnity does not accrue or come into existence until the indemnitee,the initial defendant has suffered actual loss through payment original italics cold storage matson navigation d,under california law,however,a cause of action for equitable indemnity arises only when the indemnitee actually incurs a loss by payment of the underlying claim or judgment.
the rule,however,is one by which the statute of limitations is tested.see of transportation,supra,cal d at.and just because a cause of action,for purposes of the statute of limitations,does not exist until a given future event does not necessarily mean that that the claim on which that cause of action is based can not be 
discharged in bankruptcy prior to that future event.
in this regard,we first note that california courts regularly are required to value claims for equitable indemnity prior to actual payment of the underlying debt in the context of good faith settlements this happens all the time in construction defect cases where,at the beginning,when an owner sues a builder or a developer,claims for equitable as well as other kinds of indemnity fly thick and fast,and eventually parties settle and want protection from future claims for equitable indemnity for example,in fleck bollinger home th,a builder was able to assign a cause of action for equitable indemnity to owner despite the fact that the builder had not yet paid off the underlying debt the trial court did not err in permitting the bollinger parties the builder to assign to fleck the owners their distinct cause of action for equitable indemnity for the contingent damages it faced as a result of the litigation 
this is so even though actions for indemnity do not typically accrue for the purposes of the statute of limitations until payment of a judgment or settlement.italics added.
to the same effect are erreca superior court th,which involved valuing the indemnity rights against nonsettling defendants it is clear that assignment of indemnity rights may constitute a valuable noncash consideration for settlement and alcal roofing insulation superior court th,where there was an assignment of a developer indemnity rights against a roofer to a homeowners association except there,the court said the parties should have placed a value on the assignment of the rights for purposes of seeking good faith settlement protection.
turning to bankruptcy law proper,we first note that the bankruptcy code itself is framed in terms of a dischargeable claim including a right to payment even when that right is contingent or unmatured or disputed.
thus bankruptcy courts regularly discharge contingent claims,including claims for contribution based on payments yet to be made.for example,in boston and maine massachusetts bay transp.authority cir,at the time of the debtor discharge,a local government entity had a contingent claim for contribution based on oil contamination at a particular site id.at,and the court held the discharge barred the later claim by the entity for contribution.
to be sure,indemnity claims have presented,in bankruptcy law,the conundrum,inherent in boyajian argument here,that one does know what the future amount of the obligation might be.but,as the first circuit has noted,courts have proceeded on the premise that the task will simply require some estimation.see colonial sur.weizman cir,noting decisions that treat contingent claims as intrinsically dischargeable under the present statute,saying that the court must just make the best estimate it can as to the present value of the claim.
closer to home,in the central district,there is a case on point,in re motley motley.in motley,the debtors a couple signed,in,a guaranty for a tenant on certain premises.the debtors received a chapter discharge in.when,in,the tenant ceased paying rent,the landlord sued both the tenant and,on their guaranty,the debtors,in state court.the landlord got a judgment against the tenant and the debtors.yes,that should have happened,as the bankruptcy court would later declare.the landlord then recorded an abstract of the judgment which became a lien against the debtors residence.
then the debtors sold their residence,but the buyers lender wanted a title insurance policy showing the lender deed of trust was in first position.the title insurer,in turn,wanted an indemnity agreement from the debtors,plus a deposit of money to cover the judgment and accrued interest thereon.
and the debtors signed it.the indemnity agreement provided that if the judgment was not paid off within days from its date,the title company would pay the judgment itself and refund the balance of the deposit to the debtors.
the title company,however,ended up paying the judgment to the landlord out of its own pocket,and then sought reimbursement from the deposited funds it was holding from the debtors.
the debtors then brought a motion in state court to vacate the judgment against them on the grounds that it violated their discharge injunction in their prior bankruptcy case,but the state trial court denied the motion.the debtors filed for bankruptcy again,this time in chapter.
in order to get to the question of who owned the deposited funds,the bankruptcy court had to confront the issue of the prior bankruptcy.and it held that the guaranty,given back in,was a prepetition obligation that was discharged in their prior bankruptcy case.motley,supra,at.the point was,at the time that the rent accrued the guaranty was gone.id.at.added the court,the state court had no jurisdiction to hold the debtors accountable for their personal guarantee.id.at.
which brought the court to the indemnity agreement,ironically made after the discharge,which the debtors had given to the title company.the indemnity agreement obligated the debtors to satisfy the debt that the title company itself had paid.motley,supra,at.the court held that the debtors could not even contract to pay the discharged debt,the debt had not been resuscitated by a reaffirmation agreement,and so the debtors were entitled to the return of th
