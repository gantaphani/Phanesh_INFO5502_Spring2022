these appeals arise from two takings suits related to the bankruptcies of general motors corporation gm and chrysler llc chrysler.the plaintiffs are former dealers of those companies whose franchises were terminated in the bankruptcies.the plaintiffs allege that these terminations constituted a taking because the government required them as a condition of its providing financial assistance to gm and chrysler to the companies that succeeded them in the bankruptcies.the government moved to dismiss the suits for failure to state a claim.the united states court of federal claims claims court denied dismissal,and the government brought these interlocutory appeals.
because we lack the benefit of a fully developed factual record,we do not at this stage address every issue the government raises.as to the issues we do address,we reject the government arguments for dismissal.while we hold that the complaints are deficient because they do not sufficiently allege that the economic value of the plaintiffs franchises was reduced or eliminated as a result of the government actions,we nonetheless affirm the claims court decision to deny dismissal at this point in the proceedings.the proper remedy is to grant the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaints to include the necessary allegations,and on remand the claims court shall do so.
background 
at this stage in the proceedings,we accept the dealers factual allegations as true.ashcroft iqbal.while we primarily consider the allegations in the complaint,we may also look to matters incorporated by reference or integral to the claim,items subject to judicial notice,and matters of public record.charles alan wright arthur miller,federal practice and procedure ed.
the bankruptcies of gm and chrysler took place in the historic recession and credit crisis of.gm and chrysler were in serious financial difficulty,as loans to automobile dealers and consumers had come to an abrupt halt and sales plummeted.a d automobile sales were down more than from the previous year,falling to their lowest level in years.in a major public speech,president bush expressed fears that i f we were to allow the free market to take its course now,it would almost certainly lead to disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation for the automakers.president george bush,president bush discusses administration plan to assist automakers,transcript available at htt p.news.html.in late,the chief executives of gm and chrysler appeared before congress to ask for emergency financial assistance in the form of loans and lines of credit.shortly thereafter,treasury secretary henry paulson created the automotive industry financing program,through which the department of treasury treasury would make loans and other investments in the automakers using government funds.as the plaintiffs agree,the stated goal of the program was to avoid disorderly bankruptcy and liquidation,which would entirely eliminate them as ongoing entities.id.the program was created as a part of the wider troubled asset relief program tarp,which made similar investments in a number of financial institutions.tarp had been established by congress two months earlier,in the emergency economic stabilization act of,stat.
the government first assistance to the automakers consisted of stopgap loans billion to gm,billion to chrysler intended to keep the companies from having to cease operations pending talks over more comprehensive assistance.in connection with these loans,the government and the automakers entered formal agreements setting forth the conditions of the government assistance.one condition was that the companies would submit viability plans demonstrating that they could achieve financial stability with the help of the government funds.gm and chrysler submitted their viability plans in february as required.
the government rejected gm and chrysler initial viability plans and called for the submission of revised proposals.executive branch officials in charge of overseeing the financial assistance suggested that the companies adopt various changes to improve their viability,such as focusing on lighter,more vehicles and in gm case more quickly reducing the number of brands.the government specifically suggested that the automakers should significantly reduce the number of dealers within their franchise networks to improve their viability.although the automakers were already reducing their dealer ranks over time and gm initial viability plan had included additional dealer terminations,the government determined that the current and proposed pace of terminations was too slow,and that the companies large dealer networks were an obstacle to viability.the government advised the companies they should expand their terminations and that they might accomplish the terminations expeditiously by opting to reject the franchise agreements in bankruptcy proceedings outside bankruptcy,the dealer franchises had protections against termination under various state and federal franchise laws.the complaints allege that the government proposals concerning franchise terminations were mandatory that is,that the government required the automakers to include them or else forgo any further financial assistance.at this stage,we accept the plaintiffs allegations as true,and proceed on the assumption that the government required these terms as a condition of financial assistance.
the companies eventually adopted the government suggestions for a bankruptcy filing,reduction of their dealer networks,and other changes.each filed for chapter reorganization,and the government made available an additional billion in financing billion in loans and equity investments to gm,billion in loans to chrysler for restructuring the companies.after approval by the bankruptcy court under,the old gm and chrysler entities sold most of their operating assets to newly created entities commonly called new gm and new chrysler in which the federal government,and other entities,acquired specified ownership interests.as a result of the sale,the government acquired a ownership stake in new gm common stock,as well as a portion of its preferred stock.the dealer franchises that were not terminated were transferred to the new entities along with other assets.the termination of the remaining franchises was handled differently by each company.in chrysler case,the franchises were eventually terminated by the bankruptcy estate.in gm case,either the franchises were terminated by the bankruptcy estate or the dealers signed deferred termination agreements providing for a transition to termination.to the extent the franchises were terminated by action of the bankruptcy estate,the affected dealers received unsecured claims against the estates,see g in re old carco llc,but it is unclear whether they have received anything for those claims.it is unclear as well whether the dealers who signed termination agreements received any compensation.
the first of these two suits was filed in september by several terminated gm and chrysler dealers.suing on behalf of themselves and a putative class of others similarly situated,the plaintiffs alleged that the government had effected a taking of their dealer franchises including rights conferred by state law by coerci ng the automakers that is,by requiring dealer terminations as a condition of financial assistance.colonial see also a d.the plaintiffs alleged that this constituted a regulatory taking.they did not allege a physical taking 
in february,a separate group of former chrysler dealers brought a second suit in the claims court.the two complaints were largely identical in substance.
both cases were assigned to the same judge of the claims court.shortly after amended complaints were filed,the government moved pursuant to claims court rule b to dismiss each complaint for failure to state a claim the claims court denied both motions,issuing an identical order in each case.the claims court concluded that the plaintiffs allegations were sufficient to make out a prima facie takings claim.the court noted that it was not aware of a takings theory that resembles the legal and factual theories offered so far and that the plaintiffs unusual allegations did not fit neatly into a normal takings framework.colonial a d.nonetheless,the court found that the p laintiffs should have the opportunity to develop their case s.colonial a d.the court reasoned that the possibility that the plaintiffs could prevail demand ed rejection of the government motion to dismiss on the pleadings as premature.colonial a d.
after the claims court denied dismissal,the government moved the court to certify an interlocutory appeal under d.the government asked the claims court to certify two questions whether the complaints failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted,and whether bankruptcy court findings precluded the suit.the claims court certified the first question only.the government then filed petitions for interlocutory appeal with this court.we granted the petitions,agreeing that the criteria for interlocutory appeal are met and that these petitions should be granted and heard on the merits by this court.order granting petitions for interlocutory appeal,november,ecf.we review the denial of the government motions to dismiss de novo.see,first med.health plan,vega ramos,cir on interlocutory appeal,denial of motion to dismiss is reviewed de novo.
discussion 
we address initially the scope of our review in this case.our appellate jurisdiction is ordinarily limited to the claims court final decisions.see a.but our jurisdiction extends to certain interlocutory orders as well pursuant to d.in interlocutory appeals,the scope of the issues is limited to the order appealed from,but not to the specific stated question articulated by the claims court.charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed.we may consider any question reasonably bound up with the certified order,whether it is antecedent to,broader or narrower than,or different from the question specified by the claims court.id.at see sky techs.llc sap ag,united states connolly.but we are not obligated to decide all questions presented by the order.see wright,miller,cooper,supra,at noting that courts of appeals have discretion to vacate an initial grant of permission to appeal.that is particularly so in cases where an underdeveloped record may lead to decision of an important question.id.at.
the facts of this case are unique and raise issues that have not been decided before,and the record at this stage consists of little more than the plaintiffs allegations.as discussed below,we decline to address some questions asked at this preliminary stage without the benefit of a full factual record.but we conclude that other issues are ripe for decision.
the takings clause of the fifth amendment guarantees just compensation whenever private property is taken for public use.const.amend.v.the plaintiffs do not allege,and their complaints do not assert facts supporting an allegation of,a direct government appropriation or physical invasion of their private property.lingle chevron,see,united states pewee coal,seizure and operation of private coal mine united states motors,occupation of private warehouse.nor do they allege,or support an allegation,that the government stepped into the shoes of the dealers by assuming their contractual rights or transferring them to a third party 
government action that does not directly appropriate or invade,physically destroy,or oust an owner from property but is overly burdensome may be a regulatory taking.the general rule at least is that while property may be regulated to a certain extent,if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.coal mahon,see also lingle,at regulation is a taking if it is so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster.the plaintiffs have alleged only regulatory takings.
the supreme court has treated certain regulatory actions as categorical takings.a categorical taking occurs where regulations compel the property owner to suffer a physical invasion of his property or prohibit all economically beneficial or productive use.lucas coastal council,internal quotation marks omitted.beyond those categories,the supreme court has generally eschewed any set formula,instead preferring to engage in essentially ad hoc,factual inquiries.id.internal quotation marks omitted.but three factors have particular significance in the analysis the character of the governmental action,the extent to which the action has interfered with distinct expectations,and t he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant.cent.transp.city of new york.and of course,the existence of a valid property interest is necessary in all takings claims.wyatt united states.
the supreme court has mainly applied the categorical test to regulatory takings of real property.see lucas,at.as the claims court recognized,other circuits view the lucas test as applying only to land.hawkeye commodity promotions,vilsack,cir i t appears that lucas protects real property only.unity real estate hudson,cir t he categorical approach has only been used in real property cases.see also lucas,at i n the case of personal property,by reason of the state traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings,the owner ought to be aware of the possibility that new regulation might even render his property economically worthless.we have applied the categorical test to personal property on occasion,rose acre farms,united states,maritrans,united states.but those cases involved only tangible property.rose acre farms,at chickens maritrans,at barges see also brown legal found.of.we have not had occasion to address whether the categorical takings test applies to takings of intangible property such as contract rights.we decline to decide the issue at this stage of the litigation since the issue has not been briefed by the parties.
we begin our analysis in this case with the alleged property interest,an issue equally relevant to alleged categorical takings and to takings governed by the penn central analysis.there is no dispute that the plaintiffs franchise agreements are property for purposes of the takings clause.in general,v alid contracts are property,whether the obligor be a private individual,a municipality,a state,or the united states.lynch united states,see also trust of new jersey,contract rights are a form of property and as such may be taken for a public purpose provided that just compensation is paid.franchise agreements are no exception to this general rule.
the government argues that the plaintiffs nonetheless lack a compensable property interest.as the government points out,during the lifetime of the agreements,the law of bankruptcy has always allowed a trustee or to reject executory contracts as gm and chrysler did here.see generally a.the government argues that this principle of bankruptcy law inhere d in the franchise agreements,and that termination of the agreements therefore did not concern a compensable property interest of the plaintiffs.gov t colonial br.gov t a d br.
we reject this argument.it is true that background principles of law may inhere in a plaintiff title to his property and thereby limit his ability to recover for a taking.lucas,at see also bair united states,m j coal united states.for example,the common law of nuisance limits uses of real property that interfere with neighbors rights of enjoyment.see lucas,at.thus a landowner may not recover for a taking when the government forbids a use that is a nuisance at common law.id.the law of nuisance inheres in the landowner title,so there is no taking if a use restriction falls within the scope of nuisance law.see also calero toledo pearson yacht leasing,u,no taking when innocent owner property is subject to forfeiture due to criminal acts of lessee commonwealth edison united states,en banc.
if a challenged restriction was enacted before the property interest was acquired,the restriction may be said to inhere in the title if a challenged restriction was enacted after the plaintiff property interest was acquired,it can not be said to inhere in the plaintiff title.for example,in bair united states,we held that a law giving priority to federal government liens inhered in the title of liens owned by other parties and created after the priority statute was enacted.at.the exercise of the government lien did not effect a taking because the priority law predated the plaintiffs liens and therefore inhered in their title.id.other circuits have similarly held that a law allowing bankrupt debtors to avoid certain liens inhered in the title of subsequently created liens.see,in re weinstein,cir in re thompson,cir.but though prospective application of such laws does not give rise to takings liability,retroactive application to existing property interests would raise difficult and sensitive questions of a taking.united states sec.indus.bank.
here,the plaintiffs do not dispute that the bankruptcy law allowing trustees or to reject executory contracts predated the creation of their franchise agreements.thus the plaintiffs could have no compensable property interest if the government action were limited to the bankruptcy court approval of the terminations.the government problem is the alleged government action here is not the bankruptcy court approval of the franchise terminations a theory that the plaintiffs have abandoned.the plaintiffs allege that the government action was requiring dealer terminations as a condition of financial assistance to the automakers.the challenged government action did not predate the acquisition of the plaintiffs interests.the plaintiffs franchise agreements are valid and compensable property interests.
we turn next to whether there has been government action sufficient to invoke a takings analysis either under lucas or penn central.the question here is whether the government is liable for a taking where it offers financing to a third party as a way of inducing or requiring action that affects or eliminates the property rights of the plaintiff.we conclude that such actions may give rise to takings liability depending on the circumstances.there is no per se rule either precluding or imposing liability when the government instigates action by a third party.but two broad principles drawn from the cases may guide the analysis.
first,in some circumstances,government action directed to a third party does not give rise to a taking if its effects on the plaintiff are merely unintended or collateral.see generally omnia comm.united states.in omnia,for example,the government requisitioned a steel producer entire output for the war effort,thereby preventing the plaintiff from exercising purchase rights it had obtained through a contract with the producer.id.at.the supreme court concluded that the plaintiff loss was merely consequential loss or injury resulting from the requisition,and that no compensation was due the plaintiff.id.at.similarly,in,united states,the government appropriated real property of a bankrupt railroad,terminating the plaintiff contractual right to operate a particular rail facility and receive the profits.cl.our predecessor court held that the plaintiff loss was merely a consequential injur y which result ed from the exercise of lawful power.id.at.a number of our cases have found no taking where the challenged government action was of general application and the plaintiff was but one member of an affected class of persons.see,palmyra pac.seafoods,llc united states,huntleigh usa united states,air pegasus of.united states.as the supreme court has explained,a member of the class which is regulated may suffer economic losses not shared by others.his property may lose utility and depreciate in value as a consequence of regulation.but that has never been a barrier to the exercise of the police power.bowles willingham.
in summary,in the cases relied on by the government,the effect of the government action upon the plaintiff was merely collateral or unintended or the action affected a general class.here,the complaints allege that the effect of the government action on the plaintiffs property was neither collateral nor unintended and the action affected only chrysler and gm dealers.the complaints allege that dealer terminations were the direct and intended result of the government actions directed to chrysler and gm dealers because the financing was expressly conditioned on the terminations.this case is therefore different from the cases on which the government relies.
a second principle applies where the government action was direct and intended.in such circumstances,the government may be liable if the third party is acting as the government agent or the government influence over the third party was coercive rather than merely persuasive.see.state bank united states,lion raisins,united states,casa de cambio comdiv,de united states,fed.cir b g enters.united states,langenegger united states.an agency relationship may exist where the third party is hired or granted legal authority to carry out the government business.see,yearsley ross constr.co,construction company hired to build river dikes lion raisins,at crop marketing committee authorized to set price floors for crops hendler united states,state officials authorized to perform environmental tests on the plaintiffs land.here,gm and chrysler were not acting as agents of the government in terminating the franchise agreements.
the question of coercion is more complex.while the complaints here allege that the government coerced gm and chrysler into terminating the franchise agreements,they do not allege that the government either by statute,regulation,or direct order required the terminations rather,the complaints allege that the government required the terminations as a condition of financial assistance,and that that action was coercive because the automakers could not survive without the financing.the line between coercion which may create takings liability and persuasion which does not create takings liability is highly and hardly simple to determine.
our predecessor court found coercion in turney united states,where the government induced the philippines to forbid exportation of certain military equipment within its borders that the united states had unwittingly sold to the plaintiffs in a surplus auction after world war ii.cl.the court found that the government had exerted unusual influence over the philippine government decision our armed forces had just liberated the philippines from the japanese.our government had given one hundred million dollars worth of surplus property to the philippines when we requested that government to place an embargo upon the exportation of any of the property,it,naturally,readily complied.id.at.thus,when the embargo placed irresistible pressure on the plaintiffs to turn the property over to the united states,it created a taking.id.
in langenegger united states,by contrast,this court concluded that the government influence over an expropriation by the el salvadoran government was not coercion but friendly persuasion.at internal quotation marks omitted.distinguishing turney,we explained that 
the united states can not be held responsible merely because its activity is that of friendly persuasion regarding general policy,common among allies,or when the sole benefit to the united states is the political stability of its neighbors.diplomatic persuasion among allies is a common occurrence,and as a matter of law,can not be deemed sufficiently irresistible to warrant a finding of coercion,however difficult refusal may be as a practical matter.
the plaintiffs have not alleged coercion flowing from an existing relationship between the government and a third party that gave the government the ability to exercise general control over the third party action.rather they allege monetary inducement designed to compel specific actions.the only appellate takings precedent cited to us involving monetary inducement of third party action is b g enterprises united states,at.in that case,congress offered monetary grants to the states on the condition that they adopt laws prohibiting cigarette sales to minors.id.at.california fulfilled the condition by enacting a law banning cigarette vending machines in establishments open to minors,which resulted in the loss of valuable contracts to the plaintiff,a vending machine operator.id.at.we held that the federal governme
