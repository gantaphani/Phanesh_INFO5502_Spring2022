individual debtors may seek discharge of their financial obligations under either chapter or chapter of the bankruptcy code.in a chapter proceeding,the debtor assets are transferred to a bankruptcy estate.a.the estate assets are then promptly liquidated,a,and distributed to creditors.a chapter estate,however,does not include the wages a debtor earns or the assets he acquires after the bankruptcy filing.a.chapter,a wholly voluntary alternative to chapter,permits the debtor to retain assets during bankruptcy subject to a plan for payment of his debts.payments under a chapter plan are usually made from a debtor future income.a.the chapter estate,unlike a chapter estate,therefore includes both the debtor property at the time of his bankruptcy petition,and any assets he acquires after filing.a.because many debtors fail to complete a chapter plan successfully,congress accorded debtors a nonwaivable right to convert a chapter case to one under chapter at any time.a.conversion does not commence a new bankruptcy case,but it does terminate the service of the chapter trustee.e.
petitioner harris,indebted to multiple creditors and behind on his home mortgage payments to chase manhattan,filed a chapter bankruptcy petition.his plan provided that he would resume making monthly mortgage payments to chase,and that per month would be withheld from his postpetition wages and remitted to the chapter trustee,respondent viegelahn.trustee viegelahn would make monthly payments to chase to pay down harris mortgage arrears,and distribute remaining funds to harris other creditors.when harris again fell behind on his mortgage,chase foreclosed on his home.following the foreclosure,viegelahn continued to receive per month from harris wages,but stopped making the payments earmarked for chase.as a result,funds formerly reserved for chase accumulated in viegelahn possession.approximately a year after the foreclosure,harris converted his case to chapter.ten days after this conversion,viegelahn distributed in harris withheld wages mainly to harris creditors.asserting that viegelahn lacked authority to disburse his postpetition wages to creditors postconversion,harris sought an order from the bankruptcy court directing refund of the accumulated wages viegelahn paid to his creditors.the bankruptcy court granted harris motion,and the district court affirmed.the fifth circuit reversed,concluding that a former chapter trustee must distribute a debtor accumulated postpetition wages to his creditors.
held a debtor who converts to chapter is entitled to return of any postpetition wages not yet distributed by the chapter trustee.
a absent a conversion,f limits a converted chapter estate to property belonging to the debtor as of the date the original chapter petition was filed.because postpetition wages do not fit that bill,undistributed wages collected by a chapter trustee ordinarily do not become part of a converted chapter estate.
b by excluding postpetition wages from the converted chapter estate absent a conversion,f removes those earnings from the pool of assets that may be liquidated and distributed to creditors.allowing a terminated chapter trustee to disburse the very same earnings to the very same creditors is incompatible with that statutory design.
c this conclusion is reinforced by e,which terminates the service of the chapter trustee upon conversion.one service provided by a chapter trustee is disbursing payments to creditors.c.the moment a case is converted from chapter to chapter,a chapter trustee is stripped of authority to provide that service.
d section a,which provides that a confirmed chapter plan bind s the debtor and each creditor,and a,which instructs a trustee to distribute payment s in accordance with the plan,ceased to apply once the case was converted to chapter.i.sections a and a,therefore,offer no support for viegelahn assertion that the bankruptcy code requires a terminated chapter trustee to distribute to creditors postpetition wages remaining in the trustee possession.continuing to distribute funds to creditors pursuant to a defunct chapter plan,moreover,is not one of the trustee postconversion responsibilities specified by the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure.
e because chapter is a voluntary alternative to chapter,a debtor postconversion receipt of a fraction of the wages he earned and would have kept had he filed under chapter in the first place does not provide the debtor with a windfall.a trustee who distributes payments regularly may have little or no accumulated wages to return,while a trustee who distributes payments infrequently may have a sizable refund to make.but creditors may gain protection against the risk of excess accumulations in the hands of trustees by seeking to have a chapter plan include a schedule for regular disbursement of collected funds.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns the disposition of wages earned by a debtor after he petitions for bankruptcy.the treatment of postpetition wages generally depends on whether the debtor is proceeding under chapter of the bankruptcy code in which the debtor retains assets,often his home,during bankruptcy subject to a plan for the payment of his debts or chapter in which the debtor assets are immediately liquidated and the proceeds distributed to creditors.in a chapter proceeding,postpetition wages are p roperty of the estate,a,and may be collected by the chapter trustee for distribution to creditors,a.in a chapter proceeding,those earnings are not estate property instead,they belong to the debtor.see a.the code permits the debtor to convert a chapter proceeding to one under chapter at any time,a upon such conversion,the service of the chapter trustee terminates,e.
when a debtor initially filing under chapter exercises his right to convert to chapter,who is entitled to wages still in the hands of the chapter trustee not the chapter estate when the conversion is in good faith,all agree.may the trustee distribute the wage payments to creditors as the chapter plan required,or must she remit them to the debtor that is the question this case presents.we hold that,under the governing provisions of the bankruptcy code,a debtor who converts to chapter is entitled to return of any postpetition wages not yet distributed by the chapter trustee.
the bankruptcy code provides diverse courses overburdened debtors may pursue to gain discharge of their financial obligations,and thereby a fresh start.marrama citizens bank of,quoting grogan garner.two roads individual debtors may take are relevant here chapter and chapter bankruptcy proceedings.
chapter allows a debtor to make a clean break from his financial past,but at a steep price prompt liquidation of the debtor assets.when a debtor files a chapter petition,his assets,with specified exemptions,are immediately transferred to a bankruptcy estate.a.a chapter trustee is then charged with selling the in the estate,a,and distributing the proceeds to the debtor creditors.crucially,however,a chapter estate does not include the wages a debtor earns or the assets he acquires after the bankruptcy filing.a.thus,while a chapter debtor must forfeit virtually all his prepetition property,he is able to make a fresh start by shielding from creditors his postpetition earnings and acquisitions.
chapter works differently.a wholly voluntary alternative to chapter,chapter allows a debtor to retain his property if he proposes,and gains court confirmation of,a plan to repay his debts over a three to period.b,b.payments under a chapter plan are usu
