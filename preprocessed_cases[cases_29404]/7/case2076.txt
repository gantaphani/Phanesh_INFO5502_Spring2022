in sherwood,the court addressed the same issue we are faced with here whether the bankruptcy code preempted section.sherwood,supra,at.similar to the facts in our case,thinklink transferred million to lycos.two months later,thinklink made a voluntary general assignment for the benefit of creditors to sherwood.sherwood sued lycos to recover the million pursuant to section.after the matter was removed to federal court,the district court rejected lycos preemption argument and granted sherwood motion for summary judgment.ibid.
the sherwood court began by explaining the applicable preemption principles congress has broad authority to preempt state laws,but whether congress has done so in a particular instance is a matter of congressional intent.this intent is most easily detected where the statute expressly preempts other laws,but preemption may also be inferred where it is clear from the statute and surrounding circumstances that congress intended to occupy the field,leaving no room for state regulation.the supreme court has citation summarized the contours of the field preemption doctrine absent explicit language,congress intent to supersede state law altogether may be found from a scheme of federal regulation so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,because the act of congress may touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject,or because the object sought to be obtained by the federal law and the character of obligations imposed by it may reveal the same purpose.citations.even where congress has not entirely displaced state regulation in a specific area,the court continued,state law is where it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.citations.
there can be no doubt that federal bankruptcy law is pervasive and involves a federal interest so dominant as to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject much like many other areas of congressional power listed in article i,section,of the constitution,such as patents,copyrights,currency,national defense and immigration.the bankruptcy clause,which grants congress the power to make bankruptcy laws,const.art.i,cl,stresses that such rules must be uniform.bankruptcy law occupies a full title of the united states code.it provides a comprehensive system of rights,obligations and procedures,as well as a complex administrative machinery that includes a special system of federal courts and united states trustees.
at the same time,federal law coexists peaceably with,and often expressly incorporates,state laws regulating the rights and obligations of debtors or their assignees and creditors.see,united states code section b making state law on voidable transfers available to the bankruptcy trustee sherwood,supra,at.
the sherwood court first addressed sherwood claim the bankruptcy code does not preempt section because it is specifically incorporated by section b of title of the united states code section b,which allows a bankruptcy trustee to avoid any transfers voidable by unsecured creditors under applicable law,including state law.sherwood,supra,at.the court disagreed with sherwood because section b limits the trustee powers to unsecured creditors whereas section can only be exercised by general assignees.ibid.interpreting the statutory definitions of creditor and custodian,which includes assignee s under a general assignment for the benefit of the debtor creditors the court opined creditor does not include custodians.id.at.
next,the sherwood court addressed whether section assignee special avoidance powers could coexist with the federal bankruptcy scheme.sherwood,supra,at.the court explained the bankruptcy code embodies two separate and somewhat independent ideals it is generally agreed that chapter of the bankruptcy code,which governs liquidations,embodies two ideals giving the individual debtor a fresh start,by giving him a discharge of most of his debts and equitably distributing a debtor assets among competing creditors.id.at.the court explained the united states supreme court has held state laws that perform the first function,the discharge of debts,are preempted.ibid.
as to the second function,the court,without citation to any authority,stated,what goes for state discharge provisions also holds true for state statutes that implicate the federal bankruptcy law other major goal,namely equitable distribution.sherwood,supra,at.the court explained the federal bankruptcy scheme accomplishes equitable distribution thro
