appellants the texas comptroller of public accounts and the texas workforce commission appeal the district court judgment affirming a postjudgment order entered by the bankruptcy court setting out the interest rate applicable to payments due the appellants under section b of appellee transtexas gas corporation chapter reorganization plan.because we find that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enter this order,we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions that the district court vacate the bankruptcy court postjudgment order.
factual and procedural background 
we summarize only the factual and procedural information relevant to our disposition of this case.on february,the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of texas entered an order the confirmation order confirming appellee transtexas gas corporation transtexas second amended modified and restated plan of reorganization the reorganization plan under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.see.the confirmation order provided,inter alia,that a ten percent interest rate would apply to any payments due to appellants the texas comptroller of public accounts and the texas workforce commission collectively,the state taxing authorities under section b of the reorganization plan.the state taxing authorities,who had previously objected to the reorganization plan during the approval process,filed a notice of appeal in the bankruptcy court on february,indicating their intent to appeal the confirmation order to the united states district court for the southern district of texas.pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure,the state taxing authorities also filed a statement of the issues to be presented on appeal.see fed.within ten days after filing the notice of appeal the appellant shall file with the clerk and serve on appellee a designation of the items to be included in the record on appeal and a statement of the issues to be presented.this statement indicated that the issue on appeal was whether the bankruptcy court erred in setting a interest rate for the appellants unsecured priority tax claims.
on february,the bankruptcy court entered,sua sponte,a supplemental order regarding confirmation of debtor second amended,modified,and restated plan of reorganization the first supplemental order.this postjudgment order did not invoke the authority of any particular provision of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure or the federal rules of civil procedure.the order corrected one error in the reorganization plan replacing the word in paragraph eleven of the order with the word and reiterated the interest rate applicable to the state taxing authorities claims,stating if and to the extent that the priority tax claims of the texas comptroller are a llowed,the interest rate applicable to the payments to the texas comptroller provided for in section b of the plan shall be ten percent per annum,or such other rate that is determined upon final appeal.the text of the order clarified that it was a final order subject to immediate appeal.
also on february,transtexas filed an emergency motion for entry of order determining interest rate applicable to priority tax claims asserted by texas comptroller of public accounts and texas workforce commission seeking entry of a separate order from the order confirming the plan which orders that,to the extent that the priority tax claims of the texas comptroller are a llowed,the interest rate applicable to the payments to the texas comptroller provided for in section b of the plan shall be ten percent per annum.this motion did not invoke a particular provision of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure or the federal rules of civil procedure.
on february,the bankruptcy court conducted a telephone hearing to consider transtexas motion.the next day,on february,the bankruptcy court issued an order determining interest rate applicable to priority tax claims asserted by texas comptroller of public accounts and texas workforce commission the second supplemental order.this postjudgment order,which also did not invoke the authority of any particular provision of the federal rules of bankruptcy procedure or the federal rules of civil procedure,stated 
upon record of the confirmation hearing,including the objection to confirmation of the plan filed by the texas comptroller of public accounts and the texas workforce commission collectively,texas comptroller the court has determined that payment of priority tax claims asserted by the texas comptroller,to the extent such claims are a llowed,under the plan is ten percent per annum.accordingly,the court hereby orders i f and to the extent that the priority tax claims of the texas comptroller are a llowed,the interest rate applicable to the payments to the texas comptroller provided for in section b of the plan shall be ten percent per annum.
like the first supplemental order,the second supplemental order was designated as a final order subject to immediate appeal.
on february,the state taxing authorities filed two separate notices of appeal from the first and second supplemental orders.in the statements of issues accompanying these notices,the state taxing authorities described the issues on appeal as follows 
whether a bankruptcy court,at the request of a debtor and a lender,may deny creditors that have already filed a notice of appeal the right to appeal a confirmation order by entering a supplemental order that makes no substantive change in a ruling contained in the confirmation order.
to the extent not decided in the comptroller and twc appeal of the confirmation order,w h ether the bankruptcy court erred in setting a annual interest rate for unsecured priority tax claims under a c,when the reorganized debtor will be paying to interest on loans of similar duration obtained through the commercial loan market.
after these appeals were noticed,transtexas filed a motion to dismiss the state taxing authorities appeal of the confirmation order and the first supplemental order,arguing that these appeals were moot in light of the bankruptcy court subsequent entry of the second supplemental order.transtexas thus took the position that the second supplemental order,the february,order was the appropriate order for the district court to consider on appeal.the state taxing authorities filed a response to this motion and filed a separate motion seeking to consolidate their appeals of the confirmation order,the first supplemental order,and the second supplemental order.the district court issued an order granting the state taxing authorities motion to consolidate on march.the court did not rule on transtexas motion to dismiss in this order.
the parties subsequently briefed the merits of the interest rate dispute to the district court.on june,the district court entered an order the remand order remanding the case to the bankruptcy court.the district court noted that it was unclear from the record whether the bankruptcy court arrived at the ten percent interest rate by considering the appropriate factors dictated by this court decision in mississippi state tax commission lambert in re lambert,cir,and instructed the bankruptcy court to make further findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the market rate of interest applicable to the state taxing authorities priority tax claims,including,but not limited to the rate of interest that the debtor would pay to borrow a similar amount on the commercial market the quality of the debtor security and the subsequent risk of default by the debtor.
in this remand order,the district court also ruled on transtexas motion to dismiss the state taxing authorities appeals of the confirmation order and the first supplemental order.the court granted this motion in part,stating 
from the record,it appears that the bankruptcy court entered the separate order so that its entire order confirming the plan would not be disturbed on appeal,but rather only the portion dealing with the interest rate.appellants admit that the sole issue raised by their appeal is the setting of the interest rate by the bankruptcy court the court therefore concludes that appellants first two appeals are moot.accordingly,the court grants in part appellants motion to dismiss.
the district court did not further explain the rationale underlying its determination that the state taxing authorities first two appeals were moot.the state taxing authorities did not immediately attempt to appeal this remand order.
the bankruptcy court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance with the district court remand order on january.as characterized by the district court,these findings did not modify the bankruptcy court original order,the second supplemental order.rather,the bankruptcy court january,findings merely supplement ed the order with new findings of fact and conclusions of law.the district court ruled on the merits of the interest rate dispute on may,affirming the bankruptcy court second supplemental order,the february order reiterating that the interest rate applicable to the state taxing authorities priority tax claims was ten percent.
the state taxing authorities appealed this judgment on the merits to this court.they did not indicate any intent simultaneously to appeal the district court remand order dismissing their appeals of the confirmation order and the first supplemental order.indeed,in their statement of the issues on appeal filed pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b,the state taxing authorities stated that the sole issue presented was whether the bankruptcy court,in confirming a chapter plan,erred in setting a annual interest rate for unsecured priority tax claims under a c when the reorganized debtor will be paying to on loans of similar duration obtained through the commercial loan market.similarly,the state taxing authorities did not argue in their briefing that the district court dismissal of their first two appeals was improper.
the bankruptcy court rather unusual action in entering two supplemental orders that essentially reiterate a provision of the confirmation order has created a myriad of jurisdictional problems and procedural complexities in this case.when the resulting procedural web is untangled,we find that we from addressing the merits of the important issues presented in this case because the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enter the february,order that is before us on this appeal.

ii.what issues are properly before this court 
the state taxing authorities take the position that the district court march,order consolidated their appeals of all three of the bankruptcy court orders,the original confirmation order and the first and second supplemental orders into a single appeal addressing all three orders.thus,according to the taxing authorities,the district court may,final judgment actually addressed all three of these orders,and all three of the orders are properly before this court.while the state taxing authorities acknowledge that the district court dismissed their appeals of the confirmation order and the first supplemental order as moot in its june,remand order,they maintain that the declaration of the first two orders as moot merely reflected the fact that a single,consolidated appeal was now pending.they argue that this is the only appropriate reading of this portion of the district court remand order because n o argument has ever been made that the interest rate issue was moot in the substantive sense of no longer being a live,justiciable issue.thus,according to the state taxing authorities,the portion of the district court remand order granting transtexas motion to dismiss the taxing authorities appeals of the bankruptcy court first two orders had no practical effect because there are no longer three separate appeals.they maintain that,because the district court consolidated the three appeals for all purposes,the three appeals have merged into a single appeal,eliminating any jurisdictional and procedural problems caused by the bankruptcy court entry of three separate orders.
the state taxing authorities position misconstrues the nature and impact of consolidation.as the supreme court has recognized on numerous occasions,consolidation is permitted as a matter of convenience and economy in administration,but does not merge the suits into a single cause.johnson manhattan ry.consolidated actions retain their separate character.accord mckenzie united states,cir.concededly,this court has recognized at least one context in which consolidated actions are treated as a single action.in ringwald harris,cir,we held that a proper consolidation could cause otherwise separate actions to thenceforth be treated as a single judicial unit for purposes of federal rule of civil procedure b when the consolidation is clearly unlimited and the actions could originally have been brought as a single unit.id.at.thus,we determined that a summary judgment order disposing of the claims in only one of the consolidated actions at issue in ringwald was not a final order subject to immediate appeal because all the claims in the consolidated case had not been adjudicated.such an order was immediately appealable only if the trial court entered an appropriate certification pursuant to rule b.accord road sprinkler fitters local union cont l sprinkler,cir.a number of our sister circuits have similarly held that consolidated cases should either as a general rule or subject to a analysis be treated as a single unit for the purposes of rule b finality determinations.see,trinity broad.eller,cir huene united states,cir.ins,cir.moreover,at least one circuit has determined that consolidated cases should be treated as a single case for res judicata purposes.see bay state hmo mgmt.tingley,cir.
however,neither the finality of the bankruptcy court multiple orders,nor their res judicata effect is at issue in the instant case.instead,the state taxing authorities suggestion that the appeal at bar encompasses all three orders despite the district court dismissal of the appeals of the first two orders effectively argues that the district court consolidation of the state taxing authorities appeals of the bankruptcy court three orders somehow merged the bankruptcy court underlying orders that were the subject of these appeals.we can find no authority and,indeed,the state taxing authorities point to no authority supporting this unusual proposition.consolidated appeals of separate actions retain their separate character to the extent that issues raised or claims made in one of the constituent actions do not automatically become issues or claims in all of the constituent actions.thus,if one of the constituent actions is dismissed or summary judgment is granted,and this dismissal or judgment is not appealed after the district court has addressed the remaining constituent actions,the dismissed claims are not at issue in any subsequent appeal of the remaining constituent actions.
in the case at bar,it is uncontroverted that the district court dismissed the state taxing authorities appeals of the february,confirmation order and the february,supplemental order,the first supplemental order.this court is as mystified as the parties as to why the district court determined that these first two appeals were moot,but this determination is not before this court.the state taxing authorities did not appeal to this court the district court dismissal of its first two appeals.while it is true that,pursuant to our holding in ringwald,the state taxing authorities could not have immediately appealed the remand order in which these dismissals were announced absent a rule b certification by the district court the state taxing authorities subsequent appeal of the district court may,judgment did not purport to appeal the portion of the june,remand order dismissing the appeals of the confirmatio
