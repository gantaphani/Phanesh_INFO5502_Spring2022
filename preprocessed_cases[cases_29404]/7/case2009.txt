this appeal arises from the bankruptcy court dismissal of donald hoffend complaint,in which hoffend sought to have a claim arising from alleged securities law violations deemed nondischargeable under the bankruptcy code fraud exception to discharge,a a.in granting the debtor james villa motion to dismiss,the bankruptcy court held that,because hoffend did not allege that villa committed actual fraud,hoffend failed to state a claim of nondischargeability under a a.the district court affirmed.hoffend appeals and argues that the alleged fraud of villa employees may be imputed to villa under a of the securities exchange act,so as to render hoffend claim nondischargeable by villa.mindful of our obligation to construe strictly exceptions to discharge,we hold that liability under a is insufficient to impute culpability to a debtor so as to render the liability nondischargeable under a a.the dismissal is affirmed.
background 
donald hoffend maintained an investment account,from to,with meyers,a brokerage firm.james villa was the president,sole shareholder,and principal securities executive of a corporation,meyers.villa did not handle hoffend account instead,it was managed,and allegedly fraudulently mismanaged,by two brokers who were meyers employees.hoffend filed an arbitration claim in with the national association of securities dealers,against villa,meyers,and the two brokers who handled hoffend investment account.in the claim,hoffend alleged,inter alia,violations of b and rule of the securities exchange act of.
villa filed chapter bankruptcy in june in september,hoffend filed an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy proceeding,contending that his claim against villa was nondischargeable under the bankruptcy code fraud exception to discharge,a a hoffend did not allege that villa made any fraudulent representations to hoffend instead,hoffend alleged that villa was a controlling person under a of the securities exchange act,a and thus that the alleged fraud of the two meyers brokers could be imputed to villa,so as to render hoffend claim nondischargeable as to villa.based on hoffend failure to allege that villa made any false representations,villa filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the bankruptcy court granted the motion to dismiss,holding that hoffend allegations were insufficient to establish fraud which would preclude villa discharge of the claim in bankruptcy.the district court affirmed,and hoffend has appealed.
standard of review 
our review of a dismissal for failure to state a claim is de novo.see in re johannessen,cir citing hunnings texaco,cir.in conducting our review we must,like the bankruptcy court,accept the allegations of the complaint as true and construe the alleged facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.see hunnings,at.
discussion 
hoffend has never argued villa made no false representation to him at any time.based on hoffend failure to allege a misrepresentation by villa,the bankruptcy court dismissed hoffend complaint for failure to allege the elements of fraud required under a a.in reaching this decision,the bankruptcy court relied on the four elements set forth in schweig hunter in re hunter,cir the debtor made a false representation with the purpose and intention of deceiving the creditor the creditor relied on the representation the creditor reliance was reasonably founded and the creditor sustained a loss as a result of the representation.id.at.in the instant case,it is undisputed that villa made no false representation to hoffend it is undisputed that villa committed no fraud which would render hoffend claim nondischargeable under a a.
our analysis does not end,however,with the foregoing conclusion.hoffend argues that,while villa committed no fraud,the alleged fraud of the meyers employees,for which villa may be liable as a controlling person under a of the securities exchange act,should be imputed to villa so as to render hoffend claim nondischargeable as to villa.villa relies upon in re hunter.the issue there was whether a debtor failure to volunteer information about his financial condition to a prospective lender could render the debt nondischargeable in bankruptcy after the debtor defaulted on the loan.see id.at.relying in part on the supreme court decision in neal clark,this court held that,for a debt to fall within the exception to dischargeability,the debtor must have committed positive,actual fraud.see in re hunter,at citing neal,at.we concluded that the debtor failure to disclose unsolicited details regarding his financial condition did not satisfy the positive fraud requirement of a a.see id.at.while in re hunter addressed the conduct that constitutes fraud under a a,it did not address the circumstances under which fraud,once established,may be imputed to a debtor to preclude a discharge in bankruptcy thus,the holding of in re hunter is not dispositive of this case.
hoffend relies upon strang bradner.there,the supreme court addressed the issue of whether two bankrupt debtors,who were vicariously liable under agency law for a debt incurred through the fraud of their,were precluded from discharging that debt in bankruptcy.see id.at.at.strang distinguished the holding of neal,where the court had interpreted fraud to mean actual or positive fraud rather than implied fraud.see strang,at.at citing neal,at.strang held that neal positive fraud requirement was satisfied by the fraud of the debtors.the question before the court in strang was whether the debtors,who had been unaware of their fraud,could nonetheless be precluded from discharging the debt in bankruptcy.see strang,at.at.the court held that the fraud,imputed to the debtors,precluded their discharge of the debt.see id.at.at.hoffend argues that the holding of strang should extend to preclude villa discharge of a claim based on his employees fraud,for which villa may be responsible under a.
thus,under neal and strang and their progeny,a debt may be excepted from discharge when the debtor personally commits actual,positive fraud,and also when such actual fraud is imputed to the debtor under agency principles.different inquiries arise under each of these ways to render a debt nondischargeable.under the first inquiry,the issue is whether the debtor conduct amounted to actual fraud under a a.see neal,at.stating that the bankruptcy code fraud exception to discharge requires proof of actual fraud rather than constructive or implied fraud which may exist without the imputation of bad faith or immorality.under the second inquiry,which arises when actual fraud has been committed by someone other than the debtor,the issue is whether the debtor may be held liable for the other fraud so as to render the resulting debt nondischargeable by the debtor.see strang,at.at stating that,after the court had determined that the debtors committed actual fraud,the other question to be determined was whether the actual fraud should be imputed to the partners who were without knowledge of the fraud so as to render their debt nondischargeable also.
the instant appeal focuses on the second inquiry.hoffend argues that the holding of strang,imputing actual fraud to an innocent partner under the doctrine of respondeat superior so as to render the innocent partner debt nondischargeable,should be extended to the instant situation in which hoffend has alleged that villa is liable for the actual fraud of the of meyers,not under agency principles,but as a controlling person under a we are not convinced that the reach of strang extends so far as to render villa a liability nondischargeable under a a.
in reaching this conclusion,we are mindful of our obligation to construe strictly exceptions to discharge in order to give effect to the fresh start policy of bankruptcy code.see in re walker,cir.thus,we are bound to a narrow reading of strang.strang imputed liability for fraud in bankruptcy based on the common law of partnership and agency.see strang,at.at.in the instant case,there is no suggestion that villa and the meyers were partners,so partnership law,as applied in strang,is inapplicable in this case.while it may be argued that the holding of strang was founded on
