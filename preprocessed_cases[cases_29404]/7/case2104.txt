anthony choy,the plaintiff below choy,appeals from judgment on the pleadings and the resulting dismissal with prejudice of his complaint against the defendants redland insurance company redland,acceptance insurance company aic collectively,insurer defendants,zinder,blackburn,park,clements keenan,mercer zinder,kevin park and zinder,blackburn park attorney defendants.the trial court granted the motion of the insurer and attorney defendants on the ground of a lack of jurisdiction to proceed because the trial court held that choy complaint arose from and was based upon matters that were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal bankruptcy court.
after a review of the record and the relevant statutory and case law,we have concluded that the trial court ruling was correct.we will therefore affirm.
factual and procedural background 
on january,choy filed this action against the insurer and attorney defendants.he alleged two causes of action intentional infliction of emotional distress and abuse of process.in support of those claims he alleged the following facts.
on november,choy was severely injured in a motor vehicle accident.prior to the accident,shamrock tires,shamrock had sold to choy a lift kit to modify and install lifters on his pickup truck.in the litigation choy filed following his accident he alleged that the lifters were defective and caused the chassis of his pickup truck to separate from the cab when the truck was pushed into the center divider of the freeway by a big rig.
during choy prosecution of the underlying action against the several defendants,all of whom took the position that the accident was due entirely to choy own negligence,there were a number of settlements.the manufacturer of the lift kit accepted a policy limits offer to settle and paid million similarly,the distributor paid million.choy alleges,however,that such settlements covered only a portion of his total damages for example,his economic damages alone totaled million.choy also asserts that a neutral and disinterested judge had placed a value of million to million on his case.
shamrock,whom choy claims was highly culpable because it had sold him the lift kit with bolts that were of the wrong size,refused to accept a policy limits settlement offer.shamrock carried liability insurance with redland on june,choy made a written demand to settle his claims against shamrock for the policy limits of the redland policy.this settlement was rejected by redland.the attorney defendants had been retained by redland to provide a defense for shamrock and one of them,kevin park park,communicated redland rejection of the offer to choy counsel.thereafter,choy made a second settlement offer under which choy would give shamrock which was apparently insolvent a covenant not to execute on any judgment that might be obtained in the underlying action in exchange for shamrock assignment to choy of its rights against redland choy also offered his commitment to cooperate with shamrock to preserve shamrock own first party claims against redland for emotional distress and punitive damages.this offer was likewise rejected.park delivered redland rejection to choy counsel without,according to choy allegations,ever communicating the offer to shamrock.
choy alleges that redland was guilty of bad faith when it refused these settlement offers because shamrock liability was clear,the damages to choy were catastrophic,and the settlements paid by other defendants,although frequently encompassing policy limits,did not come close to fully compensating choy for his injuries.a prudent insurer with knowledge of the facts known to redland would have immediately tendered the policy limits to settle this claim and protect its insured from potentially catastrophic exposure far in excess of the policy limits should the case against shamrock proceed to trial.however,redland unreasonably and in bad faith rejected choy offer to settle his claims for the policy limits,leaving shamrock exposed to catastrophic exposure far in excess of the redland policy limits at trial.in addition,choy alleges that park violated his professional responsibilities to shamrock by the failure to communicate the offers to shamrock and his representation of redland interests over those of shamrock which,by virtue of the terms of the second offer,had a serious conflict of interest with redland.
while the underlying action was still pending against shamrock as the sole remaining defendant,and prior to the trial thereof,shamrock filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy under chapter choy alleges that such bankruptcy filing served no rational or legitimate purpose,since the individual owners of shamrock had contemporaneously filed personal voluntary petitions and,in due course,had received a discharge.the real purpose of such filing,according to choy complaint,was to frustrate his ability to seek and obtain a judgment against shamrock in excess of the limit of the redland policy.the bankruptcy filing,choy alleges,was done on the initiative of redland,which paid all of the necessary filing fees,so that redland could avoid liability for its bad faith conduct in rejecting choy earlier offers to settle 
choy alleges that he had a reasonable expectation of a judgment well in excess of redland policy limits,and that redland action in instigating an otherwise pointless bankruptcy petition on behalf of an insolvent corporation constituted a misuse of the bankruptcy process.in the words of choy complaint,shamrock bankruptcy petition was filed not to protect or to benefit shamrock,but rather to protect redland from incurring liability exceeding its policy limits as a result of choy claims against shamrock 
based on these allegations,choy pled causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress and abuse of process,and sought substantial compensatory and punitive damages.following discovery and multiple law and motion proceedings on august,the insurer and attorney defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings.one of the issues raised in support of the motion was that both of the claims asserted by choy in his complaint depended upon a determination that shamrock bankruptcy petition had been filed in bad faith and such a determination was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal bankruptcy court.as a result,the defendants urged,the trial court had no jurisdiction to proceed and the complaint should be dismissed.
after soliciting and receiving extensive and specific briefing on this issue,on october,the trial court heard oral argument and ruled in favor of the defendants,granting their motion.thereafter,a judgment of dismissal was entered on november.choy has prosecuted this timely appeal.
contentions of the parties 
choy,while recognizing the settled principle of law that a bankruptcy court has exclusive jurisdiction over claims for abuse of process which are asserted by or against a debtor in bankruptcy,argues that such rule has no application in a case,such as this one,where the claim is not asserted against the debtor,but rather against the debtor insurer and attorneys.the insurer and attorney defendants argue that such a distinction is one without a difference,given the state of bankruptcy law.
we agree with this latter argument,as did the trial court.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a judgment on the pleadings,such as the one before us,essentially the same way we would review the granting of a general demurrer without leave to amend.we test the sufficiency of the allegations of a plaintiff complaint to state a viable cause of action.pang beverly hospital,th,d.we assume the truth of all of the factual allegations but not the contentions and give them a liberal construction.gerawan farming,lyons cal th,d.this requires resolution of a mixed question of law and fact that is predominantly one of law,that is,whether the factual allegations of the plaintiff complaint are sufficient to constitute a cause of action.ibid.the resolution of a question of this sort calls for an examination de novo.ibid.the threshold and dispositive issues before us of jurisdiction and federal preemption also necessarily call for independent de novo review as issues of law.
federal preemption of bankruptcy remedies 
the viability of choy claims,from the perspective of the jurisdictional issue,depends upon his right to litigate,in state court,the question of shamrock alleged bad faith bankruptcy petition.the defendants argue that choy must fail because such a claim may not be litigated in state court due to federal preemption.federal preemption of state law can occur in three circumstances express preemption where congress explicitly preempts state law implied preemption where congress has occupied the entire field field preemption and implied preemption where there is actual conflict between federal and state law conflict preemption.citations.gracia volvo europa truck,cir,see also english general electric,d.
the doctrine,which has its roots in the supremacy clause,art.vi,cl,requires us to examine congressional intent.preemption may be either express or implied,and is compelled whether congress command is explicitly stated in the statute language or implicitly contained in its structure and purpose.citation.absent explicit language,congress intent to supersede state law altogether may be inferred because t he scheme of federal regulation may be so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,because the act of congress may touch a field in which the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject,or because the object sought to be obtained by the federal law and the character of the obligations imposed by it may reveal the same purpose.citation.fidelity federal sav.loan de la cuesta,d.
in msr exploration,meridian oil,cir msr exploration,the circuit court affirmed the district court determination that a bankruptcy debtor action for malicious prosecution against a creditor who had allegedly maliciously pursued claims against debtor in bankruptcy,was preempted by the bankruptcy code et in support of that conclusion,the court noted that the detailed and comprehensive nature of the bankruptcy code demonstrates congress intent to create a whole system under federal control which is designed to bring together and adjust all of the rights and duties of creditors and embarrassed debtors alike.while it is true that bankruptcy law makes reference to state law at many points,the adjustment of rights and duties within the bankruptcy process itself is uniquely and exclusively federal.it is very unlikely that congress intended to permit the superimposition of state remedies on the many activities that might be undertaken in the management of the bankruptcy process.debtors petitions,creditors claims,disputes over reorganization plans,disputes over discharge,and innumerable other proceedings,would all lend themselves to claims of malicious prosecution.those possibilities might gravely affect the already complicated processes of the bankruptcy court.citations.of course,the opportunities for asserting malicious prosecution claims would only be limited by the fertility of the pleader mind and by the laws of the state in which the proceeding took place.in short,the highly complex laws needed to constitute the bankruptcy courts and regulate the rights of debtors and creditors also underscore the need to jealously guard the bankruptcy process from even slight incursions and disruptions brought about by state malicious prosecution actions.to put it another way,the problem here is not only one of state courts deciding issues of federal law in one manner or another.that is not an entirely unique situation,even when uniformity is required.citation.the difficulty here goes much deeper.it is a question of state courts,in effect,interfering with the whole complex,reticulated bankruptcy process itself.id.at fn.omitted italics added.
as we now discuss,these principles are dispositive of choy attempt in this case to prosecute this action that seeks redress in a state court for an alleged bad faith filing of a voluntary bankruptcy petition.
choy action based on alleged bad faith filing of bankruptcy petition is preempted by federal law 
in gonzales parks cir gonzales,chapter debtors sought relief in the bankruptcy court from a creditor state court action that had alleged that the debtors bankruptcy petition constituted an abuse of process.the creditor had sought to foreclose on a deed of trust on the debtors home,but the trustee sale was halted upon the debtors filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy.the creditor filed a tort action in state court against both the debtors and their attorney,alleging that the filing of the petition was an abuse of the bankruptcy laws and process.the debtors did not appear and a default judgment was awarded against them.they sought relief from the judgment in the bankruptcy court where a summary judgment in their favor was granted declaring the state court default judgment void at its inception as violative of the automatic stay provision of the bankruptcy act,a.
the circuit court affirmed the ruling of the bankruptcy court,but on a different ground.in language that is relevant to the arguments asserted by choy in this matter,the court stated,state courts are not authorized to determine whether a person claim for relief under a federal law,in a federal court,and within that court exclusive jurisdiction,is an appropriate one.such an exercise of authority would be inconsistent with and subvert the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts by allowing state courts to create their own standards as to when persons may properly seek relief in cases congress has specifically precluded those courts from adjudicating.citation.the ability collaterally to attack bankruptcy petitions in the state courts would also threaten the uniformity of federal bankruptcy law,a uniformity required by the constitution.const.art.i,cl.that congress grant to the federal courts of exclusive jurisdiction over bankruptcy petitions precludes collateral attacks on such petitions in state courts is supported by the fact that remedies have been made available in the federal courts to creditors who believe that a filing is frivolous.debtors filing bankruptcy petitions are subject to a requirement of good faith,citation,and violations of that requirement can result in the imposition of sanctions citations.congress authorization of certain sanctions for the filing of frivolous bankruptcy petitions should be read as an implicit rejection of other penalties,including the kind of substantial damage awards that might be available in state court tort suits.even the mere possibility of being sued in tort in state court could in some instances deter persons from exercising their rights in bankruptcy.in any event,it is for congress and the federal courts,not the state courts,to decide what incentives and penalties are appropriate for use in connection with the bankruptcy process and when those incentives or penalties shall be utilized.gonzales,supra,at italics added.
the reasoning of gonzales has been followed by several california appellate decisions.in pauletto reliance ins.th,d,the defendant insurers filed proceedings in the bankruptcy court to contest the dischargeability of a debt owed to the insurers by the bankruptcy debtor on the ground that money had been obtained from them fraudulently.after the bankruptcy court had ruled in the debtor favor and rejected the insurers objections to dischargeability,the debtor filed an action for malicious prosecution in state court.the trial court sustained the defendant insurers general demurrer without leave to amend.relying on gonzales,as well as its own earlier decision in gene smith terry tractor,d,the court concluded that the debtor malicious prosecution claim was implicitly preempted by federal bankruptcy law under principles of both field and conflict preemption.
in gene smith,a debtor had sued a creditor for the malicious prosecution of an involuntary bankruptcy petition against the debtor.the gene smith court noted that section i permits the bankruptcy court on dismissal of a petition to award a debtor costs,r
