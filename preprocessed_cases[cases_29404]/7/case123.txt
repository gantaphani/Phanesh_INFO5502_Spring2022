defendant susan jackson appeals from the bankruptcy court judgment setting aside certain property transfers made to her from stanley jackson,debtor and husband of the defendant,as constructively fraudulent pursuant to the new hampshire uniform fraudulent transfer act.ann.victor dahar,chapter trustee,commenced these adversary proceedings against the debtor,the defendant,and their son,stanley jackson,in.the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment for dahar on his claim against the son,voiding a transfer to him of.after a trial on the trustee claims against the debtor and the defendant,the bankruptcy court concluded that certain transfers of property by the debtor to the defendant were constructively fraudulent,and entered a judgment of in favor of dahar.the defendant appealed to the district court,which affirmed the decision of the bankruptcy court.we also affirm.
we summarize the facts as follows.at the time of the trial in,the debtor had been in the business of buying and selling real estate for approximately years.on or about august,he executed a term note in the amount of.the note was subsequently assigned to citizens bank.the debtor made a payment on the note but then did not make further payments because,he contended,the bank had not fulfilled its responsibilities in connection with the note.over the next few years,the debtor and the bank fought over the amount owed on the note but no collection proceedings were commenced by citizens bank.
on june,the debtor transferred numerous parcels of real property subject parcels to the defendant for no consideration testifying that they made the transfer for estate planning purposes,the debtor and the defendant explained that their estate planning attorney had advised them to equalize their estates and create two trusts,swj trust i and swj trust ii,to hold their assets and to obtain the maximum benefit of the federal estate tax marital deduction.in the twelve months following the transfer,the defendant sold almost all of the subject parcels.the proceeds were used to pay the debtor business and living expenses.the debtor made no payments to his largest creditor,citizens bank,during this time period.
on december,al ho,llc acquired citizens bank note and demanded that the debtor satisfy the balance due.no payments were made and al ho foreclosed on the mortgaged properties securing the debtor obligation.the foreclosure sale covered only some of the balance owed,leaving a deficiency of,which al ho demanded from the debtor on may.after state court proceedings on the validity of the note,the debtor and al ho stipulated to an order of judgment in the amount of.the stipulated order barred the debtor from transferring any property or assets from may,until july.a few days before the stipulated order was signed,the debtor transferred to the defendant,for consideration,two mortgage receivables.he transferred his remaining mortgage receivables to the defendant,for consideration,on july.the debtor then filed his bankruptcy petition on october.
on september,dahar initiated an adversary proceeding against the jacksons,alleging that the debtor transfers of the subject parcels and certain mortgage receivables to the defendant were fraudulent.although rejecting a claim of actual fraud,the bankruptcy court concluded that the transfers of the subject parcels were constructively fraudulent under new hampshire law the bankruptcy court found that the value of the subject parcels fraudulently transferred was but awarded dahar a judgment of,which reflected an equitable deduction of the amount of proceeds utilized to pay business debts of jackson and the ordinary and necessary living expenses of his family or.the district court affirmed on appeal.
dahar brought his complaint under section b of the bankruptcy code,which allows the avoidance of any transfer of an interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law.applicable law includes various state fraudulent conveyance statutes,many based on the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta.see fcc nextwave personal commc ns,in re nextwave personal commc ns,cir quoting b.the applicable law in this case,the new hampshire ufta,provides in pertinent part 
a transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor,whether the creditor claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred,if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation 
a with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor of the debtor or 
b without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation,and the debtor 
was engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction or 
intended to incur,or believed or reasonably should have believed that he would incur,debts beyond his ability to pay as they became due.
ann.i.the bankruptcy court found that the transfer here met the elements of i b.specifically,the bankruptcy court found that the debtor did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the subject parcels,and that the debtor was engaged in a business for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business.ann.i b 
the defendant does not contest the bankruptcy court first the debtor did not receive reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the subject parcels he transferred to the defendant.however,the defendant raises several arguments challenging the bankruptcy court second finding that the debtor was engaged in a business for which his remaining assets were unreasonably small in relation to the business.the defendant also argues that the bankruptcy court applied the wrong standard of proof for establishing constructive fraud under.ann.i b.in addition,the defendant argues that the bankruptcy court erred in limiting the equitable adjustment it applied to the judgment.
we address these arguments in turn,beginning with the burden issue.we review the bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.see davis cox in re cox,cir.although the district court has reviewed the bankruptcy court decision in this case,we exhibit no particular deference to the conclusions of the district court.brandt repco printers lithographics,in re healthco int l,cir.
standard of proof for establishing constructive fraud pursuant to.ann.i b 
ann.i b is silent on the issue of the standard of proof to be applied to constructive fraud claims,and the new hampshire supreme court has not yet addressed this issue.in the absence of controlling state law,a federal court should choose the rule that it believes the state highest court is likely to adopt in the future.amherst sportswear mcmanus,cir.the bankruptcy court held that the plaintiff had the burden of establishing constructive fraud by a preponderance of the evidence.the defendant argues that the clear and convincing evidence standard,not the preponderance of the evidence standard,should apply to constructive fraud claims.
in the context of claims involving actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud creditors,the new hampshire supreme court held that the plaintiff has the burden of proving by clear,convincing and direct evidence the existence of a fraudulent intent.chagnon lumber demulder.as the bankruptcy court aptly noted,however,this is not a case involving actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor.this is a case involving constructive fraud.constructive fraud is generally defined as an unintentional deception or misrepresentation that causes injury to another.black law dictionary ed emphasis added.under the constructive fraud provision in the new hampshire ufta,the court is required to assess objective factors,not actual intent.see.ann.i b stating that a transfer is fraudulent if the debtor did not receive a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer and the debtor w as engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction emphasis added.this distinction is important because the stigma that attaches to a finding of intentionally fraudulent conduct does not attach to a finding of constructive fraud.the elements of constructive fraud aim at assessing the injury to the creditor,not the intent of the debtor.
while there is no case law interpreting the standard of proof under the new hampshire ufta constructive fraud provision,we note that bankruptcy courts have applied the preponderance of the evidence standard to a similar constructive fraud provision in the bankruptcy code,a see glinka bank of in re kelton motors,armstrong ketterling in re anchorage marina,zimmerman saviello in re metro shippers,talbot warner in re warner.as one court explained,the preponderance of the evidence standard is appropriate for demonstrating constructive fraud under a because 
the judicially created presumption of fraud under a no longer requires a moving party to prove actual intent to defraud creditors the purpose of enacting a was to remove the difficulty of proving fraud and to give effect to the policy of the bankruptcy code and,an action brought under a is civil in nature,it involves no penalty or any other policy consideration that requires a heightened standard of proof.
in re kelton motors,at.
under similar reasoning,the supreme court,in interpreting a different fraud provision in the bankruptcy code,has held that a preponderance of the evidence standard applies.see grogan garner,d assessing standard of proof under a,which provides a fraud exception to discharge.the court noted that,b ecause the standard results in a roughly equal allocation of the risk of error between litigants,we presume that this standard is applicable in civil actions between private litigants unless particularly important individual interests or rights are at stake.id.at.quoting herman maclean huddleston,d.applying that reasoning to the bankruptcy code provision,the court observed that 
it is unlikely that congress,in fashioning the standard of proof that governs the applicability of these provisions,would have favored the interest in giving perpetrators of fraud a fresh start over the interest in protecting victims of fraud.requiring the creditor to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that his claim is not dischargeable reflects a fair balance between these conflicting interests.
this same reasoning holds true for the new hampshire ufta constructive fraud provision.in new hampshire civil cases,the plaintiff generally has the burden of proving his or her case by a preponderance of the evidence.see hancock earnhardt textile mach.a case involving constructive fraud under.ann.i b requires only an inquiry into objective factors.no penalty results from a finding of constructive fraud rather,the debtor is required only to pay a judgment equal to the value of the asset at the time of the transfer.ann.iii.the stigma attached to actual intent cases is not present here.thus,there is no justification for a heightened burden of proof in constructive fraud cases under this provision in new hampshire law we therefore agree with the bankruptcy court reasoning that the new hampshire supreme court would apply the preponderance of the evidence standard to constructive fraud cases.word,bruinsma in re tml,applying a similar analysis in determining that,under the constructive fraud provision in the michigan ufca,the michigan supreme court would apply the preponderance of the evidence standard.
whether the debtor was engaged in a business for which his remaining assets were unreasonably small in relation to the business 
under the new hampshire ufta,dahar had to demonstrate that the debtor w as engaged or was about to engage in a business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction.ann.i b.this requirement in fraudulent transfer law generally calls for a court to examine the ability of the debtor to generate enough cash from operations and sales of assets to pay its debts and remain financially stable after a transfer.pioneer home builders,int l bank of commerce in re pioneer home builders,quoting yoder leasing,in re suburban motor freight,internal quotation marks omitted see also vadnais lumber supply,byrne in re vadnais lumber supply,holding that,under the parallel unreasonably small capital provision in,courts must assess the ability of the debtor to generate enough cash from operations or asset sales to pay its debts and still sustain itself after a transfer.this requirement in fraudulent transfer law does not require a finding of insolvency it instead encompasses difficulties which are short of insolvency in any sense but are likely to lead to insolvency at some time in the future.in re vadnais lumber supply,at see also moody sec.pac.business credit,cir u nreasonably small capital denotes a financial condition short of equitable insolvency.
the defendant argues that the bankruptcy court committed several errors in its approach and its findings under this provision of the new hampshire ufta.we consider and reject the defendant arguments.
whether the bankruptcy court failed to consider personal assets in evaluating the debtor remaining assets 
the defendant argues that the bankruptcy court erred by interpreting the term remaining assets in.ann.i b to exclude personal assets and thus failed to consider the debtor personal assets when determining the extent of his remaining assets after the transfer.the applicable definition of asset under new hampshire law does not distinguish between personal and business assets.see.ann.if the bankruptcy court had considered the debtor personal assets,the defendant argues,it would have concluded that the debtor business and personal assets were enough to cover the debtor debts and keep him financially stable.
the defendant argument reflects a misunderstanding of the bankruptcy court analysis.the bankruptcy court did not interpret the statute to exclude personal assets.while the bankruptcy court did not calculate the precise value of the debtor personal assets,it did consider the impact of the debtor personal assets on the remaining assets inquiry.specifically,the court acknowledged that the debtor had significant equity in his residence,as well as other assets,but observed that all of the property transferred to the defendant as part of the transfers were business assets and it was from these business assets that the debtor intended to derive income,pay his business debts,and support his family.indeed,the bankruptcy court found that there was no evidence as to how the debtor could pay his business debts and support himself and his family without continuing to engage in the business of selling his real estate inventory.the defendant herself asserted in her trial brief to the bankruptcy court that the uncontroverted evidence is that during this period stanley jackson generated no new income,the jacksons needed to sell property to pay expenses,including living expenses,and that the properties were accumulated by the jacksons to do so.
thus,there was no error in the bankruptcy court analysis of the remaining assets.even considering the debtor personal assets which,the trustee argues,were not easily liquidated,the debtor could not generate enough cash to pay his debts and remain financially stable after the transfer.in re pioneer home builders,at quoting in re suburban motor freight,at internal quotation marks omitted as we discuss in more detail below,this finding is supported by the defendant own assertions at trial and the fact that,after the transfer,payment of the debtor debts and his family personal expenses came from the defendant sale of the properties transferred.
whether the bankruptcy court erred in finding the debtor remaining assets unreasonably small in relation to the business 
the defendant argues that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that the debtor remaining assets were unreasonably small in relation to his business.this argument is premised primarily upon the defendant argument that the court had failed to account for the debto
