factual and procedural history 
in,debtors began operating a large dairy farm in idaho.in,they obtained a loan from bank of the west sanwa bank,united california bank,secured by debtors contractual rights to payment,general intangibles,livestock,and milk products quota.
faulty wiring installed and maintained at the dairy by gietzen electric gietzen caused electrical shocks to the herd,and many of the animals became sick and died.in september,debtors commenced an action in state court against gietzen for the losses caused by the faulty wiring.debtors raised claims of negligence,breach of contract,negligent hiring and supervision,fraud,violations of the state consumer protection act,and breach of warranty.they sought approximately million in damages.
as a result of the electrical shocks to the animals,debtors business suffered,and in october debtors filed for chapter bankruptcy.bank had a million secured credit claim,making it debtors largest secured creditor.in july,debtors filed a motion to determine secured status to clarify what right,if any,bank and kruse another creditor,no longer a party to this action held in the proceeds of debtors pending lawsuit against gietzen.in september,the bankruptcy court issued an order resolving the respective interests in the gietzen settlement secured status order or order.the order held that both bank and kruse had secured interests in any settlement proceeds.debtors timely appealed to the bap.
in december,the bap clerk issued an order raising questions about the finality of the secured status order and thus its immediate appealability.the clerk order stated,the routine jurisdictional screening conducted by the bap suggests that there may be an issue concerning the finality of the order on appeal.in re wiersma,nos,cir,clerk order re finality issue.the bap order gave the parties fourteen days to brief the finality issue.one week later,bank submitted its response,which,according to the bap subsequent summary,contend ed that there might be additional appeals arising from the underlying bankruptcy case in the immediate future.in re wiersma,nos,cir,order re finality issue.debtors did not respond to the order.
on january,the bap issued a second order regarding the finality of the secured status order,directing debtors and kruse to explain why the order was final,why leave to appeal should be granted,and why the appeals should not be stayed pending the confirmation hearing.id.it also stated,failure to timely respond may result in dismissal of their respective for lack of prosecution.id.

discussion 
we review de novo jurisdictional issues in bankruptcy cases.mantz cal.state bd.of equalization in re mantz,cir.
generally,a party to a bankruptcy action must file a notice of appeal within ten days after entry of the order being appealed.fed.a.the timely appeal requirement is jurisdictional.preblich battley,cir.t he failure to timely file a notice of appeal is a jurisdictional defect barring appellate review.lopez long in re long,cir quotations omitted.the purpose of the rule is to enable prompt appellate review,often important to the administration of a case under the code.fed.advisory committee note.
in this case,the order in question is the secured status order of september,in which the bankruptcy court held that the gietzen settlement proceeds belonged to bank debtors timely appealed this order to the bap on september,within ten days of the filing of the order.after debtors twice failed to respond to the bap clerk questions concerning finality,however,the bap dismissed that appeal for failure to prosecute.debtors second appeal of the secured status order was filed on april,six and a half months after the order was filed,well beyond the limit provided by fed.a.
nevertheless,the bap held that it retained jurisdiction for two reasons.first,it concluded that because a court has jurisdiction to correct its own mistakes,it was entitled to correct its mistake with regard to the finality of the order.second,the bap held that the unique circumstances doctrine allowed the untimely appeal to proceed because the bap clerk finality orders had misled debtors into believing the order was interlocutory.for the reasons discussed below,neither of these rationales justifies the bap exercise of jurisdiction over the secured status order.
as a threshold issue,we must determine whether the order was in fact final.if it was interlocutory,as debtors argue,their appeal in april was timely.if,on the other hand,the order was final,the appeal should have been filed within ten days of its issuance.fed.
an order is final if it constitutes a complete adjudication of the issues at bar and clearly evidences the judge intention that it be final.in re slimick,cir.the secured status order met these requirements.the bankruptcy court determination of bank security interest in any proceeds from the gietzen suit resolved every issue relating to the validity and extent of the bank liens.subsequent appeals of the court refusal to confirm a plan and its decision to dismiss the case did not relate to the court analysis of bank ability to attach the gietzen settlement proceeds.regardless of the outcome of the plan confirmation,bank interests were resolved by the order.the record also evidences the judge intent that the secured status order be final where the judge stated,as far as i concerned in these proceedings that a final order.in re wiersma,no,judge telephonic ruling.
furthermore,a bankruptcy order is appealable where it resolves and seriously affects substantive rights and finally determines the discrete issue to which it is addressed.in re frontier properties,cir.in determining the parties respective interests in the proceeds of a major damages action,the secured status order resolved and seriously affected the parties substantive rights and finally determined to whom the proceeds would flow.as the bankruptcy judge observed,if this case were to be dismissed presumably the bank would be entitled to receive the million dollars in cash from the gietzen settlement.in re wiersma,no,j
