w e review for clear error the bankruptcy court factual findings,and we review de novo the bankruptcy court legal conclusions,as well as its conclusions involving mixed questions of law and fact.debold case,cir citing tenant ass bd.louis housing,cir.the bankruptcy court interpretation of b,that it could consider the context of the material presented in a bankruptcy proceeding to determine whether the material is scandalous,is a legal conclusion that we review de novo.in re colsen,cir.however,whether neal creditor list is scandalous within the meaning of b presents a factual question reviewed for clear error.
the appellants posit that the bankruptcy court has broad discretion to determine if material falls under the protection of b and that it is widely accepted that courts can consider the context of material under b.according to the appellants,the bankruptcy court may properly consider context,such as the purpose for which information is sought,the magnitude of harm,the availability of proper access through other means,and the environment in which the material will be released.thus,the appellants claim that the district court erred in determining that the bankruptcy court consideration of context was improper.
further,the appellants contend that the district court erred in concluding that the list of neal creditors was not scandalous within the meaning of b.the appellants assert that the bankruptcy court had ample evidence before it to support its finding that the release of the unnamed creditors names would cause a reasonable person to alter his or her opinion of the attorneys moral character.moreover,because the list of neal creditors does not distinguish between attorneys who acted unethically and those who did not,the list will brand all listed attorney creditors as guilty of wrongdoing,ethical violations,and possible criminal behavior.appellants also point out that attorneys who loaned money to neal and were repaid are not on the list of neal creditors.for those reasons,the appellants contend that the bankruptcy court was correct in determining that neal list of creditors is scandalous within the meaning of b.
