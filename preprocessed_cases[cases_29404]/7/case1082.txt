airadigm communications,is a provider.in,it successfully bid for fifteen personal communications services pcs licenses as part of an fcc auction and opted to pay off the licenses under an installment plan set up by the fcc.for airadigm,however,the airwaves were too turbulent,and by it had filed for bankruptcy.almost immediately,the fcc cancelled airadigm pcs licenses and filed a proof of claim in bankruptcy court for the remaining amounts owed under the installment plan.the ensuing reorganization proceeded under the assumption that the licenses were gone,having been validly cancelled.and although the ultimate reorganization plan set out several contingencies in the event the fcc reinstated the it never provided little else regarding the licenses status after the reorganization.in,the supreme court decided fcc nextwave personal communications,d,and held that the fcc could not cancel a debtor pcs licenses just because it had filed for bankruptcy.the fcc conceded a few months later that it had been wrong to terminate airadigm licenses and reinstated them as though they had never been cancelled.
airadigm filed a second petition in may to tie up the loose ends from the fairly significant legal developments that had come about since its first reorganization.as part of its second filing,airadigm commenced this adversary proceeding against the fcc,seeking to eliminate the fcc continuing interest in the licenses based on the reorganization plan.the bankruptcy court held that the plan had not affected the fcc interests in the licenses and subsequently ratified a second plan with the fcc as a partially secured creditor.both parties fcc objected to its treatment under the plan airadigm objected to the fcc continuing interests in the licenses.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court in all relevant respects,and,for the reasons set out below,so do we.
background 
section j of the communications act of,as amended in,authorizes the fcc to award licenses to use the electromagnetic spectrum through a system of competitive bidding,that is,an auction.j.congress recognized that an auction had several advantages over the available alternatives,such as the development and rapid deployment of new technologies,j a,and the recovery for the public a portion of the value of the public spectrum resource,j c.despite these benefits,a design could concentrate ownership of licenses in the hands of those relatively few businesses that could afford the cost.as a result,the communications act directs the fcc to structure the auction to avoid the excessive concentration of licenses,j b,specifically by consider ing alternative payment schedules,including guaranteed installment payments.j.
against this legislative backdrop,the fcc adopted rules to auction off portions of the spectrum used for personal communications services pcs,that segment used for a number of forms of wireless communication.in re implementation of section j of the communications act.the fcc specified two of the six frequency blocks being c and smaller businesses who,being unable to afford the lump sum,could pay for their licenses in installments.to ensure payment,the fcc made a condition precedent to obtaining a license,g iv,and executed a promissory note and security agreement to secure its interest in each license,id.g.if the successful bidder fell into default,its license would automatically cancel,and it would be subject to debt collection procedures.id.
in,the fcc conducted the auction.airadigm was the highest bidder for fifteen of which were and two of which segments covering michigan,iowa,and agreed to pay off what it had bid in quarterly installments,plus interest,over a period.airadigm paid of the purchase price,signed fifteen promissory notes recognizing its debt to the fcc,and executed fifteen security agreements.the licenses themselves stated that they were conditioned on the full and timely payment of all monies due pursuant to fcc regulations and the terms of the commission installment plan.the fcc then sought to perfect its interests in the licenses by,among other things,filing ucc financing statements with the office of the wisconsin secretary of state.
airadigm soon met financial problems and could not meet its obligations to the fcc.in,it filed a petition for reorganization in the western district of wisconsin.the fcc allowed airadigm to continue using its portion of the spectrum but cancelled airadigm licenses and filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court for million,airadigm remaining balance.in its proof of claim,the fcc stated that,because it had cancelled the licenses,it was an unsecured creditor.hedging a bit,the fcc also said that if it did not actually have the authority to cancel the licenses,its debt was instead secured by the licenses themselves,attaching proof of its security interests to its claim.the fcc otherwise participated in airadigm bankruptcy,filing a notice of appearance and ultimately objecting to its treatment as an unsecured creditor under the plan.
the reorganization proceeded under the assumption that the fcc had properly cancelled the licenses.the plan provided that the fcc had an allowed claim of million and laid out several contingencies should the fcc reinstate the licenses.the reorganization hinged on financing by a third party,telephone and data systems tds.should the fcc reinstate the licenses by february,tds would pay the fcc claim in full.if the fcc did not reinstate the licenses by february,but did so by june,tds had the option of paying off the claim,but was not obligated to do so.but if the fcc never reinstated the licenses or fail ed to act in a timely manner,the plan provided that tds would obtain all of airadigm assets except the licenses.the plan was otherwise silent as to the fcc exact interests in the licenses and what would happen if the fcc reinstated them after june.and the plan did expressly preserve the fcc security interest in the licenses,instead stating that the plan shall not enjoin or in any way purport to limit,restrict,affect or interfere with action initiated by the fcc in the full exercise of its regulatory rights,powers and duties with respect to the licenses.
the fcc never reinstated the licenses and maintained its position that it had validly cancelled them after airadigm bankruptcy.in,the supreme court held otherwise in fcc nextwave personal communications,d.in nearly identical circumstances,the fcc had cancelled nextwave licenses after it had filed for bankruptcy.the court held that this action violated the bankruptcy code and set aside the fcc decision.after its own bankruptcy in,airadigm had filed a petition before the fcc seeking to reinstate its cancelled licenses.on august,the fcc denied this petition as moot,reasoning that,in light of nextwave,its cancellation of the licenses had been ineffective.in re airadigm communications.airadigm thus had its licenses back as though they had never been cancelled.
in light of this development,airadigm filed a second petition for reorganization on may.as part of that reorganization,airadigm filed the present adversary proceeding against the fcc,seeking to divest it of any continuing interests in the licenses.the bankruptcy court granted the fcc motion for summary judgment and rejected airadigm claims.
ultimately,on october,the bankruptcy court approved a second plan of reorganization,to which the fcc raised two general objections.the first went to the payment options under the plan.even though airadigm owed the fcc million,the plan treated the fcc as a secured creditor for only market value for the licenses.as a result,the fcc would have two options with respect to airadigm debt it could take an immediate payout of million and lose its liens in the licenses or it could treat its entire million claim as secured and receive deferred payments totaling this greater amount over a number of years.under the latter option called a b election,the fcc would retain liens for the full million and airadigm would purchase and hold million of securities or annuities.airadigm would use the interest or payments from these instruments to make deferred payments to the fcc over at most a period.when the payments totaled million,the liens would expire.if airadigm sold the licenses before making full payment,the fcc would receive the proceeds of the sale and,if the sale amount was less than million,retain its liens in the licenses.
the fcc argued in the bankruptcy court that this last provision did not square with the code.specifically,the fcc argued that a due on sale provision set out in its that the full auction bill is due if airadigm transfers the licenses to a third party that would not otherwise qualify for installment part of the lien it held in a license.the fcc wanted the full million at the time of a sale to a third party,not the proceeds of the sale plus a continuing lien in the licenses.thus,in the fcc estimate,the plan failure to preserve this provision meant that the fcc had not retain ed its liens as required by the bankruptcy code.the bankruptcy court disagreed,reasoning that provision was not part of the lien itself and was instead contractual and subject to modification in bankruptcy.
the fcc second objection went to a provision that released the financier,tds,from liability for any act or omission arising out of or in connection with the confirmation of this plan except for willful misconduct.airadigm owed tds over million in secured claims,debt that airadigm would somehow have to finance if tds were not involved in the reorganization.in the bankruptcy court estimate,there was adequate proof that tds would not go forward without the limitation on liability ultimately contained in the plan.the court held that the release was reasonable given both tds centrality to the reorganization and the potential for liability should tds engage in willful misconduct.
both parties appealed to the district court,who affirmed the bankruptcy court decisions in relevant respects.notably,for the first time before the district court,the fcc challenged the rate at which the securities or annuities would pay out should the fcc make the b election.the fcc wanted a higher interest rate to move the secured million up to million at a quicker pace,theoretically compensating the fcc for the risk that airadigm would not ultimately pay over the accrued amounts.the district court held that the fcc had waived this claim by not presenting it before the bankruptcy court.in the alternative,the court reasoned that the option complied with the terms of the bankruptcy code and rejected the claim.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
in their respective appeals,the parties raise two issues each.airadigm first argues that the bankruptcy and district courts erred in holding that the fcc security interests in the licenses were not extinguished by the reorganization plan.in addition,airadigm argues that the courts below erred in holding that airadigm could not avoid the fcc interests in the licenses under a,the provision of the bankruptcy code.in its,the fcc challenges its treatment as an undersecured creditor in the reorganization plan.finally,the fcc argues that the reorganization plan provision limiting tds liability to willful misconduct does not comport with the bankruptcy code.the following sections discuss each in turn.
fcc interests in the licenses following the reorganization 
the reorganization proceeded under the assumption that the fcc had validly cancelled airadigm licenses after it declared bankruptcy in,and thus the plan made no mention of the status of the fcc security interests following the reorganization.but the nextwave decision proved this assumption wrong.the provision of the bankruptcy code,a,prohibits the fcc from cancelling pcs licenses just because a has entered bankruptcy.now the parties dispute the effect of the reorganization plan silence in light of nextwave.both the bankruptcy court and the district court held that the silence did not extinguish the fcc continuing involving mixed questions of fact and law that we review de novo.mungo taylor,cir.for the reasons set out below,we affirm.
under some circumstances,a reorganization plan silence regarding a creditor continuing secured interest in the debtor property can result in the elimination of the creditor lien.section c of the bankruptcy code provides that after confirmation of a plan,the property dealt with by the plan is free and clear of all claims and interests of creditors c.as applied to liens and security interests,this means that unless the plan of reorganization,or the order confirming the plan,says that a lien is preserved,it is extinguished by the confirmation.in re penrod,cir.this default rule applies provided that the creditor participated in the reorganization and,as required by c and at issue here,the property was dealt with by the plan.id.in other words,if a secured creditor participates in the debtor bankruptcy and the ultimate plan does not preserve the creditor interest,the interest is gone.
we first articulated this rule in in re penrod.the penrods were a family of hog farmers who had given security interests in their hogs to mutual guaranty corporation in exchange for a loan.the penrods soon filed for bankruptcy,and mutual guaranty then filed a proof of claim.the resulting reorganization plan provided that the penrods would pay back the remainder of the loan in full plus interest.but the plan said nothing about mutual guaranty original liens.when the penrods sold their hogs for slaughter after the reorganization,mutual guaranty sought to enforce its liens in the proceeds of the sale,as it could have done under the original security agreement.this court,applying the rule stated above,held that mutual guaranty security interests in the hogs were gone,replaced by the payment schedule.the absence of an express provision in the plan gave rise to the presumption that mutual guaranty had,in effect,give n up its preexisting liens in exchange for the stream of payments.at.
neither party denies that the fcc participated in the reorganization or that the security interests in the licenses would otherwise constitute interests of creditors under c.but the parties do dispute whether the reorganization plan dealt with the licenses so as to pull them within the ambit of c default rule.airadigm points to the provisions in the plan that set out the various payment options should the fcc ever reinstate the licenses.for example,if the fcc had reinstated the licenses by february,tds would pay the fcc claim in full.or,barring that,if the fcc reinstated the licenses by june,tds had the option of paying the claims,but was not required to do so.these contingencies should suffice,in airadigm view,to show that the plan dealt with the licenses.because the plan did not expressly preserve the fcc continuing interests,penrod applies,and the fcc secured interests in the licenses would be gone,relegating it to the heap of unsecured creditors.the fcc,on the other hand,argues that the bankruptcy court was correct in holding that a plan can not deal with a security interest in a license if everyone erroneously believed that the licenses were validly cancelled.we agree.
the reorganization plan silence regarding the fcc security interests did not extinguish its continuing interests in the licenses.a reorganization modifies the capital structure of a bankrupt enterprise.penrod,at.in reorganizing the bankrupt entity,a secured creditor interests in the debtor property can be dealt with in a variety of ways through modification,impairment,exchange,or even elimination.see,b a i permitting secured creditors to retain the liens b a i ii permitting approval of plan that exchanges the liens for deferred cash payments b a iii permitting exchanging the liens for indubitable equivalent of the value of creditor secured claim d permitting impairment of some interests if of other creditors in class approve.among other things,these powers facilitate the reorganization.see in re regional.systems,cir.a creditor wants to get something for its secured interest,and these provisions allow the creditor to do so,such as an interest in the reorganized business.the debtor also emerges from bankruptcy with property cleansed of all hidden liens,ensuring that future businesses will transact with the reorganized entity without fear that an unanticipated creditor will emerge with a superior interest in purchased property.penrod,at in re regional.systems,at.
penrod recognizes the practical reality that if it appears that a creditor has received some sort of payment or otherwise had its interest in property affected during the reorganization,the parties did not also agree to allow the creditor to keep its lien after the reorganization unless the plan specifically says so.section c and the default rule announced in penrod ensure that a potential creditor can look to a reorganization plan to determine the extent of any other creditor continuing interest in property after the reorganization.penrod,at.if the property is dealt with by the plan,the property is free and clear of all claims and interests of creditors.c.
but for the plan to deal with property for purposes of c,the plan itself must give some indication that it has compensated the creditor for or otherwise impliedly affected its interest.in other words,there must be some evidence that the powers to affect the creditor interest contained in the bankruptcy exchange,extinguish,impair or otherwise impact the in some way been expressly or impliedly.in penrod,the plan clearly dealt with the bank liens in the hogs.mutual guaranty was entitled to a full payment plus interest for the rest of the amount owed by the penrods after the reorganization,and mutual guaranty only participated in the bankruptcy because of its interest in the hogs.the inference was that the payments contained in the plan compensated mutual guaranty for its contingent property right in the hogs and thus extinguished that interest after reorganization.see generally in re regional,at.
not so here.everyone,including the bankruptcy court,the creditor,and the debtor,assumed that the fcc had validly cancelled the licenses.the plan thus only affected or mentioned the licenses to the extent that the fcc would eventually reinstate airadigm interests in the licenses,an event that never came to pass.the plan itself referred to pcs licenses as the reinstated licenses throughout,defining them as those licenses as to which the fcc grants by final order the relief requested by the debtor in the petition for reinstatement.to the extent that the fcc would receive any future payment from airadigm for allowed claims,it would only occur o n the reinstatement payment date,meaning the third business day after the fcc reinstated the licenses.finally,the plan set out contingencies should the fcc reinstate the licenses before june,but made no provision for anything after this date.a potential creditor transacting with airadigm after june could not look to the plan to determine any other creditor potential interests in the licenses because the plan did not purport to affect the licenses in any way if the fcc did not reinstate them before june.as a result,the plan did not deal with the licenses in the event that the fcc did not reinstate them,and this court rule from penrod does not control.
applicability of the strong arm provision to the fcc interests 
airadigm also appeals the lower courts conclusions that the fcc liens could not be avoided under a of the bankruptcy code,a decision regarding a mixed question of law and fact that we review de novo.mungo,at.airadigm,as the,has the rights and powers of a creditor that extends credit to the debtor at the time of the commencement of the case,and that obtains,at such time and with respect to such credit,a judicial lien on the property in question.a.this strong arm power functions much like a foreclosure.if at the time of airadigm filing some hypothetical unsecured creditor could have obtained a judicial lien superior to the interest of the party bringing a secured claim in the bankruptcy proceeding,the estate can avoid the interest.see in re leonard,cir.but unlike a regular foreclosure,the property simply becomes the estate free of the secured lien.here,if some hypothetical creditor could have obtained an interest superior to the fcc at the time of airadigm filing,the fcc will become an unsecured creditor with respect to the licenses.
to resolve the question,we must look to the rules governing the fcc interests in the licenses.for although the strong arm power comes from federal bankruptcy law,the rules governing the perfection of security interests do not.in the example one concerning a private creditor interest in a tractor or some type of law governs.but when the property in question falls outside of state commercial codes by virtue of the federal interest or the nature of the property,federal law provides the rule of decision.grogan garner,d.in such instances,if a federal statute speaks to the issue directly,the court will look no further.see united states kimbell foods,d.barring that,courts can either adopt state law as the rule of decision,see,kimbell foods,at.see also powers postal,cir,or craft a federal rule of common law.see,clearfield trust united states.the issues before us are whether state or federal law governs the perfection of the fcc interests in the licenses and,if the latter,what federal law demands.
airadigm argues on appeal that wisconsin law should govern the perfection of the fcc interests in the licenses.after the auction,the fcc executed fifteen security agreements,and airadigm signed fifteen promissory notes for the amounts owed.initially,the fcc filed financing statements in wisconsin to perfect its interests in the licenses.but financing statements lapse after five years,and the fcc did renew them when the time came in june and july,waiting until june to file a continuation statement.see.stat.due to this lapse,if wisconsin law or more generally the ucc governs,the fcc interests would be thus to this failure to renew.
but neither the ucc nor wisconsin law decides the issue,as federal statutory and regulatory law prevent a hypothetical lien creditor from obtaining a superior interest in an fcc license for purposes of the bankruptcy code.the liens held by the fcc are unlike liens held by the federal government as part of other federal lending programs,where the lien secures the loan by attaching to property that is otherwise defined by state law.see,united states kimbell foods,d.instead,the property a creature of federal law.accordingly,federal law also defines the fcc retained interest in that license.id.at.contrasting federal interest in tax liens with its interest in consensual liens.and as defined by federal law,the fcc does not have to perfect its interest in a spectrum license because federal law prevents another creditor from holding a superior interest.
the licenses created by the communications act,as amended in,maintain the control of the united states over all the invisible spectrum.the licenses give permission for the use of such channels,but not the ownership thereof,and no such license shall be construed to create any right,beyond the terms,conditions,and periods of the license.id.although these licenses provide the right to exclude,they are not freely transferable as no license or any rights thereunder,shall be transferred,assigned,or disposed of in any manner,voluntarily or involuntarily,directly or indirectly,except upon application to the commission.d.even then,the commission will only approve the transfer upon finding that the public interest,convenience,and necessity will be served thereby.id.
the rules governing the auctions themselves also preserve the fcc interests in the licenses.in,congress gave the fcc the authority to grant a license or permit to a qualified applicant through a system of competitive bidding that would recover for the public a portion of the value of the public spectrum resource made available for commercial use.j,j c.in so doing,the commission was required to consider alternative payment schedules and methods of calculation,including guaranteed installment payments.id.at j a.pursuant to this authority,and after a period,see in re implementation of section j of the communications act,the fcc crafted regulations governing the auction and the installment plan.these regulations conditioned a successful bidder use of the licenses upon the full and timely performance of the licensee payment obligations under the installment plan.g.and finally,the very terms of the license s which provided would define any right in that they were conditioned upon the full and timely payment of all monies due pursuant to the regulations and the security agreements.
these statutory and regulatory provisions indicate that federal law precludes a private party from obtaining a superior interest to the fcc.generally,when a forecloses on a lien,the affected property is sold,and the recovers its debt from the proceeds of the sale.in terms of priority,a receives payment prior to any secured creditor whose interest is unperfected.see,a.in other words,the unperfected secured this case,the not get paid anything unless there is money left over after superior creditors recover from the proceeds of the sale.law.
but if the forced sale of the pcs licenses were to occur with the fcc as merely an unperfected secured creditor,the sale would conflict with the statutes and regulations covering the fcc licensing scheme.this conflict gives rise to a negative in this federal law does not allow private creditors to obtain an interest in pcs licenses superior to the fcc.in the first place,a judicially enforced sale would mean that a transfer of the licenses occurred without an application to the commission and upon finding by the commission that the public interest,convenience,and necessity will be served thereby.d see also fcc woko.
in addition,if the were to be paid before the fcc,this would conflict with and g.section provides for the use of licenses subject to the terms,conditions,and periods of the license.and the terms of the license s require that the licensee make full and timely payment of all monies due.the fcc regulations,crafted after congressional authorization and a period,similarly predicate the use of the licenses on the full and timely performance of the licensee payment obligations under the installment plan.g.pursuant to congress command to recover a portion of the value of the public spectrum resource,the fcc made full payment a regulatory condition on the use of the invisible spectrum when implementing the installment plan.subordinating its interests to that of a private would conflict with the fcc statutory and regulatory authority.
as a result,under federal law the rights afforded to a hypothetical lien creditor at the time of airadigm filing could not have been superior to the fcc interests in the licenses.accordingly,the lower courts were correct to conclude that airadigm can not avoid the fcc interests in the licenses under a.we conclude by noting that we do not decide whether a private party can in fact take an interest in the proceeds of pcs licenses this decision is unnecessary because,regardless what interest a can give a creditor in these licenses,it could not be superior to the fcc for purposes of a.
fcc treatment as an undersecured creditor 
in its,the fcc challenges its treatment as an undersecured creditor.airadigm still owes the fcc million for the licenses it purchased.but if the licenses had been sold at the time of airadigm reorganization,the going rate was only million.so the bankruptcy court treated the fcc as an undersecured creditor in the reorganization plan.a.the plan,tracking the bankruptcy code,gave the fcc two options.it could either receive immediate payment for the entirety of its million secured claim and treat the remaining million as unsecured.id.or it could opt to treat the entire allowed million claim as secured and receive a deferred stream of payments from airadigm over a number of years.see b,b,b a i ii.to finance this stream of payments,airadigm would purchase million of securities or annuities and would then use the interest from this principal to pay the fcc over a term of years.in the alternative,airadigm could choose to pay the fcc from the proceeds of the sale of the licenses.should the fcc opt to treat the whole claim as secured,it would retain its liens in the licenses until it receives full payment,at which point the liens would expire.see b a i i see generally collier on bankruptcy ed.
the fcc raises two objections related to the plan provisions should it make the b election.the first need not detain us because it is waived.the fcc argued for the first time in its appeal to the district court that it was entitled to a higher interest rate on the million worth of securities.in short,the fcc claimed that there is a risk that airadigm will abscond with the principal and accrued interest,and it wants the million to accrue at a higher interest rate to compensate for this risk.for this court to entertain the merits of this claim,which are questionable in this context,the fcc must have raised it before the bankruptcy court so as to preserve it for appeal.see in re rimsat,cir.the fcc concedes that it did,so the claim is waived.
the fcc second claim is that the bankruptcy court did not properly preserve the liens securing its claim in the licenses because it did not keep the fcc rights in the plan of reorganization.to approve of a plan over the objection of a secured creditor,the bankruptcy plan must retain the liens securing a secured creditor claims.b a i i.the fcc regulations provide that a licensee who obtained its licenses under the installment plan must pay back the full amount if it seeks to transfer the licenses to an entity that would otherwise qualify for the installment plan.c.because,in the fcc estimation,the plan does not preserve the provision,it does not retain the liens and the plan can not be crammed down over its objection.the district court disagreed with the fcc,a decision involving statutory interpretation that we review de novo.in re till,cir,rev in part on other grounds,d.
the issue before the court is what to make of the fcc regulations for purposes of the bankruptcy code.as the supreme court decision in nextwave makes clear,the fcc participates in a debtor bankruptcy as a creditor subject to the terms of the bankruptcy code,d.unlike most creditors,the fcc is a creature of federal statutory law and a source of regulatory laws.these laws can come into conflict or at least create tension with the bankruptcy code.in the event that the fcc has issued regulations that conflict with the requirements of the bankruptcy code,nextwave commands that the former give way for example,even though fcc regulations state that when a is in default,its license shall automatically cancel,g iv,the bankruptcy code prevents the fcc from cancelling a license solely because such debtor has not paid a debt that is dischargeable in the case under this title.a see also nextwave,at.the bankruptcy code governs due to the rule of legislative supremacy.see,butner united states,d superseded in part by.see also diersen chicago car exchange,cir.
things are somewhat more complicated,however,where the fcc regulations do not conflict with the bankruptcy code,but instead contain substantive obligations with which the bankruptcy court must contend.in this case,the fcc regulations provide that i f a licensee that utilizes installment financing under this section seeks to assign or transfer control of its license to an entity not meeting the eligibility standards for installment payments,the licensee must make full payment of the remaining unpaid principal.c.on the one hand,a bankruptcy court can not nullify the effect of a duly enacted regulation as part of the plan unless the regulation conflicts with the bankruptcy code or otherwise falls within the ambit of the powers conferred upon the court.generally midlantic nat.bank new jersey of environmental protection,d.in providing the debtor with a fresh start,the bankruptcy court could not bolster the reorganization with a prospective freedom from all regulation.see,ohio kovacs,d.conversely,the bankruptcy court has broad powers under the code to modify terms of payment for a claim.nextwave,at.this power obtains with no less sweep when the terms of payment are contained in federal regulations.id.w here congress has intended to provide regulatory exceptions to provisions of the bankruptcy code,it has done so clearly and expressly,rathe
