background 
this case concerns the southeastern retail market for hot rolled coil,a type of thin steel used for items such as highway railings and gas canisters.appellant gulf states reorganization group the group challenges appellees acquisition of steel mill assets in a bankruptcy auction as a violation of the antitrust laws.appellee nucor is the dominant producer of hot rolled coil for the relevant geographic market,the southeast united states.
in,gulf states steel,of alabama gulf states,a competitor of appellee,nucor corporation,filed for bankruptcy under chapter,which was later converted to a chapter bankruptcy.it owned and operated a steel plant in gadsden,alabama.after gulf states ceased operations,the group was formed to purchase certain of its assets in the gadsden mill that could be used to produce hot rolled coil the assets.in,an independent assessor had put the total market value of the assets at approximately million.in may,a bankruptcy auction was held and the assets were unsold because neither the group nor other potential bidders would meet the reserve price of million.
during and,the group entered into private negotiations with the bankruptcy trustee for the purchase of the assets.in,in preparation for these negotiations,the group determined that the assets had a value of at least million.in june,the group offered the trustee million for the assets.the bankruptcy court then issued an order saying that the assets would be sold to the group unless another party made a higher bid,in which case a second bankruptcy auction would be held.
this order came to the attention of appellee casey equipment corporation and appellee nucor corporation.the two companies have a long relationship of buying and selling used steel equipment.they agreed to form a third entity,appellee gadsden industrial park llc park to bid for the assets and to resell them.nucor would fund the bid and casey would manage the sale.nucor would have an unilateral right to reject any sale of the assets to domestic purchasers,but a more limited right with respect to foreign ones.they agreed that the highest bid they would make was million.
on september,park bid for the assets,triggering the auction.the group contacted the federal trade commission about nucor involvement but the commission did not take any action.on september,the bankruptcy auction was held.prior to the auction,the group had received million in additional support from the gadsden development authority and million from jefferson iron metal brokerage,a scrap dealer.park final bid for the assets was million in cash.the group submitted a part cash bid of million,even though it had been advised that a credit bid would not be allowed.
the trustee rejected the group bid but gave it extra time to make a conforming bid.although the group could have made a cash bid of million,it did not do so.thus,park bid of million was accepted by the bankruptcy trustee.after prevailing,appellees resold most of the assets in the asian market for nearly three times the amount of their successful bid.
on october,the group sued appellees in the federal district court for the northern district of alabama,alleging violations of sections and of the sherman act.on september,the district court granted appellees summary judgment on all counts,dismissing the case with prejudice.the group timely filed an appeal and this case is properly before us.
ii.discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.morris communications pga tour,cir.
before the district court,the group alleged that the appellees violated section of the sherman act,prohibiting agreements to restrain trade,and that nucor violated section of the sherman act,prohibiting monopolization.the district court granted the appellees summary judgment for three reasons the group lacked article iii standing because it did not show that the defendants had caused its injury the group lacked antitrust standing because it failed to demonstrate antitrust injury,that is to say injury of the sort that the antitrust laws are meant to redress and the defendants actions could not constitute a violation of the antitrust laws because they increased competition in the bankruptcy auction.we conclude that to the contrary,the group properly demonstrated both causation and antitrust injury and we remand this case to the district court to determine whether the challenged transaction violated the antitrust laws.
a.the group adduced sufficient evidence of causation.
because the constitution limits the subject matter jurisdiction of federal courts to cases and controversies,a plaintiff must demonstrate a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of to have standing in a federal court.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.in the instant case,the group maintains that the injury it suffered was exclusion from the relevant market on account of its failure to purchase the assets.the conduct complained of is appellees arrangement to have nucor fund park bid.the group alleges that nucor enjoys a monopoly in the relevant market and therefore it could not have participated in the auction without violating the antitrust laws.
these assertions state a clear causal connection between the plaintiff injury and the defendants conduct.the bankruptcy court had previously told the group that it could purchase the assets unless a rival bidder offered a higher cash bid at the bankruptcy auction.at auction,the appellees offered a higher cash bid.as there were only two bidders in the auction,it is clear that the group would have purchased the assets but for the appellees participation in the auction.
the district court held otherwise,concluding that the cause was the group decision to submit,not a higher cash bid,but instead a part cash bid.however,the mere fact that the group own decisions played a role in its failure to win at auction does not obviate the causal connection between the defendants conduct and the plaintiff injury.antitrust law does not require that the defendant be the exclusive cause of the plaintiff injury but only a material one.cable holdings of georgia,home video,cir to recover under the antitrust laws,a plaintiff must prove that a defendant illegal conduct materially contributed to his injury.it is true that the group could have prevailed had it submitted a higher cash bid.but the group need to make a higher bid was occasioned only by the participation of nucor.if nucor participation were a violation of the antitrust issue that we do not decide it would be improper to regard the group injury as entirely.
thus,we conclude that the group has satisfied the requirement for standing in federal courts.
b.the group has properly alleged antitrust injury.
in addition to the general standing requirements that apply to all plaintiffs in federal court,plaintiffs challenging violations of the antitrust laws must also show that they have suffered antitrust injury,or injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants acts unlawful.brunswick pueblo,d.that is to say,even assuming that the appellees did violate the antitrust laws,the group must still show that its injury due to those violations was the sort that the antitrust laws were intended to prevent.we conclude that the group has properly alleged antitrust injury.
we begin our antitrust injury inquiry by characterizing the precise violation asserted by the group.we note that while the actual claims in the complaint are violations of sections and of the sherman act,the allegedly anticompetitive conduct on which the group bases its claims is an asset acquisition,thus implicating section of the clayton act section of the clayton act prohibits corporations from asset acquisitions that will lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly.if an acquisition of assets of a competitor in the relevant market by a monopolist or dominant firm might otherwise substantially lessen competition,that acquisition may nonetheless be tolerated under the failing company defense,which allows a dominant firm to purchase assets from a competitor that is about to leave the relevant market,as
