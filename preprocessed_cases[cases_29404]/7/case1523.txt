mortgages was a private lender for certain real estate investments in arizona.mortgages raised money from investors to extend loans to real estate purchasers,secured by the purchased real estate,and acted as servicing agent for the loans and properties.the investors received fractional interests in the real estate that secured the loans and the resulting loan payments.the investors acquired an actual interest in each underlying loan.
on june,mortgages filed for chapter bankruptcy.the company was restructured through a confirmed bankruptcy plan.pursuant to that plan,the entity ml manager llc ml manager,the appellee here,manages and operates the loans left in mortgages portfolio.ml manager took a million loan in exit financing to pay for expenses related to the completed bankruptcy.the bankruptcy plan was confirmed by the bankruptcy court in may.
after confirmation,ml manager sought to sell some of the loans in mortgages portfolio.in response,a group of investors rev op group objected to the sales.rev op group and ml manager then moved,essentially,for judgments to resolve ml manager powers regarding mortgages portfolio.
rev op group moved for partial summary judgment on the ground that because ml manager acted as agent for each investor,it could not sell the properties if any investor,the principal,objected.according to rev op group,if ml manager sought to sell properties over its objection,the investors in rev op group could simply revoke the agency.ml manager responded that it did not have simple agency authority,revocable at will by the principal.instead,it claimed that it held an interest in mortgage underlying loan pool,which gave ml manager an agency coupled with an interest,which is not revocable under arizona law.see phoenix title trust grimes,in banc.
simultaneously,ml manager moved for a declaratory judgment that all investors had executed documents designating ml manager as agent and that those agency documents had been properly transferred to ml manager.rev op group denied that it had executed the agreements.according to rev op group,while its investors had signed subscription and revolving opportunity agreements,the investors had not signed versions of those agreements that included a provision binding all signers to an agency relationship with ml manager.rev op group also argued that even if its members had executed the agreements that included the agency provision,the agreements were not properly assigned to ml manager.
at a hearing on the,the bankruptcy court requested and received supplemental briefs on whether the plausibility standard outlined in the then recent supreme court decisions of bell atlantic twombly,and ashcroft iqbal,governed the denials made by rev op group of the allegations in ml manager complaint.
on july,the bankruptcy court ruled that rev op group denials would only be accepted as true if the denials were plausible.on the same day,the court resolved,on the pleadings alone,both rev op group motion for partial summary judgment and ml manager motion for a declaratory judgment.the bankruptcy court held that rev op group denials were implausible,because rev op group admitted the investors had signed documents with the same name as those that included agency agreements.because the denials were implausible,the bankruptcy court held that the rev op group investors had executed the agency agreement with ml manager.the bankruptcy court also denied rev op group motion for partial summary judgment,ruling that ml manager had an agency coupled with an interest and that ml manager was properly assigned the agency agreements.
thus,after this declaratory judgment,ml manager had irrevocable authority,subject to possible review by the bankruptcy court under a business judgment standard,to sell or liquidate the interests in property of any investors,including objecting investors like the rev op group,foreclose on property of the estate,modify the terms of the outstanding loan properties,and recover costs and expenses from all investors.
armed with this order,ml manager moved to sell two properties in the portfolio.on august,rev op group moved to stay the declaratory judgment.the motion to stay was denied by the bankruptcy court on september,because the bankruptcy court concluded that ml manager needed to liquidate the properties for the benefit of all investors,who would suffer serious harm if the orders were stayed unless rev op group paid a large bond as security.rev op group stated that it could not afford such an expensive bond.rev op group appealed the denial of the motion to stay to the district court,which affirmed the bankruptcy court on october.
in march and november of,ml manager moved to sell two other properties pursuant to the declaratory judgment.the bankruptcy court overruled rev op group objections and approved the property sales.
rev op group appealed from all of these orders to the district court.on january,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order approving one of the property sales,and held that ml manager had an agency coupled with an interest and had properly applied its business judgment.
on february,having previously concluded that ml manager held an agency coupled with an interest,the district court affirmed the rest of the bankruptcy court declaratory judgment.the district court held that rev op group denials that investors had executed the agreements attached to ml manager declaratory judgment complaint were a sham and thus should be disregarded.the district court also affirmed that the agency agreements were properly assigned to ml manager.
on may and july,the district court affirmed the other property sales based upon its prior rulings regarding ml manager irrevocable agency authority,proper assignment,and rev op group sham denials of executing the agency agreements.
rev op group filed timely notices of appeal from each district court order in this opinion,we address only its appeal of the declaratory judgment.we have appellate jurisdiction under u.d.
ml manager moves to dismiss this appeal as equitably moot.although we dismiss rev op group appeals from the sales orders as equitably moot in a concurrently filed memorandum disposition,we must separately examine this appeal to determine whether to dismiss it as equitably moot.in re filtercorp,cir holding that an appeal from a sale order was moot,but the appeal from a related order was not moot in re aov,holding that to determine equitable mootness,a court can not avoid its obligation to scrutinize each individual claim,testing the feasibility of granting the relief against its potential impact on the reorganization scheme as a whole.we analyze whether each appeal is equitably moot separately because awarding relief to the appellant in one appeal may threaten the equitable disposition of the bankruptcy estate,but awarding relief in another may pose no harm to the estate or third parties.
we examine four considerations to determine whether the appeal from the declaratory judgment is equitably moot.
we will look first at whether a stay was sought,for absent that a party has not fully pursued its rights.if a stay was sought and not gained,we then will look to whether substantial consummation of the plan has occurred.next,we will look to the effect a remedy may have on third parties not before the court.finally,we will look at whether the bankruptcy court can fashion effective and equitable relief without completely knocking the props out from under the plan and thereby creating an uncontrollable situation for the bankruptcy court.
in re thorpe insulation,cir.
unlike in rev op group ml manager llc,and in re roberts farms,cir,rev op group sought a stay of the declaratory judgment,but could not obtain it.rev op group thus did not sit on its rights.it diligently pursued this appeal.though rev op group could not obtain a stay from the bankruptcy or district court because of the high cost of the bond necessary to secure the appeal,we are cautious about not giving a party who is diligent as rev op group has been in this case an opportunity to present its appeal.thorpe,at.
we next turn to whether substantial consummation of the plan has occurre
