petitioners oscar maldonado,miguel ibarra,gustavo gomez,and faustino boria brought a petition for writ of mandate seeking to overturn the order of the trial court denying their motions to compel further responses to discovery from real party in interest icg telecom group,icg.we agree with petitioners that icg responses were inadequate,and issue a peremptory writ of mandate directing the respondent court to vacate its order denying petitioners motions to compel further responses and enter a new and different order granting the motions.
factual and procedural background 
petitioners brought suit against their former employer icg,and codefendants holly horchover and patricia haley alleging employment discrimination.petitioners apparently claim that their termination or coerced resignation was tied to a policy of icg known as footprinting which petitioners describe as the racially based segregation of los angeles into regions where sales and services would be provided by icg and where sales and service would not be provided.
petitioners submitted three deposition notices to icg seeking to depose the person or persons most knowledgeable concerning the following subject areas the reasons for terminating petitioners gomez and boria the documents which supported the decision to terminate the identity of persons who participated in the decision icg responses to petitioners interrogatories the area within southern california where icg makes sales or provides services and any and all practices and policies regarding icg sales and service areas.the notices also asked that documents be produced from a number of categories,including personnel files,job descriptions,documents pertaining to petitioners employment or termination which were not in the personnel files,correspondence between icg and the department of fair employment and housing and the equal employment opportunity commission involving petitioners,and documents pertaining to icg sales and service area or footprint.
in the period after petitioners were terminated or resigned,icg underwent a financial reversal and is now in bankruptcy.it was forced to lay off a number of its employees includ ing virtually all of petitioners former supervisors,as well as numerous human resources and management employees.icg designated patricia haley as the person most knowledgeable concerning the employment matters.at the time of the depositions,she was the person in charge of human relations for the western regional states.according to her testimony,however,she had very little actual knowledge about the specific events that led to the terminations or resignations involved in the litigation.nor did she seem to have knowledge about more general matters such as employment policies and the contents of personnel files.for example,she produced what appeared to be gomez personnel file,but was not willing to say for sure that it was,indeed,the personnel file.she did not know whether there were any other employment or documents not included in the file or who in the company might have that information.she did not know anything about gomez various positions with the company or why he was terminated.she heard about his termination after the fact,she did not remember from whom.subsequently,she had a conversation with horchover and ibarra who said gomez was terminated for performance but she had no specific information concerning what was deficient about his performance.she did not know if gomez was out on injury leave when he was terminated or what icg policy was regarding termination of an injured employee.questions were asked about icg interrogatory responses,particularly a response which identified persons with knowledge about the terminations,but haley,who had verified the responses,had no idea what information any of the people listed might have had.
at her deposition as the person most knowledgeable concerning boria employment,haley neglected to bring boria personnel file with her to the deposition or to review it before the deposition.she did not know anything about his employment history,although she had received his letter of resignation she did not know whether it would have been possible to terminate an employee in his position without involving the human resources department.
karen sparrow and robert athey were designated as most knowledgeable concerning the footprint issues.they did not bring any documents to the deposition.counsel for icg stated that there had been difficulty putting documents relevant to the request together due to the bankruptcy,and that icg was still in the process of looking for said documents.the witnesses did not know what the footprint was for los angeles county in and,whether it had substantially changed since then,whether any maps depicting the footprint existed,where any such maps might be found,or whether there was anyone at the company who would know the answers to the questions.they had general knowledge about the factors that went into deciding the limits of the footprint or sales and service as estimated sales volume and the existence of technology were unaware of whether any studies had been conducted to determine or predict whether the factors were favorable or unfavorable in a particular area.
after the depositions had concluded,petitioners brought motions to compel further responses with regard to all three depositions.petitioners sought an order compelling icg to provide further depositions of the person most knowledgeable regarding the various issues and to fully respond to all outstanding requests for documents an order that i n the event the person most knowledgeable fails to provide discovery to any relevant line of inquiry,defendants be precluded from introducing testimony at trial or asserting affirmative defenses as to matters to which they refused to disclosed sic information and attorney fees for the cost of bringing the motions.
at the hearing on the motions to compel,the trial court indicated its belief that the footprint issue was irrelevant,stating that petitioners do need to do an investigation on the footprint and that t he footprint is out.the court told counsel that if at trial your clients petitioners want to get up and say,our sales were lower than other people because we wanted to sell in the hispanic community and we were prohibited from doing so,that their own firsthand knowledge,fine,l et the company respond to that but rejected counsel argument that he needed to conduct discovery on what the company response to such testimony might be.
the court further stated that the defense was wrong in not reproducing for the deposition the documents that they say they had previously produced petitioners had the right to ask the person most knowledgeable to bring in all of the documents that they felt are supportive.nevertheless,the court denied all of the motions with the exception that in any further depositions of the most knowledgeable,the company is to produce all as opposed to footprint related documents for that it has or can find on a reasonable search including those previously produced.
a petition for writ of mandamus was filed on october,seeking a review of the trial court order.by order dated october,this court instructed respondent to show cause why a peremptory writ of mandate should not issue ordering respondent to vacate the order and make a new and different order compelling real party to search diligently for,and to produce at appropriate depositions,all available documents meeting the descriptions in the deposition notices and compelling deponents identified as most knowledgeable by real party to answer questions to the full extent of information known to the deponent or reasonably available to him or her.we stayed trial until this matter could be resolved.
