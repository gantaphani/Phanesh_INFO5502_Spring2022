the plaintiffs appeal from an order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york spatt,dismissing their action asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty,tortious interference,and common law fraud against the law firm gates,llp and two of its former partners.the plaintiffs,unsuccessful bidders in a bankruptcy proceeding,alleged that the defendants used their prior representation of the plaintiffs to undermine the plaintiffs attempt to acquire assets in a bankruptcy sale.the district court granted the defendants motion to dismiss on res judicata grounds,reasoning that the plaintiffs could have raised their claims during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings and that allowing the plaintiffs action to go forward would call into question the integrity of the bankruptcy court final orders.
on appeal,the plaintiffs argue that they could not have brought their claims during the bankruptcy proceedings,and this present action will not disturb the orders of the bankruptcy court.we agree.for the following reasons we reverse the district court decision,vacate the judgment,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
gates,a large international law firm,and its former partners edward fox and eric moser collectively,the defendants,represented brown publishing company,brown media holdings company,and their affiliates collectively,brown publishing in brown publishing chapter bankruptcy.
plaintiff roy brown was the former chief executive officer,as well as a former shareholder,manager,and director of brown publishing.brown and other brown publishing insiders owned and controlled plaintiff brown media corporation brown media and,together with brown,the plaintiffs,which they formed to purchase brown publishing assets in a bankruptcy auction.the plaintiffs action arises out of events that occurred just prior to and during brown publishing bankruptcy proceeding.
because we are reviewing the dismissal of plaintiffs complaint,we draw the following facts from the complaint and present them in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.see carpenters pension tr.fund of louis barclays plc,cir.
before entering bankruptcy,brown publishing was a corporation controlled by roy brown,his brother clancy brown,their parents bud and joyce brown brown publishing former general counsel joel dempsey,and joe ellingham collectively,the managers.at an unspecified time,brown publishing received financing from a company known as windjammer capital windjammer,with an equity option as part of the financing arrangement.
in late,the managers grew concerned that windjammer was on the verge of exercising its option,which might have resulted in the managers losing control of brown publishing.the managers decided to seek legal advice.to that end,dempsey sent a memorandum to and fox requesting legal advice regarding,inter alia,the following a the legal ramifications of a proposed transaction whereby the managers create a new llc and managers roy,dempsey and ellingham acquire the assets of brown publishing through the new llc,a transaction that would take place outside of bankruptcy b what actions to take,if any,with regards to windjammer capital c possible successor liability related to the proposed transaction d what state would be an advantageous one for incorporation of the new llc e the tax consequences to the managers and f other issues pertaining to brown publishing lenders.app x.
in response to the memorandum,and fox provided advice directly to roy and dempsey,advising them that unless brown publishing was brought through a bankruptcy process,successor liability could flow to the shareholders of the new llc.app x.and fox,however,further advised roy and dempsey that,if the transaction took place outside of a bankruptcy,steps could be taken to reduce these concerns.billed the managers for the time devoted to providing these legal services.
by march,brown publishing was on the verge of defaulting on its loan from windjammer,prompting the managers to take a series of actions to protect brown publishing assets.later that month,the managers followed the advice of and entered into an agreement to execute a transaction similar to that contemplated in the memorandum dempsey had provided to.when the transaction did not have the desired result,dempsey again sought the advice of fox,who advised the managers that a sale of brown publishing assets in bankruptcy was the best way to retain control of the company.also advised roy and dempsey that they could purchase brown publishing assets through a sale pursuant to,which authorizes the bankruptcy court to conduct a sale of the bankruptcy debtor assets even outside the ordinary course of business.see generally in re lionel,cir.discussing the circumstances permitting the bankruptcy court to conduct a sale process.the managers rescinded the march transaction and,pursuant to advice,ushered brown publishing into bankruptcy.
in june,notified roy and dempsey that the firm was interested in representing brown publishing in its bankruptcy proceeding,however,did not seek or obtain a waiver or consent from the managers to do so.in july,brown publishing retained as counsel.
in august,and dempsey began preparing a stalking horse asset purchase agreement the apa,which was designed to further the ultimate goal of being able to obtain the assets with the blessing of the bankruptcy court.app x.also allegedly continued to serve as the managers counsel,despite having been retained by brown publishing.app x.in addition to preparing the apa,advised the managers on how to maximize the chances that a bankruptcy court would approve their bid at a bankruptcy sale.also advised the managers with respect to forming brown media the company that would make the stalking horse bid,and assisted the managers in their effort to convince brown publishing lenders to finance the managers purchase.with the help of,the managers obtained a funding commitment through guggenheim partners to support their purchase offer.
shortly before brown publishing filed for bankruptcy,did urge the managers and brown media to obtain new counsel.on fox recommendation,the plaintiffs hired richard levy,fox friend and former partner.by the time levy was hired,however,brown media had been formed and much of the apa had been drafted.
b.the bankruptcy filing 
in april,brown publishing filed for chapter bankruptcy.as part of the bankruptcy court approval of as brown publishing counsel,the firm submitted a disclosure statement which did not reveal prior representation of the managers or the extent of its relationship with members of the pnc bank group,a rival bidder for brown publishing assets.
after the bankruptcy filing,brown publishing received a credit bid from the pnc bank group.that bid,however,was rejected as inferior to the managers stalking horse bid.thus,in may,brown publishing,advised by,executed the apa and sought the bankruptcy court approval of the sale of its assets to the managers through brown media.the bankruptcy court approved the managers bid,and,at the same time,approved procedures for the eventual sale of brown publishing assets should an auction become necessary.
although the managers had retained levy to represent them,continued to treat them like clients,advising roy on how to answer questions at a creditors meeting and gathering with some of the managers to discuss issues relating to the bankruptcy,all without levy present.app x.
c.the foreclosure action and the defendants alleged fraudulent scheme 
crj investments,an affiliate of brown publishing,was owned by roy,dempsey,and roy brother.crj owned the real estate which housed all of brown publishing manufacturing operations and a substantial majority of its profit generating operations.app x.importantly,brown media bid had been deemed superior,in part because,under the apa,brown media agreed to assume brown publishing leases with crj.
crj sole lender was huntington bank,which also happened to be a member of the pnc bank group.as noted above,pnc bank group had submitted a competing offer for brown publishing assets.huntington bank was also a creditor of brown publishing and a sometime client of in june,huntington bank filed a foreclosure action against crj in an ohio state court,a move designed to reduce the value of brown media assumption of the crj leases,thereby undermining the plaintiffs bid for brown publishing assets.
the foreclosure action violated the bankruptcy stay,and dempsey,in his capacity as brown publishing general counsel,directed promptly to file a motion to enforce the automatic stay.through its representation of the plaintiffs,was well aware that the leases owned by crj were a critical component of the managers strategy,and of considerable importance to guggenheim,which was funding the managers bid.app x,however,deliberately delayed filing the stay motion until after the final review of the bids for brown publishing assets so that the pnc bank group would be the successful bidder.in light of these events,declared the pnc bank group bid to be the superior bid,which necessitated an auction of brown publishing assets.
d.the auction 
in july,new york office hosted an auction for brown publishing assets.because brown media financing had fallen through in the wake of the foreclosure action,the pnc bank group was successful in acquiring most of brown publishing assets.following the auction,successfully moved in the huntington bank foreclosure action to enforce the automatic bankruptcy stay.by then,however,it was too late for the plaintiffs to salvage their bid.
ii.procedural background 
alleging the facts set forth above,the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit asserting the following causes of action breach of fiduciary duty based on the defendants a failure to secure a waiver of the conflict of interest presented by their dual representation of the managers and brown publishing,b failure to disclose their relationship with members of the pnc bank group,and c use of confidential information gleaned from representation of the plaintiffs to manipulate the bidding process in favor of the pnc bank group tortious interference with prospective economic advantage based on the defendants interference with the relationship between the managers and brown publishing and common law fraud based on the defendants breach of their duty to disclose potential conflicts of interest.the plaintiffs sought an unspecified amount of damages.in connection with their claim for breach of fiduciary duty,however,the plaintiffs asserted that damages would include a calculation based in part on the value of the assets they were unable to purchase due to the defendants breach of fiduciary duty,and where the plaintiffs would have been financially with respect to the assets had they succeeded in obtaining the assets as contemplated in the apa.app x.
the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint under rule b for failure to state a claim,arguing,inter alia,that the plaintiffs claims were barred by res judicata and,in particular,by the preclusive effect of three final orders of the bankruptcy court the sale procedures order,which approved procedures for the eventual sale of brown publishing assets the sale approval order,which authorized the sale of brown publishing assets,and the confirmation order,which confirmed the third amended joint chapter plan of liquidation of brown publishing and its affiliates the liquidation plan.
the district court granted the defendants motion on res judicata grounds.it noted that the parties disputed only one prong of the res judicata analysis whether the causes of action were the same,and if not,whether the claims asserted by the plaintiffs in this action could have been brought in the prior proceeding.special sp.app x.the court explained that,because none of the three bankruptcy orders cited by the defendants in their motion to dismiss directly or sufficiently addresse d the causes of action asserted in this case,there was no indication that allegedly improper dual representation,the issue which dominate d the entire complaint in this action,was raised at the time of the b ankruptcy o rders.sp.app x.
the court observed,however,that whether the plaintiffs could have asserted their present claim in the bankruptcy court was a closer question.sp.app x.the court determined that the plaintiffs action was a thinly disguised collateral attack on the b ankruptcy o rders.sp.app x internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the court reasoned that the plaintiffs sought to challenge the result of the sale by placing themselves in the same position as if they had been the successful bidders of brown publishing assets,as evidenced by their demand for compensation to restore them to where they would have been financially with respect to these assets had they succeeded at the auction.sp.app x internal quotation marks omitted.in the district court view,obtaining this relief would call into question the integrity of the final bankruptcy orders,a result that would impair,destroy,challenge,or invalidate the enforceability or effectiveness of the original reorganization plan,whether the sale was unwound or not.sp.app x internal quotation marks omitted.the court observed further that the plaintiffs,as unsuccessful bidders who were complaining about fraudulent collusion among the sale participants,had standing to raise the issue of collusion during the auction.sp.app x internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
the court explained that,ultimately,the plaintiffs action was so inextricably linked to the underlying bankruptcy proceeding that the relief sought by the plaintiffs would require the court to effectively overrule the bankruptcy court orders.sp.app x.according to the district court,any policy interest in allowing the plaintiffs to proceed with their action was outweighed by the longstanding policy favoring the finality of sale orders issued by bankruptcy courts.sp.app x.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review de novo a grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b,accepting the complaint factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff favor.carpenters pension tr.fund,at quoting steginsky xcelera,cir.to survive a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter,accepted as true,to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.ashcroft iqbal,quoting bell atl.twombly.a district court application of res judicata is also reviewed de novo.technomarine sa giftports,cir.
the doctrine of res judicata,or claim preclusion,holds that a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties or their privies from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action.monahan dep t of,cir.quoting allen mccurry.to determine whether the doctrine of res judicata bars a subsequent action,we consider whether the prior decision was a final judgment on the merits,the litigants were the same parties,the prior court was of competent jurisdiction,and the causes of action were the same.in re layo,cir.quoting corbett macdonald moving,cir.whether or not the first judgment will have preclusive effect depends in part on whether the same transaction or series of transactions is at issue,whether the same evidence is needed to support both claims,and whether the facts essential to the second were present in the first.monahan,at quoting nlrb united techs,cir.
in the bankruptcy context,we ask as well whether an independent judgment in a separate proceeding would impair,destroy,challenge,or invalidate the enforceability or effectiveness of the reorganization plan.in re layo,at quoting corbett,at see also state bank and tr,cir.also dispositive to a finding of preclusive effect,is whether an independent judgment in a separate proceeding would impair or destroy rights or interests established by the judgment entered in the first action.quoting herendeen champion int l,cir.a party can not avoid the preclusive effect of res judicata by asserting a new theory or a different remedy,at quoting matter of howe,cir.the burden is on the party seeking to invoke res judicata to prove that the doctrine bars the second action.comput.assocs.int l altai,cir.
as below,the plaintiffs focus their argument on whether the causes of action they are advancing against the defendants were addressed in the bankruptcy proceeding and whether,in any event,they could have brought their present claims during the bankruptcy proceedings.for the reasons stated below,we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.
at the outset,as other courts have observed,the standard res judicata analysis can be an awkward fit when applied to bankruptcy proceedings.see,in re piper aircraft,cir.noting that,given the unique nature of bankruptcy proceedings,different res judicata considerations may come into play when the first case is a bankruptcy proceeding see also hsbc bank usa adelphia commc ns,wl,at,aff sub nom.in re adelphia recovery,cir.because a bankruptcy case is fundamentally different from the typical civil action,comparison of a bankruptcy proceeding with another proceeding is not susceptible to the standard res judicata analysis.rather,the court must scrutinize the totality of the circumstances in each action and then determine whether there is identity of causes of action.citing oneida motor freight,united jersey bank,cir.unlike a typical lawsuit,where one party brings an action against another,a bankruptcy proceeding provides a forum for multiple parties debtors,creditors,bidders,to sort out how to allocate,among other things,a debtor assets.in other words,a bankruptcy court foremost concern is maximizing the value of the debtor estate.see in re piper aircraft,at observing that when confirming a debtor chapter plan,a bankruptcy court is primarily determining whether the plan,as presented,meets the literal requirements and policy objectives of the bankruptcy code by maximizing the value of the debtor estate.in the bankruptcy context,therefore,instead of examining whether a subsequent lawsuit asserts claims that could have been included as part of a previous lawsuit,courts have assessed whether a new action seeks to bring claims that could have been raised and litigated within the scope of the bankruptcy proceeding.see,at noting the fact that plaintiffs could have brought their actions during the bankruptcy proceeding was germane to a finding of res judicata,since that doctrine bars not just of those claims which were brought in a prior proceeding,but of any other admissible matter which could have been brought,but was internal quotation marks omitted.we are tasked here with resolving this question.
it is undisputed that the plaintiffs did not inform the bankruptcy court of the defendants alleged conduct prior to the confirmation of the liquidation plan.the issues surrounding the defendants alleged conduct were thus not litigated or explored during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings the district court was,therefore,correct that the issues had not been fully and fairly litigated prior to the bankruptcy orders identified by the defendants as having preclusive effect.
the district court nonetheless identified at least one way in which the plaintiffs could have vindicated their rights against the defendants in bankruptcy court.it posited that the plaintiffs,as unsuccessful bidders,likely would have had standing to assert their claims in similar fashion to the plaintiffs in in re colony hill,cir.sp.app x.in colony hill,a disqualified bidder was denied an opportunity to place a bid at a bankruptcy sale because the next highest bidder had fraudulently colluded with the other sale participants to exclude the disqualified bidder.at.we held that the disqualified bidder had standing to challenge whether the successful bidder was a good faith purchaser because the alleged conduct by the successful bidder,if proven,would call into question the intrinsic fairness of the sale hearing.id.at.we explained that,when collusion occurs between a debtor,creditors and a successful bidder,the unsuccessful bidder may be the only party with an interest in exposing such inequitable conduct.id.
we do not view the gravamen of the complaint here as alleging the type of collusion at issue in colony hill.rather,the plaintiffs focus the vast majority of their allegations on the conduct of,and fox in particular.to be sure,there are isolated allegations that suggested a semblance of collusion.the plaintiffs allege,for example,that huntington bank,a member of the pnc bank group,filed the foreclosure action against crj to ensure that the pnc bank group bid would prevail at the bankruptcy sale.however,although the plaintiffs alleged that was well aware that crj leases were of strategic importance to the managers bid,the plaintiffs did not assert that huntington bank foreclosure action was orchestrated by the defendants or done at their behest.app x.indeed,referencing huntington bank foreclosure action simply provided context for the true target of the plaintiffs claim the defendants allegedly decision to delay filing a motion in the foreclosure action to enforce the bankruptcy stay 
in our view,therefore,the complaint is fairly read to allege misconduct only on the part of the defendants.thus,because the plaintiffs are not alleging collusion among the defendants and the pnc bank group through huntington bank foreclosure action or brown publishing through carlson,it was not incumbent on the plaintiffs to challenge in the bankruptcy court the good faith purchaser status of the pnc bank group or,more generally,the intrinsic fairness of the bankruptcy sale on grounds of collusion.
we acknowledge that,had the plaintiffs alerted the bankruptcy court to defendants conduct during bankruptcy proceedings,the bankruptcy court likely would have considered whether the defendants conflict of interest and other mischief warranted their removal as brown publishing counsel.see,in re congoleum,cir.observing in the bankruptcy context that the obligation to ensure that professional ethics are followed has led courts to rule that counsel has standing to raise and challenge unethical procedures on the part of opposing lawyers,and that r ules governing professional conduct are often viewed as more necessary and applicable in bankruptcy cases than in other contexts.removing the defendants as brown publishing counsel,however,would have addressed only the defendants failure to disclose its conflict of interest to the court,either in its initial disclosure statement or pursuant to an attorney obligations as an officer of the court.the defendants removal would not have provided the plaintiffs a fair forum in which to litigate fully the claims it now brings against them.these claims seek to remedy not simply the fact of a conflict but the defendants effective interference with the plaintiffs attempt to acquire the debtor assets.although consideration of the defendants potential conflict of interest may have prompted the bankruptcy court to examine some of the facts necessary to support the present claims,the factual overlap is limited by the proper framing of each claim.defendants point us to no case in which the fact of an attorney conflict in one action will bar a subsequent action for malpractice or breach of fiduciary duty.thus,even if the plaintiffs objected to,and successfully blocked,the sale of brown publishing assets to the pnc bank group,this would not have been equivalent to asserting the present claims,which,as described above,are not limited to the mere fact of a conflict of interest.see in re piper aircraft,at observing that m erely objecting to the confirmation plan would not have been the equivalent of pursuing the breach of fiduciary duty and breach of agreement claims the plaintiff asserts in state court against the successful plan proponent.here,objecting to the plan would not have provided a complete substitute for the relief sought in the instant action.id.at.
the defendants assert on appeal that bankruptcy courts have arising in jurisdiction over malpractice and similar claims against a debtor retained professionals that occur during a bankruptcy because they are inseparable from the bankruptcy context.br.thus,defendants contend the bankruptcy court could have exercised jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims 
the defendants are referring to the plenary jurisdiction bankruptcy courts enjoy over all cases under t itle and
