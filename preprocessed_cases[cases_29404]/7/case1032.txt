in james redmond defaulted on his home mortgage and filed for chapter bankruptcy protection against his lender pinnacle bank pinnacle,now known as fifth third bank.the bankruptcy court entered an agreed order,pursuant to which redmond made monthly payments and owed a balloon payment for the balance of the mortgage on april.to obtain financing for this balloon payment,redmond requested a payoff letter from pinnacle detailing his debt obligations.redmond disputed the charges in the payoff letter and subsequently failed to secure a loan to cover the payment.he then defaulted for a second time,and pinnacle initiated state foreclosure proceedings.redmond moved to reopen his bankruptcy case in,four years after it had been closed and three weeks before trial in the state foreclosure suit.he contended that the charges pinnacle was seeking in the foreclosure suit were in violation of the bankruptcy court orders and the automatic stay.the bankruptcy court denied the motion,and a year later redmond filed a second motion to reopen along with a motion for sanctions against pinnacle for violating the terms of the bankruptcy plan.these motions,too,were denied.the case shuttled back and forth between the district court and the bankruptcy court,and when the denial of reopening was finally affirmed,redmond appealed to this court.
we affirm.bankruptcy judges are given broad discretion to reopen closed bankruptcy cases,and we see no abuse of discretion here.the bankruptcy judge declined to reopen on multiple appropriate grounds the motion was not timely,the state court was an appropriate forum to litigate redmond potential claims,and his bankruptcy arguments were in any event meritless.further,redmond was not denied a fair hearing the bankruptcy judge gave him ample opportunity to present his claims.
background 
in february james redmond defaulted on his home mortgage,and pinnacle initiated foreclosure proceedings.redmond staved off foreclosure by filing for chapter bankruptcy protection.the bankruptcy judge entered an agreed order,which reduced pinnacle arrearage,stayed foreclosure proceedings,and required redmond to make monthly payments on the mortgage in addition to a final balloon payment on april.
as the april deadline approached,redmond sought to refinance his mortgage to cover the upcoming balloon payment.redmond requested a payoff letter from pinnacle so that he could close on the refinance loan in time to pay the balloon note.pinnacle provided two payoff second containing a higher payoff amount than the first.redmond demanded an explanation of the charges he claims that due to pinnacle failure to explain the difference,he could not refinance his mortgage.redmond then failed to make the balloon payment and defaulted on the mortgage for a second time,after which pinnacle initiated a second foreclosure suit in state court.pinnacle contended,and the bankruptcy judge agreed,that the automatic stay as to pinnacle mortgage lien dissolved when redmond did not make the balloon payment redmond received a bankruptcy discharge in may,and his case was closed in may.
after seven years of litigation,the state foreclosure proceedings were slated for trial on july.on june,three weeks before the trial date and four years after his bankruptcy case had been closed,redmond filed a motion to reopen the bankruptcy proceedings.redmond claimed that pinnacle was seeking through its payoff letters and the foreclosure action to recover fees above what it was owed under the agreed order and the bankruptcy plan.on july,redmond counsel made an appearance to argue the motion,and the bankruptcy judge denied it on the ground that the state court could properly entertain his claims.
meanwhile,pinnacle filed a pleading in the foreclosure proceeding in which it disclosed the specific sums at issue in the payoff letters.this prompted redmond to file a second motion to reopen in a year after the court had denied his first one.this time he included a request for sanctions for alleged violations of the bankruptcy court orders.at a june,hearing,the bankruptcy court denied the motion,finding that redmond dispute with pinnacle over the amount owed under the mortgage did not implicate any bankruptcy order.redmond appealed,and the district court reversed and remanded with instructions to consider whether pinnacle had improperly sought payment of prepetition debts prohibited by the agreed order on remand the bankruptcy court again denied the motion the judge held that the motion was untimely any remaining issues could be resolved in the proceedings and redmond bankruptcy arguments were facially meritless.
redmond again appealed,claiming that the bankruptcy judge had not followed the district court remand instructions this time the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order denying the motion to reopen.redmond appealed,and on the eve of oral argument before this court,he filed an emergency motion to reschedule the argument.we vacated the oral argument and took the case on the briefs.
ii.discussion 
redmond challenges the bankruptcy court denial of his second motion to reopen his closed bankruptcy case.the decision to reopen a bankruptcy case is within the broad discretion of the bankruptcy court.in re bianucci,cir.a bankruptcy court may,for example,reopen a case for the correction of errors,amendments necessitated by unanticipated events that frustrate a plan implementation,and the need to enforce the plan and discharge.in re zurn,cir citations omitted.although we review de novo the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court order denying the motion,the bankruptcy court order itself is entitled to deference the denial of a motion to reopen a closed bankruptcy case is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see in re ingersoll,cir we review a district court decision to affirm the bankruptcy court de novo,which allows us to assess the bankruptcy court judgment anew,employing the same standard of review the district court itself used.citations omitted.a bankruptcy judge may consider a number of nonexclusive factors in determining whether to reopen,including the length of time that the case has been closed whether the debtor would be entitled to relief if the case were reopened and the availability of nonbankruptcy courts,such as state courts,to entertain the claims.see in re antonious.
as a threshold matter,redmond contention that the bankruptcy court did not afford him a full and fair hearing is without basis in law or fact.as a matter of law,there is no question that bankruptcy courts may rule on motions to reopen without a hearing.see in re jones,denying a motion to reopen without a hearing.further,b of the bankruptcy code,which governs the closing and reopening of cases,makes no provision for hearings or other procedures available to debtors.b.even though redmond is not entitled to a hearing as a matter of law,the record is clear that he was given ample opportunity to present his claims.the bankruptcy judge held a hearing before denying each of redmond motions to reopen.after the district judge remand order,the bankruptcy court held another hearing after three continuances before issuing a thorough opinion denying the motion.given this procedural history,redmond argument that he was not given a fair hearing is untenable.he had over four years and three chances to persuade the bankruptcy judge to reopen his he failed.
timeliness 
the passage of time weighs heavily against reopening.the longer a party waits to file a motion to reopen a closed bankruptcy case,the more compelling the reason to reopen must be.in re case,cir citing reid richardson,cir.in assessing whether a motion is timely,courts may consider the lack of diligence of the party seeking to reopen and the prejudice to the nonmoving party caused by the delay.in re frontier.
while the passage of time in itself does not constitute prejudice to the opposing party,a delay may be prejudicial when combined with other factors such as court costs and attorney fees in foreclosure proceedings.bianucci,at.we held in bianucci that a delay that caused the creditor to incur costs in foreclosure proceedings was a sufficient basis to deny reo
