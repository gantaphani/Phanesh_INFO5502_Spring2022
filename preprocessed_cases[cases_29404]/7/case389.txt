robert and bernadine erkins,an idaho couple,appeal from a final judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york rakoff,the judgment entered following a jury trial.the jury found that the erkins breached an oral contract to pay their attorneys,the now defunct and bankrupt law firm of gaston snow g s,on an hourly basis.the jury awarded g s trustee in bankruptcy,alfred bianco,for breach of contract damages.following the jury verdict,the district judge determined that,under the law of idaho,an award of in prejudgment interest was proper.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
in deciding this appeal,we are required to resolve an issue that has divided the federal courts.the issue is whether a bankruptcy court hearing claims that are based upon state law and do not implicate federal policy should apply federal choice of law rules or whether the rule of klaxon stentor electric manufacturing,that federal courts exercising diversity jurisdiction must apply the choice of law rules of the forum state,should be extended.because federal choice of law rules are a type of federal common law,which federal courts have only a narrow power to create,we decide that bankruptcy courts confronting state law claims that do not implicate federal policy concerns should apply the choice of law rules of the forum state.
background 
robert erkins is a businessman who owned one of the largest trout farming companies in the world.he and his wife,bernadine also ran an international seafood conference.
in,the erkins started a new venture raising and marketing oyster mushrooms.they incorporated in the name of bliss valley foods.they solicited idaho secured a loan from idaho first national bank first national.the loan amount was,which the erkins personally guaranteed and pledged a million ranch to secure.
the mushroom operation was unsuccessful bliss valley filed for bankruptcy,and litigation ensued.the erkins were sued by first national and the investors in idaho state court.at first the erkins were represented by an idaho law firm.however,the erkins soon came to believe they needed to bring in a firm with hard hitting litigators.they found such a firm in g s.they knew of g s,a firm with a satellite office in new york city,because g s bankruptcy partner charles vihon represented bliss valley.
the lead litigator for g s in the bliss valley litigation was edwin mccabe.mccabe convinced the erkins that the best defense was a good offense,and therefore that filing a lender liability counterclaim against first national was prudent.the counterclaim alleged first national deliberately sabotaged the mushroom operation and forced bliss valley into insolvency.mccabe managed to convince the investors to drop their suit against the erkins and join in the counterclaim against first national.
the case went to trial and the jury found in favor of the erkins and bliss valley on the lender liability counterclaim.the jury awarded the erkins and bliss valley.after the verdict was returned,the trial court determined that it should award attorney fees to the erkins and bliss valley.in doing so,it concluded that g s had taken the case on an hourly fee basis.
first national appealed.by the time of the appeal,the relationship between the erkins and g s had become acrimonious due to disagreements over billing.thus,the erkins did not retain g s to handle the appeal.first national won a reversal in the idaho supreme court.idaho first national bank bliss valley foods,idaho,issued on denial of rehearing.upon remand,the erkins settled with first national and agreed to pay the bank.
in,an involuntary chapter petition was filed against g s in the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york.in,alfred bianco,plan administrator to the estate of g s,filed an adversary proceeding against the erkins seeking to recover million for legal services allegedly rendered by g s to the erkins.
the erkins had little,if any,connection to new york.although g s had a satellite office in new york,the g s attorneys who represented the erkins were based in boston.nonetheless,the erkins did not challenge the new york bankruptcy court exercise of personal jurisdiction over them.on appeal,the erkins explain that they did not attempt to dismiss the complaint on personal jurisdiction grounds because they interpreted bankruptcy rule to require minimum contacts with the united states as a whole rather than with the forum state,diamond mortgage sugar,cir texas trading milling federal republic of nigeria,cir in re outlet dep t stores.
the erkins counterclaimed against g s and moved to transfer the proceedings to the united states district court for the district of idaho.after a hearing,bankruptcy judge cornelius blackshear denied the transfer motion.thereafter,the proceedings were transferred to the united states district court for the southern district of new york for a jury trial.
at trial,the parties presented sharply different versions of the fee arrangement between g s and the erkins.the trustee claimed that the erkins orally agreed to pay g s customary hourly rate.defendants claimed that g s undertook the representation on a contingency basis.given that the lawsuit against first national did not yield any recovery for the erkins,they argued that they owed g s nothing.
vihon testified on behalf of defendants that g s undertook the representation on a contingency fee basis.however,vihon also testified that g s and the erkins never discussed the terms of the contingency agreement.specifically,vihon testified that they never agreed upon a percentage of the recovery that would go to g although vihon never drafted a written contingency agreement,some of g s internal documents indicate that g s treated its representation of the erkins as taken on a contingency basis.
robert erkins also testified that the case was taken on a contingency basis.however,he was unable to produce any documents demonstrating the terms of the alleged contingency arrangement.erkins initially testified that he and vihon agreed that the percentage was,but later retracted his testimony.erkins ultimately testified that he and vihon never discussed a specific percentage term.
the district court found the lack of a percentage term fatal to defendants theory that they were under no obligation to pay g s because the case was taken on a contingency basis.although courts sometimes may supply a percentage term according to custom,the district court ruled that custom can not provide a missing term when the representation is far removed from the normal type of case in which contingency agreements are used.the district court ruled that g s representation of the erkins was not a typical contingency fee situation because,as robert erkins recognized,a favorable result for the erkins would not have required a monetary recovery against first national.rather,if the erkins merely escaped liability for their guarantee of the loan,that would have been an excellent result.the district judge therefore instructed the jury that the erkins defense of a contingency agreement should not be considered.
in support of the view that g s billed defendants on an hourly basis,bianco pointed to several documents which evidenced an oral agreement to pay hourly fees.first,bianco introduced an agreement executed by the erkins on the eve of the idaho trial.in the document,the erkins agreed to pay a amount above and beyond whatever was owed to g s prior to the execution of the the event the counterclaim against first national yielded a significant monetary recovery.the district court thought this agreement suffered from lack of consideration because mccabe presented the agreement to the erkins as the price of g s continuing representation in response,bianco decided not to seek to have the jury award damages based upon the premium agreement,but continued to rely on the premium agreement as evidence that an oral contract to pay hourly fees had existed prior to the agreement.specifically,a sentence in the premium agreement noted that t he existing fee arrangements provide g s shall render professional services to erkins and shall be paid by the hour and shall be reimbursed for all expenses.second,the fee application submitted to the idaho trial court indicated that the erkins had been billed on an hourly basis.third,the idaho trial court found that this was not a contingent fee case.it was taken on a specific hourly basis and payment of attorneys fees and costs was based upon a favorable outcome of the law suit so far as the counterclaimants were concerned.
defendants argued that the oral contract claim should be dismissed as barred by the statute of limitations.in analyzing this argument,the district court had to decide which state statute of limitations applied.defendants argued that idaho limitations period applied,under which,they argued,the oral contract claim was barred.the trustee argued that new york period applied,in which case the parties agreed the claim was validly pending.
the district judge ruled that new york limitations period applied first,the district judge stated that he would sit as if he were a new york state court judge.the district judge did not analyze the main issue we address a bankruptcy court or as here,a district court which has been transferred a bankruptcy proceeding for trial applies federal choice of law rules or the choice of law rules of the forum state.second,the district judge thought that a new york state court would apply the longer new york limitations period.new york has a borrowing statute,cplr,which mandates the application of new york statute of limitations when the cause of action accrued in favor of a resident of the state.the district court did not identify who was the new york resident for purposes of or g defendants did not bring this problem to the district court attention,but they raise it on appeal.defendants did argue that it was unconstitutional to apply new york statute of limitations to them because they had no connection to new york.the district court rejected this argument.
the jury found in favor of the trustee on the breach of oral contract claim,and also on defendants counterclaim.the jury awarded the trustee.
the parties agreed that idaho law governed the award of interest.the idaho code provides for the award of prejudgment interest on m oney after the same becomes due.idaho code.idaho courts award prejudgment interest only if the damages are liquidated or ascertainable by mere mathematical process.magic valley foods,sun valley potatoes,idaho.the district court found the fees owed to g s were in this category,and awarded plaintiff in interest.
discussion 
choice of law 
in deciding this appeal,we resolve a question left open in in re koreag,controle et revision,cir.there,we suggested,in dicta,that bankruptcy courts should apply the choice of law rules of the forum state unless the case implicates important federal bankruptcy policy.
thus,if koreag suggested the proper rule,the district court was correct in sitting as if it were a new york state court for purposes of determining the applicable statute of limitations.we analyze below whether a new york state court,relying on the borrowing statute,would have applied new york statute of limitations.by contrast,if federal choice of law rules are to be utilized,the borrowing statute would not be considered and there is little doubt that new york statute of limitations would not apply.this is true because federal choice of law rules apply the law of the jurisdiction with the most significant relationship with the action,advani enterprises,underwriters at lloyds,cir pescatore pan american world airways,cir,and new york relationship to the action is insignificant compared to idaho.
the federal courts are divided concerning whether federal choice of law rules or the choice of law rules of the forum state apply.compare,in re merritt dredging,cir utilizing choice of law rules of forum state with in re lindsay,cir utilizing federal choice of law rules and in re smec,articulating policy reasons why federal choice of law rules should apply see generally james markus don quigley,conflict of state rules govern.am.further,our prior cases dealing with other federal statutes that provide a federal forum for claims that hinge upon state law do not provide clear guidance.compare corporacion venezolana de fomento vintero sales,cir applying federal choice of law rules in case arising under edge act with pescatore pan american world airways,cir applying forum choice of law rules in case arising under warsaw convention and brink south african airways,cir same.
our resolution of this question begins with the recognition that federal choice of law rules are a species of federal common law.see trade,petra int l banking,a choice of law rule is no less a rule of state law than any other.the recognition that federal choice of law rules are no different from any other judicially created rule of decision is based upon klaxon,which treated choice of law rules no differently from the arguably more substantive type of federal common law that was prohibited in erie railroad tompkins.see klaxon,at.
once it is recognized that federal choice of law rules are a species of federal common law,the framework the supreme court has established for determining whether the creation of federal common law is appropriate must be utilized.the ability of the federal courts to create federal common law and displace state created rules is severely limited.the supreme court has said that cases in which judicial creation of a special federal rule would be justified are few and restricted.myers fdic,d internal quotation marks omitted.before federal courts create federal common law,a significant conflict between some federal policy or interest and the use of state law must first be specifically shown.atherton fdic,d internal quotation marks alteration omitted.
we find no such federal policy or interest that would be violated,in this case,if the choice of law rules of the forum state were utilized.the ninth circuit has suggested that there is a federal interest in national uniformity which should not be subordinated to the differences in state choice of law rules.in re lindsay,at see also vanston bondholders protective comm.green.frankfurter,concurring stating that interest in uniformity is in treating existing obligations of the debtor alike,regardless of the state in which the bankruptcy court sits.the ninth circuit concern is arguably present here,for the erkins,who have little connection to new york,find themselves subject to new york statute of limitations due to the intricacies of new york borrowing statute.further,applying a federal rule of most significant contacts may prevent forum shopping by debtors.in re smec,at rather than allow debtors in the shadow of bankruptcy to restructure or relocate their business dealings in such a way as to gain the benefit of a certain forum laws,this rule imposes on debtors the laws under which they primarily acted.likewise,creditors and other parties are not subjected to,or given the benefit of,an unjustified quirk of legal procedure that imposes on them laws under which they rarely or never transacted.
we recognize the concerns expressed by these courts,but do not believe they implicate significant enough federal interests to justify the creation of federal common law in this case.while an interest in uniformity can justify the creation of federal common law,see united states kimbell foods,d,klaxon rejected the need for uniformity as a justification for displacing state conflicts rules.klaxon,at.see also zicherman korean air lines,d.regarding the federal interest in avoiding forum shopping,we believe there are only a limited number of cases in which this interest is implicated.here,for example,where the debtor was brought into bankruptcy court through an involuntary petition,it is difficult to argue that any forum shopping occurred.
counterbalancing the policy concerns expressed by those courts that have utilized federal choice of law rules are the policy goals recognized by the fourth circuit in in re merritt dredging,at.the fourth circuit explained 
we believe that in the absence of a compelling federal interest which dictates otherwise,the klaxon rule should prevail where a feder
