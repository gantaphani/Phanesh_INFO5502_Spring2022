on december,chapter debtor,gordon,filed a claim for a federal tax refund in bankruptcy court.while the government acknowledged that sel way was entitled to a refund,it refused to pay on the grounds that owed it money for past tax penalties.the bankruptcy court held that the government was not entitled to set off the tax refund against prior debts because the government claims arose prior to filing of the bankruptcy petition and refund claim arose.the government appealed this decision to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,where it argued that the bankruptcy court did not have jurisdiction over this case,and that it was entitled to a setoff.the district court held that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction and that the government was entitled to a setoff.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the district court decision.
on july,which was in the excavation business,filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code.the appellant plan of liquidation and reorganization was confirmed by the bankruptcy court on july.the plan provided for the liquidation of all of assets,after which it would not continue doing business.the plan did not provide for a discharge of debt.
debts included unpaid unemployment tax futa penalties owed to the irs.under the plan,the government tax penalty claims were treated as class general unsecured claims.as such,these claims were to be paid off after the full payment of the expenses of administration,priority union fringe benefit fund claims,and secured and priority tax claims.
on march,paid its michigan unemployment taxes for and,and thereby became entitled to futa refunds.on august,the bankruptcy court found that was entitled to futa tax refunds for the years and,in the amounts of and,respectively in total.in the meantime,also filed an adversary complaint against the irs to subordinate the government class unsecured tax penalty claims mentioned above.citing the sixth circuit decision in united states noland in re first truck lines,cir,the bankruptcy court granted the motion.the government appealed this decision to the district court.while this appeal was pending,liquidated all of its assets except for the futa tax refund and disbursed the liquidation in a manner consistent with the confirmed plan as amended by the bankruptcy court order allowing to subordinate the government tax penalty claims.
on may,the supreme court issued its opinion in united states noland,d,overruling the sixth circuit disposition.based on the supreme court opinion,the district court remanded this case to the bankruptcy court for further review.after considering noland,the bankruptcy court reversed its prior order granting subordination of the government claims and restored those claims to the status of general unsecured claims.thus,the government once again became entitled to a share of the monies that were distributed to all unsecured claims.however,by this point had already disbursed all of the liquidated assets in reliance on the bankruptcy court initial decision to subordinate certain government claims.consequently,the irs tax penalty claims that had been temporarily subordinated were not paid.also left unpaid were administrative expenses in the form of attorney and accountant fees totaling approximately which were entitled to first priority of distribution under the plan.
once the subordination issue was resolved in favor of the irs,the bankruptcy court proceeded to address claim for its futa tax refund and the government claim that it should be able to setoff this refund against the amount of money that it would have received had it been given a share of the monies distributed to all other unsecured claims.on september,the bankruptcy court found that the government claim arose prior to petition for bankruptcy and that futa tax refund claims arose in after the petition.the bankruptcy court concluded that the since the government claim arose it could not be set off against claim.
the government appealed this decision to the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan.on appeal,the government asserted that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over this case.specifically,it argued that refund claim was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity and that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this matter.in addition,the government argued that the bankruptcy court erred by refusing to grant it a setoff.
on august,the district court held that the bankruptcy court properly exercised jurisdiction over claim.however,it reversed the bankruptcy court decision regarding setoff.the court found that upon confirmation of the appellant plan of liquidation and reorganization,the government claim was converted to a claim.the court reasoned that since futa tax refund claim also arose,the parties claims could be set off against one another.now appeals the district court decision to this court.
ii.jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court 
on appeal,the government argues that the district court erred when it held that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over this case.since the jurisdictional issue is necessarily antecedent to any determination of the merits,we will address it first.in doing so,we review the district court jurisdictional determinations de novo.michigan employment sec.comm wolverine radio in re wolverine radio,cir.
sovereign immunity 
the terms under which the united states waives sovereign immunity against suit in bankruptcy court are specified in a,b,and c 
section a waives the government sovereign immunity with respect to proceedings listed in certain provisions of the bankruptcy code.one of these provisions is,which relates to the determination of tax liabilities.section b states 
a trustee may request a determination of any unpaid liability of the estate for any tax incurred during the administration of the case by submitting a tax return for such tax and a request for such a determination to the governmental unit charged with responsibility for collection or determination of such tax.
b.as noted above,the district court found that since properly brought its refund claim under this section,the government had waived sovereign immunity.
on appeal,the government emphasizes that the language of section states that a trustee acting on behalf of the estate may obtain a tax refund in bankruptcy court.the government concludes that since is not a trustee acting on behalf of the estate,did not establish jurisdiction in the bankruptcy court under.we are not entirely persuaded by this argument.
first,the government argument that section b is restricted to trustees seems inconsistent with the broad language of a,which allows the bankruptcy court to determine 
the amount or legality of any tax,any fine or penalty relating to a tax,or any addition to tax,whether or not previously assessed,whether or not paid,and whether or not contested before and adjudicated by a judicial or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction.
a.in addition,the legislative history indicates that was not intended to restrict the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to claims of trustees over property of the estate.rather,it authorizes the bankruptcy court to rule on the merits of any tax claim involving an unpaid tax,fine,or penalty relating to a tax,or any addition to a tax,of the debtor or the estate.cong.rec.h daily ed,remarks of edwards introducing the house amendments emphasis added,reprinted in.
moreover,at least one circuit has held that is not restricted solely to claims brought by trustees.see irs luongo in re constance luongo,cir.similarly,several other courts have rejected attempts to restrict the use of other bankruptcy provisions to trustees.for example,in fleet bank of massachusetts,tierney,kalis lucas in re patriot illinois,and winston strawn kelly in re churchfield mgmt.inv,bankruptcy courts allowed and assignees to bring actions under,even though these provisions only mention trustees.thus,the legislative history and court precedent strongly suggests that section b is not restricted to trustees and that the government waived sovereign immunity in this case.
furthermore,assuming arguendo that congress abrogation of sovereign immunity in section a does not apply to section b claims brought by,we find that the government waived sovereign immunity pursuant to b.
section b states that 
a governmental unit that has filed a proof of claim in the case is deemed to have waived sovereign immunity with respect to a claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence out of which the claim of such governmental unit arose.
b.accordingly,when the government files a proof of claim against the debtor,the debtor may bring a counterclaim against the government if the property that the debtor claims is the property of the estate and the debtor claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the government claim.id.
in this case,the government filed a proof of claim against as to recover unemployment tax penalties for the years,and.the government acquired an unsecured claim for tax penalties in the amount of.on september,paid its michigan unemployment taxes for the and tax years.this payment decreased federal tax liability for and,and made eligible for a refund for and a refund for.given these facts,the government claim for unpaid taxes constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity with regard to claim for futa taxes if the futa refunds are property of the estate,and futa refund claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the government tax penalty claim.
a property of the estate 
as noted above,the first step in determining whether the government claim constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity with regard to a debtor counterclaim is whether the debtor claim is property of the estate.in its briefs,the government points out that plan of reorganization stipulates that the property of the estate reverts to upon confirmation.at.according to the government,tax refund can not be the property of the estate since the refund claim arose after confirmation,at a point in time when the estate had ceased to exist.
although the government approach has a certain linguistic appeal,it has been criticized for creating arbitrary distinctions between and property.for example,in price united states in re theodore price,a chapter debtor filed a claim for attorney fees that he incurred while defending against the government suit for back taxes in a federal court.as in this case,the government argued that since the claim for attorney fees arose after the confirmation of the reorganization plan and the dissolution of the bankruptcy estate,the claim was not property of the estate.the district court rejected this argument.id.at.the court pointed out that since the chapter debtor remained obligated to use property to fulfill the obligations of the plan of reorganization,there was no reason to distinguish between property and the property of the estate.it stated p lainly there is no firm line which divides the property of the debtor and property of the estate once a chapter plan has been confirmed.rather,the two must be treated as one and the same,at least to the extent that the debtor income or other property is committed to implementation of the plan.id.this decision was affirmed by the seventh circuit.price united states in re theodore price,cir.
although there may be some situations in which distinguishing property from the property of the estate might help maintain the integrity of the plan of reorganization,we agree with price court holding that where the debtor does not obtain a discharge and property is committed to the plan of reorganization,it would be arbitrary to exclude property from the property of the estate given that chapter liquidation and reorganization plan does not provide for a discharge and the plan obligates to use property to fulfill the plan of reorganization,we find that the tax refund claim,although property should be considered as property of the estate.accordingly,we hold that claim for futa tax refunds is property of the estate for the purposes of determining jurisdiction under section b.
b same transaction or occurrence 
pursuant to section b,the second test for waiver of sovereign immunity is whether the debtor claim arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the government claim.since the same transaction language was borrowed from rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,courts have routinely relied on rule jurisprudence in interpreting b based on this reliance,several courts have held that like rule,section b transaction or occurrence language should be interpreted liberally.see,burlington strong,cir w e have stressed that our inquiry can not be a wooden application of the common transaction label.citations omitted.rather,a transaction may comprehend a series of many occurrences,depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical relationship.united states southern constr,cir,rev in part on other grounds,d internal quotation omitted.
in this case,the parties claims both arise out of the debtor tax liability.the government claim for tax penalties arises out of failure to pay taxes in and.claim for a futa refund arises out of its eventual payment of his and federal taxes and its subsequent payment of michigan unemployment taxes for and.although it is true that the parties claims did not arise at the same moment,there is clearly a logical relationship between the claims,since they are both proceed from tax liability for and 
as such,we find that has met both tests for the waiver of sovereign immunity under section b and that therefore the government claim against constituted a waiver of sovereign immunity with regard to tax refund claim.
subject matter jurisdiction 
the government also argues that the bankruptcy court should not have adjudicated this case because it did not have subject matter jurisdiction.
a core jurisdiction 
section b confers jurisdiction on bankruptcy judges to hear all core proceedings arising under title.b bankruptcy judges may hear and determine all core proceedings arising under title.the bankruptcy code sets forth a list of core proceedings this list includes proceedings which affect the adjustment of the relationship.b o.
the resolution of this proceeding clearly affects the adjustment of the relationship.as noted above,the adjudication of tax refund claim and the government right to setoff will determine and the government rights one another.thus it is clear that the bankruptcy court did have core subject matter jurisdiction over this case 
b post confirmation jurisdiction 
nonetheless,the government contends that in a chapter proceeding,the bankruptcy court may not exercise jurisdiction unless such jurisdiction is provided for in the plan of reorganization.see hosp.property damage claimants in re,cir.the government argues that since plan of reorganization only provides jurisdiction over controversies pending as of the date of confirmation it does not have jurisdiction over tax refund claim,which arose after confirmation.this argument has two important weaknesses.
first,although it is true that some courts have restricted the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to the plan of reorganization,this practice has been explicitly rejected by others.see refrigerant reclamation of am.todack in re refrigerant reclamation of am,citing frank kennedy gerald smith,postconfirmation issues the effects of confirmation and postconfirmation proceedings,s ince the confirmation of a plan in a chapter case does not terminate a case,there should be no change in basic jurisdiction of the court.
in fact,several courts have held that provides bankruptcy courts with broad power to enforce the terms of a confirmed plan.see,in re terracor,in re beta int l.section b states 
the court may direct the debtor and any other necessary party to execute or deliver or to join in the execution of delivery of any instrument required to effect a transfer of property dealt with by a confirmed plan,and to perform any other act,including the satisfaction of any lien,that is necessary for the consummation of the plan.
under this line of cases,the bankruptcy court would cl
