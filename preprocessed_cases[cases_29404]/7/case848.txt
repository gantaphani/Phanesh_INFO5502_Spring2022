wieburg was discharged by gte southwest,on august.nearly three months later,on november,she and her husband filed for chapter bankruptcy.the following february,wieburg wrote a letter to the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc,stating that the letter was an official charge of discrimination based on age and sex.approximately two months later,on april,wieburg was adjudged bankrupt and her debts of approximately were discharged.three weeks later,on april,wieburg filed formal discrimination charges against gte with the eeoc.

during wieburg deposition in september,gte counsel learned of wieburg bankruptcy and the of her discrimination claims during her bankruptcy proceeding.gte moved to dismiss wieburg complaint,asserting that her claims were property of the bankruptcy estate and,therefore,the chapter bankruptcy trustee had exclusive standing to assert them.in addition,gte informed the trustee of wieburg pending claims.
a few weeks later,the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion to reopen wieburg bankruptcy case.wieburg initiated an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court in which she asserted that her claims were not the property of the bankruptcy estate.in response to gte motion to dismiss filed in the district court,wieburg sought a stay of the motion pending the bankruptcy court ruling or an agreement between her and the trustee and,if appropriate,joinder of the trustee as a real party in interest.on december,the district court entered an agreed order staying the action.
wieburg and the trustee reached a settlement of the bankruptcy adversary proceeding,memorialized in a january,letter from wieburg counsel to the trustee 
wieburg claims against gte are property of the bankruptcy estate,not subject to exemption.however,the trustee shall file an application to retain wieburg counsel as counsel to pursue the claims on behalf of the estate and in that regard,the claims will be pursued in her name without formal intervention by you as trustee in the action,and the decision to settle the claims at any level or pursue the claims to trial will exclusively be within her control and mine as her counsel,subject to the obligation that any monies received by way of settlement or judgment be used first,before any attorney fees are paid to me or any proceeds are paid to her,to pay the finally allowed priority,administrative and unsecured claims of her creditors in her bankruptcy case and your trustee fees and any expenses you may incur in connection with the civil action,all subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court 
emphasis added.the trustee signed the letter,approving its terms.

on april,gte supplemented its motion to dismiss.it asserted that wieburg had had a reasonable time to join or substitute the trustee,and that her claims should be dismissed or,alternatively,she should be ordered to join or substitute the trustee as the real party in interest.in response,wieburg contended that,in accordance with her agreement with the trustee,she was properly pursuing the action without substitution or joinder by the trustee and that,at most,the trustee should be joined as a nominal.alternatively,wieburg requested that the trustee be joined,but not substituted,as a party in interest.
on may,the district court granted gte motion to dismiss.it held that wieburg lacked standing because the trustee was the real party in interest.the district court stated that wieburg reliance on the settlement agreement was misplaced,because the bankruptcy court had held that wieburg discrimination claims are property of the bankruptcy estate and that the bankruptcy court did not even allude to the purported agreement.thus,the district court interpreted the bankruptcy court order as indicating that the trustee is the only proper plaintiff to pursue wieburg discrimination claims.
wieburg moved to vacate the judgment.she argued that there was no just basis for dismissing the action without allowing an opportunity for the trustee to be joined or substituted.although the trustee was not a party to the action,wieburg counsel represented in the motion that the trustee joined in seeking vacatur of the district court judgment.on august,the district court denied the motion.wieburg,again joined by the trustee,has now timely appealed to us the judgment and the order denying her motion to vacate.we first turn to address some preliminary matters.
the trustee was not a party in district court and has not sought to intervene in this appeal.accordingly,the trustee appeal must be dismissed.see karcher may,d one who is not a party or has not been treated as a party to a judgment has no right to appeal therefrom mcshane united states,cir one can not be an appellant here unless he had been a party in the court below and has taken the prescribed steps for the perfection of his appeal.
wieburg conceded in district court that gte service corporation was not her employer and was thus subject to dismissal.we therefore affirm the dismissal of gte service corporation.we now turn to address the issues presented in this appeal.
the first question before us is whether the district court erred in concluding that wieburg lacks standing to pursue her discrimination claims.gte argues that the trustee has exclusive standing to assert these claims.we will review de novo this legal question.see cadleway properties,andrews in re andrews,cir.
our determination of the proper party to assert wieburg discrimination claims is governed by rule a of the federal rules of civil procedure.it requires that e very action shall be prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest.the real party in interest is the person holding the substantive right sought to be enforced,and not necessarily the person who will ultimately benefit from the recovery.farrell construction jefferson parish,cir.the purpose of this provision is to assure a defendant that a judgment will be final and that res judicata will protect it from having to twice defend an action,once against an ultimate beneficiary of a right and then against the actual holder of the substantive right.id.at.
wieburg filed for bankruptcy after the events giving rise to her discrimination claims had occurred.therefore,consistent with the settlement agreement between wieburg and the trustee,the trustee notice of intent,and the bankruptcy court approval order,all of which refer to the claims as property of the bankruptcy estate not subject to exemption,those claims are property of the bankruptcy estate and should have been disclosed in wieburg ban
