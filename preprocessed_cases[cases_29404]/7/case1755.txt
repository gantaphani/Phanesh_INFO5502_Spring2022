this appeal presents the question,inter alia,as to whether sovereign immunity bars a suit filed against a united states trustee acting in his official capacity based on acts conducted within the course and scope of his employment.we hold that it does and affirm the district court.
the bankruptcy proceedings were initiated as three involuntary chapter petitions filed by carillon gardens associates,llc carillon against homewood development,richard balser,and corinne balser collectively,the debtors.eventually,the three petitions were administratively consolidated and converted to a chapter bankruptcy.the debtors thereafter acted as.carillon moved for the appointment of an examiner in the case pursuant to.the debtors stipulated to the appointment,and the bankruptcy court entered an order authorizing the united states trustee to appoint an examiner with expanded powers pursuant to c,including the power and duty to manage the debtors rental properties and a power concurrent with the debtor to seek approval of sale of the properties subject to carillon secured claims.the united states trustee selected perry stacks stacks as the examiner,and the bankruptcy court entered an order approving the appointment after notice and hearing.
carillon subsequently filed a request for relief from the automatic stay pursuant to d for the purpose of foreclosing on its secured claims against the debtors real property.shortly thereafter,the examiner filed a motion for approval of a proposed sale of the real property for a purchase price of,free and clear of liens pursuant to.after notice to creditors and all parties in interest,including the debtors,the bankruptcy court entered an order granting carillon relief from the automatic stay,provided that any foreclosure sales not be conducted earlier than august.the purpose of this was to enable the examiner to complete the sales of the property.the debtors objected to the terms of the sale proposed by the examiner.however,the bankruptcy court approved the sale free and clear of liens on june.the bankruptcy court denied the debtors motion for reconsideration on june.the debtors filed a notice of appeal of the order approving the sale.however,they did not pursue the appeal,and it was dismissed.
the bankruptcy court approved the debtors joint plan of reorganization on june,and the chapter cases were closed on december.
on august,richard and corinne balser the balsers contacted the assistant united states trustee who had been assigned the debtors case and complained about the examiner conduct in the chapter cases.the assistant united states trustee commenced an investigation and ultimately determined that there had been no evidence of fraud or other wrongdoing to require further action and so advised the balsers.the balsers then filed this pro se action on december,alleging that the united states trustee had acted negligently and fraudulently in connection with the appointment and supervision of the examiner.specifically,the balsers allege that two sales involving ten properties were conducted in a negligent and unlawful manner,which resulted in the sale of ten properties significantly below market value and without notice to the balsers.in particular,the balsers allege that examiner stacks fraudulently collaborated with attorney lawrence ream ream,who served as the property buyer attorney,even though he had a prior and existing business relationship with stacks in which ream provided legal representation and services to stacks.the balsers allege that the united states knew of the conflict of interest and fraudulent conduct,but it failed to follow its statutory duty to supervise the administration of balsers estate in a manner that protected the balsers interests.
the balsers further asserted that the united states trustee conduct violated their federal constitutional rights set forth in the fifth,seventh,ninth,and fourteenth amendments.the balsers sought injunctive and monetary relief,including a claim for approximately in damages.
after first providing the balsers with the opportunity to amend their complaint,the district court dismissed the complaint on the basis that the united states trustee is immune from suit under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.the district court also concluded that if the suit had been brought against the united states trustee in his individual capacity,it would be barred by judicial immunity.the balsers timely appealed 
the united states,as a sovereign,is immune from suit unless it has waived its immunity.see dep t of army blue fox,d mitchell,d.a court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over a claim against the united states if it has not consented to be sued on that claim.see mccarthy,cir.when the united states consents to be sued,the terms of its waiver of sovereign immunity define the extent of the court jurisdiction.mottaz,d citing sherwood.in sovereign immunity analysis,any lawsuit against an agency of the united states or against an officer of the united states in his or her official capacity is considered an action against the united states.see sierra club whitman,cir.
in this case,the balsers sued the department of justice,office of united states trustee,which the balsers now ask us to construe as an action against the united states trustee.however captioned,the suit plainly states a cause of action against the united states.the department of justice is undisputably an agency of the united states.see.the office of united states trustee is under the supervision of the united states attorney general.see a c.the attorney general of the united states is empowered to appoint united states trustees for each federal judicial district.id.the term of the appointment is five years.see b.subject to certain restrictions that are not important to this analysis,the attorney general fixes the annual salaries of united states trustees and assistant united states trustees.see.the united states trustee system is funded by the federal treasury by virtue of special fees collected in bankruptcy cases.see b.
in sum,the district court properly construed the balsers action against the department of justice,office of united states trustee as one against the united states.as such,the doctrine of sovereign immunity would apply unless waived by the united states.
a waiver of sovereign immunity by the united states must be expressed unequivocally.see nordic village,d.as a general matter,purported statutory waivers of sovereign immunity are not to be liberally construed.id.at.
the balsers argue that the bankruptcy code provides an express waiver of sovereign immunity for suits against united states trustees in a.a close examination of the code refutes this suggestion.section a contains a waiver of sovereign immunity as to a governmental unit.the phrase governmental unit is defined in as follows 
governmental unit means united states state commonwealth district territory municipality foreign state department,agency,or instrumentality of the united states but not a united states trustee while serving as a trustee in a case under this title,a state,a commonwealth,a district,a territory,a municipality,or a foreign state or other foreign or domestic government 
id.emphasis supplied.
thus,by its plain terms,the bankruptcy code does not contain an unequivocally express waiver of sovereign immunity for united states trustees.to the contrary,united states trustees expressly are excepted from the a sovereign immunity waiver thus,the balsers argument fails 
the balsers argue,in the alternative,that the federal tort claims act ftca provides an avenue of relief.see b.the ftca grants a limited waiver of sovereign immunity by making the united states liable to the same extent as a private person for certain torts of federal employees acting within the scope of their employment.see b.the balsers neither asserted this theory of liability in their pleadings nor requested that the district court grant leave to amend their complaint to assert this theory.on appeal,the balsers request us to reverse the district court and require the district court to allow an amendment asserting this theory.
generally speaking,we will not consider an
