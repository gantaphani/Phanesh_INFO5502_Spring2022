robert louis marrama appeals from the bankruptcy court order which rejected his petition to convert these proceedings from chapter to chapter,based on its determination that marrama had attempted to conceal assets from creditors.we affirm.
background 
in august,marrama transferred residential real estate in york,maine,having an unencumbered value of,to a revocable spendthrift trust,for no consideration,and designated himself sole beneficiary and his girlfriend sole trustee.marrama acknowledged intent was to protect the property from the claims of creditors.seven months later,he submitted a voluntary chapter petition,together with a statement of financial affairs wherein he i disclosed that he was the trust beneficiary,ii listed the value of its res as zero,iii denied making any property transfers within one year preceding the filing of the chapter petition,and iv asserted that the irs owed him no tax refunds whereas,marrama was due a tax refund exceeding.
in june,the chapter trustee questioned marrama regarding these apparent discrepancies.rather than responding,marrama filed notice in the bankruptcy court,pursuant to bankruptcy code a,seeking to convert the chapter case to a chapter proceeding,based upon his contention that,more recently,he had acquired additional rental income and gainful employment.the chapter trustee opposed the conversion on the ground that marrama intentionally failed to disclose in his schedules the preferential transfer of the maine property into the trust some seven months prior to his chapter petition,as well as his anticipated federal tax refund.the debtor contended that these misstatements and omissions were inadvertent.
following a hearing,the bankruptcy court refused to permit the conversion to chapter,on the ground that the deceptive statement of financial affairs demonstrated marrama bad faith.marrama appealed to the bap,which affirmed.in re marrama,cir.bap the present appeal fails as well.
discussion 
on an appeal from a bap decision,we review de novo the legal determinations of the bankruptcy court,and its findings of fact for clear error.see brandt repco printers lithographics,in re healthco int l,cir.
section a and bad faith conversion 
the initial issue on appeal is whether bankruptcy code a confers any discretion upon the bankruptcy court to forfend against bad faith conversions to chapter,or the debtor has an absolute right to convert.interpretation of subsection a presents a pure issue of law,engendering de novo review.see hsbc bank usa branch in re bank of new england,cir,cert.denied,d.subsection a provides 
the debtor may convert a case under this chapter,chapter to a case under chapter,or of this title at any time,if the case has not been converted under section,or of this title.any waiver of the right to convert a case under this subsection is unenforceable.
a emphasis added.thus,section imposes two plainly expressed limitations upon a debtor right to convert the debtor i must not previously have converted the case and ii must meet the eligibility requirements for the chapter to which he intends to convert,see d.with respect to a conversion to chapter,for example,the debtor must have a regular income,unsecured debts less than,and secured debts less than.see id.e.
as always,first we must inquire whether the plain language of subsection a resolves the interpretive issue,and,if so,its manifest meaning must control.see in re bankvest capital,cir,cert.denied,d.at the outset it must be noted that subsection a is to be viewed in light of a fundamental canon of the bankruptcy code a bankruptcy court sitting in equity is duty bound to take all reasonable steps to prevent a debtor from abusing or manipulating the bankruptcy process to undermine the essential purposes of the bankruptcy code,including the principle that all the debtor assets are to be gathered and deployed in a bona fide effort to satisfy valid claims.see united states mourad,cir noting that bankruptcy code a enables the bankruptcy court to tak e any action or mak e any determination necessary or appropriate to prevent an abuse of the bankruptcy process.whether or not the bankruptcy code a provision alone would warrant the bankruptcy court decision to deny marrama a subsection a conversion,that provision indeed looms large in determining whether congress envisioned that subsection a be construed as withholding all discretion where the bankruptcy court is confronted with a patently abusive motion to convert 
those who seek the shelter of the bankruptcy code must not play fast and loose with their assets or with the reality of their affairs.the statutes are designed to insure that complete,truthful,and reliable information is put forward at the outset of the proceedings,so that decisions can be made by the parties in interest based on fact rather than fiction.as we have stated,t he successful functioning of the bankruptcy act hinges both upon the bankrupt veracity and his willingness to make a full disclosure.
boroff tully in re tully,cir citation omitted.absent plain language to the contrary in subsection a,therefore,we would be loathe indeed to disregard such an overarching legislative policy.
turning to the particular language utilized in subsection a,we can discern no evidence that the congress intended to override the presumptive power and responsibility of the bankruptcy court to weed out abuses of the bankruptcy process at any stage in the bankruptcy proceedings.subsection a simply provides that the debtor may convert.the word may has at least two connotations.it can simply denote that a debtor has the option to convert,or not convert.on the other hand,may often suggests conditionality,signifying that the event or status described is in no sense to be considered a foregone conclusion.thus,the phrase may convert reasonably may suggest that the right to convert is merely presumptive,and may be exercised only if the debtor meets the preconditions for eligibility established in bankruptcy code e,or even then only in the absence of other exceptional circumstances.see in re finney,cir holding subsection a right not absolute,but subject to exception martin martin in re martin,cir in re kuntz,cir.bap.in other words,the debtor may succeed in an attempted conversion,but not necessarily in all conceivable instances.
although congress mere use of the word may might not be conclusive in itself as to the existence or scope of the bankruptcy court discretionary authority to deny a conversion,the statutory interpretation proffered by the trustee is bolstered as well by a comparison between bankruptcy code a and b,for example,which provides that o n request of the debtor at any time,if the case has not been converted under section,or of this title,the court shall dismiss a case under this chapter.emphasis added.subsection b demonstrates that congress well understood how to draft statutory language which left no or at least considerably less discretion in the bankruptcy court to deny a chapter debtor request the fact that subsection a contains no such imperative language strongly suggests that it confers a more restricted right upon the debtor,and that the bankruptcy court presumptively retains its discretionary prerogative to deny conversion in some circumstances.see citizens awareness network,united states,cir congress use of differential language in various sections of the same statute is presumed to be intentional and deserves interpretive weight.
similarly,use of the phrase at any time in subsection a simply means that the debtor may seek to convert at any time during the pendency of the bankruptcy case,or in other words,that no artificial time constraints should impede an election to convert.obviously,however,the temporal permissiveness of the phrase at any time hardly equates to the more broad circumstantial permission which congress could have conferred,for example,by employing a phrase such as regardless of the circumstances.see in re copper,cir.bap in re young,in re starkey.
marrama points to the second sentence in subsection a,which provides that a ny waiver of the right to convert a case under this subsection is unenforceable,as evidence that congress intended that the debtor not be able to divest himself of the right to convert,even where he allegedly abuses the bankruptcy process.once again,however,in context this sentence functions strictly as a consumer protection provision against adhesion contracts,whereby a debtor creditors might be precluded from attempting to prescribe a waiver of the debtor right to convert to chapter as a condition of its contractual agreements.see in re copper,at bankruptcy code e referring to a exemption waiver,which was made unenforceable,as one executed in favor of a creditor.subsection a contains no intimation that the debtor should be accorded protection against his own willful misconduct,such as an intentional abuse of the bankruptcy process.see in re starkey,at noting that such debtor misconduct is more akin to an estoppel,than a waiver.
in construing subsection a,it is important to bear in mind that the bankruptcy court has unquestioned authority to dismiss a chapter distinguished from converting the case to chapter upon a showing of bad faith on the part of the debtor.see in re cabral,cir.bap see also in re alt,cir.we can discern neither a theoretical nor a practical reason that congress would have chosen to treat a motion to convert a chapter case to chapter under subsection a differently from the filing of a chapter petition in the first instance.
the plain language of subsection a in no sense undermines the presumptive authority of the bankruptcy court to take reasonable steps to thwart debtor abuse of the bankruptcy process.however,even assuming arguendo that subsection a were ambiguous,we would look to the statute historical context,its legislative history,and the underlying policies that animate its provisions.in re weinstein,cir see in re lan tamers,cir noting that court may rely upon legislative history to corroborate meaning derived from plain statutory language.
the present controversy over the meaning of subsection a is traceable not to the plain language of subsection a,but largely to its legislative history,which describes the debtor right to conversion as absolute,or as a matter of right 
subsection a of this section gives the debtor the absolute right of conversion of a liquidation case to a reorganization or individual repayment plan case.if the case has already once been converted from chapter or to chapter,then the debtor does not have that right.the policy of the provisions is that the debtor should always be given the opportunity to repay his debts.
at,at,reprinted in.
the term absolute is problematic,if taken out of context,in that it implies that the debtor conversion right is unconditional.we are not at liberty to take the term so literally,however,since subsections a and e make clear that numerous conditions exist which might defeat the debtor motion to convert.see lawrence king,collier on bankruptcy,at to section a permits the debtor,as a matter of right,to convert a liquidation case to a case under chapter,or if the case has not previously been converted from one of those chapters to chapter.emphasis added.therefore,in context the term absolute likely constitutes a recognition either that the debtor may convert once as a matter of right,but may not engage in successive conversions,or that the debtor right to conversion can not be waived by contract.
it is the pronounced policy of subsection a that the debtor should always be given the opportunity to repay his debts,at,thus should be given one chance to effectuate a viable chapter plan.it is plainly implicit in this legislative observation,however,that such an opportunity is to be accorded only to honest debtors.see in re spencer,where conversion to chapter amounts to an attempt to escape debts rather than to repay them,the reason for the rule there the rule ceases also.see also in re marcakis.nothing in the legislative history remotely negates nor undermines the overarching principle that the bankruptcy courts are duty bound to take all reasonable steps to preclude debtors from abusing or manipulating the bankruptcy process in order to undermine the essential purposes of the bankruptcy code.
marrama advances two additional arguments.first,he notes the supposed irony that the bankruptcy reform legislation recently enacted by congress aims to encourage more debtors to file chapter petitions and thus undertake voluntary repayment of their debts,whereas the bankruptcy court here prematurely his nascent attempt to do so.see bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of,stat.this argument is unpersuasive.the language of subsection a remains unchanged under the new act,and marrama has not suggested that there is any other specific bankruptcy code amendment which would affect our interpretation of subsection a.rather,the purport of the bankruptcy reform legislation is to compel some debtors presently eligible to file chapter cases to opt for the less,chapter regime,thus making it impossible for those debtors to obtain an absolute discharge of their debts.see in re hill,discussing reform bill.a legislative policy aimed at encouraging able debtors to undertake the voluntary repayment of their lawful credit obligations plainly is not served where the bankruptcy court has determined,as a threshold finding of fact,that the debtor is utilizing his subsection a conversion rights to advance an ongoing scheme to retain his assets from bona fide creditors.
finally,marrama notes that the code accords the bankruptcy court discretion to reconvert a chapter case to chapter at a subsequent stage in the proceedings where the debtor has acted in bad faith,see in re copper,at,and therefore that subsection a should not be construed as authorizing a largely duplicative remedy.we disagree.first,it would ill serve general policies aimed at promoting the efficient administration of bankruptcy cases to insist that a bankruptcy confronted with clear evidence of a debtor bad indulge in the technical formality of converting the chapter case to chapter,knowing full well that eventually the case must be reconverted by reason of that same evidence of bad faith.see kowal malkemus in re thompson,cir noting the important policy favoring efficient bankruptcy administration.absent some plausible policy justification for such pointless spinning of judicial wheels,we can not construe subsection a as requiring it.
moreover,these two remedies are neither inherently nor necessarily duplicative.thus,for example,the bankruptcy court could invoke its power to reconvert a case,even though the debtor did not submit the subsection a conversion motion in bad faith,but subsequent to the conversion the debtor engaged in conduct which justified reconversion to chapter.congress may well have the bankruptcy court could nip in the bud manipulative conduct on the part of a bad faith debtor at the moment of conversion,pursuant to subsection a,rather than only after the case has been converted.
for all these reasons,we conclude that subsection a permits the bankruptcy court to deny a chapter debtor subsection a motion to convert where the court determines that the debtor engaged in bad faith conduct.we now turn to an assessment of the determination of bad faith made by the bankruptcy court.
b.the finding of bad faith 
marrama maintains that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that he acted in bad faith by attempting to conceal assets from creditors by means of misrepresentations and material omissions of fact in his chapter schedules.marrama contends that i the schedules merely failed to disclose his recent transfer of the maine property into the trust,yet did not conceal the existence of the property itself ii the former omission was merely the result of scrivener error,with no intent to conceal iii the statement,in schedule the res property had no not false,notwithstanding its stated market value of,in that marrama harbored a belief that the spendthrift nature of the trust prevented it from becoming property of the chapter estate in the first instance and iv the bankruptcy court determination is not supported by competent evidence,since the court did not convene an evidentiary hearing.
