the plaintiff,itofca,appeals from the grant of summary judgment to the defendant,megatrans,in a suit for copyright infringement.itofca claims to be the owner of the copyright on a computer software program.megatrans owns the program itself,claims to have obtained the copyright in a bankruptcy sale,and is making and selling copies of a modified version of the program.the modified program is a derivative work,and so if itofca owns the copyright on the original,megatrans can not sell its version without a license,which it does not have,from itofca.
itofca was in a cooperative corporation owned by ford,walgreen,and other large corporations to which it provided rail and truck freight consolidation and forwarding services.it had developed a computer program called the comprehensive intermodal program to help its with their shipping.it undoubtedly owned the copyright on the program,though it had registered the copyright registration is no longer required for a valid copyright.in it transferred most of its assets to a new entity,itofca consolidators,ici.the asset agreement recites that the membership of itofca desires to divest itofca of all assets and operations involving freight forwarding services and specifically desires to transfer all of its assets,except a building at address and cash assets of itofca to ici.among the assets transferred to ici which despite its name was not owned by or otherwise affiliated with itofca was the employee of itofca,a man named fowler,who had developed the comprehensive intermodal program.
five years later,ici found itself in chapter.the bankruptcy court,with no opposition from itofca which participated in the chapter proceeding,approved the sale to a company called amerifreight of ici right,title and interest in all patent,copyright and trade secret rights in and to all computer software and corresponding documentation developed or acquired by ici amerifreight expressly acknowledges that ici may sell additional copies of the software to other parties and that by virtue of the proposed assignment it has only a nonexclusive right to the software.amerifreight turned around and assigned all the rights it had acquired from ici to megatrans.fowler,now employed by megatrans,modified the software program,which megatrans then licensed to others.that was in.eight years later,itofca,dormant since the transfer of its operating assets to ici,woke up and registered copyright on what it described as a comprehensive intermodal program that had been developed in.later it filed a supplemental registration stating that the program had been created in and listing ici as a and hence as a copyright owner,but asserting that itofca was the owner of the original program,which had been developed in.itofca was thus conceding that ici was authorized to modify the original program,see a,but only,as the statute makes clear,for ici own use,and not to sell copies of the modified work.b aymes bonelli,cir foresight resources pfortmiller.the distinction is consistent with the general principle of copyright law that a license to prepare a derivative work does not authorize the preparer to sell copies of it.making and selling are distinct rights,and you can assign one without the other.see gracen bradford exchange,cir.
when a bankruptcy court approves the sale of an asset of the debtor,a person who has notice of the sale can not later void it on the ground that he is the asset real owner.la preferida,cerveceria modelo,de,cir in re,cir veltman whetzal,cir see also in re edwards,cir.that was the ground on which the district judge rejected itofca claim of copyright infringement.itofca argues that all the sale did was transfer whatever copyright interest ici had,and the only interest it had was a license to use the copyrighted program that had been transferred to it by itofca when ici was created.the terms of the bankruptcy court order approving the sale refute this interpretation.the order states that ici is free to sell additional copies of the software this implies,since ici was conveying its rights to amerifreight,that amerifreight too,and hence its transferee,megatrans,was free to sell copies.so ici and its transferees must have had more than a license to use the software,since a copyright licensee has no right to make further copies except a single,copy for his own use the purchaser of a book does not obtain the right to make copies of the book.
in the same order,ici conveyed its software rights to a second company as well as to amerifreight namely southern pacific,which it could not do without making a copy to repeat,a mere copyright licensee is permitted only to make a single copy,and that for his own use only,not for sale to another.there is a further significance to this second sale it helps explain why the grant to amerifreight was described as a nonexclusive license.it was nonexclusive because another corporation southern pacific was also sold rights to the software and because ici retained a right to sell more copies amerifreight was not receiving an exclusive right to the software.nonexclusive does not as itofca believes equate to a copy the bankruptcy court would have had no occasion to mention the nonexclusivity of the grant if all that was being conveyed was a copy of the software,since everyone knows that the sale of a copy of a copyrighted work does not convey an exclusive right to the work the owner of the copyright retains his right to make and sell additional copies to others.
any doubt about the meaning of nonexclusive is dispelled by the exchange over the term between the lawyers and the bankruptcy judge,after the critical passage,elided by itofca in its brief,is restored 
itofca attorney and the only other concern that we had is it being a private sale instead of a public sale.now,we understand that the software will be held open to a future sale as well.i just query 
court what this,a nonexclusive license that being sold 
ici attorney that correct,your honor.
itofca attorney i just query whether there is anything unique about the hardware that should be marketed by a public sale.
the grant was nonexclusive because the software remained salable to others as well as to amerifreight.
it is true that ici did not list a copyright among its assets on the asset schedule that it submitted to the bankruptcy court true,too,that ordinarily persons who might have an interest in property being sold at a bankruptcy auction have a right to rely on the fact that the debtor schedule of assets does not list the property in which they are interested.but it was apparent on the face of the bankruptcy judge order that it was conveying the right to sell copies of the modified is precisely the right that itofca claims to have retained for itself.its failure to object to the bankruptcy court order is compelling evidence that its claim of right is an afterthought.it knew it had no basis for objecting to the sale order.
the question whether the bankruptcy court order gave ici transferee,amerifreight,and hence amerifreight transferee,megatrans,the defendant,the right to make and sell copies of the software is distinct from the question whether what itofca had conveyed to ici in the asset transfer agreement which of course preceded the bankruptcy was,in fact,the copyright on the software.probably it was,though this we need not decide,since even if the agreement did not transfer the copyright we have just determined that it transferred a right to sell a modified version,which is all that matters so far as this appeal is concerned.
the copyright on the computer program was an asset of itofca.itofca sold all its assets to ici except a building and some cash.a copyright is neither a building nor cash.true,the asset transfer agreement also states that itofca desires to transfer only those assets used and necessary in the operations of the transportation services being transferred,but the copyright is one of those assets it was used in itofca transportation services that was itofca business that it exited through the sale to ici.a possible reply is that since section of the copyright statute entitled ici to adapt the program for its own use,it did need the copyright itself,but just the right that the statute gave right to modify the program for its own use.but the parties do not discuss the possible bearing of section.
itofca is right of course that a copyright is not transferred automatically with the transfer of the copyrighted good.as we said,when you buy a book,you do obtain the right to make and sell copies of it.the copyright statute is explicit that there must be a memorandum in writing for the sale of the copyright to be enforceable,a.but it does not follow as itofca believes that the agreement must use the word copyright.schiller schmidt,nordisco,cir,payday,cir shugrue continental airlines,bieg hovnanian enterprises,d,sapc,lotus development,cir.it can use terminology such as all assets that clearly includes copyrights.schiller schmidt,nordisco,supra,at shugrue continental airlines,supra.at relational design technology,brock,wl,at.may.
we do want to be literalists,and so are happy to concede that the circumstances may,as in playboy enterprises,dumas,cir,negate the inference drawn from an acontextual reading.we are doubtful that there any such circumstances here to repeat an earlier point,the fact that the license granted to amerifreight and thus to megatrends was nonexclusive reserved certain rights to ici but nothing to itofca.indeed,as in schiller schmidt,where we held that a sale of photographic negatives included the copyright on them,since without it the buyer could not print positives from them,the circumstances in this case reinforce more than they undermine the inference drawn from the language of the transfer agreement.ici or a successor could not use the comprehensive intermodal program profitably unless it could adapt it to changing technology and the needs of particular customers.itofca acknowledges that the sale to ici carried with it the right to modify the program and now suppose that ici or its successor wanted to license the modified work to a customer.did it have to get a license from itofca to be allowed to do this itofca no longer had any technical or sales staff.it was a shell.how would it evaluate such a request who would evaluate the request would ici have consented to have such an albatross around its neck 
itofca points out that the asset schedule in the chapter proceeding did not list any copyrights,but asset schedules are far from infallible and we have seen that itofca was not entitled to rely on the omission from the agreement of any reference to the copyright.itofca best evidence that the copyright itself was not transferred is testimony by one of its employees that a lawyer acting on behalf of amerifreight sullivan,formerly the president of ici acknowledged at one point that itofca retained the copyright,and that fowler acknowledged that amerifreight had entered into negotiations with itofca for a license to make and sell a modified version because it was unsure whether itofca had transferred its copyright to ici.even if,as we doubt,this evidence is enough to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the asset transfer agreement transferred the copyright,in view of the sheer impracticability of such divided ownership,the preclusive effect of the bankruptcy court order,which clearly authorized ici and its transferees to make and sell a modified version of the software,requires that the judgment be 
the court affirms the district court grant of summary judgment in this difficult case by holding that itofca suit for infringement is precluded by the doctrine of claim preclusion under this court holding in la preferida,cerveceria modelo,cir.i agree.however,because i believe that this case raises serious concerns about the proper limitations on the use of claim preclusion,i write separately in order to set forth those concerns with some specificity.
in holding that the bankruptcy court order bars itofca claim as a matter of claim preclusion under our holding in la preferida,at,the court writes,w hen a bankruptcy court approves the sale of an asset of the debtor,a person who has notice of the sale can not later void it on the ground that he is the asset real owner.op.at.this is a correct statement of the law,and,as the court notes,itofca,having had notice of the bankruptcy proceedings is thus bound by the bankruptcy court order.the difficulty in this case lies in the imprecision of the bankruptcy court order it leaves unclear exactly what asset ici was selling.that ambiguity places significant strains on the doctrine of claim preclusion,and we must give serious consideration as to whether those concerns are so weighty as to preclude using that doctrine as the supporting beam on which to rest a judgment in this case.
claim preclusion is a salutary instrument that relieve s parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits,conserve s judicial resources,and,by preventing inconsistent decisions,encourage s reliance on adjudication.allen mccurry,d.however,these values of repose and reliance are gained at the expense of denying any opportunity to litigate matters that never have been litigated and that may involve valid rights to relief.the rules of preclusion inevitably have been affected by the resulting desire to achieve a proper balance between foreclosure and a fair opportunity to litigate.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure jurisdiction and related matters,at.indeed,claim preclusion must strike a delicate balance between,on the one hand,the interests of the defendant and of the courts in bringing litigation to a close and,on the other,the interest of the plaintiff in the vindication of a just claim.restatement second of judgments cmt.b.we have stated that r es judicata was not meant to be a trap for the unwary it must ensure fair notice to litigants and yield predictable results.andersen chrysler,cir.
in order to ensure that the appropriate balance is maintained between these two important policy concerns,the courts have developed various controls on the use of claim preclusion to ensure that its use adequately serves both concerns for judicial efficiency and concerns for fairness to the litigants.among those controls is the rule that res judicata is an affirmative defense thus megatrans has the burden of establishing that res judicata ought to bar itofca infringement action.kulavic chi.illinois midland ry,cir noting that the burden of establishing preclusion is placed on the party claiming it,id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted gleash yuswak,cir noting that claim preclusion is an affirmative defense.when,as here,the issue is decided on summary judgment,the party with the burden of proof,here megatrans,must establish each element of claim preclusion as a matter of law.see.c celotex catrett,d thorsteinsson drangur,cir in accordance with celotex,then,and to uphold the summary judgment entered by the district court,the defendant needs to have established as a matter of law that the prior judgment bars claims.
moreover,as noted by many courts,d oubts are resolved against preclusion.in re associated vintage group,cir citing harris jacobs,cir as stated by the second circuit,although the principles of res judicata should not be frugally applied,a reasonable doubt as to what was decided in the first action should preclude the drastic remedy of foreclosing a party from litigating an essential issue.mcnellis first fed.sav.loan ass of rochester,cir internal citations omitted finding that lower court disposition concerning a supplemental complaint was ambiguous and thus refusing to apply claim preclusion for action based on same transaction as that in supplemental complaint.the rationale for this rule is evident.if it is ambiguous and subject to reasonable doubt whether or not the plaintiff ever got a first bite or even the opportunity to take a first bite at the apple,to bar that claim forever would be unfair and would act as a trap for the unwary.andersen,at.certainly,if the party asserting claim preclusion can not establish and the reviewing court can not determine whether the claim was disposed by or ought to have been brought in the prior action,there is no guarantee that the party being precluded understood the situation either.
many of the cases relied upon by the court today support the salutary role played by these corollary principles to ensure that res judicata is reserved for its proper use and not called upon to perform service for which it was never intended.notably,both veltman whetzal,cir,and in re edwards,cir,involved transfers of real estate free and clear of all liens there was no question as to what was sold by the bankruptcy order.similarly,in re,cir,involved a liquidation sale of assets.in all three proceedings,the plaintiffs were attempting to nullify a sale to which they were party.both parties understood that the specific property had been sold by the bankruptcy sale and the plaintiffs understood that their only way to proceed would be to nullify that sale.we determined that such attempts to nullify the sale were barred by res judicata.similarly,in la preferida,after corona had declared bankruptcy,the bankruptcy court,correctly or incorrectly,purported to sell all of corona trademarks from corona itself to another company,modelo.la preferida,at.the plaintiff,la preferida,having participated in the bankruptcy litigation and not prevailed,was bound by the bankruptcy court determination when future litigation arose.
by contrast,the situation here is far more ambiguous.the bankruptcy court order does not establish clearly the nature of ici interest or the nature of the right ici transferred to amerifreight,megatrans predecessor in interest.
in pertinent part,the bankruptcy order reads as follows 
the debtor is authorized to sell to amerifreight the debtor right,title,and interest in all patent,copyright and trade secret rights in and to all computer software and corresponding documentation developed or acquired by the debtor the software in consideration for.amerifreight expressly acknowledges that the debtor may sell additional copies of the software to other parties and that by virtue of the proposed assignment it has only a right to the software.the sale of the software will be as is and without warranty of merchantability or fitness for any purpose.the sale of the software to amerifreight shall be free and clear of all liens,claims and encumbrances,with any liens,claims,and encumbrances attaching to the proceeds of the sale to amerifreight.
ex at emphasis added.
the result of this ambiguity is evident in the different characterizations given the order.megatrans in its brief claims that it received on a basis ici right to exercise all of the copyright rights the rights to reproduce,prepare derivative works,to distribute,to perform,and to display,see.appellee br.at.itofca submits that we should read the order much more tightly and that the sale only transferred a nonexclusive license to use the program and modify it for its own use.consequently,in its view,the bankruptcy sale only authorized the transfer of two modified copies of the itofca the itofca copyright itself.appellant br.at.these various contentions illuminate the problem of employing res judicata in a case in which the court judgment supporting the use of that construct is ambiguous.at some point,whatever judicial efficiencies the doctrine might bring are outweighed by the need to probe the record in order to determine what the court meant.as that investigation becomes more complex and involves investigating at great lengths the underlying transactions,the risk of unfairly pretermitting the opportunity of a party to explain the situation also increases.as the following discussion demonstrates,the task placed on this court by the ambiguity of the underlying order in this case requires significant hesitation before applying res judicata.
itofca created the original program and thus held the copyright the bundle of the exclusive rights to reproduce,prepare derivative works,to distribute,to perform,and to display for the program,see.in the asset transfer agreement,itofca transferred many of its assets to its subsidiary ici,see at.sometime in,itofca provided ici with a copy of the computer program,and ici used and modified the program from until its insolvency in.see at.itofca,as copyright owner could have transferred to ici by assignment,one or all or any part of its exclusive rights by exclusive license,one or all or any part of its exclusive rights by nonexclusive license,permission to exploit any one or more of its rights or any subdivision of them.paul goldstein,copyright ed supplement see generally melville nimmer david nimmer,nimmer on copyright ch.discussing assignments,licenses,and other transfers of rights.by nonexclusive,what is meant is that the licensee does not have an exclusive is,the licensor may grant to another licensee the exact same right.see,shaver,cir distinguishing between exclusive and nonexclusive licenses and noting that i n an exclusive license,the copyright holder permits the licensee to use the protected material for a specific use and further promises that the same permission will not be given to others,while for a nonexclusive license,t he copyright owner simply permits the use of a copyrighted work in a particular manner robert gorman,copyright law giving as an example of a nonexclusive license,separate grants to several production companies to perform a dramatic work.
the bankruptcy court order effected the transfer of ici right,title and interest to amerifreight and southern pacific,ex at.in determining what interest ici possessed and therefore was able to transfer to ameritech and to southern pacific,a logical starting point is to examine what itofca previously had transferred to ici by an examination of the asset agreement.
my colleagues suggest that,regardless of the ambiguities in the bankruptcy order,it is extremely likely that itofca transferred the copyright to ici without reservation in the asset transfer agreement between itofca and ici hereinafter asset agreement.the majority expresses doubt that the evidence is enough to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the asset transfer agreement transferred the copyright.op.at.in my view,the record can not support such a suggestion.the district court explicitly stated that the record was unclear as to exactly what property rights itofca conveyed to ici under the asset agreement.in my view,the district court perspective is more firmly grounded in the record.
the parties submissions on the motion for summary judgment reveal that the issue of whether the asset agreement transferred the copyright was vigorously disputed.certainly,the asset agreement itself is ambiguous.although two of the whereas clauses in the asset agreement indicate that itofca was selling all of its assets to ici,another whereas clause indicates that itofca desires to retain substantially all the property and assets of itofca and transfer only those assets used and necessary in the operations of the transportation services being transferred,ex at.the asset agreement does not mention transferring the does it mention the software at all there was voluminous conflicting evidence.see,at,and exhibits and at,and exhibits.
in light of this situation,i can not join my colleagues estimation that,despite the ambiguity in the asset agreement itself and despite a disputed and conflicting record,itofca p robably transferred the copyright to ici through the asset agreement.op.at.
as correctly explained by the majority,t he copyright statute is explicit that there must be a memorandum in writing for the sale of the copyright to be enforceable,a.op.at.in this case there is no such writing.the asset agreement says nothing about copyrights,intangible assets,or even the computer software itself.the majority suggests that this omission in the agreement is of little consequence because the asset agreement transferred all of itofca assets except a building and some cash and a copyright is neither a building nor cash,op.at the asset agreement was not required to use the word copyright to transfer the copyright,and a statement that all assets are transferred is sufficient because it clearly includes copyrights,op.at and circumstantial evidence establishes that a copyright was sold,see op.at.i therefore turn to an examination of each of these areas.
with respect to the asset agreement itself,the majority explains 
the copyright on the computer program was an asset of itofca.itofca sold all its assets to ici except a building and some cash.a copyright is neither a building nor cash.true,the asset transfer agreement also states that itofca desires to transfer only those assets used and necessary in the operations of the transportation services being transferred,but the copyright is one of those assets it was used in itofca transportation services that was itofca business that it exited through the sale to ici.
op.at.first,as noted previously,there is internal ambiguity in the agreement although one of the whereas clauses of the asset agreement essentially states that itofca was selling to ici all of its assets except a building and some cash,op.at,another whereas clause limits this broad statement and reveals that itofca desires to retain substantially all the property and assets of itofca and transfer only those assets used and necessary in the operations of the transportation services being transferred,ex at.it does not follow from this statement that the right to reproduce and sell copies of the program to third parties was included in the sale of assets.the only right that seems necessary to the freight forwarding service and thus transferred by the asset agreement is a copy with the right to use and modify the program,which is what itofca argues was transferred.megatrans is being sued for reproducing and selling copies to other for using the program in its own freighting services.commercial distribution of software does not appear to be necessary to conducting freight forwarding services and thus,on that basis,can not be said to be within the scope of the assets transferred by the asset agreement.
the majority recognizes this problem and states that a possible reply is that ici did need the copyright itself,but just the right that gave right to modify the program for its own use.op.at.i agree that the right to modify the program is the only right necessary to its freight forwarding service and thus the only right necessarily conveyed by an asset transfer agreement that only transfers assets necessary to the business.
although there is a strict requirement that the transfer of a copyright interest be in writing,the majority is correct when it states that it does not follow as itofca believes that the agreement must use the word copyright,op.at,and that such a writing can use terminology such as all assets that clearly includes copyrights,id.at.
the cases cited by the majority indeed stand for the proposition that use of the word copyright is not always necessary,but it is somewhat notable that in none of the cases did the written agreement merely say all assets without reference to rights,intangible property,or the underlying tangible property to which the intangible right attached.in all but one of the cited cases finding a transfer,the written agreement expressly conferred all rights in a specific piece of property,which the courts construed to include copyrights.see,payday,cir holding that an agreement in which a company retained all rights of ownership in a specific series of programs included the copyright shugrue cont l airlines,holding that agreement transferring all right,title and interest to a ll of its computer programs and software conveyed the copyright relational design,brock,civ,wl,at.may,holding that agreement conferring all rights to the completed program with no licensing or royalties fees due conveyed the copyright.even in schiller schmidt,nordisco,cir,the one case in which the agreement did not use the words all rights concerning a specific piece of property,the court stated that under the agreement bertel sold all the assets of spotline studios,tangible and intangible alike.id.in contrast,the asset agreement does not specify the sale of intangible assets at all.moreover,the asset agreement does not state that it is selling all of itofca assets either tangible or intangible,but merely all of the assets used and necessary to the freighting would include the right to use and modify the program,but not the right to reproduce and sell the program,ex at.
finally,the majority also looks to circumstantial evidence.specifically,the majority notes that itofca failure to object to the bankruptcy court order is compelling evidence that its claim of right is an afterthought.it knew it had no basis for objecting to the sale order,op.at and the sheer impracticability of such divided ownership if itofca retained the copyright because itofca no longer had any technical or sales staff.it was a shell.how would it evaluate such a request for a license who would evaluate the request would ici have consented to have such an albatross around its neck,op.at.
none of these issues was explored in the district court or during this appeal.to state on summary judgment that an agreement that says nothing about copyrights or intellectual property even mentions the underlying transferred a copyright conflicts with the purposes of section,which is designed to ensure that the creator of a work will not give away his copyright inadvertently,to enhance predictability and certainty of copyright ownership congress paramount goal in creating it.effects,cohen,cir quoting community for creative reid,d.rather than look to the courts every time they disagree as to whether a particular use of the work violates their mutual understanding,parties need only look to the writing that sets out their respective rights.id.
more fundamentally,even if there is some circumstantial evidence that the agreement conveyed a copyright,there is also significant evidence that the agreement was not intended to transfer the copyright,namely only assets used and necessary to the freighting business were transferred by the asset agreement,and rights of reproduction and sale of the computer program are arguably not necessary for that purpose the asset agreement does not say anything about copyrights,intangible property rights except the itofca trademark,or rights in computer programs in fact,it does not even mention the software at issue amerifreight,through its representative daniel sullivan appeared to believe that itofca owned the copyright ici statement on its bankruptcy schedule that it had no copyright or other intangible property rights.
certainly there is evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable finder of fact to find that the asset agreement failed to transfer the copyright.in reviewing a grant of summary judgment,a court is to construe all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and draw all reasonable and justifiable inferences in favor of that party.sch.dist.of whitefish bay,cir citation omitted.considering the conflicting evidence and the fact that the asset agreement itself is not only ambiguous but fails to even purport to convey a copyright interest in the software a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the asset agreement transferred the copyright.
because the asset agreement affords us no solid basis for determining the nature of the property rights that itofca transferred to ici,i must turn to the bankruptcy order.the bankruptcy order authorizes the sale of rights in the software to two parties southern pacific and amerifreight.see,ex at.the software is defined by the bankruptcy court as the debtor ici right,title and interest in all patent,copyright and trade secret rights in and to all computer software and corresponding documentation developed or acquired by the debtor the software,ex at.after defining software in the order authorization to sell the software to amerifreight,the court authorizes ici also to sell its right,title and interest in the software to southern pacific.id.at.thus both amerifreight and southern pacific obtained the debtor right,title and interest in all patent,copyright and trade secret rights in and to all computer software.id.at.for both conveyances,the order gives the same limitation the debtor may sell additional copies of the software to other parties and that by virtue of the proposed assignment a
