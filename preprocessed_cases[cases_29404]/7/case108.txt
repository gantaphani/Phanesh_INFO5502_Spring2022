this bankruptcy dispute presents a question of first impression in this circuit concerning a commercial lender right to receive a prepayment penalty from a solvent debtor.the lender best argument was not presented very clearly in the lower courts,but the parties have vigorously contested the point in this court.because the issue was at least arguably preserved and because its resolution has significant ramifications for the due administration of the bankruptcy code the code,we decide it.that decision leads us to reverse the lower courts rulings,vacate their orders,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the facts are not seriously disputed.on february,bess eaton donut flour and its sole shareholder,louis gencarelli,entered into a pair of commercial loan agreements with ups capital business credit.one loan,involving roughly,was for a term the other,involving nearly,was for a term.each was governed by rhode island law,secured by interests in real property and other business assets owned by bess eaton,and bore interest at a floating rate pegged to over prime.
pertinently,each loan agreement allowed the borrowers to repay at any time,subject,however,to a prepayment penalty provision.that provision,common to each loan agreement,stated in substance that,should repayment occur within the first five years of the loan term,the borrowers would pay a fee equal to a percentage of the amount prepaid.that percentage would vary depending upon the date of prepayment generally speaking,the earlier the prepayment,the higher the percentage.
on march,bess eaton filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter.see.gencarelli followed suit within the next few days.the bankruptcy court consolidated the cases.
in due course,the bankruptcy court arranged for,and oversaw,the sale of bess eaton operating assets.see id.b.the auction,skillfully managed by the bankruptcy judge,inspired unbridled enthusiasm,which translated into hard cash.as a result,the sale fetched a far higher price than had been much higher that the bankruptcy estates wound up with funds sufficient to pay all creditors in full including interest.even so,a multimillion dollar surplus remained for gencarelli.
along the way,ups submitted timely proofs of claim to the bankruptcy court in which it asserted a right to the unpaid principal balances of the two loans,plus accrued interest,plus the prepayment penalties.because full repayment was to be made in the third year of the loans,the loan agreements called for penalties equal to of the outstanding principal balances.this amounted to aggregate prepayment penalties of some.
the debtors conceded liability for the loan balances including accrued interest those balances have been paid in full and are not at issue in this appeal.withal,the debtors balked at paying the prepayment penalties.
as a practical matter,the dispute over the prepayment penalties narrowed to one between gencarelli and ups.gencarelli filed an objection to those portions of the claims that sought prepayment penalties.he averred that,under the code,an oversecured creditor is entitled to recover such costs only to the extent that they are reasonable.id.b.he posited that the prepayment penalties demanded by ups were unreasonable because they bore no rational relationship to the added expense that prepayment might inflict on the lender.accordingly,the claims should be disallowed.
ups countered,albeit without citation to any specific code provision,that the prepayment penalties were valid under controlling state law and,therefore,were enforceable in bankruptcy.in the alternative,it asserted that the penalties were reasonable.
following a hearing,the bankruptcy court held that section b of the code governed,displacing state law and creating a uniform federal standard of reasonableness that served as a substantive limitation on the fees,costs,and other charges that a secured creditor could recoup.in re bess eaton donut flour,wl.ergo,the prepayment penalties coveted by ups were enforceable only to the extent that they were reasonable,regardless of their status under rhode island law.id.at.
the bankruptcy court subsequently took evidence to determine the reasonableness of the prepayment penalties.thereafter,the court found the penalties unreasonable in amount and disallowed ups claims for them in their entirety.in re bess eaton donut flour,wl,at.
ups appealed this ruling to the united states district court for the district of rhode island.in the proceedings that followed,most of the briefing was devoted to the question of whether the prepayment penalties were reasonable.but ups also argued that a finding that fees,costs,or charges are unreasonable under b means only that they can not be allowed as a secured claim,and instead must be treated as an unsecured claim.while ups again neglected to cite the relevant code provisions,it did offer pertinent case citations in support of this argument.
although its analysis diverged somewhat from that of the bankruptcy court,the district court agreed that section b governed and that an oversecured creditor can recover charges,such as prepayment penalties,only if they are reasonable.see ups capital bus.credit gencarelli,wl,at.in affirming the bankruptcy court order,the district court did not address the possibility that unreasonable prepayment penalties might qualify as unsecured claims.
this timely appeal ensued.in it,ups argues that section b reasonableness standard is not relevant to the question of whether an oversecured creditor is entitled to collect a prepayment penalty from a solvent debtor.it directs us to section of the code and to a wealth of case law holding that if fees,costs,or other charges are deemed unreasonable,an oversecured creditor nonetheless may collect them as unsecured debt subject to the provisions of section.in the alternative,it argues that the lower courts models of reasonableness are unsuited to the realities of modern commercial lending.
gencarelli counters on several levels.first,he asserts that ups has forfeited the statutory argument.second,even if this argument is properly before us,he dismisses it as incorrect.third,he indiscriminately defends the reasonableness analyses conducted by the lower courts glossing over the fact that the district court and the bankruptcy court did not see eye to eye as to how reasonableness should be measured in this context.
we begin our inquiry by examining the merits of ups statutory interpretation argument.this argument turns on the interrelationship between sections and b of the code.
section is entitled a llowance of claims or interests.subject to other provisions not relevant here,it instructs that a bankruptcy court shall allow claims made against the debtor,valued as of the date of the filing of the petition,with nine categorical exceptions.see b.only one of these is arguably implicated here.that category calls for the disallowance of claims that are unenforceable under applicable law.id.b.ups maintains that rhode island law governs the loan agreements at issue here and that the prepayment penalty provisions contained in these agreements are enforceable under that applicable state law.
the bankruptcy court disallowed ups claims for prepayment penalties not because they were unenforceable under rhode island law but,rather,because it deemed a different code provision controlling.that provision states 
to the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which is greater than the amount of such claim,there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim,interest on such claim,and any reasonable fees,costs,or charges provided for under the agreement or state statute under which such claim arose.
id.b emphasis supplied.the bankruptcy court found that ups was an oversecured creditor that had failed to show the prepayment penalties were reasonable.
ups disputes the bankruptcy court interpretation of section b.it submits that section b speaks only to whether an oversecured creditor may enjoy special priority over other creditors with respect to ancillary claims for various kinds of fees,costs,and other charges.the statute accomplishes thi
