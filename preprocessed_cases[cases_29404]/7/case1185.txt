b.earlier proceedings 
the bankruptcy court concluded that had met the undue hardship test of a.it took the view that had satisfied the test for undue hardship previously established by this court 
the debtor can not maintain,based on current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for himself and his dependents if forced to repay the loans and 
additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans and 
the debtor has made efforts to repay the loans.

the bankruptcy court concluded that could not cover his current expenses despite what the court characterized as a frugal budget.the court also believed that,given his age,financial difficulties would persist.with respect to his employment opportunities,the court believed that,considering his age and his particular training and talents,he had maximized his job opportunities.with respect to his living arrangement,the court believed that he could not reduce his overall expenses by renting less expensive quarters because he would not have the advantage of sharing other living expenses.the court also noted that he had made efforts to pay the loans.
accordingly,the court discharged student loans.the court further ordered that any funds recovered on the judgment against his former accountant be remitted to ecmc.it decided to impose this arrangement despite ecmc objection that such a plan would have the practical effect of relieving of any incentive to collect the judgment.on appeal,the district court affirmed the discharge.ecmc timely appealed to this court.
discussiona.
the basic purpose of a discharge in bankruptcy is to give debtors a fresh start.see vill.of san jose mcwilliams,cir.congress nevertheless has decided that various considerations of public policy require that certain debts be excluded from the general principle of discharge.student loan debts are among those debts that congress has singled out for such exclusion.this student loan exception is codified in the bankruptcy code at 
a discharge under section,a,b,or b of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt for an educational benefit overpayment or loan made,insured or guaranteed by a governmental unit,or made under any program funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit or nonprofit institution,or for an obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit,scholarship or stipend,unless excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph will impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor dependents.
a.under this provision,debtors can not discharge student loans in bankruptcy unless they show that paying on the loans would cause undue hardship.supporters of this limitation on the dischargeability of these loans sought to curb abuse by unscrupulous former students who,having obtained their education,sought to evade their commitment to pay for it by seeking immediate discharge of their loans 
the key phrase of the statutory provision,undue hardship,is not defined in the statute.nor does the legislative history provide meaningful guidance.as noted earlier,in roberson,at,we adopted the test for undue hardship,first enunciated by the second circuit in brunner new york state higher educucation services in re brunner,cir per curiam.in adopting that approach,we chose a path that gave ample recognition to the term undue in order to ensure that the intent of congress would be fully reflected in our adjudications.as our colleagues in the ninth circuit have noted,congress would not have made student loans an exception to discharge if it meant to allow discharge based on merely hardship.see rifino united states in re rifino,cir see also pennsylvania higher educ.assistance agency faish in re faish,cir t he brunner standard safeguards the financial integrity of the student loan program by not permitting debtors who have obtained the substantial benefits of an education funded by taxpayer dollars to dismiss their obligation merely because repayment of the borrowed funds would require some major personal and financial sacrifices.roberson,at deeming a as heightened standard for dischargeability of student loans.
each prong of this undue hardship inquiry reflects the need to keep in mind this basic policy decision by congress.accordingly,the first prong examines the debtor current financial condition to see if payment of the loans would cause his standard of living to fall below that minimally necessary.id.similarly,the second prong,future prospects,should be based upon the certainty of hopelessness,not simply a present inability to fulfill financial commitment.id.at citation omitted.the third prong,good faith,is measured by the debtor efforts to obtain employment,maximize income,and minimize expenses and encompasses a notion that the debtor may not willfully or negligently cause his own default,but rather his condition must result from factors beyond his reasonable control.id.citation omitted.
as we have stated in prior decisions,we review de novo whether the debtor circumstances meet the undue hardship test.goulet educ.credit mgmt.in re goulet,cir roberson,at.in doing so,however,we must give deference to the bankruptcy court findings of adjudicative fact and to the factual inferences that the court drew from those facts as long as those findings are ground in the evidence of record.see,pena,at t he bankruptcy court did not clearly err in finding that the debtors exhibited good faith in attempting to pay back the student loans.roberson,at accepting the bankruptcy court factual finding that the debtor financial straits were not likely to continue for an extended period of time.the debtor has the burden of establishing each element of the undue hardship test by a preponderance of the evidence,and if he fails on any one element,the test has not been met and the court need not continue with the inquiry.goulet,at.
although we normally give deference to a bankruptcy court factual findings and inferences,we must conclude that,in this case,we can not affirm the discharge of student loans because,insofar as we can tell from the record before us,the bankruptcy court grounded its decision on factual inferences that are not supported by the record 
of particular concern to us is the bankruptcy court analysis of financial circumstances under the first prong of the established ability to maintain,based on current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for himself,if he is required to repay the loans.at the time of the hearing,had no dependents and an annual income of plus benefits.thus,his monthly income exceeded the irs housing and utility allowance for a family of two in portland by nearly the bankruptcy court nevertheless concluded that could not maintain a minimal standard of living if forced to repay his loans 
the bankruptcy court analysis of expenses raises even more serious questions for us.the court allowed to justify a rent payment to live in his fiancée house that was nearly higher than the amount he apparently would have paid for a apartment in the portland area.the court based this justification on two assumptions that would have to live alone if he rented an apartment and that by living alone many of his expenses,no longer shared,would likely double.we can not see how this record necessarily supports these conclusions.many couples are forced to live in less appealing housing because of the financial obligations undertaken by one or the other.more importantly,it is speculative to assume that his expenses would necessarily double if he lived alone in an apartment.there is no evidence of record that it takes even close to the same amount of heat or light to service a apartment as it does to support a,house 
with respect to the second prong,the bankruptcy court conclusions with respect to future outlook also are troubling.here,the inquiry centers on whether circumstances indicate that financial situation is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period the bankruptcy court did not explore fully whether taking jobs in other fields might put in better financial standing.the bankruptcy court concluded that had found the job he could in the public health field and that,given his age,he might have a tough time finding other work in the future.and testified that he contacted over employers in different fields before landing his present job.but,other than testimony that he has worked as a substitute teacher and has some background in manufacturing,we can not tell from the record if has job skills that would be transferable to occupations.instead,the bankruptcy court seemed to focus on his choice to work in the public health field,commenting that i do think we can necessarily ask people to take other jobs just to pay their student loans.however,it is not uncommon for individuals to take jobs not to their liking in order to pay off their student loans,or for that matter to meet all sorts of other financial obligations.see brightful,at noting debtor responsibility to pursue other employment avenues if prospects at current job are limited.but cheesman tennessee student assistance in re cheesman,cir in affirming stay of discharge decision,accounting for debtors choice to work in worthwhile,albeit,professions.although has been fortunate in finding a position that he deems satisfying and that is socially useful,congress has not provided that such considerations ought to be weighed in determining the discharge of student loans.see roberson,at explaining,in adopting the brunner test,that i f the leveraged investment of an education does not generate the return the borrower anticipated,the student,not the taxpayers,must accept the consequences of the decision to borrow.
with respect to this second prong,another factor remains underdeveloped on this record.although has a responsibility to take into account the need to replenish his retirement assets,we are not told with any precision the impact that this consideration might have on his economic future.is a crime victim.if the record were more fully developed and the findings of the bankruptcy court more extensive,it would be possible to determine the sort of weight that this factor ought to be given in analyzing prospects.
given the evidence in the record,we can not say that the bankruptcy court was on solid ground in its determination that had met his burden on either the first or the second prong of the established undue hardship test.
with respect to the third prong,ecmc takes the position that the bankruptcy court erred in finding that had not established this factor.in ecmc view,the record establishes that,rather than face up to his obligation to pay his student loans,has pursued a course of building an equity interest in his fiancée home.the bankruptcy court took a different view of the record,a view that appears to be based at least in part on the court assessment of the credibility of the witnesses.we shall not disturb that determination.
conclusion 
on remand,the bankruptcy court should address the matters we have noted in the course of this opinion.although our review of the ultimate issue of undue hardship is de novo,that review ought to be predicated on an analysis that fully takes into account the record developed by the parties.the bankruptcy court is free to reassess its views or to reaffirm those already stated,albeit with
