jason clint worley,a chapter bankruptcy debtor,estimated the value of his interest in a real estate investment company at just of his initial capital contribution.the bankruptcy court found after a bench trial that worley intentionally lowballed his valuation and accordingly denied his discharge under the false oath provision of a.the district court agreed.we review that finding for clear error,and for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
worley has spent much of his adult life studying and working in the financial industry.in addition to earning a bachelor degree in finance from the university of florida and an mba from emory university,he worked at edward jones as a financial advisor for almost a decade.
during his time at edward jones,worley got caught up in the heady investment environment of the early and began personally investing in a series of real estate ventures.one of those ventures was gemini land trust,llc,which worley formed in january with his childhood friend,joshua crapps.worley contributed for a interest in the company joshua crapps served as managing member and had complete discretion over whether to distribute any profits or retain the proceeds for future transactions.gemini sole investment was a share in pelham land group,llc,which was managed by crapps father,daniel crapps.pelham owned acres of georgia timberland that,in,was worth an estimated per acre,or million total.the property also generated a few thousand dollars each year from farming,hunting,and timber leases.
many of worley other investments flopped,and he filed for bankruptcy on february.he initially classified the filing as a no asset case,signaling to the bankruptcy trustee that he did not own any assets that were worth distributing.see authorizing the trustee to abandon to the debtor any property of the estate that is of inconsequential value.on schedule b to the petition,worley estimated that his interest in gemini had a market value of.he explained that he was unsure how to value the minority stake in gemini,but sought the advice of counsel and applied the capitalization rate method.consequently,he took the largest annual distribution he received from gemini,rounded up to and multiplied by a capitalization rate of five.worley never consulted with joshua or daniel crapps before estimating the value of his interest,though he admitted that joshua crapps would be in a better position to value the company.worley schedule form for gemini,the most recent tax return in the record,reflected an individual capital account of.
although worley categorized the filing as a no asset case,upon learning that gemini owned a stake in pelham,the trustee informed creditors that assets would likely be available for distribution.on september,the plaintiffs here filed an adversary complaint alleging that worley intentionally misrepresented the value of his interest in gemini land trust by more than percent.the creditors therefore sought a denial of discharge pursuant to the false oath provision of a.
the bankruptcy court held a trial on the adversary claim on september.daniel crapps explained that the illiquid nature of gemini stake in pelham complicated the valuation analysis because only buzzards were interested in minority llc shares,gemini would fetch no more than of its capital account.nonetheless,he surmised that gemini share in pelham could be sold for at least and dismissed the idea that worley interest was worth something like or something that low.joshua crapps echoed his father assessment.although he had no idea what the value of his share of gemini was,he agreed that its value exceeded and depended on the appraised value of the land held by pelham.finally,the bankruptcy trustee testified that he did not sense that worley was stonewalling him and emphasized that the values assigned to scheduled assets are just starting points.the trustee did note,however,that one day before trial he discovered that pelham sold a large tract of land for approximately per acre and distributed to gemini.
a week after the trial,the bankruptcy court denied worley discharge under a.the court first held that worley made a false oath or account by understating the value of gemini on his schedule of assets.while it acknowledged that gemini illiquid interest in pelham might be worth less than the appraised value of the underlying timberland,the court concluded that in light of his capital contribution and pelham recent distribution to gemini worley estimate was so low as to be unrealistic.second,the court found that worley acted with the requisite fraudulent intent because the use of the capitalization rate method was inconsistent with his knowledge and extensive background in finance.id.
on september,the district court affirmed the denial of discharge.as a threshold matter,the district court rejected worley argument that a debtor undervaluation of a single asset is insufficient to warrant a denial.it then concluded that the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in finding that worley intentionally lowball ed his interest in gemini.even though worley claimed to rely on the advice of counsel,the bankruptcy court could plausibly have concluded that any such reliance was unreasonable given worley extensive investment history and knowledge of the capitalization rate method.
the primary benefit of filing for bankruptcy under chapter is that discharge offers the debtor a fresh start unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.farouki emirates bank int l,cir.this privilege,however,is reserved for the honest but unfortunate debtor.grogan garner.section a of the bankruptcy code provides that a bankruptcy court shall grant the debtor a discharge,but then describes twelve scenarios where a debtor is not entitled to such relief.a.

the statute invites the bankruptcy court to strike a balance between two competing objectives.at bottom,bankruptcy is an equitable remedy that elevates substantial justice over technical considerations.pepper litton.given the harsh consequences of a denial of discharge,the statute is ordinarily construed liberally in the debtor favor.smith jordan in re jordan,cir.the reasons for denying a discharge to a bankrupt must be real and substantial,not merely technical and conjectural.boroff tully in re tully,cir.in this vein,the provision although a civil statute with civil sanctions incorporates a classic criminal law element of mens rea that involves an assessment of whether the debtor made the false statement knowingly and fraudulently,as opposed to carelessly.a a.
at the same time,the statute reflects the equitable doctrine of unclean hands.the purpose of the false oath exception is to ensure that those who play fast and loose with their assets or with the reality of their affairs do not profit from the liberating shelter of the bankruptcy code.farouki,at.the implicit bargain for discharge is simple candid,good faith disclosure of the debtor financial affairs in return for the freedom of a clean slate.in re kestell,cir.the goal is to spare trustees and creditors from having to undertake investigations into the existence of every asset or costly audits of property whose value can not be fixed at a glance.after all,t he successful functioning of the bankruptcy act hinges upon both the bankrupt veracity and his willingness to make a full disclosure.in re mascolo,cir.
