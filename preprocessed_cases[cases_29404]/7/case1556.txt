this quotidian bankruptcy case presents a novel question can a iii bankruptcy judge enter a final judgment in a fraudulent conveyance action against a nonclaimant to the bankruptcy estate federal law empowers bankruptcy judges to do so,but we hold that the constitution forbids it.
the executive benefits insurance agency suffered an adverse final judgment in a fraudulent conveyance at the hands of a bankruptcy judge.but our decision today is no reprieve,because we also hold that the company consented to the adjudication of the fraudulent conveyance claim by a bankruptcy judge by failing to object until the case reached this court.thus,unencumbered by constitutional doubts,we review the entry of summary judgment de novo,and affirm.
nicholas paleveda and his wife,marjorie ewing,operated a welter of companies,including aegis retirement income services,aris and the bellingham insurance agency,bia.aris designed and administered pension plans,and bia sold insurance and annuity products that funded those plans.
bia and aris were closely related paleveda owned of aris and served as the ceo and sole director of bia until february,when ewing took over.ewing owned of bia and served as aris general manager.aris and bia shared an office and a phone number.because aris lacked sufficient assets to operate independently,it routed all of its income and expenses through bia,kept joint accounting records with bia,and declared its income on consolidated tax returns with bia.
by early,bia was insolvent.and though the company ceased operations on january,it did not stop acting entirely.two weeks after closing its doors,the company irrevocably assigned the insurance commissions from one of its largest clients,the american national insurance company,to peter pearce,a longtime bia and aris employee who had often acted as a conduit for insurance commissions between bia and its clients.
the day after bia stopped operating,paleveda used bia funds to incorporate the executive benefits insurance agency,ebia.in,of commission income earned between january and june was deposited into an account held jointly by aris and ebia.pearce deposited and ebia deposited the remainder.at the end of the year,all of the deposits were credited to ebia via an intercompany transfer.
in the meantime,bia had filed a voluntary chapter bankruptcy petition in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of washington.the trustee,peter arkison the appellee in this case filed a complaint against ebia and aris in the same court to recover the commissions deposited into the account,which the trustee alleged to be property of the estate.the complaint alleged eighteen causes of action,including federal and preferential and fraudulent transfer claims and a claim that ebia was a successor corporation of bia and therefore liable for its debts.
the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment in favor of the trustee,concluding that the deposits into the account were fraudulent conveyances of bia assets and that ebia was a mere successor of bia.the bankruptcy court entered a final judgment for 
ebia appealed to federal district court.the district court,holding that the commissions paid into the account were fraudulent transfers under both the bankruptcy code,and washington uniform fraudulent transfer act.the district court also affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment that ebia was liable for bia debts as a corporate successor.
ebia appealed.in a motion to dismiss submitted prior to oral argument,ebia objected for the first time to the bankruptcy judge entry of final judgment on the trustee fraudulent conveyance claims.styled as a motion to vacate the judgment for lack of jurisdiction,and relying on stern marshall,d,the motion argued that the bankruptcy judge was constitutionally proscribed from entering final judgment on the trustee claims it is to this vexing constitutional issue that we first turn.
bankruptcy judges are appointed for terms of years,a,and their salaries are subject to congressional diminution.id.a.hence,bankruptcy judges can not exercise t he judicial power of the united states,which is vested by the constitution in courts whose judges enjoy life tenure and salary protection.const.art.iii.
nonetheless,bankruptcy judges enjoy substantial statutory authority.although the district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over all cases under title,id.a,they may refer all of the cases within that broad jurisdiction to bankruptcy judges,id.a.what the bankruptcy court may do with a given referred proceeding depends on whether the proceeding is denominated a core or a proceeding.in all core proceedings arising under title,or arising in a case under title,a bankruptcy judge has the power to hear and determine the controversy and enter final orders,subject only to appellate review.id.b.in a proceeding that is otherwise related to a case under title,however,a bankruptcy judge may only submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.id.c.the entry of final judgment in proceedings is the sole province of article iii judges.
section b enumerates sixteen nonexclusive examples of core proceedings.among these are proceedings to determine,avoid,or recover fraudulent conveyances.id.b h.the bankruptcy judge hearing the trustee claim was thus empowered by statute to enter a final judgment.indeed,until quite recently,the exercise of that statutory power was routine and uncontroversial.see,jones schlosberg,wl,at affirming a bankruptcy court entry of judgment in a fraudulent conveyance action see also duck munn in re mankin,cir holding that both state and fraudulent conveyance actions are core proceedings.but following the supreme court decision in stern marshall,the view that such judgments are consistent with the constitution is no longer tenable.
to explain why this is so,we must begin somewhat earlier,with the supreme court epochal decision in northern pipeline construction marathon pipe line,d.the bankruptcy reform act of invented the modern bankruptcy judge,subject to the same conditions as today a year term and a mutable salary.id.at.northern pipeline was the supreme court first effort to demarcate the constitutional limits of these judges authority.
northern pipeline filed a chapter petition for reorganization in a bankruptcy court.id.at.it then filed a suit against marathon pipe line for a prepetition breach of contract and warranty.id.marathon sought to dismiss the suit on the grounds that the claim at issue could only be decided by an article iii judge.id.
a plurality of the court agreed that the assignment of northern pipeline claims for resolution by a bankruptcy judge violated art.iii of the constitution.id.at brennan,plurality opinion id.at rehnquist,concurring in judgment.the plurality admitted to only three exceptions to the rule of article iii adjudication territorial courts,id.at,military tribunals,id.at,and cases involving public as opposed to private rights,id.at outside of the narrowly drawn exceptions for territorial and military courts,the distinction between public and private rights was the crucial determinant of whether a dispute belonged in an article iii court our precedents clearly establish,the court explained,that only controversies in the former category may be removed from art.iii courts and delegated to legislative courts or administrative agencies for their determination.disputes,on the other hand,lie at the core of the historically recognized judicial power.id.at internal citations and footnote omitted.
while a majority of the court could not agree on the scope of the public rights exception,a majority did agree that the public rights exception could not justify the adjudication of northern pipeline claims by a iii officer.see id.at plurality opinion id.at to whatever extent different powers granted under the bankruptcy reform act might be sustained under the public rights doctrine i am satisfied that the adjudication of northern lawsuit can not be so sustained.rehnquist,concurring.
despite consigning the breach of contract and breach of warranty claims at issue to the category of private rights,the northern pipeline plurality hinted that some quantum of bankruptcy proceedings might fall within the public rights exception 
t he restructuring of relations,which is at the core of the federal bankruptcy power,must be distinguished from the adjudication of private rights,such as the right to recover contract damages that is at issue in this case.the former may well be a public right,but the latter obviously is not.
following the northern pipeline decision,congress amended the statutes governing bankruptcy jurisdiction and bankruptcy judges.see bankruptcy amendments and federal judgeship act of,stat.the act.the legislation enacted,among other reforms,the division of claims in bankruptcy cases into core and proceedings.this distinction was clearly inspired by the northern pipeline plurality dictum that certain proceedings at the core of the federal bankruptcy power may well be a public right.at see also in re mankin,at.
the cases following northern pipeline created substantial new ambiguity about the content and import of the public rights exception.in thomas,the court addressed a law that required pesticide manufacturers to submit research data to the environmental protection agency on a new product health,safety,and environmental effects.at.the law allowed subsequent registrants of similar products to rely on the proprietary data,but required them to compensate the first manufacturer for the data and to submit to binding arbitration of any disagreement over the fee amount.id.at.the northern pipeline plurality had defined public rights as matters arising between the government and persons subject to its authority in connection with the performance of the constitutional functions of the executive or legislative departments.at plurality opinion internal quotation marks omitted.the thomas court rejected that definition,opting for a more fluid position the public rights doctrine reflects simply a pragmatic understanding that when congress selects a method of resolving matters that could be conclusively determined by the executive and legislative branches,the danger of encroaching on the judicial powers is reduced.at quoting northern pipeline,at.under this newly pragmatic approach,the court was convinced that the right created by the statute is not a purely private right.id.rather,it bore many of the characteristics of a public right it serve d a public purpose as an integral part of a program safeguarding the public health and represent ed a pragmatic solution to the difficult problem of spreading the costs of generating adequate information regarding the safety,health,and environmental impact of a potentially dangerous product.id.at.
similarly,in commodity futures trading commission schor,d,the supreme court abjured formalistic and unbending rules for determining the extent to which a given congressional decision to authorize the adjudication of article iii business in a iii tribunal impermissibly threatens the institutional integrity of the judicial branch.instead,the court held that determining when a proceeding required an article iii court entailed balancing several factors with an eye to the practical effect that the congressional action will have on the constitutionally assigned role of the federal judiciary 
among the factors upon which we have focused are the extent to which the essential attributes of judicial power are reserved to article iii courts,and,conversely,the extent to which the iii forum exercises the range of jurisdiction and powers normally vested only in article iii courts,the origins and importance of the right to be adjudicated,and the concerns that drove congress to depart from the requirements of article iii.
id.citing thomas,at.this standard demanded a certain hierophancy on the part of the lower courts,which had to comb through the court inconsistent statements about the metes and bounds of article iii to apply it.but the standard did reflect a pragmatic accommodation of the realities of modern bankruptcy practice and the logistical and administrative difficulty of circumscribing the authority of the bankruptcy courts.
encouraged by the supreme court retreat from a formalist conception of the public rights exception and the limitations of article iii more generally,we concluded in that certain controversies at the core of the bankruptcy process implicated public rights.see in re mankin,at the public rights doctrine in large part simply constitutionalizes the historical understanding of what need and need not be committed to article iii officers for determination.while,as indicated above,it has always been understood that the property rights of creditors can not be committed exclusively to the political branches for determination,by the same token it has always been understood that bankruptcy proceedings need not be solely determined by article iii officers.we also held that the portion of proceedings that fit within the public rights exception was coextensive with that portion which had been designated as core by the act.id.
today,we acknowledge mankin demise it has been felled by two cases granfinanciera,nordberg,d,and stern marshall,which together point ineluctably to the conclusion that fraudulent conveyance claims,because they do not fall within the public rights exception,can not be adjudicated by iii judges.
in granfinanciera,the court considered whether a to a bankruptcy estate has a seventh amendment right to a jury trial when sued by the bankruptcy trustee under to recover allegedly fraudulent prepetition conveyances.at.because congress had designated fraudulent conveyance actions core proceedings,which iii judges could decide,the court defined the issue as whether the seventh amendment confers on petitioners a right to a jury trial in the face of congress decision to allow a iii tribunal to adjudicate the claims against them.id.at.and that required the court to again construe the public rights exception,because congress may only deny trials by jury in actions at law in cases where public rights are litigated.id.at.
was a fraudulent conveyance proceeding a matter of public right the court answer was,if not unequivocal,at least conclusive although the issue admits of some debate,a bankruptcy trustee right to recover a fraudulent conveyance under a seems to us more accurately characterized as a private rather than a public right as we have used those terms in our article iii decisions.id.at.the court echoed the northern pipeline plurality distinction between the restructuring of relations the core of the federal bankruptcy power and the adjudication of private rights.northern pipeline,at.fraudulent conveyance actions,the granfinanciera court explained,are obviously in the latter category,because they are quintessentially suits at common law that more nearly resemble contract claims brought by a bankrupt corporation to augment the bankruptcy estate than they do creditors hierarchically ordered claims to a pro rata share of the bankruptcy res.at.
granfinanciera clarified that fraudulent conveyance actions are not matters of public right,and that a noncreditor retains a seventh amendment right to a jury trial on a bankruptcy trustee fraudulent conveyance claim.some courts,however,seemed disinclined to deduce from those holdings that such litigants also retain a right to be heard by an article iii court.see,mcfarland leyh in re.petroleum,cir,withdrawn and replaced by cir turner davis,gillenwater lynch in re investment bankers,cir.but see leyh,at gower farmers home admin.in re davis,cir.
following stern,we can no longer resist granfinanciera logic.the issue in stern was whether a bankruptcy court could enter final judgment on a claim for tortious interference with a gift expectancy,which vickie marshall had filed as a compulsory counterclaim to pierce marshall proof of claim in her ongoing bankruptcy proceeding.see.at.the supreme court held that it could not,because vickie counterclaim can not be deemed a matter of public right that can be decided outside the judicial branch.id.at.in the course of a lengthy exegesis of its own precedents,the court explained that the counterclaim at issue was indistinguishable from the fraudulent conveyance claim in granfinanciera vickie counterclaim like the fraudulent conveyance claim at issue in granfinanciera does not fall within any of the varied formulations of the public rights exception in this court cases.id.at.this common character of the claims in granfinanciera and stern means that neither can be consigned to the bankruptcy courts without doing violence to the constitutional separation of powers 
what is plain here is that this case involves the most prototypical exercise of judicial power the entry of a final,binding judgment by a court with broad substantive jurisdiction,on a common law cause of action,when the action neither derives from nor depends upon any agency regulatory regime.if such an exercise of judicial power may nonetheless be taken from the article iii judiciary simply by deeming it part of some amorphous public right,then article iii would be transformed from the guardian of individual liberty and separation of powers we have long recognized into mere wishful thinking.
id.at.here,the trustee fraudulent conveyance claims are not matters of public right,and,ipso facto,can not be decided outside the article iii courts 
our conclusion is buttressed by the supreme court equation of litigants article iii rights with their seventh amendment jury trial rights in cases.granfinanciera itself drew the comparison explicitly 
indeed,our decisions point to the conclusion that,if a statutory cause of action is legal in nature,the question whether the seventh amendment permits congress to assign its adjudication to a tribunal that does not employ juries as factfinders requires the same answer as the question whether article iii allows congress to assign adjudication of that cause of action to a iii tribunal.for if a statutory cause of action,such as respondent right to recover a fraudulent conveyance under a,is not a public right for article iii purposes,then congress may not assign its adjudication to a specialized iii court lacking the essential attributes of the judicial power.
at.and the court in stern characterized cases involving seventh amendment jury trial rights as binding authority on the article iii issue.stern described granfinanciera a case about seventh amendment rights as deciding that congress could not constitutionally assign resolution of the fraudulent conveyance action to a iii court.at.
the stern court again transmuted a seventh amendment case into an article iii precedent in its analysis of langenkamp culp,d.langenkamp itself stated that the case present ed the question whether creditors who submit a claim against a bankruptcy estate and are then sued by the trustee in bankruptcy to recover allegedly preferential monetary transfers are entitled to jury trial under the seventh amendment.id.at.on the stern court reading,however,langenkamp also decided whether such a claim could be heard in bankruptcy at all we explained in langenkamp that a preferential transfer claim can be heard in bankruptcy when the allegedly favored creditor has filed a claim if,in contrast,the creditor has not filed a proof of claim,the trustee preference action does not become part of the process subject to resolution by the bankruptcy court.at alteration in original emphasis added quoting langenkamp,at.
stern fully equated bankruptcy litigants seventh amendment right to a jury trial in federal bankruptcy proceedings with their right to proceed before an article iii judge.hence,granfinanciera statement that u nless a legal cause of action involves public rights,congress may not deprive parties litigating over such a right of the seventh amendment guarantee to a jury trial is powerful evidence that congress also may not deprive such parties of their right to an article iii tribunal.at.
several amici object that the claim at issue in stern was a claim,and that the trustee fraudulent conveyance claim is indistinguishable from the preferential transfer claim at issue in katchen landy,d.katchen held that bankruptcy referees acting under the bankruptcy acts of and could exercise summary jurisdiction over a voidable preference claim brought by a bankruptcy trustee against a creditor who filed proof of claim in the bankruptcy proceeding.id.at.the stern court did distinguish katchen on the grounds that the trustee bringing the preference action was asserting a right of recovery created by federal bankruptcy law.at vickie claim,in contrast,is in no way derived from or dependent upon bankruptcy law it is a state tort action that exists without regard to any bankruptcy proceeding.and granfinanciera noted that actions to recover preferences are indistinguishable in all relevant respects from actions to recover fraudulent conveyances.at.there is an argument,then,that bankruptcy courts can render final judgment on a fraudulent conveyance claim whose source of law is the bankruptcy code.
that is wrong for two reasons.first,the dispositive distinction between the claims in stern and katchen was that in katchen,the trustee preference action would necessarily be resolved in the claims allowance process because the defendant had filed a proof of claim against the bankruptcy estate.stern.at.the preference action necessarily had to be resolved in the course of deciding whether to allow the defendant claim on the estate.by contrast,vickie marshall counterclaim in stern required the bankruptcy court to make several factual and legal determinations that were not disposed of in passing on objections to pierce proof of claim for defamation.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.there thus was never reason to believe that the process of ruling on pierce proof of claim would necessarily result in the resolution of vickie counterclaim.id.at.
second,a rule that classified any claim as a public right would render stern internally contradictory.assume that the stern court observation that vickie claim is in no way derived from or dependent upon bankruptcy law was the sole basis by which the court distinguished the counterclaim in that case from the preference action in katchen.if that were so,the stern court characterization of the holding in granfinanciera that congress could not constitutionally assign resolution of the fraudulent conveyance action to a iii court.at would be incoherent,because the claim in granfinanciera arose under of the bankruptcy code.see at.
granfinanciera involved a claim,and stern involved a claim.but stern held that both claims required an article iii court.thus,the only principled basis on which to distinguish katchen from both stern and granfinanciera is that katchen involved a claim against a creditor that necessarily had to be resolved in the course of the process,and stern and granfinanciera did not.
in this case,ebia is a noncreditor to the bia bankruptcy estate.hence,it is not subject to the bankruptcy court equitable jurisdiction the trustee can recover monies fraudulently conveyed to it only by initiating a legal action.langenkamp,at if a party does not submit a claim against the bankruptcy estate,however,the trustee can recover allegedly preferential transfers only by filing what amounts to a legal action to recover a monetary transfer.that legal action need not necessarily have been resolved in the course of allowing or disallowing the claims against the bia estate.for that reason,the claim belonged in an article iii court.see stern.at congress may not bypass article iii simply because a proceeding may have some bearing on a bankruptcy case the question is whether the action at issue stems from the bankruptcy itself or would necessarily be resolved in the claims allowance process.that the trustee asserted a fraudulent conveyance claim against ebia is of no moment to our conclusion that the claim is nonadjudicable by a bankruptcy judge.
taken together,granfinanciera and stern settle the question of whether bankruptcy courts have the general authority to enter final judgments on fraudulent conveyance claims asserted against noncreditors to the bankruptcy estate.they do not.we now turn to a subsidiary question whether bankruptcy judges may constitutionally hear such claims,and prepare recommendations for de novo review by the federal district courts.
federal law authorizes bankruptcy judges to hear and determine all cases under title and all core proceedings arising under title,or arising in a case under title.b.bankruptcy judges have the narrower power to hear a proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise related to a case under title,and to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court for the entry of final judgment.id.c.
our conclusion today creates a gap in this framework federal law classifies fraudulent conveyance proceedings as core proceedings,b h,but the constitution prohibits bankruptcy judges from entering a final judgment in such core proceedings.nowhere does the statute explicitly authorize bankruptcy judges to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a core proceeding c is expressly limited to proceedings.is the power to hear and determine capacious enough to include the power to submit proposed findings in a core proceeding or are bankruptcy courts impotent to address fraudulent conveyance proceedings,because they fall in the interstices of 
we have noted that congress enumerated the examples of core proceedings in b with a view toward expanding the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to its constitutional limit.mankin,at see also celotex edwards,d.with respect to any claim,then,the bankruptcy courts must be vested with as much adjudicatory power as the constitution will bear.in light of this statutory objective,the power to hear and determine a proceeding surely encompasses the power to hear the proceeding and submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court.section b empowers bankruptcy courts to hear and determine fraudulent conveyance claims in a manner consistent with the strictures of article iii and that includes the more modest power to submit findings of fact and recommendations of law to the district courts.
in sum,b provides bankruptcy courts the power to hear fraudulent conveyance cases and to submit reports and recommendations to the district courts.such cases remain in the core,and the b power to hear and determine them authorizes the bankruptcy courts to issue proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.only the power to enter final judgment is abrogated 
our conclusion is consistent with the stern court tacit approval of bankruptcy courts continuing to hear and make recommendations about statutory core proceedings in which entry of final judgment by a iii judge would be unconstitutional.the district court that heard stern before it reached the supreme court took the view that the bankruptcy court had lacked the constitutional authority to enter final judgment on vickie marshall counterclaim.see stern.at.for that reason,the district court treated the bankruptcy court judgment as proposed,rather than final,and reviewed the judgment de novo.id.alteration in original.nowhere did the stern court object to the district court judgment.instead,the court noted that pierce marshall ha d not argued that the bankruptcy courts are barred from hearing all counterclaims or proposing findings of fact and conclusions of law on those matters.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.immediately thereafter,the court explained,we do not think the removal of counterclaims such as vickie from core bankruptcy jurisdiction meaningfully changes the division of labor in the current statute we agree that the question presented here is a narrow one.id.stripping the bankruptcy courts of the power to entertain counterclaims in any capacity would have roiled the prevailing bankruptcy schema.the court was surely suggesting that bankruptcy courts were not barred from hearing all counterclaims or proposing findings of facts and conclusions of law on those matters.id.internal quotation marks omitted see also heller ehrman llp arnold porter,llp in re heller ehrman,noting the approbation by district courts and bankruptcy courts of the view that stern permits bankruptcy courts to submit reports and recommendations in proceedings even when the entry of final judgment is unconstitutional.
for these reasons,we conclude that bankruptcy courts have statutory authority to hear and enter proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in a fraudulent conveyance proceeding asserted by a bankruptcy trustee against a noncreditor,subject to de novo review by a federal district court.
several amici contend that even if defendants in fraudulent conveyance suits have a right to a hearing in an article iii court,that right is waivable.we agree,and hold that ebia waived its right to an article iii hearing.
the waivable nature of the allocation of adjudicative authority between bankruptcy courts and article iii courts is well established.prior to the bankruptcy act of,federal law distinguished between summary matters,which involved property in the actual or constructive possession of the court,and plenary matters,which did not.see northern pipeline,at.bankruptcy referees were vested with jurisdiction over summary matters,but plenary suits could only be tried by an article iii judge.but the right to an article iii judge in plenary proceedings could be waived by the litigants.see macdonald plymouth county trust.
following the genesis of the modern bankruptcy system,the supreme court clarified that article iii,guarantee of an independent and impartial adjudication by the federal judiciary of matters within the judicial power of the united states serves to protect primarily personal,rather than structural,interests.schor,at stern further made clear that does not implicate questions of subject matter jurisdiction.at.accordingly,as a personal right,article iii guarantee of an impartial and independent federal adjudication is subject to waiver.schor,at see also daniels head assocs.william mercer,in re daniels head assocs,cir.and in fact,c expressly provides that bankruptcy courts may enter final judgments in proceedings with the consent of all the parties to the proceeding.c.
if consent permits a iii judge to decide finally a proceeding,then it surely permits the same judge to decide a core proceeding in which he would,absent consent,be disentitled to enter final judgment.the only question,then,is whether ebia did in fact consent to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction.
we have previously held that a bankruptcy litigant impliedly consents to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction when he fails to timely object.in in re daniels head,at,we held that appellant failure to object to the bankruptcy court jurisdiction constitutes consent to that jurisdiction.similarly,in mann alexander dawson in re mann,cir,we held that a debtor decision to file an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court,and his failure to object to the court jurisdiction prior to the time it rendered judgment against him,meant that he consented to the court jurisdiction.id.
this case,of course,is somewhat different,because the trustee,not ebia,initiated the adversary proceeding.but ebia conduct bore considerable indicia of consent.ebia initially demanded a jury trial,invoking its rights under granfinanciera,which the district court treated as a motion to withdraw the reference.see defs.answer at,in re bellingham ins.agency,ecf mot.to withdraw the reference,arkison exec.benefits,cv,ecf.but ebia elected not to pursue a hearing in an article iii court.instead,ebia petitioned the district court to stay its consideration of the motion to withdraw the reference to give the bankruptcy court time to adjudicate the trustee motion for summary judgment.see order,arkison exec.benefits,cv,ecf.in other words,ebia did not simply fail to object to the bankruptcy judge authority to enter final judgment in the fraudulent conveyance action it affirmatively assented to suspend its demand for a jury trial in district court to give the bankruptcy judge an opportunity to adjudicate the claim.
a month later,the bankruptcy court entered summary judgment in arkison favor.ebia abandoned its motion to withdraw the reference,and the district court dismissed the action.see order,arkison exec.benefits,cv.july,ecf.ebia then separately appealed the bankruptcy court judgment in the d
