rebecca mierkowski and dennis mierkowski filed a chapter petition under the bankruptcy code.in their plan,the mierkowskis proposed to bifurcate ford motor credit company claim.ford credit objected to the plan,and the bankruptcy court overruled the objection.ford credit appeals.having jurisdiction under d,this court reverses and remands.
in august,the mierkowskis purchased a new vehicle for the price of.the mierkowskis and the dealer agreed to a allowance of,but was still owed on the vehicle.the difference between the amount still owed on a vehicle and its value is termed negative equity.the negative equity in the,was included in the amount financed which equaled the total sale price.the transaction was memorialized by a missouri simple interest vehicle retail installment contract,which provided for percent interest and monthly payments.the dealer assigned the contract to ford credit.
the mierkowskis filed for chapter relief days after purchasing the vehicle.in their plan,the mierkowskis proposed to bifurcate ford credit claim into two components a secured component equal to the value of the new vehicle,and an unsecured claim for the balance.ford credit objected,arguing its claim could not be bifurcated due to the hanging paragraph of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa the bankruptcy court ruled that the debt attributable to the price of the new vehicle was secured,but the debt attributable to the negative equity in the was unsecured.
generally,a chapter debtor may retain a vehicle and modify the rights of a secured creditor that has a security interest pmsi in the vehicle,by bifurcating the creditor claim into secured and unsecured parts based on the vehicle value.see a,a.the creditor has a secured claim to the extent of the value of the vehicle,and an unsecured claim for the remainder of the debt.see a.
under bapcpa,the hanging paragraph prohibits bifurcation under if the creditor has a security interest securing the debt that is the subject of the claim,the debt was incurred within the days preceding the filing of the petition,and the collateral is a motor vehicle for the debtor personal use.at issue is whether ford credit has a pmsi securing its entire claim,including the amount financed to pay off the negative equity in the vehicle.this question of law is subject to de novo review.see drewes vote in re vote,cir.
pmsi is not defined in the bankruptcy code.in bapcpa,congress incorporated the definition of pmsi from article of the uniform commercial code.see in re price,cir reiber gmac,llc in re peaslee,cir.article states 
a in this section 
collateral means goods or software that secures a obligation incurred with respect to that collateral and 
obligation means an obligation of an obligor incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral or for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of the collateral if the value is in fact so used.
b a security interest in goods is a security interest 
to the extent that the goods are collateral with respect to that security interest 
the official comment to article states 
as used in subsection a,the definition of obligation,the price of collateral or the value given to enable includes obligations for expenses incurred in connection with acquiring rights in the collateral,sales taxes,duties,finance charges,interest,freight charges,costs of storage in transit,dumurrage,administrative charges,expenses of collection and enforcement,attorney fees,and other similar obligations.
the concept of security interest requires a close nexus between the acquisition of collateral and the secured obligation 
ann.stat,official comment emphasis added.see in re nocita,banc when construing uniform and model acts enacted by the general assembly,it is assumed the legislature enacted them with the intention of adopting the accompanying interpretations.
comment lists a wide range of obligations that can be part of a vehicle price,indicating that price should be broadly interpreted.the mierkowskis obligation is sufficiently similar to those listed in comment,so as to be within the other similar obligations part of the definition of price.see reiber gmac,llc in re peaslee,wl,at june.since the parties here agreed to include the negative equity as part of the total sale price of the new vehicle,the negative equity was an integral part of and inextricably intertwined with the sales transaction.graupner nuvell credit in re graupner,cir.the financing of the and the purchase were a package deal.id.therefore,there was a close nexus between the acquisition of the new vehicle and the financing.see price,at.
the amount financed to pay off the negative equity in the is part of the price of the new car,so it is a obligation.see.a.the new car is collateral securing the obligation.see a.thus,ford credit has a pmsi securing the financing.see b.
this interpretation is consistent with the missouri motor vehicle time sales act mvtsa,which regulates installment sales of motor vehicles.under missouri law,courts take into consideration statutes involving similar or related subject matter to shed light upon the meaning of the statute at issue.lane lensmeyer,banc.article and mvtsa both relate to the installment financing of motor vehicles,and should be read in pari materia.
mvtsa defines cash sale price as the price at which the vehicle would have been sold for cash,instead of for installment payments.it further defines time sale price as the price plus insurance and other benefits,official fees,and interest.other benefits includes negative equity payments,making part of the price.see.price under article includes interest,and thus,is not the price.see.ann.stat,official comment.therefore,interpreting price in article to include negative equity is consistent with the definition of time sale price in mvtsa.
this court has considered the many opinions by bankruptcy courts addressing this issue.this court strives to maintain uniformity in the law among the circuits,wherever reasoned analysis will allow.owens miller in re miller,cir.the tenth,fourth,and eleventh circuits the only three to resolve this issue each determined that a creditor had a pmsi securing financing for a vehicle.see ford ford motor credit in re ford,cir price,at graupner,at.this court holds that ford credit has a pmsi securing its entire claim.
the judgment of the bankruptcy court is reversed,and the case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
because i conclude negative equity is not all or part of the price of a new vehicle or value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of a new vehicle,i respectfully dissent.accordingly,i would hold ford motor credit company advance of credit in connection with the purchase of the mierkowskis motor vehicle was not entirely protected from cramdown by the hanging paragraph in a.
this case involves the interpretation and application of the hanging paragraph of a,which was added to the bankruptcy code code by the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcp.see,stat.the issue before the court is whether the provision in the hanging paragraph protects the negative equity in a vehicle against cramdown.i would hold it does not.
bankruptcy rehabilitation under chapter commonly involves the adjustment of obligations owed to creditors holding liens on the bankruptcy debtor property.generally,lien creditors are deemed to hold a secured claim to the extent of the present value of the property the lien encumbers,while the excess,if any,is treated as a separate and unsecured claim.see a.
as the majority correctly notes,congress amended a when it passed the bapcpa and added the hanging paragraph,which provides 
for purposes of paragraph,section cramdown shall not apply to a claim described in that paragraph if the creditor has a purchase money security interest securing the debt that is the subject of the claim,the debt was incurred within the preceding the date of the filing of the petition,and the collateral for that debt consists of a motor vehicle as defined in section of title acquired for the personal use of the debtor,or if collatera
