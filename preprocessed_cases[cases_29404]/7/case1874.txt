after renting a boat from aramark leisure services aramark,charles kendrick was involved in a boating accident.faced with potential damage claims from kendrick and his,aramark brought a special proceeding in federal district court under the limitation of vessel owner liability act,et as part of that proceeding,kendrick filed a claim against aramark,and kendrick also brought a claim against aramark insurer,albany insurance company albany.albany responded by arguing that kendrick personal liability insurance with shelby insurance company shelby provided kendrick with primary coverage,and that,pursuant to an escape clause in the albany policy,albany was not required to extend coverage to kendrick.while the litigation was ongoing,shelby became insolvent,and the utah property and casualty insurance guaranty association upciga became potentially responsible for shelby obligations.in a letter,the upciga stated that,under the exhaustion provision in utah code ann.a,albany was required to provide primary coverage to kendrick.the district court agreed with the upciga,and albany has appealed.we have jurisdiction under and reverse and remand for further proceedings.
on september,traci sevy and charles kendrick were vacationing together at lake powell,in southern utah.kendrick rented a mirage runabout boat from aramark leisure services at the bullfrog marina.at the time of the rental,aramark had an insurance policy with albany insurance company.at some point during the rental period,and while kendrick was operating the boat,it collided with a canyon wall or cliff the boat was severely damaged,and sevy sustained serious personal injuries and lost various items of personal property.a few months later,sevy filed a lawsuit in utah state court,alleging claims against kendrick for negligence and conversion.
aramark brought a special proceeding under the limitation of vessel owner liability act,et,in the united states district court for the district of arizona,asking for exoneration from,or limitation of,any liability resulting from the boating accident.aramark named sevy and kendrick as potential claimants.the case was then transferred to the united states district court for the district of utah,where sevy and kendrick each filed a notice of claim.
kendrick also filed a complaint against albany,alleging that,b y virtue of his rental and use of the runabout,kendrick was also insured under the albany policy with respect to sevy allegation in utah state court that he was negligent.kendrick,roa,vol.i,at.kendrick explained that he had liability coverage under a homeowner insurance policy with shelby insurance company,and that,a s a result of the existence of kendrick homeowners policy with shelby,albany has denied coverage and has refused to defend kendrick in connection with the subject accident.id.at.kendrick asked the court for a declaratory judgment that the albany policy constitutes primary coverage in connection with the claims asserted by sevy against kendrick.id.at.
albany filed an answer,admitting that it had denied coverage and asserting a host of affirmative defenses.both kendrick and albany filed motions for summary judgment.at issue was the effect of two contractual provisions.the first provision,in albany insurance contract with aramark,provided 
special conditions 
where the assured is,irrespective of the section,covered or protected against any loss or claim which would otherwise have been paid by this company,under this section there shall be no contribution or participation by this company on the basis of excess,contributing,deficiency,concurrent,or double insurance or otherwise.
insurance in excess of the limits of liability stipulated herein permitted.
albany contract,roa,vol.i,at.albany argued that,because kendrick was covered under his policy with shelby,this escape clause applied,and the albany policy did not cover kendrick.the second provision at issue,in shelby insurance contract with kendrick,provided 
other liability.this insurance is excess over other valid and collectible insurance except insurance written specifically to cover as excess over the limits of liability that apply in this policy.
shelby contract,roa,vol.i,at.kendrick argued that,under this excess clause,the escape clause in the albany policy did not apply,and albany was kendrick primary insurer.both parties essentially conceded that,in the absence of the shelby policy,albany would have provided primary coverage to kendrick,and in the absence of the albany policy,shelby would have provided primary coverage to kendrick.
after the parties filed their for summary judgment,but before the district court held a hearing,shelby became insolvent.on august,a texas state court issued an order placing shelby into liquidation.kendrick filed a motion to dismiss or stay the action,arguing that the texas state court liquidation order prevented the case from going forward.albany opposed the motion,arguing,in part,that shelby was not a party to the case.kendrick replied that,although shelby was not named as a party,it had been prosecuting the action on kendrick behalf.
at a hearing on september,the district court indicated that,if there were no receivership issue,i quite inclined to say that the albany clause is going to prevail probably,and that shelby would be the primary insurer.hearing,supp.roa,at citing utah power light co fed.ins,cir.the district court explained,however,that everything change d once shelby entered liquidation proceedings.id.at.ultimately,the district court declined to rule on the for summary judgment,and instead allowed the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the effect of shelby insolvency 
the main source of controversy resulting from shelby insolvency was the role of the utah property and casualty insurance guaranty association in particular,the parties disputed the effect of the following statutory provision 
any person who has a claim against an insurer,whether or not the insurer is a member insurer,under any provision in an insurance policy,other than a policy of an insolvent insurer that is also a covered claim,is required to first exhaust that person right under that person policy.
utah code ann.a.in a letter dated september,the upciga stated its position that,under a,the upciga is secondary to any other insurance coverage,and albany insurance is primary.upciga letter,doc.attachment.kendrick adopted the upciga position in his supplemental brief,arguing that t he obvious purpose of this provision is to assure that other sources of insurance are all exhausted before the association is asked to cover a claim.kendrick supp,supp.roa,at.albany countered by contending that for the same reasons that shelby is primarily liable for coverage of kendrick claim,the upciga is also liable thereon.albany supp,supp.roa,at.
at a subsequent hearing,the district court adopted the position of the upciga and kendrick.the district court explained that the statute is quite clear that the albany policy must be exhausted,and that the upciga is a fund of last resort,a guarantor of last resort.hearing,supp.roa,at.moreover,while the upciga to some degree steps into shelby shoes,it does not absolve the fact that albany is the insured that must pay first.id.at.the district court later entered a written order incorporating its ruling,which is now appealed.
federal jurisdiction 
although neither party contests jurisdiction,neither party provides any analysis of the even the correct citation to the statutory provision granting federal jurisdiction over admiralty disputes.before we address the merits of the case,therefore,we must first determine whether the federal district court,and likewise this court,has jurisdiction over the dispute between kendrick and albany.healthy city sch.dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d w e are obliged to inquire sua sponte whenever a doubt arises as to the existence of federal jurisdiction.
although the dispute between kendrick and albany might not,by itself,fall within our jurisdiction we have jurisdiction over the claim pursuant to and.section provides the federal courts with jurisdiction over admiralty claims 
the district courts shall have original jurisdiction,exclusive of the courts of the states,of 
any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction,saving to suitors in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.
in addition,clarifies the extent of our admiralty jurisdiction in cases of damage or injury 
a in admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the united states extends to and includes cases of injury or damage,to person or property,caused by a vessel on navigable waters,even though the injury or damage is done or consummated on land.
pursuant to and,the district court had federal jurisdiction over aramark original complaint under the limitation of vessel owner liability act,et.in jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d,the supreme court addressed the extent of federal admiralty jurisdiction under,where a party had filed an action seeking protection under the limitation of vessel owner liability act the court began by explaining 
a federal court authority to hear cases in admiralty flows initially from the constitution,which extend s federal judicial power to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction,art.iii.congress has embodied that power in a statute giving federal district courts original jurisdiction of a ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.
id.at.alterations in original.the court then provided the test for determining whether a party may invoke federal admiralty jurisdiction 
a party seeking to invoke federal admiralty jurisdiction pursuant to over a tort claim must satisfy conditions both of location and of connection with maritime activity.a court applying the location test must determine whether the tort occurred on navigable water or whether injury suffered on land was caused by a vessel on navigable water.the connection test raises two issues.a court,first,must assess the general features of the type of incident involved,to determine whether the incident has a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce.second,a court must determine whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.

in its complaint,aramark alleged that kendrick and sevy were engaged in recreational boating on the navigable waters of lake powell,at bullfrog bay,when they collided with a canyon wall or cliff.aramark,roa,vol.i,at.consequently,aramark claim readily satisfied grubart location test.see grubart,at.aramark claim also satisfied the first of the maritime connection enquiries,because the boating collision was an incident of a sort with the potential to disrupt maritime commerce.id.at.see also id.at.noting that a fire on a vessel docked at a marina on navigable waters had satisfied this test in sisson ruby,d,and holding that the damag e to a structure beneath the riverbed in grubart also satisfied the test,because it could lead to a disruption in the water course itself and could lead to restrictions on the navigational use of the waterway during required repairs.finally,aramark complaint satisfied the second of the maritime connection enquiries whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity because it involved n avigation of boats in navigable waters,which clearly falls within the substantial relationship.id.at.
with jurisdiction over aramark original claim,the district court appropriately exercised its supplemental jurisdiction,pursuant to,over the insurance dispute between kendrick and albany.section provides 
a except as provided in subsections b and c or as expressly provided otherwise by federal statute,in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction,the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.
a.under this provision,a federal court may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over related claims when the court has admiralty jurisdiction over the original claim.see loeber bay tankers,cir roco carriers,nurnberg express,cir moeller mulvey,ins.of am.cape charles,grubart,at.the parties do not dispute the seventh circuit conclusion that jurisdiction as to counts ii and iii indemnity and contribution hinges on jurisdiction over the count i claim.citing other citations omitted.the insurance dispute between kendrick and albany falls squarely within the terms of,which,when coupled with and a,provided federal jurisdiction here.
kendrick coverage under the albany insurance policy 
it is a close question whether albany must provide primary insurance coverage to kendrick now that shelby is insolvent.as described above,shelby policy stated 
other liability.this insurance is excess over other valid and collectible insurance except insurance written specifically to cover as excess over the limits of liability that apply in this policy.
shelby contract,roa,vol.i,at.albany policy stated 
special conditions 
where the assured is,irrespective of the section,covered or protected against any loss or claim which would otherwise have been paid by this company,under this section there shall be no contribution or participation by this company on the basis of excess,contributing,deficiency,concurrent,or double insurance or otherwise.
insurance in excess of the limits of liability stipulated herein permitted.
albany contract,roa,vol.i,at.under utah law 
insurance policies are construed using general contract principles.the interpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of law to be determined by the court and may be decided on summary judgment.if the policy language is clear and unambiguous,the court must construe it according to its plain and ordinary meaning.
utah power light fed.ins,cir citations omitted.utah courts follow this same course when construing competing other insurance clauses.id.at citations omitted further,t he utah courts do not simply categorize other insurance clauses as excess,escape,or clauses and apply presumptive rules that one type trumps another.rather,they give effect to the plain meaning of the clauses language.thus,the utah supreme court recognizes the general validity of clauses,because the plain language of these clauses generally prevails over the language of other types of clauses.more importantly,utah has interpreted the plain language of an clause to prevail over the plain language of an excess clause.although courts in other jurisdictions may have found good reason to disfavor escape and clauses,the utah supreme court has not followed their lead.
id.at citations omitted.
if shelby were not insolvent,then,under our decision in utah power light,at,our only relevant inquiry would be the plain meaning of the shelby and albany clauses language.for the shelby clause to trigger,and for the shelby policy to become excess insurance,rather than primary insurance,the shelby excess clause requires that other valid and collectible insurance be available to kendrick.shelby contract,roa,vol.i,at.the albany policy,which contains an escape clause,would not qualify as other valid and collectible insurance.see utah power light,at w hen the loss could be covered in full by a policy with an excess clause,other insurance provided by policies with either escape or clauses was not collectible insurance that would trigger the competing excess insurance clause.as a result,the albany policy would not trigger the competing excess insurance clause in the shelby policy,and shelby,with the untriggered excess clause,would be liable for the whole loss.id.also,the existence of the shelby policy would trigger the albany policy escape clause,resulting in no contribution or participation by albany as an insurer of kendrick.albany contract,roa,vol.i,at.the district court initial inclination that,in the absence of shelby insolvency,shelby would be the primary insurer,hearing,supp.
