in this adversary bankruptcy proceeding,the trustee of the bankruptcy estate of a payroll processing firm seeks a judgment against the united states for an amount of payroll tax payments the firm made on behalf of its to the internal revenue service.after a series of decisions by the united states bankruptcy court for the district of maryland and appeals to the district court and to this court,this appeal presents one issue whether the trustee in bankruptcy may reclaim as property of the debtor the approximately million transferred by the debtor to the irs during the days preceding the filing of the bankruptcy petition.we agree with the bankruptcy court and the district court that,as a matter of law,the debtor lacked an equitable interest in the funds paid over to the irs,and therefore we affirm the judgment.
a detailed description of the facts and procedural history of this case is provided in the opinion we issued the last time this case came before us.see in re firstpay,in re firstpay i,app x,cir per curiam.here,we provide only those facts and procedural history necessary to understand the issue presented in the instant appeal.
firstpay,firstpay or the debtor provided payroll processing services pursuant to a payroll processing agreement with each of its clients as well as tax reporting and depositing services to a number of its clients in accordance with a tax reporting services agreement services agreement.prior to each payroll date,firstpay would withdraw funds from the client checking account sufficient to cover the following amounts taxes for which the client was liable payment of the client employees wages and fees owed to firstpay for its services.firstpay deposited the withdrawn funds into a firstpay account that the parties call the tax account.the services agreement provided that firstpay would hold the tax funds until taxes were due and then remit payments to taxing authorities.
although firstpay transferred a portion of the funds in the tax account to taxing authorities toward satisfying the obligations of some of its clients,not all of the funds in the tax account were ultimately used for this purpose.firstpay transferred some of the funds from the tax account to an operating account used to pay its own business expenses,and another portion of the funds were transferred to an exchange and reimbursement account that was used for lavish personal expenditures by firstpay principals.the parties are unaware of how firstpay determined what portions of the funds in the tax account would be remitted to taxing authorities and what portions would be transferred to the operating account or to the exchange and reimbursement account.
firstpay fraudulent scheme continued without detection for several years,until the death of one of its principals in.as a result of firstpay misappropriation of its clients funds,a substantial portion of its clients tax obligations went unpaid and now remain due and owing.
creditors filed an involuntary chapter bankruptcy petition against firstpay in the bankruptcy court for the district of maryland in may.appellant michael wolff was appointed trustee of the bankruptcy estate.
in,the trustee filed a complaint against the united states in the bankruptcy court seeking a declaratory judgment that the government had no claim for taxes or penalties against firstpay clients whose payroll taxes were paid to firstpay but not ultimately remitted to the irs count i avoidance of firstpay payments of its clients payroll taxes to the irs as preferences under and as fraudulent conveyances under u.and maryland law counts ii through viii and turnover of avoided transfers under count ix.the bankruptcy court granted the government motion for summary judgment as to the trustee declaratory judgment and preference claims and,after a trial,entered judgment in favor of the government on the fraudulent conveyance claims.
on appeal,the district court reversed as to the claim to avoid as preferences under b a the payments firstpay made to the irs within days prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.it is undisputed that,during that day period,the irs received from firstpay,on behalf of its clients,a total of in payroll tax payments,including in taxes withheld from clients employees wages,taxes and in taxes owed by the client,taxes.the district court ruling was based in part on its determination that the transfer of funds from the debtor to the irs was a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property under b.
on remand,the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion for summary judgment on the b a preference claim count ii and the related turnover claim count ix,entered judgment against the government in the amount of million plus interest,and denied the government subsequent motion to alter or amend the judgment.the government appealed,and the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court in a summary order.
on appeal to this court,we determined that the district court erred in saddling the government with a concession that firstpay transfer of tax funds to the irs on behalf of its clients was a transfer of firstpay own interest in property.in re firstpay i,app x at.we remanded the matter with an instruction that the bankruptcy court reconsider the remaining preference claim without regard to any such concession.id.at.we also instructed the bankruptcy court to determine the merits of the government ordinary course of business defense under c,which the court had refused to consider as untimely.id.at.
the parties stipulated to a set of facts for the bankruptcy court to consider on remand and filed new summary judgment motions.the bankruptcy court determined that the funds transferred by firstpay to the irs were not firstpay property and therefore not preferences but,if the payments were preferences,they would not be protected from avoidance under the ordinary course of business exception.in re firstpay,in re firstpay ii,bk pm,ap pm,wl.the court therefore granted summary judgment in favor of the government,and the trustee appealed.after the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court,the trustee timely filed a notice of appeal to this court.
summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact,and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.in re french,cir citing anderson liberty lobby,see also.c fed.this court reviews de novo a bankruptcy court award of summary judgment and a district court affirmance thereof.hager gibson,cir citing in re ballard,cir.
in furtherance of the policy against preferential treatment of creditors embodied by the bankruptcy code,a trustee in bankruptcy is permitted to avoid and recover certain payments made by the insolvent debtor preferentially for the benefit of some creditors prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition.see b,a.these avoidable preferences include certain transfers made on or within days before the date of the filing of the petition.id.b a.however,the trustee can only avoid a transfer of an interest of the debtor in property,id.b,as only the debtor property would have been available for distribution among creditors in the absence of the transfer.see begier.the sole issue in this appeal is whether the nearly million firstpay transferred to the irs during the days preceding the bankruptcy filing constituted an interest of the debtor in property under b.
in begier,the supreme court looked to the scope of the postpetition property of the estate as defined in d for guidance in determining the scope of the debtor prepetition property under b.see at.property in which the debtor holds only legal title and not an equitable interest is property of the debtor only to the extent of the debtor legal title,but not to the extent of any equitable interest in such property that the debtor does not hold.id.at quoting d.t he debtor does not own an equitable interest in property he holds in trust for another,and therefore any such trust property is not the debtor for purposes of b.id.
because property interests are generally created and defined by state law,we look to state law to determine the nature of a debtor interest in the property at issue.butner united states.a bsent a countervailing federal interest,state law determines whether a given property falls within the federal framework of a bankruptcy estate.am.bankers ins.of maness,cir.given that the agreements that govern the relationships between firstpay and its clients provide that their terms are to be construed in accordance with maryland law,the parties agree that maryland law applies here.see glass,penney,i t is generally accepted that the parties to a contract may agree as to the law which will govern their transaction.quoting kronovet lipchin.
we hold that,under maryland law,firstpay held the million in tax funds in an express trust and therefore lacked the equitable interest in the property necessary for its transfers to be avoidable under b accordingly,we affirm the judgment 
under maryland law,a trust exists where the legal title to property is held by one or more persons,under an equitable obligation to convey,apply,or deal with such property for the benefit of other persons.from the heart church ministries,african methodist episcopal zion church,md citing milholland whalen.the existence of a trust must be established by clear and convincing evidence.kelley kelley.
express trusts are created by the direct and willful acts of the parties,by some writing,or deed,or words expressly evidencing the intention to create a trust.from the heart church ministries,at citing levin sec.fin.ins.corp.the maryland court of appeals has outlined three elements of a valid,express trust f irst,a definite within the disposition of the settlor second,a lawful,definite object to which the is to be devoted and third,clear and unequivocal words or acts devoting the to the object of the trust.levin,at quoting sieling sieling,internal quotation marks omitted.
all of the elements of a valid,express trust are satisfied in this case.the funds at issue comprise a definite subject matter within the disposition of the firstpay client,transferred to firstpay,and devoted to the lawful and definite object of paying the client tax obligations by the clear and unequivocal terms of the agreements between firstpay and the client.the services agreement states that c lient checking account shall be debited for the aggregate total of all taxes and unemployment and credited to firstpay,a minimum of three days prior to payroll date and that t hese tax funds will be held by firstpay,until such taxes are due,and will be submitted by firstpay,in accordance with local,state and federal regulations.in short,firstpay was but an intermediary,and there was no intention that it would keep the funds or at any point use them for its own purposes or benefit.see in re dameron,cir holding that debtor held funds subject to express trust under virginia law where contractual language and circumstances under which debtor received funds showed that parties intended debtor to act merely as an intermediary without any expectation that debtor would keep the funds or develop any equitable interest in the funds.
although the agreements here do not use the term trust,w hether or not a trust has been created in any given case is,in the last analysis,a question of intention,and therefore,n o particular words are necessary to create a trust.kozlowska napierkowski,see also restatement third of trusts cmt.b a trust may be created without the settlor use of words such as trust or trustee.the language of the services agreement is sufficient to evidence a clear intent by the parties that firstpay would be obligated to handle the tax funds solely for the benefit of its clients and of the taxing authorities in satisfaction of the clients tax obligations.thus,firstpay and each of its clients expressly created a trust,and the tax funds received and transferred by firstpay pursuant to its obligations under the services agreement were trust property in which firstpay held no equitable interest.
the trustee argument that,upon transfer to firstpay,the tax funds became a debt firstpay owed to its clients and not trust property,is without merit.
the trustee correctly asserts that a debt is not a trust.dunlop sand gravel hospelhorn,quoting restatement first of trusts see also restatement third of trusts k.when one person pays money to another,it depends upon the manifested intention of the parties whether a trust or a debt is created.levin,at.
if the intention is that the money shall be kept or used as a separate fund for the benefit of the payor or a third person,a trust is created.if the intention is that the person receiving the money shall have the unrestricted use thereof,being liable to pay a similar amount whether with or without interest to the payor or to a third person,a debt is created.
dunlop sand,at quoting restatement first of trusts see also restatement third of trusts cmt.where the language of the parties does not clearly show their intention,all the circumstances must be considered in order to determine whether a trust or a debt was intended.levin,at.
the terms of the agreements between firstpay and its clients clearly show that the parties did not intend for the amount of the tax funds transferred to firstpay to be a debt.these agreements do not permit firstpay unrestricted use of the tax funds it received from its clients and in fact leave firstpay with no discretion as to how it could handle the funds.firstpay freedom to use the funds is expressly limited to holding them until the clients taxes are due and then remitting them to the taxing authorities.the parties to these agreements intended the tax funds to be used separately from other monies the clients transferred to firstpay and used for the separate and limited purpose of satisfying the clients tax obligations.it is clear that a trust was intended,and not a debt.
the trustee points to a stipulation the parties entered into that each time firstpay withdrew contractually authorized funds from a client account,firstpay became indebted to the client for the amount of tax funds included in that withdrawal but not for the fees firstpay was to retain for its services.in this regard,the parties have stipulated to what is essentially a legal conclusion,one that we can not accept.see h r block,raskin,cir a court is not required to accept what in effect is a stipulation on a question of law.citation omitted.it is immaterial whether the parties knew the precise legal characteristics of a trust relationship and whether they knew that their intended relationship is called a trust under the law.restatement third of trusts cmt.a.the terms of firstpay unambiguous agreements,which we interpret as a matter of law,see gresham lumbermen mut.cas,cir,clearly establish that the tax funds were intended to be held by firstpay only for payment of the clients taxes and therefore constituted trust property.
the trustee further argues that the funds firstpay ultimately transferred to the irs can not be deemed trust property because they had been commingled with other funds and therefore can not be effectively identified or traced.the trustee points out that the money firstpay obtained from each client general operating account was first commingled in the client account with funds intended and used for other purposes by the client and after firstpay received the money,those funds were again commingled in firstpay tax account with funds intended for payment of the client and other clients employees wages,payment of firstpay for its payroll services,and payment of other clients taxes.we are not persuaded that the commingling of funds that occurred in this case defeated creation of a trust.
the trustee relies on the maryland court of appeals decision in levin sec.fin.ins.levin involved claims by two savings and loan associations to funds they had transferred to security financial insurance security financial,an insurance company that subsequently became insolvent.id.at.agreements between the parties provided that the associations would make payments into a trust fund held by security financial as trustee in order to better indemnify the association savings account shareholders and to also increase the liquidity of said association and to set up a reserve fund for conti
