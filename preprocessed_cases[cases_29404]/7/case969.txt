harry herbert wagner,wagner,a developer in northern ohio,appeals his conviction for fraudulently concealing property from a bankruptcy trustee in violation of and filing a false document in a bankruptcy proceeding in violation of.wagner was indicted in november after allegedly making false statements to the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of ohio during a chapter conversion hearing and changing the locks on several properties belonging to his estate,which the trustee was attempting to sell.a jury convicted wagner in april,and the united states district court for the northern district of ohio sentenced wagner to six months imprisonment.on appeal,wagner challenges his conviction,arguing that he did not conceal property by changing the locks and that he did not commit bankruptcy fraud because any falsifications he may have made did not deceive the bankruptcy court.additionally,wagner asserts that he was deprived of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel and that the district court erred by not permitting expert evidence regarding wagner alleged hearing problems.because there is no merit to wagner various arguments,we affirm wagner conviction.
factual history and procedure 
the factual and procedural history of wagner appeal can be divided into three segments the events leading up to and the declaration of chapter bankruptcy the bankruptcy court proceedings and wagner indictment,trial,and conviction.
wagner declaration of bankruptcy and subsequent actions 
in the,wagner developed edgewood estates,a acre subdivision in lima,ohio containing rental units.wagner also built six smart houses,which were outfitted with electronic devices that automated various household chores.at some point after,wagner began to have difficulty with his multiple mortgage obligations,and in,wagner ceased paying several of his mortgagees.these lenders commenced foreclosure proceedings against most of wagner properties.at one point,wagner was juggling over separate foreclosure proceedings.
seeking a way to forestall the foreclosures,wagner contemplated declaring bankruptcy.wagner obtained a bankruptcy kit and filed a pro se chapter bankruptcy petition on april,which automatically stayed the foreclosure proceedings.shortly after the filing of the chapter petition,the united states trustee office contacted wagner.because debtors serve as their own trustees in chapter proceedings,it is standard practice for the trustee office to hold an informal meeting with the debtor to advise the debtor about the timely filing of financial reports,the fiduciary duties incumbent upon the debtor,and the prohibition against selling or further encumbering disputed assets without prior approval.the trustee office asked wagner to attend such a meeting.in a bizarre letter,wagner refused to conference with the trustee office,asking,are you one of the good old boys and are you bonded and stating,if you persist on this meeting,that i am not going to attend,i will put this in a letter that i am writing to the bankruptcy judge that you are not following the due process of law in bankruptcy.joint appendix at letter from wagner.in several instances during the early part of may,wagner repeatedly refused to meet with the trustee office and failed to produce financial documents required by the court.as a result,on may,the trustee office filed a motion to convert wagner chapter bankruptcy petition to a chapter petition,under which wagner would no longer serve as his own trustee.the bankruptcy court scheduled a hearing to consider this motion on june.
during the interlude,wagner visited a branch office of the united states small business administration sba in columbus,ohio on may.wagner requested a loan application,but the sba officials informed wagner that the sba does not distribute loan applications because the sba does not make direct loans.indeed,the sba works primarily with institutional lenders,such as banks,to guarantee loans,and the application for sba assistance is usually completed by the financial institution making the loan.one of the sba officials attempting to assist wagner suggested that wagner explore the sba website,which fully described the sba program and its role in making loans.wagner responded that he understood that the sba did not make direct loans and that he had already looked at the website,but he persisted in asking for the loan forms,and eventually the sba officials relented.
on friday,may,and with neither authorization for a loan from the sba nor approval from the trustee office to further encumber property belonging to his estate,wagner filed a mortgage against several of his properties.wagner recorded with the allen county recorder office a mortgage which listed close to properties and included wagner and his wife as mortgagors.wagner attached a loan note to the mortgage,which claimed that the sba had granted wagner a million loan.
the following tuesday monday was memorial day,wagner returned to the recorder office and asked for the return of the mortgage.the recorder informed wagner that the mortgage could not be rescinded unless the mortgagee authorized a release,which sba had not done,given that it was not yet aware of the purported loan existence.wagner then recorded a second mortgage,which listed only himself as the mortgagor.on may,several days after publicly recording an sba mortgage that did not exist,wagner submitted his loan package forms to the sba.wagner contends that the sba accepted the loan forms,the package,but that no individual ever informed him that his forms were improperly filed.the sba did not formally reject wagner application until june.
b.the bankruptcy court proceedings and chapter proceedings 
the bankruptcy court heard the trustee conversion motion as scheduled on june.the morning of the hearing,wagner filed a plan of arrangements,a layman stab at what is more technically known as a plan of reorganization,which serves as the outline of how a debtor intends to pay his or her creditors.the document,signed by wagner,read 
harry herbert wagner,plan of arrangement is to pay all legitimate creditors a cents on the dollar of exactly what they are actually owed.the note mortgage is in place,and harry herbert wagner,is ready to commence,but there are no certified proof of claims to pay at the moment.judge mary ann whipple,you are letting people move this court,who have no interest in any claim.enough is enough.if there is not a verified proof of claim submitted to the court within days from the date of this letter,they are deemed not to be a creditor and will forfeit any right to a claim.upon further examination with council sic,the amount that harry herbert wagner,jr owes may decrease.if there are any disagreements with the verified proof of claims,harry herbert wagner,jr is ready to use mediation,arbitration if both parties agree,or litigation to resolve them.
at plan of arrangements emphasis added.wagner attached three items to the plan of arrangements.first,he attached the second mortgage filed with the allen county recorder office,which purported to be worth million and which listed the sba as the mortgagee.second,he included a mortgage note,written on an sba form,which listed the sba as a lender of million at an interest rate of.third,wagner included a letter from investt acura cal iac,allegedly located in kent,washington,which expressed iac intent to loan wagner up to million.wagner claimed that he paid for this loan guarantee,and he characterized the iac loan commitment as a backup to the sba loan.
there were several problems with the alleged mortgage and note attached to the plan of arrangements.first,and most obviously,the sba was not capable of making a loan to wagner.second,the sba did not guarantee loans exceeding million,so that even if wagner had received a million loan from a lending institution,the sba could only guarantee a small portion of the loan amount.third,the note referenced the alleged sba loan as sba loan,which was clearly false,because the sba employs loan numbers.fourth,the interest rate listed on the note was fabricated.fifth,the iac backup loan commitment was unverified.the iac loan commitment filed with the plan was not written on iac letterhead,and the government alleges that no such loan commitment ever truly existed.
at the hearing,wagner openly testified to his recalcitrance.wagner admitted to his refusal to meet with the trustee office and further confirmed that he had not assisted the trustee office in any meaningful fashion.during the hearing,wagner initially testified that the sba had granted his loan request.however,upon further questioning,wagner admitted that the sba had not actually approved the loan and that despite the lack of approval,he had still publicly recorded the mortgage.
on june,the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion to convert wagner chapter bankruptcy to a chapter bankruptcy.the court also addressed and denied several motions filed by wagner,some of which the court described as defamatory.at.as to the plan of arrangements,the court stated that i t is hard for the court to decide what the most shocking aspect of this filing is,as between the fact that it turns out wagner has not actually received any loan from the sba and has thus publically filed a fraudulent note and mortgage and the fact that all of this occurred postpetition on may,without any notice,a hearing,court approval or bankruptcy code authority.at.finding multiple bases for conversion pursuant to b,including wagner bad faith in prosecuting his petition,wagner inability to create a reorganization plan,and wagner dereliction of his fiduciary duties to creditors,the court determined that conversion was the proper result.
as a result of the conversion,bruce french was appointed trustee on june.trustee french went to wagner office and informed wagner that he was assuming control of wagner assets and business operations.according to trustee french,wagner claimed that he would not cede control of anything until trustee french provided official documentation of his role.allegedly,wagner also explicitly stated that he would not cooperate with the trustee office and that he considered the proceedings to be unlawful.on june,trustee french drafted a letter to wagner tenants,informing them that all rents were to be paid to the trustee.a few days later,wagner wrote a responsive letter to his tenants.wagner claimed that all rents were still payable to him and that failure to pay rents as usual could result in the cessation of maintenance and lawn care.
trustee french difficulties with the disposition of wagner property were compounded by wagner actions with regards to three of the six smart houses that were among wagner assets.these houses were unoccupied and on the market for sale.consequently,trustee french hired a real estate company to sell the homes and changed the locks so as to effectuate this goal.in the beginning of july,wagner directed one of his employees to change the locks again and to return a single key for each home only to wagner.shortly after,one of the realtors could not show the home to a prospective buyer.wagner claimed that he changed the locks because there was a rash of at the three houses and he wanted to control all the outstanding keys to halt any future incidents,but the government presented contrary evidence that wagner in fact changed the locks to interfere with trustee french efforts.
wagner indictment,trial,and conviction 
wagner was indicted on november,in the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.the grand jury charged three separate counts wagner fraudulently presented the sba mortgage and note in the plan of arrangements in violation of wagner fraudulently ordered his tenants not to pay rent to the trustee in violation of and wagner concealed assets in violation of by changing the locks on houses that were assets of the trustee.the case proceeded to trial,and during the trial,the defense tried to call alyssa leaser leaser,wagner audiologist,to testify as to wagner hearing problems.the district court did not admit her testimony on relevancy grounds.the trial concluded on april.the jury returned a guilty verdict on counts one and three,but the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict on count two.the district court sentenced wagner to a term for each conviction to run concurrently.after wagner filed his timely notice of appeal,the district court stayed the defendant sentence pending this appeal.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,we must resolve four distinct issues the meaning of conceal as used in whether the evidence was sufficient to uphold wagner bankruptcy fraud conviction wagner ineffective assistance of counsel claim and the district court exclusion of the testimony of wagner audiologist.each issue involves a distinct standard of review,which we describe in turn.
wagner concealment of assets 
wagner first claim attacks his conviction for concealing three unoccupied smart houses from trustee french by changing the locks on the doors of those houses.while both parties suggest that the issue is best viewed as a question of the sufficiency of the evidence,we analyze the problem differently.in essence,the parties ask us to determine whether the word conceal,as used in,extends to wagner conduct.this is not a inquiry,as the evidence is clear that wagner changed the locks,but rather a question of statutory interpretation.we review de novo questions of statutory interpretation.united states firearms,cir.we begin our analysis by looking at the language of the statute itself to determine if its meaning is plain.plain meaning is examined by looking at the language and design of the statute as a whole.id.quotations and citations omitted.w e may look to the legislative history of a statute if the statutory language is unclear.united states choice,cir.
wagner chief argument is that obstructing a trustee access to real property,and thus potentially hindering the sale of that property,does not constitute concealment under.we have resolved very few cases involving,and we have never addressed this particular issue.we begin,as always,with the text of the statute under which wagner was convicted,which provides 
a person who knowingly and fraudulently conceals from a custodian,trustee,marshal,or other officer of the court charged with the control or custody of property,or,in connection with a case under title,from creditors or the united states trustee,any property belonging to the estate of a debtor shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
to prove wagner guilt under,the government must show that wagner knowing and fraudulently concealed property from the trustee that belonged to his estate.see united states christner,cir.the only issue here is whether wagner concealed property under either a narrow or a broad understanding of the term conceal,we must conclude that wagner concealed the smart houses from the trustee.
the narrow construction of conceal to hide,secrete,or withhold from the knowledge of others to cover or keep from sight.to hide or withdraw from observation,or prevent discovery of springs from its dictionary definition.black law dictionary ed see also random house unabridged dictionary ed.t o hide withdraw or remove from observation cover or keep from sight.by depriving the trustee of access to the house,wagner concealed,he hid,secreted,prevented discovery of,and withheld from the knowledge of the trustee the value of the property.that the trustee knew of the house existence does not alter our conclusion,because mere awareness of the property does not concomitantly reveal the property value.without access to the inside of the home,no prospective buyer could accurately assess the worth of the house and place a bid,which in turn prevented the trustee from learning the value of the house and accordingly disposing of the estate.it would be no different if wagner revealed to the trustee the existence of a cache of diamonds in a locked box,but refused to give the trustee the key to open the box,preventing a buyer and consequently the trustee from assessing whether the diamonds were of pristine cut,color,and clarity such that they were worth or were instead diamonds worth only.like diamonds,the value of the smart house,as embodied in the sale price,can not be known until a purchaser bids on the house,which provides the only true measure of the house value.few rational buyers would purchase a home without seeing the inside first.thus,limiting access to the inside of the house effectively precluded any potential purchaser from making an informed decision,which in turn prevented the trustee from learning the true value of the house.such actions constitute concealment of an asset.
the purposes of,the section history,and its interpretation by other courts support a broader construction of conceal,and applying a more encompassing definition does not alter our conclusion.because the efficiency and manageability of the bankruptcy system relies heavily on the free flow of accurate information,like the rest of the provisions governing bankruptcy crimes,exists not to protect individual creditors,but rather to prevent and redress abuses of the bankruptcy system.collier on bankruptcy a,at ed hereinafter collier.s ection promotes disclosure and revelation by debtors,and furthers one of the main goals of the statute identification of all the debtor assets and affairs so that there can be an objective evaluation of each bankruptcy estate.thus,the statute prohibits hiding assets from bankruptcy officers and actively frustrating collection efforts by creditors.id.at a i,at emphasis added see also stuhley hyatt,cir t he principal objectives of the provisions are to prevent and punish efforts by a bankrupt to avoid the distribution of any part of a liable bankrupt estate.several circuits have recognized that is a congressional attempt to cover all of the possible methods by which a debtor or any other person may attempt to defeat the intent and effect of the bankruptcy law through any type of effort to keep assets from being equitably distributed among creditors.united states goodstein,cir internal quotations omitted emphasis added united states thayer,cir quoting goodstein united states shapiro,cir the object of congress in passing was to punish those debtors who,although wanting relief from their debts,did not want to surrender what property there was to the creditors.section serves a broad purpose it exists to prevent a wide array of behavior designed to stymie the bankruptcy system,and consequently it targets many different kinds of conduct.
the history of the word conceal in the statute also demonstrates that conceal has a broad meaning.section,along with the other bankruptcy crimes provisions,first appeared in of the bankruptcy act of,which was codified in title of the united states code.see bankruptcy act of,ch,b,stat.in,congress amended the bankruptcy act of those amendments stated that conceal shall include secrete,falsify,and mutilate.the chandler act,ch,stat.in,the criminal provisions of the bankruptcy act were moved to title.see crimes and criminal procedure act,ch,stat.section remained a part of title even though the term it was defining was nestled in title until,when the bankruptcy reform act of repealed along with large portions of the bankruptcy act.despite this repeal,courts have continued to apply an expanded definition of conceal in cases.see collier b i,at courts have not allowed the accident of transference to the criminal code to change settled interpretations.united states grant,cir noting that where appropriate we cite to authority antedating the amendment.for example,in thayer,the third circuit upheld a jury instruction in a case which read 
fraudulently concealing property of the estate of the debtor may include transferring property to a third party,destroying the property,withholding knowledge concerning the existence or whereabouts of property,or knowingly doing anything else by which the person acts to hinder,delay or defraud any of the creditors.
at emphasis added.similarly,in united states turner,cir,the court adopted a comparably broad standard.it upheld the following jury instruction 
concealment means,not only secreting,falsifying and mutilating as specified in section of the bankruptcy act but also includes preventing discovery,fraudulently transferring or withholding knowledge or information required by law to be made known.
id.at.the court held that c learly concealment means more than secreting one does not have to put something in a hidden compartment,a safe,or a hole in the backyard in order to conceal it.it is enough that one withholds knowledge,or prevents disclosure or recognition.id.quotation omitted.
the purpose of and the broad definition of conceal,adopted first by congress and then by the courts,guide our holding that conceal in this context means more than just the act of hiding property or withdrawing it from sight.section relationship to real property highlights the problem with an overly rigid definition of conceal.unlike cash,bonds,stocks,or other liquid assets,real property can not be easily hidden.narrowly construing the word conceal would sharply limit the type of behavior can reach,which contravenes the purpose of the statute.naturally,a debtor can withhold information about the debtor ownership of a house,a parcel of land,or a vehicle,but such refusal to disclose information about the existence or whereabouts of real property does not exhaust the ways in which a debtor can conceal real property.other actions,for instance,a debtor use of physical force to prevent a trustee from approaching the debtor property or the intentional marring of property to reduce its value to prospective buyers,hinder or obstruct the trustee responsibilities just as much as preventing the trustee from learning about the existence of assets by hiding or secreting away such assets.see,united states yagow,cir affirming,without discussion,a conviction under when the defendant warned the trustee not to enter his property and constructed a trench around his property to stymie removal of any collateral.we agree with the other circuits that have held that concealing property encompasses actions designed to hinder,delay,or otherwise obstruct the ability of a trustee to account for and distribute the debtor estate.see thayer,at turner,at.this holding permits to serve its significant task of ensuring that trustees can equitably distribute assets among creditors pursuant to the bankruptcy laws without interference.
under this standard,wagner modification of the locks constituted concealment.by changing the locks,wagner prevented the trustee from showing the property to a prospective buyer.it is true that the realtor,and thus by extension the trustee,was inconvenienced for only a short amount of time by wagner decision to change the locks.also,it is not certain that the individual s who wanted to view the house on that particular day would have decided to purchase it.however,such considerations are irrelevant there is no materiality requirement in,and wagner would be no less criminally liable under if he had changed the locks knowingly and fraudulently but the realtor had not planned to show the house that particular day.see collier a i,at s ection has no implicit or explicit materiality requirement concealment of any asset,if done knowingly and fraudulently,can support conviction.wagner intent to delay or obstruct the trustee is enough for culpability under.
in reaching our conclusion,we do not ignore the rule of lenity,which establishes that in construing an ambiguous statute,a court should resolve the ambiguity in favor of the more lenient sentence.mallett united states,cir see also mcelroy united states,d a mbiguity concerning the reach of a criminal statute should be resolved by reading the statute narrowly in order to encourage congress to speak clearly,thus giving the populace fair warning of the line between criminal and lawful activity,and in order to have the legislature,not the courts,define criminal activity.in evaluating whether a statute is ambiguous for purposes,it is not enough for the plain language to be unclear only when the plain language,structure,and legislative history provide no guidance will we apply the rule of lenity.united states boucha,cir.whatever ambiguity may inhere in the use of the word conceal,there is no doubt that is part of a clear and explicit framework of prohibitions designed to ensure the equitable distribution of assets.accordingly,the rule of lenity does not apply,and we uphold wagner conviction under for the concealment of property from the trustee.
wagner fraudulent representation 
wagner second claim is that insufficient evidence exists to sustain his conviction for bankruptcy fraud pursuant to.our standard of review for this type of claim presents a defendant with an uphill battle.see united states henley,cir a defendant making such a challenge bears a very heavy burden.quotation omitted united states kelly,cir the standard for evaluating claims that a conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence presents a very difficult hurdle for the criminal appellant.quotation omitted.the key inquiry is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states humphrey,cir quotation omitted.we will reverse a judgment for insufficiency of evidence only if this judgment is not supported by substantial and competent evidence upon the record as a whole.united states chavis,cir quotation omitted.in analyzing such a claim,we do not weigh the evidence,evaluate witness credibility,or displace the jury judgment with our own.id 
wagner argues that the evidence does not support his conviction because his actions did not have any proven effect on the bankruptcy court.wagner br.at.wagner was indicted and convicted pursuant to,which provides 
a person who,having devised or intending to devise a scheme or artifice to defraud and for the purpose of executing or concealing such a scheme or artifice or attempting to do so files a document in a proceeding under title shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.
we have stated,section contains three elements the existence of a scheme to defraud or intent to later formulate a scheme to defraud and the filing of a bankruptcy petition for the purpose of executing or attempting to execute the scheme.united states desantis,cir emphasis added see also united states mcbride,cir collier,at to.we apply the same test in analyzing,except that we are concerned with the filing of a document in a proceeding under title rather than the filing of a bankruptcy petition.in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence of the intent to defraud,we are mindful of the fact that the question of intent is generally considered to be one of fact to be resolved by the trier of the facts and the determination thereof should not be lightly overturned,united states daniel,cir quotation omitted alteration in original.
wagner does not dispute that there is sufficient evidence that he filed the plan of arrangements,which is the allegedly fraudulent document,or that the plan served to execute the scheme if the scheme existed.instead,wagner chiefly contends that there is a failure of proof that the plan and its attachments are a scheme or artifice to defraud.wagner br.at.the evidence clearly belies wagner argument.the plan,to which wagner attached the falsified sba mortgage and note,explicitly claimed that he had received a loan of million from the sba when in fact he had not.furthermore and quite incredibly,at the hearing,wagner first falsely explained that he had received a loan from the sba before finally admitting not only that he had not received the loan,but also that he had claimed the opposite in his plan of arrangements and had recorded the mortgage with allen county,in violation of bankruptcy rules forbidding the encumbrance of property without prior approval.the plan and the attached mortgage and note were clear fabrications because they included a fictitious interest rate and a nonexistent sba loan number,they exceeded the sba loan guarantee limit,and the sba is not even institutionally capable of making loans.wagner complete unwillingness to aid the trustee office and his attempts to disrupt the chapter process provide collateral evidentiary support for the notion that wagner plan of arrangements constituted one more episode in a series of schemes to mislead the bankruptcy court and to delay the bankruptcy proceedings.when combined,the evidence clearly demonstrates an intent to defraud,and there is no doubt that a rational trier of fact could have found wagner guilty.
wagner offers several unpersuasive reasons why the evidence was insufficient.first,he claims that because the plan of arrangements did not cause anyone to act or refrain from acting,wagner br.at,there is insufficient evidence to support his conviction.this is plainly incorrect there is simply no requirement that the fraudulent filing have its intended effect for a defendant to be liable under.success of the scheme is not an element of the crime.desantis,at.the bankruptcy fraud statute makes the crime complete upon the filing of the bankruptcy petition when the filing is accompanied by the other two defined circumstances filing itself is the forbidden act.id the mere filing of the plan of arrangements and the mendacious mortgage and note are enough to create criminal liability under because such action is evidence of a scheme or artifice to defraud.the purported sba mortgage and note are no less fraudulent merely because they were unconvincing.it would be counterproductive to hold that debtors making fraudulent statements in bankruptcy proceedings can elude prosecution simply because the bankruptcy court successfully sniffed out the misrepresentation.
second,wagner directs us to the legislative history of,which he believes highlights the insufficiency of the evidence.section was enacted as part of the bankruptcy reform act of,stat,a b.the house report states that u nder no circumstances is this section to be operative if the defendant is adjudicated as having committed the act alleged to constitute fraud for a lawful purpose,at,reprinted in.as examples,the report suggests that would not apply when an individual makes a misrepresentation on a financial statement before filing bankruptcy so long as the individual did not make the misrepresentation in preparation for bankruptcy,nor would the statute apply if an individual made a false statement unrelated to the bankruptcy proceeding.id.at.this legislative history does not help wagner,who argues that the lawful purpose behind his filing of the plan of arrangements was to demonstrate his intent to repay his creditors.wagner actions can hardly be considered lawful,as his plan fraudulently described a mortgage that did not exist.furthermore,wagner can not claim to fit within any of the exceptions described in the legislative history of.
third,wagner suggests that the plan of arrangements was not fraudulent because even though the sba mortgage and note were false,they were allegedly backed up by the iac loan commitment.in essence,wagner claims that the plan merely demonstrated his intent to pay his creditors and if the bankruptcy court had approved the plan without realizing the sba loan was a forgery,the iac loan would have served to satisfy wagner creditors,such that the plan stated intention was not false.this argument is factually misleading because it ignores the falsified mortgage and note attached to the plan and referenced in the text of the plan.this contention also misses the point,as it is actually just a variant of wagner reliance contention.even assuming that the iac loan commitment was real,which the government has convincingly called into question,wagner still misrepresented the sba mortgage and note.wagner did not cease either to engage in a scheme to defraud or to file a document in furtherance of that scheme simply because he had a legitimate backup plan.the fact that the iac loan,if it existed,might have potentially helped to satisfy his creditors does not eliminate the illegality of wagner false statements about an sba loan for which he never received approval.
fourth,wagner suggests that he was unaware of both sba inability to make loans and its guarantee limit of million because he could not hear the sba officials.it is unclear why his knowledge in this regard is relev
