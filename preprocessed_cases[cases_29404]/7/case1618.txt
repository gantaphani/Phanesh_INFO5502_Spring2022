statutory background 
debtors who seek chapter relief commit to a period of repayment,after which their remaining debts are discharged unlike chapter debtors,who are entitled to a discharge of debt as soon as their estate is liquidated and distributed chapter debtors are not entitled to a discharge of debts unless and until they complete payments to creditors under a plan a student loans are excepted from discharge unless the debtor can show undue hardship.id.a,a coleman is currently making payments under her chapter plan.she will not be entitled to discharge any of her debts until she completes this plan,and will not be entitled to discharge her student loans unless she can show undue hardship.
to show undue hardship,the debtor must show that she can not maintain,based on current income and expenses,a minimal standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment portion of the student loans and that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.in re saxman,cir.
the question before us is one of timing may coleman obtain this undue hardship determination substantially in advance of the time she completes payments under her chapter plan 
federal rule of bankruptcy procedure a provides that a debtor or any creditor may file a complaint to obtain a determination of the dischargeability of any debt.under federal rule of bankruptcy procedure b,a complaint other than under c may be filed at any time.coleman argues that this rule shows that the undue hardship determination is ripe at any time,while educational credit argues that,because coleman can not obtain a discharge unless and until she completes payments under the plan,the undue hardship determination is not ripe until at or near the time coleman completes plan payments.
constitutional ripeness 
ripeness has two components constitutional ripeness and prudential ripeness thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir en banc.the constitutional ripeness of a declaratory judgment action depends upon whether the facts alleged,under all the circumstances,show that there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.united states braren,cir quoting.cas.pac.coal oil.see also hulteen v.at t,cir en banc finding jurisdiction because substantial controversy requirement was met.

a substantial controversy arose between coleman and educational credit when coleman filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter coleman purpose in filing was to seek the discharge of her student loans,and educational credit seeks to prevent this.further,the controversy here is certainly definite and concrete,not hypothetical or abstract,because it is a controversy between coleman and educational credit over a specific and defined debt.
it is true that coleman actual discharge of her student loans will only occur,if at all,when she completes payments under the plan.a.if she does not complete her plan payments,there will be no discharge 
but plan completion is a single factual a series of contingencies rendering the decision impermissibly speculative.see portland police,at.in la ligue contre le racisme et,cir per curiam,this court concluded that a challenge to the of a french court injunction was constitutionally ripe even though enforcement of that injunction had yet to be sought if this factual contingency did not render the dispute so impermissibly speculative that it failed to meet the case or controversy requirement,it is difficult to see how the dispute between coleman and educational credit would not also qualify as constitutionally ripe.just as coleman could fail to complete her plan payments,parties to the dispute at the time ripeness was at issue could have decided not to seek the enforcement of its injunction in the united states the dispute here is constitutionally ripe.
prudential ripeness test 
the supreme court has held that p roblems of prematurity and abstractness may well present insuperable obstacles to the exercise of the court jurisdiction,even though that jurisdiction is technically present.socialist labor party gilligan,d citing rescue army mun.court.
the supreme court has developed a test for determining the prudential component of ripeness in the administrative context the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.abbott labs.gardner,d,overruled on other grounds by califano sanders,d originally,we generally applied this test in making prudential ripeness determinations without strictly limiting the test to the administrative law context.see,audubon soc y,davis,cir,amended on denial of reh g,cir knight kenai penninsula borough sch,cir in re dominelli,cir.
however,in principal life insurance robinson,cir,we held that abbott does not apply to private contract disputes,and suggested that the test may only be appropriate in the administrative law context.the court noted,because an administrative action has consequences for many members of the general public,it is prudent for courts to limit their review of such actions to those involving the possibility of concrete injury greater than speculative or remote financial contingencies.id.at.the court also observed that the concerns expressed in abbott over judicial entanglement,allocation of authority,and the risks of and remote adverse consequences in administrative agency actions do not apply to private party contract disputes.id.at.
the court then declined to apply the abbott test to a private party contract dispute over a provision,finding the matter ripe even though the provision was contingent upon future property value.noting that the fundamental role of the courts is to resolve concrete and present disputes between parties,the court held that the proper test for ripeness in private party contract disputes is the traditional ripeness standard,namely,whether there is a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.id.at quoting.cas,at.
principal does not tell us whether the abbott test would be appropriate in this private party dispute that is governed not by contract but by the bankruptcy code.however,prior to principal,disputes in the bankruptcy context were subjected to the abbott ripeness test.see,dominelli,at dispute as to whether debtor estate could be required to pay legal expenses of creditor committee ripe under abbott test even though counsel had not yet sought fees in re carriers,cir.bap dispute over bankruptcy court jurisdiction to enter abstention order ripe under abbott test.because principal did not and could not overrule dominelli application of abbott in the bankruptcy context,we must apply abbott here 
prudential ripeness here 
background 
turning to the specific inquiry at hand,we note that courts of appeal are currently split as to whether student loan dischargeability determinations are ripe substantially in advance of plan completion.most courts to address the issue do not specify which ripeness standard they are employing.the ninth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap has held that the issue of student loan dischargeability is ripe before the completion of plan payments.in re taylor,cir.bap,overruled on other grounds by saxman,at without explicitly applying the abbott test or any particular ripeness standard,the bap reasoned that the issue was ripe because bankruptcy rule b expressly permits the filing of a a complaint at any time,and no statute or policy conflicts with the filing of such a complaint at any time.taylor,at.
the fourth circuit has also held that undue hardship determinations may be ripe in advance of plan completion.in re ekenasi,cir.the court expressly decline d to adopt a hard and fast rule which would preclude bankruptcy courts from ever entertaining a proceeding to discharge student loan obligations until at or near the time the debtor has completed payments under a confirmed chapter plan.a bankruptcy court in the southern district of ohio also took this approach.in re strahm,
two courts of appeal disagree with taylor.the eighth circuit,without applying any particular ripeness test held that,in undue hardship determinations,the factual question is whether there is undue hardship at the time of discharge,not whether there is undue hardship at the time that a a proceeding is commenced.in re bender,cir.the court reasoned that student loan dischargeability proceedings should take place relatively close to the date of discharge so that the court can make its determination in light of the debtor actual circumstances at the relevant time.id.similarly,the fifth circuit has held,in contrast to taylor,that the undue hardship determination is not ripe until plan completion because dischargeability is not available until plan completion in re rubarts,cir 
applying abbott,we agree with the fourth circuit and with the ninth circuit bap that an undue hardship determination can be ripe substantially in advance of plan completion.
the purpose of the fitness test under abbott is to delay consideration of the issue until the pertinent facts have been in cases where further factual development would aid the court consideration.see,park hospitality ass dep t of the interior,d further factual development would significantly advance our ability to deal with the legal issues presented so the matter determined not ripe for judicial review internal quotation marks omitted lujan wildlife fed n,d regulation ordinarily not ripe for review until the scope of the controversy has been reduced to more manageable proportions,and its factual components fleshed out,by concrete action applying the regulation to the claimant situation in a fashion that harms or threatens to harm him earth island inst.ruthenbeck,cir issue not fit for review absent proper factual context to aid court determination natural res.def.council,epa,considering whether consideration of the issue would benefit from a more concrete setting in determining whether an issue is fit under the abbott test.
although a case is more likely to be fit if it involves pure legal questions that require little factual development,san diego county gun rights committee,at,inquiries that depend on further factual development may nevertheless be ripe if,as here,that development would do little to aid the court decision.in the bankruptcy context,there are many situations in which the factual context may never be ideally.congress has given bankruptcy courts the task of undertaking complex factual inquiries that depend,by their very nature,on future events and contingencies.whether a bankruptcy court decides to lift an automatic stay depends upon its assessment of the debtor ability to adequately protect against future decline in the collateral value and ultimately successfully reorganize.d,e united sav.ass of timbers of inwood forest,d.at that moment the bankruptcy court essentially must predict whether the debtor is doomed or has some reasonable chance of rehabilitation.whether a bankruptcy court decides to confirm a chapter plan depends upon the likelihood that the debtor will be able to make all required payments under the plan.a.in all of these situations,delay is unlikely to provide much,if any,additional benefit to the bankruptcy court resolution of the issue.
the same is true here the undue hardship inquiry itself contemplates factual contingencies many years into the future.see coleman,at.under the second prong of the undue hardship test,the debtor must show that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans.saxman,at.many student loan repayment periods are thirty years in significant portion of this period is far longer than the duration between the initiation and conclusion of the chapter plan.a determination of lack of ripeness due to the factual contingency of the debtor financial situation makes little sense since the court must always speculate on debtor financial situation years into the future.
educational credit also argues that the determination whether the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans,saxman,at,can not be made until at or near plan completion.however,whether it is premature for the court to make such a determination varies depending on each debtor situation.see,ekenasi,at.if the debtor has been trying in vain to make student loan payments for the past fifteen years,the facts may be sufficiently well developed for the court to conclude that the debtor made good faith efforts to repay.if,on the other hand,the debtor files for bankruptcy immediately upon graduating from college,it will likely be necessary to wait the duration of the plan before a good faith determination is possible.here coleman has been trying to repay her student loans since,which seems to us a sufficient amount of time for the bankruptcy court to evaluate whether she has made a good faith attempt at repayment.
we disagree with the eighth circuit conclusion that bankruptcy courts should not make an undue hardship determination until the time of discharge because the factual question is whether there is undue hardship at the time of discharge,not whether there is undue hardship at the time that a a proceeding is commenced.bender,at.the bankruptcy court below correctly noted that there is no clause in a specifying that the undue hardship must exist exactly at the time of disch
