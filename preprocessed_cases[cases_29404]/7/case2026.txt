finally,we uphold the district court application of judicial estoppel and affirm the summary judgment granted in favor of howard.courts may invoke judicial estoppel w here a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding,succeeds in maintaining that position,and then,simply because his interests have changed,assume s a contrary position.comcast fcc,quoting new hampshire maine.even after he had filed for bankruptcy,moses continued to hold himself out before the district court as a valid plaintiff,a position which was clearly inconsistent with his pursuit of relief in bankruptcy.see maine,at internal quotation marks omitted.j udicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding create s the perception that either the first or the second court was misled,thus posing a threat to judicial integrity.see id.internal quotation marks omitted.moses derive d an unfair advantage in maintaining and controlling this lawsuit by falsely holding himself out as a proper party.id.at.therefore,the district court did not err in applying judicial estoppel against moses.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
on february,appellant moses filed the first of two lawsuits against howard,his,alleging race discrimination,national origin discrimination,and retaliation in violation of title vii race discrimination and retaliation in violation of the dchra and age discrimination in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea,et.on january,the district court entered summary judgment for howard on all counts except those related to moses adea claim.see moses howard,civ.action,moses i.the parties subsequently settled the adea claim,and the case was dismissed with prejudice.see moses howard,civ.action,slip op.at july,moses ii describing the proceedings in the initial lawsuit.
in october,moses was terminated by howard.moses then filed complaints with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and the district of columbia office of human rights,contending that he was dismissed in retaliation for filing the lawsuit against howard.on september,moses received a right to sue letter from the eeoc.he then filed the instant lawsuit with the district court.in his complaint,moses alleged that howard had retaliated against him in violation of title vii and the dchra.howard denied the charges and moved for summary judgment.
while this lawsuit was pending in district court,moses initiated two separate bankruptcy proceedings.on september,moses filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code,et.this action was brought in the district of maryland,with nesse assigned to serve as trustee of moses bankruptcy estate.a chapter proceeding authorizes a discharge of prepetition debts following the liquidation of the debtor assets by a bankruptcy trustee,who then distributes the proceeds to creditors under chapter the debtor nonexempt assets are controlled by the bankruptcy trustee.marrama citizens bank of.on january,moses secured a discharge of approximately in debt pursuant to his chapter bankruptcy petition.
in early,moses again filed for bankruptcy in the district of maryland,this time under chapter of the bankruptcy code,u.et chapter authorizes an individual with regular income to obtain a discharge after the successful completion of a payment plan approved by the bankruptcy court u nder chapter the debtor retains possession of his property during the course of the bankruptcy proceeding.marrama,at.the bankruptcy court rejected moses proposed payment plan and his chapter proceeding was closed on june.
in each of his bankruptcy proceedings,moses was required to execute,under penalty of perjury,a statement of financial affairs setting forth all suits and administrative proceedings to which the debtor is or was a party within one year immediately preceding the filing of this bankruptcy case.moses iii,slip op.at citing defendant statement of undisputed material facts in support of its renewed motion for summary judgement def.undisputed facts,reprinted in joint appendix.a debtor is required to disclose all potential claims in a bankruptcy petition.see,a.this means that a debtor is under a duty both to disclose the existence of pending lawsuits when he files a petition in bankruptcy and to amend his petition if circumstances change during the course of the bankruptcy.see jethroe omnova solutions,cir in re coastal plains,cir.and when an estate is in bankruptcy under chapter,the trustee is the representative of the estate and retains the sole authority to sue and be sued on its behalf.see parker wendy int l,cir.nesse retained this authority as trustee in the chapter bankruptcy proceeding.
despite these disclosure requirements,moses failed to reveal the existence of this lawsuit in either his chapter or chapter bankruptcy proceedings.he did,however,disclose his involvement in separate civil actions involving the garnishment of his wages.see moses iii,slip op.at citing def.undisputed facts.
moses action in this case remained live in the district court during the course of both bankruptcy proceedings.on february,the district court conclude d that genuine issues of material fact remain ed with respect to moses termination claim,and thus ruled that howard was not entitled to summary judgment on this claim.moses howard,d,moses ii.the court also ruled that,w ith respect to all other adverse employment actions that moses allege d were taken in retaliation for his filing a discrimination complaint and lawsuit,it would enter judgment for howard.id.the district court subsequently set a trial date for moses claim that his termination from employment constituted unlawful retaliation.
while preparing for trial in this case,howard uncovered moses chapter and chapter bankruptcy proceedings.howard also determined that moses had neither disclosed this action to the bankruptcy courts nor disclosed the bankruptcy proceedings to the district court.on december,with this newly discovered information in hand,howard renewed its motion for summary judgment,arguing that judicial estoppel barred moses from maintaining this suit.in early,after howard had revealed moses failures to disclose,moses moved to reopen his chapter bankruptcy proceeding in the district of maryland to amend his original statement of financial affairs to reflect the existence of this lawsuit.on january,the bankruptcy court granted moses motion and reappointed nesse as trustee of the estate.while howard renewed motion for summary judgment was still pending before the district court,nesse and howard commenced negotiations over a possible settlement of the pending retaliation claim.
on july,the district court granted howard renewed motion for summary judgment.see moses iii,slip op.at.on july,nesse filed a rule a motion to substitute herself as plaintiff in this action.see.a.on the same day,nesse also filed a rule e motion to amend the opinion and judgment in moses iii,to clarify that judicial estoppel would apply in this case solely against moses in the event that he acted in his own right to pursue the retaliatory termination claim.see.e.moses filed a notice of appeal on august,contesting the district court dismissal of his suit.
on february,the district court approved nesse rule a and rule e motions.see moses howard,civ.action,slip op.at,moses iv.the district court corrected the case docket to show nesse as plaintiff,and amended its july,judgment and opinion to clarify that its judicial estoppel holding only applied to the extent that the retaliation claim was prosecuted by moses on his own behalf.id.at.subsequently,when settlement negotiations between nesse and howard failed to yield an agreement,nesse notified the bankruptcy court that she sought to abandon moses claim in this case as property of the estate.see a.the bankruptcy court approved nesse abandonment on june.see order authorizing abandonment of property of the estate,reprinted in.
in this appeal,appellant moses argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to howard on judicial estoppel grounds.howard counters that judicial estoppel applies in this case howard further contends that moses lacks standing to pursue this appeal and this court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case because moses failed to timely file his notice of appeal within days of the judgment below.see fed.a.
ii.analysis 
the art.iii judicial power exists only to redress or otherwise to protect against injury to the complaining party,even though the court judgment may benefit others collaterally.a federal court jurisdiction therefore can be invoked only when the plaintiff himself has suffered some threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action e ven when the plaintiff has alleged injury sufficient to meet the case or controversy requirement,the supreme court has held that the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.warth seldin,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
in the context of bankruptcy proceedings,it is well understood that a trustee,as the representative of the bankruptcy estate,is the real party in interest,and is the only party with standing to prosecute causes of action belonging to the estate once the bankruptcy petition has been filed.kane union fire ins,cir per curiam.the commencement of chapter bankruptcy extinguishes a debtor legal rights and interests in any pending litigation,and transfers those rights to the trustee,acting on behalf of the bankruptcy estate.see a indicating that a bankruptcy estate includes all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property id.establishing the bankruptcy trustee as the representative of the estate with the capacity to sue and be sued on its behalf.thus,g enerally speaking,a cause of action is the property of the chapter bankruptcy estate,and only the trustee in bankruptcy has standing to pursue it.parker,at accord turner cook,cir detrick panalpina,cir.
howard argues that only nesse,the trustee of the bankruptcy estate,and not moses,had standing to pursue the claims in this case.that was true until june,when nesse abandoned the estate claims in this case.an outstanding legal claim that is abandoned by the trustee reverts back to the original.see a directing that a fter notice and a hearing,the trustee may abandon any property of the estate that is burdensome or that is of inconsequential value and benefit to the estate id.c directing that any property scheduled but not otherwise administered at the time of the closing of a case is abandoned to the debtor and considered administered.u pon abandonment the trustee is divested of control of the property because it is no longer part of the estate property abandoned under reverts to the debtor,and the debtor rights to the property are treated as if no bankruptcy petition was filed.kane,at quoting collier on bankruptcy,see also parker,at.
whatever interest passed to the trustee when moses filed for chapter bankruptcy was extinguished when nesse abandoned the cause of action in this case.brown.in other words,when property of the bankrupt is abandoned,the title reverts to the bankrupt,nunc pro tunc,so that he is treated as having owned it continuously.morlan,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted emphasis added.the retroactive effect of the trustee abandonment ensured that moses had standing to file a notice of appeal on august,when he did.and,as explained below,moses notice of appeal was effective on february,when the district court disposed of the trustee rule e motion.
timeliness 
a court of appeals has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal that is filed outside of the time limits prescribed by fed.a a and a.see bowles russell.these time limits are mandatory and jurisdictional,and failure to file a timely notice of appeal defeats the jurisdiction of a court of appeals.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.howard contends that moses appeal should be dismissed,because it was not filed with the district clerk within days after the judgment or order appealed from was entered.see fed.a a.we disagree.
the district court entered its original order granting howard motion for summary judgment on july.as noted above,nesse,acting as trustee,filed a rule e motion on july,seeking to amend the district court judgment.rule a provides that i f a party timely files a motion to alter or amend a judgment under rule,the time to file an appeal runs for all parties from the entry of the order disposing of the last such remaining motion.id.at a a.in other words,once nesse filed her rule e motion,this tolled the time for the filing of an appeal.
moses filed his notice of appeal on august,during the time when the rule e motion was still pending and the time for filing an appeal was tolled.his notice of appeal was thus early,not late.the trustee rule e motion was not disposed of until february,the date when the time to file an appeal commenced to run for all parties.where,as in this case,the notice of appeal was filed before the district court resolved the pending rule e motion,the notice of appeal became effective when the order disposing of the e motion was entered.see fed.a b i if a party files a notice of appeal after the court announces or enters a before it disposes of any motion listed in rule a a the notice becomes effective to appeal a judgment or order,in whole or in part,when the order disposing of the last such remaining motion is entered.in other words,moses early notice of appeal was in effect,suspended until the e motion was disposed of,whereupon,the previously filed notice effectively place d jurisdiction in the court of appeals.see advisory committee notes on fed.a.
