the bankruptcy code prohibits private employers from discharging bankrupt employees solely because of the employees having invoked the protection of the bankruptcy laws.see b.
the appellants in the case at bar,a husband and wife,filed a joint bankruptcy petition under chapter.three days after notice of the bankruptcy was published in the local newspaper,the couple mutual employer fired them.at a bench trial in the ensuing adversary proceeding,the bankruptcy court determined that one factor in the employer factor sufficient in and of itself to justify termination of the husband been a request by the husband to be given a company car in exchange for helping his bosses falsify their income tax returns.
on the strength of this factual notwithstanding that,as we read the record,the automobile issue may not have been the most significant factor in the employer decision to let the couple bankruptcy court concluded that the employees had not been fired solely because of the bankruptcy.their claim for relief under b was therefore denied.
the district court affirmed the denial of relief,expressing agreement with the proposition that solely because means exactly what it says we too agree with that proposition,and we shall affirm the challenged judgment.
appellant william lona white became an employee of kentuckiana livestock market,a rural business,in.named of the corporation in,he held that position until april.his duties included keeping the company books.
appellant shirley jean white,as she is now known,married white in.she had worked for kentuckiana longer than he,having been hired by the company in.her duties were secretarial and clerical in nature.
in white and his then wife opened a restaurant business in owensboro,kentucky.shareholders and customers of kentuckiana were invited to invest in the restaurant,and some of them did so.the restaurant failed after three years,and the investors got none of their money back.
in the year white became part owner of a welding and fabricating shop.he borrowed money from a bank in this connection and,unable to repay,he and his current wife filed a chapter bankruptcy petition on march.the filing was reported in a local newspaper on april.because of the bankruptcy,white had to surrender his personal automobile.
sometime around the end of march,it appears,white called the chairman of kentuckiana board of directors,ralph douglas wood,to ask if the board would approve the purchase of a vehicle for his white use.wood subsequently testified that he told white this would be a matter for the company management to decide and that white would have to talk to pat and mike baker.the former was kentuckiana president and the latter its and general manager.
white approached mike baker first,according to baker.after broaching the vehicle question with him,mike baker testified,white said if you scratch my back i scratch yours.at this point in the conversation white allegedly held up a kentuckiana check which,although it represented a commission for mike baker,had been made out in the name of a boat dealer.i will lose stuff like this,white is alleged to have said.
white approached pat baker later in the day,according to the latter testimony,telling him that i f you buy me an automobile it will be good for kentuckiana,and it will be good for pat baker.asked to explain this last remark,pat baker testified,white said that he would lose certain documents pertaining to your income.baker took this to mean that my commission check would be reported for tax purposes 
on the following day,april,pat baker fired and white.baker refused to give the whites any reason for this action.according to board chairman wood,however,pat baker had called wood to say he was thinking of discharging the couple for reasons that wood recalled thus the car was one reason,and they pat baker and mike baker had had a decline in confidence in their the whites general ability in how they were performing their duties.pat baker did not mention the bankruptcy,according to wood.according to white,on the other hand,billy barnett,a board member who was not called as a witness at trial,told her that pat baker had said he fired the whites because of their bankruptcy.
less than a week after the firings,pat baker identified the bankruptcy and the prior failure of white restaurant business as the main reason for kentuckiana having terminated the whites employment.in a sworn statement that pat baker submitted to the kentucky unemployment insurance authorities on april,baker responded as follows to a question asking him to state his primary reason for discharging white his past personal business ventures.white has filed bankruptcy in one,and beat several people,some of them farmers,out of thousands of dollars.this reflects poorly on kentuckiana livestock for having him employed.
in response to a section of the unemployment insurance form calling for a detailed description of the final incident,pat baker had this to say 
when bill white declared bankruptcy in march,and failed in his restaurant business before that,we kentuckiana livestock market,felt his employment here hurts our business,decreases the faith farmers have in our bookkeeping department and the management does trust him.
the form completed by baker with respect to white was similar.
at his deposition,pat baker claimed several other reasons for the decision to terminate white employment.the reasons included rudeness to customers,failure to inform employees how the amount of each paycheck had been calculated,failure to record payments received from customers,and general sloppy bookkeeping.none of these alleged problems was documented,baker acknowledged,but he said that they nonetheless overshadowed the bankruptcy in importance.the bankruptcy,he insisted,had very little to do with white discharge.
when asked why white employment had been terminated,baker testified that it was b ecause she married to bill white baker also said that white was involved in the sloppy bookkeeping.
the whites responded to their pink slips by commencing an adversary proceeding against kentuckiana in the bankruptcy court.the complaint alleged that the discharge of the plaintiffs was motivated by the filing of plaintiffs sic chapter bankruptcy in direct violation of.the relief sought included compensatory damages measured by the salaries and benefits a combined total,initially,of per annum that the whites could have expected to receive if each of them worked to age plus punitive damages,plus attorney fees and costs.
the case was tried before the bankruptcy judge sitting without a jury.having heard the evidence,the bankruptcy judge found as a fact that the whites filing of their bankruptcy petition was not the sole reason for the termination of their employment.the issue was a factor in the decision to terminate the employment of the whites,the judge found,and that factor was sufficient reason for bill white termination.as to white,the judge found that her employment was terminated simply because she was married to bill white this being so,the judge concluded that she was not terminated solely for filing bankruptcy.the whites claims were dismissed with prejudice.
the district court affirmed the dismissal on appeal.a timely appeal to this court followed.
section b of title of the united states code provides,in relevant part,that 
no private employer may terminate the employment of an individual who is or has been a debtor under this title,an individual who has filed a petition under the bankruptcy code solely because such debtor 
is or has been a debtor under this title,has filed for bankruptcy 
in rejecting the whites claim for damages under this section,the bankruptcy court acknowledged that t he whites were able to establish in their pleadings and at trial a prima facie case that kentuckiana engaged in discriminatory treatment in violation of b based on the totality of the particular facts and circumstances brought out at trial,however,the bankruptcy court concluded that kentuckiana has overcome the whites prima facie case.specifically,the court found,t he vehicle purchase issue was sufficient reason for bill white termination,and was
