the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order of conversion of the debtors chapter case to a case under chapter.loop corporation,a creditor which also owns approximately of the debtors stock,and various of loop affiliates collectively loop appeal,arguing that the bankruptcy court improperly interpreted and applied b.we affirm.
debtor health risk management,and three of its subsidiaries filed petitions under chapter of the bankruptcy code on august,which the bankruptcy court consolidated and ordered to be jointly administered.the debtors intended from very early in the case to liquidate their businesses rather than attempt to reorganize as viable entities.
in the months following the filing,the debtors successfully liquidated their two primary businesses as well as substantially all of their remaining assets.they used part of the funds from these sales to pay the claims of their secured creditors.as of december,when the debtors filed their initial plan of reorganization,their remaining assets included approximately million in cash potential causes of action against ernst young and various other directors and accountants of the debtors and net operating losses that purportedly could provide the estate with million to million in value the debtors,loop,and the official committee of unsecured creditors creditors committee began to attempt to negotiate a consensual plan of reorganization,but they were unsuccessful.
on january,the trustee moved for conversion of the cases from chapter to chapter pursuant to b.this motion was opposed by the debtors,loop,and the creditors committee,who sought more time for negotiations.at a february,hearing on the motion,the debtors counsel explained that the debtors preferred to stay in chapter and use part of the remaining cash to fund litigation against the accountants and directors rather than distribute the cash to the unsecured creditors.the debtors also believed that the value of the net operating losses could be realized,if at all,only in chapter.loop and the creditors committee also preferred to remain in chapter because they thought chapter had the potential to provide a greater return for the unsecured creditors.
the trustee,however,focused on the accumulating expenses associated with administering the estate in chapter million during the period from september to january the parties continuing failure to reach a confirmable plan of liquidation.the trustee believed the expenses would continue to reduce the assets available to the creditors,who would otherwise be entitled to prompt distribution of the remaining cash if the case were conducted under chapter instead of chapter.see in re bell,cir primary purpose of chapter trustee is to collect,liquidate and distribute estate property thereby closing the estate as expeditiously as is compatible with the best interests of the parties internal punctuation omitted.
the bankruptcy court concluded at the february hearing that the trustee had shown cause for conversion.however,the court continued the conversion hearing until march,to give the debtors and creditors one last chance to negotiate a confirmable plan.the parties returned to court on march without having agreed on a satisfactory plan.by that time,even the creditors committee believed conversion to chapter was appropriate and had,in fact,filed its own motion for conversion.only loop and the debtors opposed.
relying on its earlier finding of cause and on the creditors committee new support for conversion,the bankruptcy court granted the motion to convert.loop appealed the bankruptcy court conversion order to the district court,which affirmed.loop now appeals the district court affirmance.
although loop divides its appeal into six separate arguments,we understand it to raise two real issues first,that the bankruptcy court erred by interpreting b in a manner that loop believes makes it impossible for liquidating debtors to remain in chapter and second,that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by improperly applying b in this case.
the trustee and creditors committee moved for conversion of the debtors liquidating chapter cases to chapter despite the assertion by loop and the debtors that a chapter liquidation would provide greater recovery for the creditors.the bankruptcy court granted the motion to convert because it believed cause existed under b,which states in part 
o n request of a party in interest or the united states trustee or bankruptcy administrator,and after notice and a hearing,the court may convert a case under this chapter to a case under chapter of this title or may dismiss a case under this chapter,whichever is in the best interest of creditors and the estate,for cause,including 
continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and absence of a reasonable likelihood of rehabilitation 
inability to effectuate a plan 
the bankruptcy court concluded that cause existed under b because,first,the ongoing expenses associated with administering the estate and attempting to negotiate a confirmable plan constituted continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and,second,the debtors were liquidating and therefore had no likelihood of rehabilitation the court also provided several reasons why it considered chapter to be better for creditors than chapter,including the court uncertainty about the parties ability to negotiate a confirmable plan and concern about the costs associated with staying in chapter.
we sit as a second court of review in bankruptcy matters and apply the same standards of review as the district court.see in re clark,cir.we review the bankruptcy court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.see in re cedar shore resort,cir.the bankruptcy court has broad discretion in deciding whether to dismiss or convert a chapter case.in re lumber exch,cir.
loop argues that,taken together,the bankruptcy court interpretations of continuing loss to or diminution of the estate and rehabilitation mean that cause for conversion to chapter will automatically exist whenever a debtor seeks to liquidate under chapter.first,loop asserts,a liquidating debtor will inevitably have a negative cash flow,which the bankruptcy court determined was sufficient to find continuing loss to or diminution of the estate.second,a liquidating debtor will by definition have no likelihood of rehabilitation because the bankruptcy court understood that term to refer to the restoration of the debtor business operations,not the liquidation of the debtor assets.thus,unless the creditors or trustee decline to file a motion to convert,a debtor will never be able to liquidate in chapter.
we are unpersuaded by loop challenge to the bankruptcy court interpretation of continuing loss to or diminution of the estate.loop concedes that the debtors,as liquidating entities that had ceased their business operations but continued to incur administrative expenses,had a negative cash flow.under the interpretation of b consistently used in bankruptcy courts,this negative cash flow situation alone is sufficient to establish continuing loss to or diminution of the estate.see,in re schriock,continuing loss to or diminution of the estate can be established by showing that debtor incurred continuing losses or maintained negative cash flow after entry of the order for relief matter of white plains road,continuing loss or diminution illustrated by debtor continual negative cash flow see also collier on bankruptcy a i alan resnick henry sommer,eds.ed.if the debtor is operating with a sustained negative cash flow after entry of the order for relief,this fact is sufficient to support a finding that the debtor is experiencing a continuing loss to the estate.
we are convinced that this interpretation is correct,notwithstanding loop concern that a liquidating debtor will inevitably have a negative cash flow.the purpose of b is to preserve estate assets by preventing the debtor in possession from gambling on the enterprise at the creditors expense when there is no hope of rehabilitation.in re lizeric realty.in the context of a debtor who has ceased business operations and liquidated virtually all of its assets,any nega
