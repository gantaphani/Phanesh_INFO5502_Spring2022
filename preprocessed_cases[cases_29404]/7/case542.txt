opinion of the court 
the state of maryland and three maryland counties baltimore,montgomery,and prince george collectively the taxing authorities appeal from an order of the united states district court for the district of delaware affirming two orders of the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware.the first of these bankruptcy court orders declared that certain sales of real estate interests proposed by hechinger investment company of delaware,hechinger would be exempt under c from transfer and recording taxes imposed by the taxing authorities.the second order directed the taxing authorities to refund any transfer and recording taxes previously paid by purchasers of the real estate interests once the bankruptcy court confirmed hechinger reorganization plan.
agreeing with the only other court of appeals that has decided the issue,nvr homes,clerks of the circuit courts,cir,we hold that c does not apply to real estate transactions that occur prior to the confirmation of a plan under chapter of the bankruptcy code.we therefore reverse the order of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the relevant facts are undisputed.prior to its bankruptcy and cessation of operations,hechinger was a retailer of home and garden care products and services.app.at.in june,hechinger filed a voluntary petition for relief pursuant to chapter of the bankruptcy code,and in september of the same year,hechinger announced its plan to liquidate its assets and cease operations.
in october,hechinger filed a motion in the bankruptcy court requesting permission to sell its interests in certain real estate pursuant to and.hechinger proposed to make these sales prior to the confirmation of a plan of reorganization by the bankruptcy court under.the real estate interests at issue were all located within the taxing authorities borders.consequently,the taxing authorities under normal circumstances would have been able to collect transfer and recording taxes from the purchasers of those interests.hechinger motion sought a declaration by the bankruptcy court that the proposed sales would be exempt from these taxes on the ground that the sales constituted the making or delivery of instrument s of transfer under a plan confirmed under section of the bankruptcy code and thus could not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.c.
in november,hechinger filed another motion seeking the authority to sell its leasehold interest in real estate located in montgomery county,maryland.as in its october motion,hechinger proposed to make this sale prior to the confirmation of a reorganization plan,and hechinger again sought a declaration by the bankruptcy court that the sale would not be subject to state and county transfer and recording taxes.both the october and november motions were filed pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.as required by rule,the taxing authorities were served with the motions and informed of their opportunity to enter objections in the bankruptcy court.see fed.a b.
the taxing authorities subsequently filed such objections.first,the taxing authorities claimed that the bankruptcy court proceedings concerning the declarations sought by hechinger constituted a suit against the state of maryland under the eleventh amendment and were therefore barred.second,the taxing authorities maintained that the proposed declarations would effectively enjoin the collection of a tax imposed by state law in violation of the tax injunction act,finally,the taxing authorities argued that the proposed sales did not constitute deliver ies of instrument s of transfer under a plan confirmed under section of the bankruptcy code,as required by c,and that the proposed sales were thus ineligible for the tax exemption created by section c.the taxing authorities contended that a property interest that is sold prior to the confirmation of a reorganization plan is not transferred under a plan confirmed under section within the meaning of section c because a chapter plan must be confirmed before a property interest may be said to be sold under such a plan.
the bankruptcy court rejected the taxing authorities contentions and issued the requested declarations.two aspects of the bankruptcy court opinion are pertinent to this appeal.first,the bankruptcy court held that hechinger motions seeking the declarations were not suits within the meaning of the eleventh amendment.because the motions did not request the turnover of property already in possession of a state,the court reasoned,adjudication of the motions did not require the court to exercise jurisdiction over maryland.app.at.second,the bankruptcy court held that hechinger proposed sales were under a plan confirmed under section within the meaning of c,since a transfer that is essential to or an important component of the plan process,even if it occurs prior to plan confirmation,is under a plan within the meaning of c.id.at.hence,the bankruptcy court concluded,the proposed sales were exempt from the taxing authorities transfer and recording taxes.
the bankruptcy court order made the operation of the tax exemption in section c conditional upon that court eventual confirmation of a chapter plan.the bankruptcy court accordingly ordered hechinger to escrow proceeds from the sales sufficient to pay the transfer and recording taxes that the purchasers would have been required to pay absent the section c exemption.
hechinger subsequently sold an unknown number of real estate interests pursuant to the authorization granted by the bankruptcy court,and the purchasers of those interests paid transfer and recording taxes to the taxing authorities.in october,hechinger filed a motion requesting that the bankruptcy court clarify its prior order.hechinger asked the bankruptcy court to instruct the taxing authorities to refund the taxes paid by the purchasers as soon as the bankruptcy court confirmed hechinger proposed plan.the bankruptcy court granted hechinger motion in january,and directed the taxing authorities to refund any transfer and recording taxes paid by the purchasers once the bankruptcy court confirmed hechinger reorganization plan.the taxing authorities took an appeal to the district court.while the taxing authorities appeal to the district court was still pending,the bankruptcy court confirmed a plan of reorganization.in pertinent part,the plan required hechinger to transfer all of its assets to the hechinger liquidation trust the trust.
in march,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court orders for the reasons stated by the bankruptcy court.on the issue of the taxing authorities sovereign immunity,the district court held that the eleventh amendment did not preclude the issuance of the declarations because they did not mandate a direct recovery from a state treasury and thus did not require the bankruptcy court to exercise jurisdiction over the state of maryland.id.at.on the question whether c applied to the real estate sales at issue,the district court held that it is the fact of plan confirmation,rather than its timing,that is critical to a determination of whether a sale is under a plan confirmed under section of the bankruptcy code.id.at.so long as a plan authorizing a sale is eventually confirmed,the district court reasoned,the proceeds of the sale are not subject to transfer and recording taxes.thus,the district court held,it was proper for the bankruptcy court to order hechinger to escrow the sale proceeds until such time as the bankruptcy court made a final decision concerning hechinger proposed plan.the taxing authorities appealed the district court decision to this court.in june,we granted hechinger motion to substitute the trust for hechinger as the appellee in this appeal.
on appeal,the taxing authorities make two contentions.first,they claim that the rule proceedings concerning the propriety of the declarations violated the eleventh amendment.second,they maintain that section c does not exempt sales of real estate interests from state transfer and recording taxes where those sales are made prior to the confirmation of a plan.
as we detail further below,we believe that the bankruptcy court and the district court erred in holding that c exempts the real estate sales at issue here from the taxing authorities transfer and recording taxes.in view of this holding,we find it unnecessary to reach the question whether the bankruptcy court orders declaring the transactions to be violated the eleventh amendment.we will first explain why we are not required to reach the eleventh amendment question,and we will then show why section c does not exempt hechinger proposed transactions from the taxes at issue.
as noted above,the taxing authorities claim that the trust motions seeking the declarations issued by the bankruptcy court were suits commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states within the meaning of the eleventh amendment.the supreme court has stated that where a defendant successfully demonstrates that the eleventh amendment precludes a suit,the court in which the plaintiff filed the action lacks subject matter jurisdiction over that action.see seminole tribe florida,d stating that the eleventh amendment stands for the constitutional principle that state sovereign immunity limit s the federal courts jurisdiction under article iii blake kline,cir the eleventh amendment has been interpreted to bar jurisdictionally the federal courts from entertaining suits for damages when a state is the real party in interest.when subject matter jurisdiction is at issue,a federal court is generally required to reach the jurisdictional question before turning to the merits.see steel citizens for a better env,d rejecting the position previously taken by several courts of appeals that found it proper to proceed immediately to the merits question in a case despite jurisdictional objections larsen senate of the,cir a court that is without proper jurisdiction can not proceed at all,and must merely note the jurisdictional defect and dismiss the suit.
eleventh amendment immunity,however,has features that are atypical of doctrines that divest federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction.while no action of the parties can confer jurisdiction upon a federal court,insurance of ireland,compagnie des bauxites de guinee,d,a state may waive its eleventh amendment immunity.see atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d i f a state waives its immunity and consents to suit in federal court,the eleventh amendment does not bar the action.similarly,while a federal court is obligated to consider whether it possesses jurisdiction even if the issue is not raised by the parties,see insurance,at,a federal court need not address the issue of sovereign immunity if neither party brings it to the attention of the court.see wisconsin dep of corrections schacht,d t he eleventh amendment grants the state a legal power to assert a sovereign immunity defense should it choose to do so.the state can waive the defense.nor need a court raise the defect on its own.unless the state raises the matter,a court can ignore it.internal citations omitted.
these distinctions between eleventh amendment immunity and other doctrines that divest federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction have led at least two other courts of appeals to conclude that where a defendant argues that an action is barred by sovereign immunity,a federal court is not required to resolve that issue before adjudicating the merits of the action.see united states scs bus.tech,parella ret.bd.of the employees ret,cir.in addition,two other courts of appeals have bypassed eleventh amendment questions and decided appeals on other grounds pursuant to the doctrine that courts should avoid deciding constitutional questions whenever possible.see tyler douglas,cir floyd thompson,cir.other courts of appeals,however,have held that questions of sovereign immunity must be decided before reaching the merits of an appeal.see united states texas tech,cir seaborn of corrections,cir.
although there are reasonable arguments on both sides of the issue,we agree with the decisions of the district of columbia and first circuits noted above,and we therefore hold,for two reasons,that we are not required in this case to address the eleventh amendment issue before proceeding to the merits.
first,the premise of the holding in steel that a federal court has no power to entertain an action if article iii jurisdiction is lacking simply does not apply when the jurisdictional defect is the bar erected by the eleventh amendment.as noted,a federal court is not necessarily devoid of jurisdiction to entertain a claim to which the eleventh amendment applies.see schacht,at.rather,the eleventh amendment grants the state a legal power to assert a sovereign immunity defense should it choose to do so.id.since a federal court possesses the power to entertain such a claim if the state opts to waive or merely neglects to assert its eleventh amendment defense,it does not follow from the reasoning of steel that a federal court must address an asserted eleventh amendment defense before considering the merits of a case.see scs bus,at steel s rule is premised on a court lack of power to reach the merits without establishing its jurisdiction.in the eleventh amendment context,where a court lacks power only if a state claims that it does,it is arguable that we have no obligation to decide the eleventh amendment issue first if the state does not demand that we do so.spicer hilton,cir noting the paradox inherent in the fact that it is clearly established that the state sovereign immunity can be waived by the state,despite the principle that a waiver can not confer jurisdiction on a court which lacks subject matter jurisdiction.
second,we believe that the supreme court reasoning in calderon ashmus,d,supports the position we take here.the plaintiff in ashmus filed a class action challenging the application of certain time limits on the filing of habeas corpus petitions in capital cases.the district court granted declaratory and injunctive relief,the court of appeals affirmed,and the supreme court granted certiorari on the issues of whether the suit was barred by the eleventh amendment and whether the injunction issued by the district court violated the first amendment.
after granting review,the supreme court on its own motion raised the question whether the named plaintiff had standing under article iii to request a declaratory judgment,and the court stated that it was required to decide this standing question before reaching the eleventh amendment and first amendment issues.see ashmus,at.we granted certiorari on both the eleventh amendment and first amendment issues,but in keeping with our precedents,have decided that we must first address whether this action for a declaratory judgment is the sort of article iii case or controversy to which federal courts are limited.citing,dallas,d.
the supreme court treatment of the article iii standing issue in ashmus is important for present purposes because in ruhrgas ag marathon oil,d,the court held that federal courts are not generally obligated to address jurisdictional issues in any particular order.see ruhrgas,at.while steel reasoned that jurisdiction necessarily precedes a ruling on the merits,the same principle does not dictate a sequencing of jurisdictional issues.the language of the court in ruhrgas makes it clear that,by jurisdictional issues,the court meant those issues that a federal court must address before it possesses the power to reach the merits of an action.see id.at.observing that steel reasoned that jurisdiction necessarily precedes a ruling on the merits.if the eleventh amendment issue in ashmus had been one of the jurisdictional issues that must be decided before moving on to the merits,the ashmus court would not have been obligated to reach the article iii standing question before turning to the eleventh amendment question.the ashmus court statement that it was required to reach the standing issue first,however,suggests that steel does not require a federal court to consider an asserted eleventh amendment defense before reaching the merits.
this conclusion does not obscure the distinction between a defense based on sovereign immunity and a defense relating to the merits of an action.a sovereign immunity defense differs from a defense on the merits in the key respect that a defendant may raise the defense of sovereign immunity at any time in the absence of an explicit waiver.see edelman jordan,d stating that the eleventh amendment defense sufficiently partakes of the nature of a jurisdictional bar so that it need not be raised in the trial court ford motor of treasury.the eleventh amendment declares a policy and sets forth an explicit limitation on federal judicial power of such compelling force that this court will consider the issue arising under this amendment in this case even though urged for the first time in this court.hence,the notion that the doctrine of sovereign immunity is in some sense a jurisdictional bar retains significance.
for these reasons,we hold that we are not required to determine whether the eleventh amendment bars the trust action against the taxing authorities prior to reaching the question whether the real estate sales at issue here are protected by the c tax exemption.we therefore turn to the primary issue in this appeal,the proper interpretation of section c.
title united states code,c,provides as follows 
the issuance,transfer,or exchange of a security,or the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a plan confirmed under section of this title,may not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.
c.there is no dispute that the property sales at issue here involved the making or delivery of instrument s of transfer or that the taxing authorities transfer and recording taxes are stamp taxes or similar taxes.nor is there any dispute that approval of the sales was sought under the authority of and,not,and that the bankruptcy court had not confirmed a plan under section at the time of the sales,although it later did so.the disputed question is whether the sales were carried out under the eventually confirmed plan.
the trust argues that the sales in question here occurred under the plan even though the plan had not been confirmed at the time of the sales.according to the trust,a transfer occurs under a plan confirmed if two criteria are met.first,the transfer must be necessary to effect the confirmation of a plan.brief for appellee at second,the bankruptcy court must eventually confirm a chapter plan that retroactively authorizes the transfer at issue.see brief for appellee at.thus,under the trust reading of section c,a debtor who sells real estate interests before the confirmation of a plan may still benefit from the section c tax exemption so long as the bankruptcy court eventually confirms a plan that covers the sale of those interests.
in interpreting section c,we look first to the language of the provision.see health maintenance org.whitman,cir in re segal,cir.as noted above,section c speaks of the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a plan confirmed under.the preposition under is of course very common,and it can have many different meanings in different contexts.see webster third new international dictionary of the english language,unabridged listing different definitions random house dictionary of the english language unabridged ed listing definitions.after considering all of these definitions,we believe that the most natural reading of the phrase under a plan confirmed in c is authorized by such a plan.see random house dictionary at.when an action is said to be taken under a provision of law or a document having legal effect,what is generally meant is that the action is authorized by the provision of law or legal document.thus,if a claim is asserted under,section provides the authority for the claim.if a motion is made under.b,that rule provides the authority for the motion.if benefits are paid under a pension or welfare plan,the payments are authorized by the plan.
on this reading,if an instrument of transfer is made or delivered under a plan,the plan must provide the authority for the transaction.but the transfers at issue in this case were not made under the authority of the plan that was eventually confirmed.rather,they were made under the authority of and.since the plan had not been confirmed at the time of the transfers,the plan could not provide the legal authority for the transfers,and the legality of those transfers was not dependent upon eventual confirmation.
although we believe that authorized by is the most natural reading of the term under in the phrase under a plan confirmed,we do not go so far as to say that this is the only plausible interpretation of that term.for example,an accepted definition of the preposition under is in accordance with,and accordance may mean agreement.random house dictionary at.thus,we can not say that the language of section c rules out the possibility that under a plan confirmed means in agreement with a plan confirmed.on this reading,a sale of real estate could be said to be in accordance with a plan if the sale,although actually carried out under the authority of some other provision of law such as or,is later listed as part of a plan that is confirmed.nevertheless,we find at least two other reasons for interpreting the phrase under a plan confirmed to mean authorized by such a plan 
first,that reading fits best with the remaining language of section c.it is a normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.sorenson sec.of the treasury,d quoting helvering stockholms enskilda bank.this canon logically has added force where identical words appear more than once in the same provision.section c uses the word under three times in the same sentence.as noted above,section c provides that the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer under a plan confirmed under section of this title,may not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.c emphasis added.it is apparent that the term under in confirmed under section means confirmed pursuant to the authority granted by section.it is similarly clear that the term under in may not be taxed under any law means may not be taxed pursuant to the authority of any such law.consequently,reading the first under in this sentence in under a plan confirmed to mean pursuant to the authority conferred by such a plan gives the term under a single,consistent meaning throughout section c 
second,this interpretation gives the phrase under a plan confirmed the same meaning as an identical phrase in another provision of the bankruptcy code,g.this provision speaks of the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease under a plan confirmed under chapter,or of this title.g.it seems clear that this language means a plan that is confirmed pursuant to the authority conferred by those chapters.for these reasons,we believe that the phrase under a plan confirmed in c was most likely intended to mean authorized by a plan confirmed.
even if the language of section c is ambiguous,however,two important canons of construction support our interpretation.first,tax exemption provisions are to be strictly construed.see united states centennial savings bank fsb,d t and deferral provisions are to be construed narrowly.united states wells fargo bank,d e xemptions from taxation must be unambiguously proved.united states trust helvering.exemptions from taxation do not rest upon implication.second,federal laws that interfere with a state taxation scheme must be narrowly construed in favor of the state.see private truck council oklahoma tax comm,d noting the strong background presumption against federal interference with state taxation california state bd.of equalization sierra summit,d a court must proceed carefully when asked to recognize an exemption from state taxation that congress has not clearly expressed.nvr homes,clerks of the circuit courts,cir wilkinson,concurring if congress wished to exempt a bankrupt from state and municipal taxation,the intention would be clearly expressed,not left to be collected or inferred from disputable considerations of convenience in administering the estate of the bankrupt.quoting swarts hammer.since section c both constitutes a tax exemption and interferes with the state of maryland scheme of property taxation,we must construe section c in the taxing authorities favor all of these reasons weigh in favor of interpreting the phrase under a plan confirmed in c to mean made pursuant to the authority conferred by such a plan,and since an unconfirmed plan can not confer such authority,this interpretation means that a transfer made prior to plan confirmation can not qualify for tax exemption under c.
we have considered the alternative interpretation advanced by the trust,but we reject that construction.as noted above,the trust argues that made under a plan confirmed means necessary for the confirmation of a plan that is eventually confirmed.although the preposition under can have many different meanings,no accepted definition of that term corresponds to the meaning that the trust advocates.
of the many possible definitions of the preposition under,the trust points to the following as supporting its position 
covered by,beneath the heading or within the category of,subject to the authority,direction,or supervision of,protected,controlled,or watched by,authorized,warranted,or attested by,or in accordance with.
brief for appellee at quoting random house unabridged dictionary ed.but not one of these definitions corresponds to the trust definition,necessary for.for example,the statement that a sale is covered by a plan that is later confirmed would presumably mean that the sale is required or permitted by the terms of the plan.thus,the statement that the sale is covered by the plan would not in any way suggest that the sale was necessary for confirmation of the plan.similarly,the statement that a sale is in accordance with a plan would not suggest that the sale was necessary for confirmation.the interpretation advanced by the trust and adopted by the bankruptcy and district courts simply can not be squared with the statutory language.
in support of its interpretation,the trust cites the second circuit decision in in re,cir,and numerous district court and bankruptcy court decisions relying on.see brief for appellee at citing in re baldwin league of indep,in re smoss enters,in re lopez,in re permar provisions.the trust characterizes the decision in as holding that a sale is exempt from taxes under c so long as the sale is necessary to the consummation of a plan.id.at quoting,at.
the trust quotation of the second circuit language is correct,but the conclusion that the trust draws from the quoted language is not.in,a bankruptcy court confirmed a debtor proposed reorganization plan pursuant to.the debtor subsequently sold real property located in new york state and claimed that the section c tax exemption protected the sale from state real property transfer taxes because the sale was authorized by the confirmed plan.the state argued that the confirmed plan did not authorize the sale because the plan did not mention any instrument of transfer and did not give the debtor the authority to make the specific sale,at.the second circuit disagreed with the state,holding that since section c does not require that the reorganization plan include specifics and the sale at issue was necessary to the consummation of the plan,the confirmed plan authorized the sale.id.the decision thus resolved the issue of whether the sale was authorized by the terms of the previously confirmed plan,not whether the sale was necessary to achieving the plan confirmation.the second circuit statement that the debtor sale of real property was necessary to the consummation of the plan simply meant that the language of the plan,or the implications thereof,required the sale to occur.accordingly,does not support the proposition that section c protects transfers that are necessary or essential to the subsequent confirmation of a plan.see also nvr homes,at disapproving the practice of extend ing the second circuit language and alter ing s holding,changing the test from necessary to the consummation of a plan,to necessary to the confirmation of a plan.since we disagree with the trust reading of the decision,we also disagree with the district court and bankruptcy court decisions that have adopted the trust reading.
the trust argues that the language of other sections of the bankruptcy code supports its interpretation of section c.the trust approvingly quotes the bankruptcy court statement that w hen congress wants to impose a temporal condition on a bankruptcy transaction,it does so expressly.app.at citing a authorizing a bankruptcy court to appoint a trustee a t any time after the commencement of the case but before confirmation of a plan b o nly the debtor may file a plan until after days after the date of the order for relief under this chapter.we are not impressed with this argument.if,as we conclude,the phrase under a plan confirmed means authorized by a plan confirmed,no temporal issue is raised,because it is beyond dispute that the transfers at issue were not made on the authority of a plan but on the authority of other provisions of the bankruptcy code.even if no plan had ever been confirmed,that would not have called into question the validity of the transfers.
the trust finally maintains that permitting transfers to benefit from the section c tax exemption would best implement the policies underlying chapter of the bankruptcy code.the trust contends that congress enacted c to encourage chapter plans by providing chapter debtors with tax relief when they are compelled by business realities to sell certain assets.brief for appellee at.limiting the section c tax exemption to transfers,the trust contends,would not serve congress purposes,because such an approach would not adequately assist debtors in obtaining creditors approval of proposed reorganization plans.
we are not persuaded by this argument.needless to say,it is not for us to substitute our view of policy for the legislation which has been passed by congress.united parcel,united states postal,cir.moreover,as is often the case in disputes about the interpretation of legislation that affects the economic interests of different groups,the opposing sides both cite policies that congress might have wished to further when it enacted the law at issue.in opposition to the trust policy arguments,the amici curiae note that limiting the section c exemption to transfers under a confirmed plan create s an incentive for early confirmation.brief for amici curiae at.in addition,the taxing authorities preferred interpretation limits the bankruptcy code interference with state revenue collection.see in re,stating that a taxing authority should not be required to wait until some indeterminate time when there may be a plan before collecting the taxes which it was entitled to collect at the time of the transfer see also.private truck council oklahoma tax comm,d noting the strong background presumption against federal interference with state taxation.
for all these reasons,we hold that a real estate transaction is made under a plan confirmed under section only where the sale is authorized by the terms of a previously confirmed chapter plan.since the real estate transactions at issue here were made pursuant to the authority conferred by other bankruptcy code provisions and occurred before the confirmation of a plan,those transactions were not entitled to the section c exemption from stamp taxes and similar taxes.
for the reasons explained above,we reverse the judgment of the district court,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
although this all may at first appear to be a splitting of grammatical hairs,i believe that the majority misinterpretation of c under a plan confirmed,of sufficient significance to warrant separately expressing my views.hence,i dissent.i do not think this phrase places a temporal restriction on the qualifying transactions.instead,i read the phrase to be a description of eligible under a plan the transfer occurred before or after confirmation.as the bankruptcy court and district court did in this case,i look to the structure and purpose of the bankruptcy code,and conclude that the transfers here should be excluded from taxation under c.
c is ambiguous 
we begin every statutory interpretation by looking to the plain language of the statute.when the language is clear,no further inquiry is necessary unless applying the plain language leads to an absurd result.in re resorts int l,cir citations omitted.however,even where the statutory language initially appears plain,application of the statute may reveal its ambiguity.see,united states doe,cir.this is such a case.although the statute might be read to apply only to those transactions that take place following confirmation,this case illustrates the ambiguity of c.at oral argument the parties averred that there was a proposed plan at the time the bankruptcy court approved these transactions.the court subsequently confirmed the plan.therefore,the transactions,though,took place under a plan confirmed.
reduced to its most basic elements,c states that,the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer may not be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.but not every instrument of transfer is excluded from taxation.section c only excludes those under a plan confirmed under section.although the statute uses the past tense of confirm,the statute need not be read to place a temporal restriction on when the confirmation of the plan must take place,just that the plan must at some point be confirmed for the transfer to be exempt.to be unambiguous,the statute would need to contain an auxiliary verb stating the temporal restriction.for example,under a plan that was confirmed under,or under a plan that will be confirmed under.without such a clarification the statute can just as plausibly be read as a description of eligible transfers,those under a plan confirmed regardless of when the plan is confirmed.
ii.statutory interpretation 
under a plan confirmed 
lacking an auxiliary verb to place a temporal restriction on the exemption,the parties struggle to define the word under in the statute.i start with what under in under a plan in c does not mean.the appellants define under to create a temporal restriction.they argue under means authorized by.here,the bankruptcy court approved the transactions under.therefore,since the transactions here were not authorized by the confirmed plan,they are not under a plan confirmed.the majority agrees that,among the many definitions of under,authorized is the meaning of under in c.see majority,supra at.
while authorized by is undoubtably one of the meanings of under,it is not unambiguously the meaning of under throughout c.when congress clearly meant authorized in the code,it used authorized.in at least nineteen sections of the code,congress used authorized,and in several sections it even used authorized under.see,accountant means accountant authorized under applicable law b participate in programs authorized under such act c if the business of the debtor is authorized to be operated under various section s b participate in programs authorized under the higher education act.this illustrates that under can not be read in isolation.for example,under in under a plan may have a different meaning than under in authorized under.
more important,the majority reading of under a plan can not be consistently applied throughout the bankruptcy code,particularly in reference to confirmation.the code accepts that some transactions may take place prior to confirmation and still be under a plan.section sets out the requirements for confirmation,including a the court shall confirm a plan only if any payment made or to be made by the proponent,by the debtor,or by a person issuing securities or acquiring property under the plan in connection with the plan and incident to the case,has been approved by,or is subject to the approval of,the court as reasonable.a emphasis added.if under the plan means authorized by an already confirmed plan,then there could never be a payment made under a plan prior to confirmation.such a reading would read out the past tense made in the above phrase.instead,a more consistent reading of the code suggests that a purchase or sale under the plan does not require prior confirmation of the plan.as the majority notes,in accordance with is an acceptable definition of under and a sale of real estate could be said to be in accordance with with a plan that is confirmed after the sale occurs.majority,supra at.
the majority looks to the repeated use of under c and concludes that authorized by makes the most sense in each instance.typically words should have the same meaning as they are used throughout the code.see sorenson sec.of the treasury,d.however,under is used in nearly two hundred different sections of the bankruptcy code.when under can be a preposition,adverb,adjective,noun,or verb,see webster new international dictionary of the english language,unabridged,ed,and it is used so frequently,this may be a case where this canon of statutory interpretation is of little value.see,kapral united states,cir of course,canons of construction are not absolute and must yield when other indicia of congressional intent suggest a different result.again,the key is that under can not be read in isolation,it must be read as part of the phrase under a plan.
only by reading under as authorized by does the statute place a temporal restriction on the transfers.however,when congress wanted to apply a temporal restriction in the code,it knew how to do so,and did do expressly.see,a at any time after the commencement of the case but before confirmation of a plan at any time before confirmation of a plan b only the debtor may file a plan until after days after the date of the order for relief.nonetheless,if the statute is unambiguous,it unambiguously does not place a temporal restriction on qualifying transfers.a definition of under that does not unduly limit the qualifying transfers is supported by the statutory intent,consistent reading of the code,and bankruptcy reality.
reading tax exemptions narrowly the remedial purpose of the bankruptcy code 
the appellants encourage us to apply the canon of interpretation to read tax exemptions narrowly.see,ba props.gov t of the united states,cir.but we are not to abrogate the purpose of the exemption through too narrow an application.see id.a reflexive adherence to this canon without careful examination of the exemption in question may result in an abdication of the judiciary responsibility to interpret statutes in ways that are faithful to legislative intent.a s a general rule grants of tax exemptions are given a strict interpretation against the assertions of the taxpayer and in favor of the taxing power but it is equally true that such interpretation may not be so literal and narrow as to defeat the exemption purpose.moreover,a remedial statute such as the bankruptcy law should be liberally construed.in re cca partnership,citing sutherland,statutory construction,ed.section c,which applies only to chapter cases,was clearly intended to provide relief to debtors when they were compelled to sell assets under the plan.our reading of the statute should comport with this intent 
in its opinion,the bankruptcy court described at length the reality of plan proposal and confirmation.the bankruptcy court lists four basic scenarios leading to plan confirmation.the debtor may a transfer all of its properties via a going concern sale authorized by a confirmed liquidating plan.in the alternative,the debtor may b transfer property prior to confirmation of the plan.this typically occurs because the debtor has no reasonable prospects for reorganization,is in a severe negative cash flow situation and can not await the plan confirmation process if the estate is to realize going concern value in the disposition of the business.in re hechinger.this would still result in a liquidating plan.instead of a liquidating plan,the debtor may restructure.here,the debtor may c transfer some of its via a restructuring or downsizing,as authorized by a confirmed plan.again,in the alternative,the debtor may d transfer some property done as a part of a formulated business plan to emerge from chapter with the transfer taking place prior to the filing of,or confirmation of,a plan.the disposition may be prom
