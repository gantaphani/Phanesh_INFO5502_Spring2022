this appeal concerns the narrow issue of whether,in a chapter reorganization proceeding,a creditor who fails to appeal a order appointing a trustee is precluded from challenging the trustee appointment when the trustee subsequently obtains an order affecting the creditor interests.this issue arises on an appeal by kenneth silverman,trustee for the debtor american preferred prescription app from the september,order of the district court for the eastern district of new york denis hurley,district judge reversing an order of the bankruptcy court dorothy eisenberg,bankruptcy judge.the bankruptcy court had denied the motion of tracar,tracar,a creditor,to remove silverman as trustee.the district court ruled that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to appoint a trustee after the confirmation of the debtor reorganization plan.we conclude that tracar had an opportunity to challenge the appointment of silverman by appealing the appointment order giving him full trustee powers,and,having failed to do so,is now precluded from challenging his authority.we therefore reverse and remand.
app operates a mail order pharmaceutical service.in june,app filed a chapter reorganization petition.in march,the bankruptcy court confirmed app plan of reorganization plan,which provided for the full payment of all allowed claims with interest.in the order confirming the plan,the court also reserve d and retain ed jurisdiction in accordance with articles and of the plan and the provisions of the bankruptcy code and bankruptcy rules and retained the authority to make such orders to aid in the consummation of the plan or in accordance with said plan as the court shall deem appropriate.
the confirmed plan contains a lengthy retention of jurisdiction section.this section provides the court shall retain jurisdiction of this chapter case pursuant to and for the purposes set forth in section b of the code,and then sets out a broad list of reserved tasks and powers,including the power to make such orders as are necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the plan,including but not limited to orders interpreting,clarifying or enforcing the provisions thereof,article q.however,the plan does not contain a clause explicitly authorizing the court to appoint a trustee.
appointment of the trustee.the appointment of a trustee for app arose out of developments in the chapter proceeding of american prescription plan,ap plan.cost controls,cost controls,a creditor of ap plan,discovered that ap plan was trying to evade its bankruptcy obligations by funneling assets to app.cost controls then brought an adversary action against app in app chapter proceeding.that action was adjudicated by bankruptcy judge francis conrad,who ruled in cost controls favor,finding that app and ap plan were alter egos and that the common principals of both companies were fraudulently diverting assets from ap plan to app to bypass ap plan creditors.he entered judgment in favor of cost controls against app for compensatory and punitive damages.
apprehending that app principals would defraud app creditors,as they had done to the creditors of ap plan,cost controls asked judge eisenberg to appoint a trustee to monitor app assets pending the execution of the plan.
on april,judge eisenberg appointed silverman as trustee,rejecting app objection that section of the bankruptcy code authorizes the appointment of a trustee only before confirmation of a reorganization plan.she ruled that she had authority to appoint a trustee by virtue of the court broad equitable powers codified in section of the bankruptcy code.however,she indicated that she envisioned the trustee operating merely in a watchdog capacity.she emphasized that app appeared to be operating profitably,and that she hesitated to jeopardize this success by inserting an operating trustee with full powers.
she therefore ruled that she would continue a previously issued temporary restraining order prohibiting the debtor from transferring any of its property outside its ordinary course of business,and she authorized the trustee to look at all of the company expenditures and have access to all of its books and records.however,she did not give the trustee the power to veto any expenditures implicating substantial business decisions or anything out of the ordinary course without first obtaining court approval.no appeal was taken from the april,order 
expansion of the trustee powers.the bankruptcy court expanded the trustee powers twice in the ensuing months.the first expansion came after silverman initial report in june of detailed further instances of wrongdoing by app and its principals.app creditors among them cost controls requested that silverman powers be expanded to include the authority to investigate and settle claims.the court granted this motion,emphasizing that silverman settlements would not be binding without an order of the court.no appeal was taken from this order.
the second expansion occurred in the aftermath of an adversary proceeding,filed by the trustee,seeking the consolidation of app with its parents and affiliates,and proposing a settlement of the cost controls claim.the court ordered silverman to negotiate with app and its affiliates.these negotiations resulted in the secured guarantee and subordination agreement,approved november.in this agreement,app,its affiliates,and some of its subordinated lenders called subordinated guarantors,including tracar,pledged their assets for the payment of the allowed claims,subordinated their claims to app other creditors,and irrevocably consent ed to the continuing jurisdiction of the united states bankruptcy court in connection with any dispute arising hereunder,and waive d any right to object to such jurisdiction on the basis of forum non conveniens,or otherwise.subordination agreement g.
shortly after the effective date of the subordination agreement,the trustee reported to the court that app and the other guarantors had breached the agreement in several respects.the court held extensive hearings,and concluded that they had breached the agreement by,among other things,diverting profitable business to an affiliate.on june,the court granted the trustee request to substantively consolidate app and the subordinated guarantors,including tracar.
on june,the bankruptcy court enlarged the trustee powers to that of a full operating trustee,in light of evidence of rampant fraud and diversion of assets that had been uncovered during the hearings of the previous few months.the parties seem to agree that at this point,the trustee had powers equivalent to those of a trustee appointed pursuant to.no appeal was taken from this order the june order.
silverman sought and received permission to sell the assets of the consolidated debtors.in the course of hearings in the bankruptcy court concerning the sale,questions arose as to the validity of tracar claims.the court extended the trustee time to object to claims.the trustee then moved to expunge tracar claims as fraudulent.after holding hearings,the court granted the motion,finding that the loan documents supporting tracar claims were fabricated by one of app principals.
challenges to the trustee.app twice filed papers challenging the trustee.in may,before the first expansion of the trustee powers,app contended that,because of changed circumstances,the trustee was no longer necessary.in january,after the initial expansion of the trustee powers,app sought the trustee removal for alleged malfeasance.tracar,the appellee in the pending appeal,participated in the hearing on this second application.the bankruptcy court rejected both challenges,neither of which was appealed.
on may,eleven months after the june order giving silverman full trustee powers,tracar filed a motion with the bankruptcy court challenging the court authority to appoint the trustee.judge eisenberg denied the motion.tracar appealed to the district court,which reversed the bankruptcy court.judge hurley concluded that the bankruptcy court had tried to sidestep section a of the bankruptcy code,which authorizes the appointment of a trustee a t any time after the commencement of the case but before confi
