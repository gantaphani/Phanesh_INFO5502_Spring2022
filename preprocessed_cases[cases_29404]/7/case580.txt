opinion of the court 
in this bankruptcy appeal,the issue is whether plaintiffs should have obtained a stay under m of the bankruptcy code before appealing an assumption and an assignment under.see m.
this appeal arises from the district court affirmance of the bankruptcy court order approving the assumption of eight physician employment contracts by the chapter trustee of a bankrupt health care system and their assignment to another hospital contending their employment contracts were not assignable,the physicians appealed.
factual and procedural history 
the allegheny health,education and research foundation aherf,the parent corporation,managed a healthcare network in pittsburgh and philadelphia.after a decade of acquisitions,the health system grew to more than fifty corporations that operated health care,educational and research institutions.the enterprises included allegheny university medical practices,allegheny university of the health sciences,allegheny general hospital,allegheny university,centennial hospital,allegheny singer research institute,allegheny university medical center,and the medical college of university.especially relevant here were aherf physician practice plans located in the pittsburgh area.
john cinicola and seven primary care physicians,operate the north allegheny internal medicine medical practice in several locations around pittsburgh between and,the physicians signed contracts with allegheny integrated health group now allegheny university medical practices,and the medical college of pennsylvania hahnemann university now allegheny university of the health sciences both aherf affiliates.
after aherf incurred significant losses,many of its affiliates and hospitals in philadelphia and pittsburgh filed for bankruptcy on july,some months after his confirmation,william scharffenberger,aherf chapter trustee,together with some aherf affiliates,filed an emergency application with the bankruptcy court to approve a settlement agreement.for our purposes,the germane provisions of the settlement agreement involved the sale of assets and the assignment of executory contracts,for over,to the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance.to assume control of several of aherf institutions that did not file for bankruptcy,in particular allegheny general hospital,the settlement agreement substituted the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance for aherf as the institutions sole voting member the settlement agreement also provided for the assignment of the physicians employment contracts from allegheny university medical practices and allegheny university of the health sciences to the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance,which at the time had no affiliation with aherf.
in response,the physicians filed omnibus objections with the bankruptcy court alleging the proposed assumption and assignment of their contracts to the western pennsylvania healthcare their their employment agreements prohibiting assignment to a of aherf moreover,contesting western pennsylvania healthcare alliance financial viability,the physicians asserted adequate assurance of western pennsylvania healthcare alliance future performance of their contracts had not been provided as required by f of the bankruptcy code.see f b trustee may assign executory contracts only if adequate assurance of future performance by the assignee of such contract or lease is provided,whether or not there has been default in such contract or lease.after holding a hearing on july,the bankruptcy court issued an order the following day,july,approving the settlement agreement the first order,but deferred deciding the assumption and assignment of the physicians contracts in order to address their objections.
at a hearing on july,to consider the physicians objections,the bankruptcy court allowed the trustee to orally amend the settlement agreement to permit the physicians contracts to be assigned to allegheny general hospital,at the time an aherf affiliate this substitution was critical because the contracts explicitly prohibited assignment to an entity,like the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance,not affiliated with aherf.after the hearing,the bankruptcy court authorized the assumption of the physicians contracts and their assignment to allegheny general hospital the second order.later that same day,the trustee assigned the contracts to allegheny general hospital.the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance then closed on the settlement agreement on august,substituting the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance for aherf as the sole and controlling member of allegheny general hospital.
without seeking a stay,the physicians appealed the bankruptcy court second order to the district court on august.as noted,the trustee and the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance closed on the settlement agreement two days earlier.before the district court ruled on their appeal,however,the physicians terminated their employment with allegheny general hospital effective october.on february,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court second order which assigned the employment agreements to allegheny general hospital.the physicians then appealed the assumption and assignment to this court.
because the sale can not be reversed,the physicians seek vacation of the bankruptcy court order approving the assumption and assignment of their employment contracts.appellees contend the physicians claims are constitutionally moot because the sale has been consummated and statutorily moot under m because the physicians failed to obtain a stay pending appeal.
as noted,the physicians unilaterally terminated their contracts with allegheny general hospital,now a western pennsylvania healthcare alliance affiliate.it became clear at oral argument that the physicians seek to invalidate the assignment of their employment contracts to avoid the noncompetition clauses in their contracts that allegheny general hospital would now assert the noncompetition clauses prohibit the physicians from working anywhere within a five mile radius of any medical practice location at which they provided primary care services for aherf or its affiliates.the covenants arguably bar the physicians from joining allegheny general hospital main competitor in pittsburgh and terminate on october,two years after the last date of their employment.id.when the noncompetition clauses expire,the physicians concede their appeal becomes constitutionally moot.
constitutional mootness 
because the physicians unilaterally terminated their employment,the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance and the trustee contend the physicians appeal is constitutionally moot.in the absence of current employment contracts,appellees assert there remains neither a claim to adjudicate nor relief to grant.
under article iii of the united states constitution,the exercise of judicial power depends upon the existence of a case or controversy.defunis odegaard,d watson,cir.mootness derives from article iii prohibition against federal courts issuing advisory opinions.north carolina rice,d presbytery of of the orthodox presbyterian church florio,cir.while the supreme court has spoken of the flexible character of the article iii mootness doctrine,united states parole comm.geraghty,d,it applies where interim events remove the effects of the violation that prevent the appellate court from granting any relief.in re cantwell,cir.
to avoid mootness,a claim must present a real legal controversy,genuinely affect an individual,and have sufficiently adverse parties.iranian oil mapco int l,cir int l of boilermakers kelly,cir.if the parties have an interest in the outcome of the litigation,regardless of size,we have found a live case or controversy exists.ellis of,airline and clerks,d mapco,at.thus,the case will be moot only if it is impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief.church of scientology of cal.united states,d citation and internal quotes omitted in re pws holding,cir.
for constitutional mootness to apply,the physicians must have raised no claim on which relief could be granted.we believe relief may be available here.if assignment of their contracts is vacated,the physicians may have a claim for rejection damages furthermore,the covenants not to compete in the physicians contracts may survive their resignations.see in re klein,holding covenant not to compete in rejected franchise agreement remained effective insofar as it was enforceable under applicable law in re steaks to go,holding covenants not to compete in rejected franchise agreements remained enforceable.moreover,allegheny general hospital belies its own mootness argument by unequivocally stating its intention to enforce the noncompetition clauses.see supra note.because potential contractual obligations and damages claims remain,we hold the physicians claims are not constitutionally moot.
statutory background 
as noted,the trustee assumed the physician contracts and then assigned them to allegheny general hospital.the physicians appeal the assignment.before addressing the legal issues raised by the assignment,we briefly review the relevant sections of the bankruptcy code.
section of the bankruptcy code authorizes the trustee to assume or reject executory contracts,enabling the trustee to maximize the value of the debtor estate by assuming executory contracts that benefit the estate and rejecting those that do not.rickel home centers in re rickel home centers,cir see also a t he trustee,subject to the court approval,may assume or reject any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor.it also permits the trustee to cure certain defaults before assumption and to provide adequate assurance of future performance of contracts in default.b a,b.if the trustee meets the assumption requirements under,it must assume the executory contract entirely nlrb bildisco bildisco,d rickel,at.
once the trustee assumes an executory contract,also authorizes assignment.generally,the bankruptcy code supports this right and allows a trustee to assume and assign executory contracts regardless of applicable laws or contractual provisions restricting assignment.rickel,at in re headquarters dodge,cir section f was designed to prevent or other clauses from defeating the trustee ability to realize the full value of the debtor assets.see also f n otwithstanding a provision in an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,or in applicable law,that prohibits,restricts,or conditions the assignment of such contract or lease,the trustee may assign such contract or lease.before an executory contract may be assigned,the trustee first must assume the contract and adequate assurance of future performance of the contract must be provided.f a,b.this requirement provides needed protection to the party because the assignment relieves the trustee and the bankruptcy estate from liability for breaches arising after the assignment see k rickel,at.
there are other protections as well.section c places constraints on the assignment rights created under f and prohibits the assumption or assignment of an executory contract if applicable nonbankruptcy law would excuse the other party from accepting performance from or rendering performance to someone other than the debtor c a.in other words,if a contract could not be assigned under applicable law,it may not be assumed or assigned by the trustee.collier on bankruptcy.but if the other party this case,the trustee may assume and assign the contract.c b 
for sales in bankruptcy,authorizes the trustee to use,sell,or lease property of the estate outside the ordinary course of business after providing notice and hearing.b.the bankruptcy code broadly defines the property of the bankruptcy estate to include all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.executory contracts and leases also fall under this definition.rickel,at krebs,valley motors,cir.
to promote certainty and finality in bankruptcy sales,m prohibits the reversal of a sale to a good faith purchaser of bankruptcy estate property if a party failed to obtain a stay of the sale the statute provides 
the reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization of a sale or lease of property does not affect the validity of a sale or lease under such authorization to an entity that purchased or leased such property in good faith,whether or not such entity knew of the pendency of the appeal,unless such authorization and such sale or lease were stayed pending appeal.
the provision blunt finality is harsh but its certainty attracts investors and helps effectuate debtor rehabilitation.see collier on bankruptcy.nevertheless,we have rejected a per se rule mooting appeals absent a stay of the sale at issue.krebs,at holding failure to obtain stay of order approving sale of executory contracts by debtor rendered appeal moot because any remedy would affect sale.instead,we require the satisfaction of two conditions before an appeal becomes moot under m the underlying sale or lease must not have been stayed pending appeal,and reversing or modifying the authorization to sell would affect the validity of the sale or lease.rickel,at holding failure to obtain stay order approving sale of leases by debtor rendered appeal moot pittsburgh food beverage,at holding appeal of bankruptcy sale moot because court could not grant effective relief.
statutory mootness 
the trustee and the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance contend the physicians appeal is statutorily moot because the assignment of the physicians contracts triggered the protection of m.in support,appellees rely on our recent decisions in in re rickel home centers,cir,and krebs,valley motors,cir,which,they argue,require procuring a stay pending appeal to avoid mootness when an assignment and sale are authorized under and.
first we must examine whether m applies to the assignment of the physician contracts to allegheny general hospital and the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance subsequent substitution as the sole member of allegheny general hospital.rickel,at in re joshua slocum,cir.in other words,we must decide whether aherf assumption and assignment of these executory contracts to allegheny general hospital,which was later sold to the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance,remain exclusively under the scope of or trigger the protection of m as well.
to recapitulate,although the bankruptcy court authorized the assignment of the physicians contracts to allegheny general hospital under the second order issued july,the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance gained control of several aherf affiliates,including allegheny general hospital,under the authority of the first order issued july.entered under and,the first order authorized the substitution of the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance for aherf as the controlling member of allegheny general hospital.see order approving settlement agreement on july.as noted,aherf initially intended to assign the contracts directly to the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance.when the physicians objected,the bankruptcy court permitted the trustee to orally amend the settlement agreement to assign the physicians contracts to allegheny general hospital.this amendment enabled the trustee and the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance to achieve through a change of control what they could not accomplish through direct assignment.the physicians contend the amendment was improper.but we need not decide whether this maneuver invalidated the assignment.assuming the assignment was invalid,the physicians may have failed to perfect their right to appeal.
the bankruptcy code provides debtors with broad authority to assume and assign executory contracts,which we have defined as a contract under which the obligation of both the bankrupt and the other party to the contract are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach excusing the performance of the other.in re columbia gas,cir quoting sharon steel fuel gas distrib,cir neither party disputes the executory nature of the physicians employment contracts.moreover,permits the debtor to assume and assign executory contracts the trustee deems advantageous.f norton bankruptcy law and practice william norton,ed.although assignment requires the satisfaction of certain conditions,the bankruptcy code favors free assignability.rickel,at.
in addition,enables the debtor to sell property of the bankruptcy estate.norton bankruptcy law and practice.the broad definition of property of the bankruptcy estate encompasses all legal or equitable interests of the debtor,and includes executory contracts.a see also rickel,at krebs,at norton bankruptcy law and practice.once the debtor sells its property,m prohibits reversing a sale when a party fails to obtain a stay pending appeal,unless vacating or modifying the sale would not affect its validity.m krebs,at.
we first explored the relationship between and in krebs valley motors,cir.in krebs,we found an assumption of executory contracts implicated the mootness protection of a sale under m when a bankrupt automobile dealer sought authorization to assume and sell certain franchise agreements.after winning an auction to purchase the assumed franchise agreements from the debtor,krebs,another automobile dealer,refused to pay the bankruptcy estate.the bankruptcy court then ordered him to close on the sale,and,in an effort to avoid this obligation,krebs appealed the debtor initial assumption of the agreements under as improper.after the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order,we held krebs appeal moot under m.finding the executory contracts constituted property of the estate under of the bankruptcy code and pennsylvania law,we also concluded that assignments of franchises under section are also sales of estate property subject to section m therefore,section m governs the sale of the franchises here,notwithstanding that section applies to the particular mechanics of conveyance.krebs,at emphasis added.to state it another way,the sale of an executory contract triggers the protections afforded sales of bankruptcy estate property but also requires satisfaction of the requirements for assuming assigning the same executory contract.rickel,at.in a subsequent case regarding the assignment and sale of leases by a debtor in bankruptcy,we reaffirmed the rationale in krebs.id.at.
there is a nexus between and.one court explained their correspondence 
even though assignments of executory contracts are governed by and not by the more general sales provision,assignments are in fact just a type of sale.instead of purchasing or leasing property,transactions governed by,an assignee purchases a lease.a good faith assignee,therefore stands in the same shoes as a good faith purchaser and as an innocent third party depends on the finality of bankruptcy orders to the same extent as good faith purchasers 
comco,spa faraldi food indus.
under krebs,at executory contracts,and rickel,at lease contracts,a party need only obtain a stay pending appeal when the debtor receives authorization to assign and sell executory contracts or leases under both and.if there is no sale of the assigned property,will not apply.see slocum,at refusing to require parties to obtain a stay when only implicated.
other courts have not explicitly extended m reach to assignments under,but they have embraced our interpretation of statutory mootness and found cases moot for similar reasons.rickel,at discussing cases.for example,in in re adamson,cir,a bankrupt steel tank manufacturer sought to sell its assets and assign the lease on its manufacturing plant to a shareholder.the landlord objected,but failed to seek a stay of the bankruptcy court order authorizing the assignment.the court of appeals for the fourth circuit held the case moot because the leasehold was personal property that triggered the protection of m id.at.also,in comco,spa faraldi food indus,where a bankrupt meat market assigned its property leases,the district court dismissed the lessor appeal because any appeal of a consummated assignment pursuant to must be dismissed as moot.at.the court of appeals for the first circuit extended m mootness protection to assignments fundamentally intertwined with a sale in in re stadium mgmt,cir.holding the assignment of a professional football team stadium sublease together with the purchase of related assets was protected by m,the court concluded m would apply to transactions in which the assignment of the executory contract was integral to the sale and removing it from the sale would adversely affect the terms of the sale.id.at.
the trustee contends that the transaction consummated pursuant to the global settlement agreement,including the assumption and assignment of the contracts by the trustee to agh allegheny general hospital involves both and because of the settlement agreement hybrid nature.br.of appellee trustee at.invoking and in its first order,the bankruptcy court authorized the transactions contemplated by the settlement agreement.see bankruptcy order of july.as noted,the bankruptcy court first order authorizing the implementation of the settlement agreement deferred action on the physicians contracts and the second order addressed only the assumption and assignment of the physicians contracts under.see bankruptcy order of july.nonetheless,it is clear the bankruptcy court intended its second order to operate in conjunction with its first order.see transcript of bankruptcy hearing,united states bankruptcy court for the western district of pennsylvania,july,at.although the physicians argue the second order represented an independent act,authorized solely under,we are convinced the assumption and assignment of the physician contracts were inextricably intertwined with aherf sale of assets to the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance.because the assignment here involved a sale under and the first order was authorized under and,the mootness provision of m applies to the assignment of the physicians contracts 
as noted,we have rejected a per se rule which would moot every appeal not accompanied by a stay under,and formulated a test for mootness whether the underlying sale was stayed pending appeal,and whether a reversal or modification of the authorization to sell would affect the validity of the sale.krebs,at the only matter at issue then is whether any relief can be fashioned for the physicians that would not affect the validity of the sale.in krebs,we recognized that allowing a debtor to reject an executory contract after it had been assumed and sold would have an impact on the validity of the sale because it would necessarily require reversing the subsequent assumption and assignment of the underlying executory contracts.clearly,this remedy is not permitted by section m.id.
in the district court,the physicians requested reversal of the assumption and assignment of their employment contracts as well as a declaration of nonassignability.as noted,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court order without opinion and without addressing mootness.consequently,the district court did not examine the effect,if any,vacating or modifying the assumption and assignment order would have on the sale between aherf and the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance.for this reason,we will vacate the order of the district court and remand this matter to allow it to consider whether the requested relief would affect the validity of the transaction between aherf and the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance.whether our jurisprudence permits the assignment of the physicians contracts,and,if so,whether the assignment satisfied the requirements of can not be addressed until mootness is resolved.if the district court finds reversing or modifying the assignment would not affect the validity of the sale,then the court must determine both issues.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated,we will vacate the order of the district court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction under and the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal of the bankruptcy order under a.we exercise jurisdiction under d over the district court final judgment in bankruptcy and over any final decision by the district court.we review the bankruptcy court findings of fact under a clearly erroneous standard,and its conclusions of law under a plenary standard.in re new valley,cir,cert.denied,d.because the district court sits as an appellate court in bankruptcy cases,our review of its decision is plenary.in re lan assocs.xi,cir.

the debtor affiliates consisted of allegheny university of the health sciences,allegheny university medical practices,allegheny,and allegheny university hospitals east.nonetheless,some affiliated organizations in pittsburgh,such as allegheny general hospital,did not file for bankruptcy.these corporate affiliates in pittsburgh included allegheny general hospital,allegheny singer research institute,and allegheny university medical centers.
the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance assumed control of certain aherf affiliates through the substitution of the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance for aherf as the sole member of these affiliates.in nonprofit corporations,members generally play a role similar to shareholders in corporations.see howard oleck martha stewart,nonprofit corporations,organizations associations ed.robin dimieri stephen weiner,the public interest and governing boards of nonprofit health care institutions,vand.for this reason,the acquisition of a nonprofit corporation membership interest is comparable to the purchase of stock in a business.paul demuro,corporate structure company issues in transactions,and special issues for physician practice management companies,in health care how to structure the transaction,at pli corporate law and practice course handbook series no.by contrast,however,the members of a nonprofit corporation also manage and control the corporation.id.at.in this case,aherf was the sole member of its affiliates and the sale of its memberships interests to the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance effected a complete change of control.
the physicians contracts provided this agreement,and your rights and obligations hereunder,may not be assigned by you.this agreement,and the medical college of university rights and obligations hereunder,may be assigned and delegated,from time to time,by to aherf,or to any other subsidiary of aherf for the doctors working for allegheny university of the health sciences auhs,auhs is substituted for in their contracts.cinicola contract differed slightly and provided no assignment of this agreement or the rights and obligations hereunder shall be valid without the specific written consent of both parties hereto,except that this agreement may be assigned by or aihg allegheny integrated health group to any parent,subsidiary or affiliated corporation without prior approval of the physician 
the bankruptcy court did not issue an order approving this amendment to the settlement agreement.despite the bankruptcy court earlier approval of the settlement agreement,allegheny general hospital remained an aherf affiliate because the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance had not yet closed on the agreement.
allegheny general hospital general counsel represented to one of the plaintiffs attorneys that the hospital would enforce the noncompete clauses in the physicians contracts.see letter from jerry fedele,senior vice president and general counsel,allegheny general hospital,to edwin klett,attorney for several plaintiffs,klett,leiber,rooney schorling march,reply br.of appellants at ex.a.
see br.of appellees the western pennsylvania healthcare alliance and allegheny general hospital at t he only alternative to assumption was rejection.rejection would have given rise to significant damages claims in accordance with g.under g,rejection of an executory contract constitutes a breach immediately before the date of filing for bankruptcy and creates a claim for breach of contract.nevertheless,rejection does not affect the parties substantive rights under the contract.collier on bankruptcy,lawrence king,ed.
cinicola alleges aherf did not entirely assume and assign his contractual obligations.in view of our treatment of statutory mootness,we do not reach this claim.
the term adequate assurance of future performance is not defined in the bankruptcy code but is included in b c and f b.section b requires adequate assurance of future performance of an executory contract when a debtor seeks to assume an executory contract on which it has defaulted.this protection is also required when a debtor seeks to assign an executory contract under f.under either section,the definition of the term should be generally the same.don fogel,executory contracts and unexpired leases in the bankruptcy code.the court of appeals for the fifth circuit has fleshed out the definition of adequate assurance and concluded a dequate assurance of future performance are not words of art the legislative history of the bankruptcy code shows that they were intended to be given a practical,pragmatic phrase first appears in the legislation proposed by the commission on bankruptcy laws the commission report explains the language adequate assurance of future performance as follows the language is adopted from uniform commercial code.what constitutes adequate assurance of future performance must be determined by consideration of the facts of the proposed assumption.official comment to uniform commercial code edition.it is not intended,however,that any party should acquire greater rights in a case under the act than he has outside the act.report of the commission on bankruptcy laws of the united states,doc,sess.pt.ii.section of the uniform commercial code,from which the bankruptcy statute borrows its critical language,provides that when reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party,the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of future performance the commentaries to the code note that adequate assurance is to be defined by commercial rather than legal standards.official comment to uniform commercial code ed.what constitutes adequate assurance is to be determined by factual conditions the seller must exercise good faith and observe commercial standards his satisfaction must be based upon reason and must not be arbitrary and leasing capital bank,cir quoting in re sapolin paints,see also in re carlisle homes,the phrase adequate assurance of future performance,adopted from section of the uniform commercial code,is to be given a practical,pragmatic construction based upon the facts and circumstances of each case.although no single solution will satisfy every case,the required assurance will fall considerably short of an absolute guarantee of performance.citations omitted.
the court of appeals for the ninth circuit has characterized the interaction between these two sections as,what f appears to give,c a seems to take away.in re claremont acquisition,cir.while f creates a broad right of assignment,c reins it in section f provides except as provided in subsection c of this section,notwithstanding a provision in an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,or in applicable law,that prohibits,restricts,or conditions the assignment of such contract or lease,the trustee may assign such contract or lease and,the relevant exception to this authority in c provides the trustee may not assume or assign any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of duties,if a applicable law excuses a party,other than the debtor,to such contract or lease from accepting performance from or rendering performance to an entity other than the debtor or the debtor in possession,whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of duties.
c provides in relevant part the trustee may not assume or assign any executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor,whether or not such contract or lease prohibits or restricts assignment of rights or delegation of duties,if b such party does not consent to such assumption or assignment.
we have recognized that section m fosters the policy of not
