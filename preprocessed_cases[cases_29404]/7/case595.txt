there are two questions presented in this appeal.the first is one of first impression whether,in light of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa,a bankruptcy court is required,absent extraordinary circumstances,to compensate chapter trustees on a commission basis.thus far,no circuit court of appeals has confronted this issue,and the lower courts that have addressed it are deeply divided.compare hopkins asset acceptance llc in re salgado nava,b.cir holding that,absent extraordinary circumstances,the fee award for chapter trustees is to be based on the commission rates provided in a,and in re eidson,the purpose of the amendment to section a,and the addition of section a to the code in,was to clarify congress intent that the trustee compensation is,unlike professional fees,to be,absent extraordinary circumstances,with in re brous,by its terms,a sets a maximum limit,but does not create right to or standard for awarding compensation,and in re clemens,b,asserting that,even after the bapcpa amendments,the bankruptcy court must still determine the reasonableness of chapter trustee fees,but its inquiry should now include a consideration of the provisions in.the second question presented is whether we should remand the case to the bankruptcy court with instructions to apply the correct legal standard after an evidentiary hearing.the trustee contends that the bankruptcy court violated his right to due process when it reduced his compensation without advance notice that it thought his fee request to be extraordinary or a meaningful opportunity to put forth evidence to assuage the bankruptcy court misgivings.we have jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to d.
