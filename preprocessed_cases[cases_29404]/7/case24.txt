this case concerns an appeal from a consolidated adversary action in bankruptcy.the action was brought by donald lassman,the appellant,who is the trustee for the estates of two bankruptcy petitioners,andrew and maureen demore.in bringing the adversary action that this appeal concerns,lassman sought,pursuant to a,to avoid a mortgage on a parcel of land in massachusetts that the demores had purportedly granted to the predecessor in interest to hsbc bank,usa,hsbc,which is the appellee.
below,the bankruptcy court granted summary judgment to lassman.the bankruptcy court did so on the ground that what is known under massachusetts law as the certificate of acknowledgement for the mortgage at issue is materially defective because the certificate failed to make clear that the demores,as grantors of that mortgage,executed that mortgage as their free act and deed.but,when hsbc appealed that ruling to the district court,the district court reversed on the ground that the certificate of acknowledgement is not materially defective because it did make clear that the demores had executed the mortgage as their free act and deed.because we agree with the district court,we affirm its order reversing summary judgment for lassman.
the underlying dispute concerns a mortgage purportedly granted by the demores to hsbc mortgage corporation hsbc mortgage,the predecessor in interest to hsbc,on a parcel of property that is owned by the demores.we start by recounting the uncontested facts that are critical to the resolution of this dispute.
in,the demores acquired a parcel of land in north attleboro,massachusetts.this property is what is known in massachusetts as registered land,which is a type of land for which the massachusetts land court maintains a certificate of title,and to which chapter of the massachusetts general laws applies.
in april,the demores each executed a power of attorney to john molloy.those powers of attorney authorized molloy to grant a mortgage on the property to hsbc mortgage.
later that month,molloy granted a promissory note and mortgage on that property to hsbc mortgage on behalf of the demores.several days later,the note and the mortgage were registered on the certificate of title for the property in the northern bristol county registry of deeds of the massachusetts land court.
appended to the mortgage document was a certificate of acknowledgment.a certificate of acknowledgment is a notarized document that is signed by an officer entitled to take acknowledgments often a notary public and that attests that the grantor appeared before the officer making the certificate and made such acknowledgment.bank of,casey,quoting mcouatt mcouatt.the certificate of acknowledgment in this case reads as follows

the requirement to record a mortgage with a certificate of acknowledgment comes from chapter,section of the massachusetts general laws.that section states,in relevant part,that n o deed shall be recorded unless a certificate of its acknowledgment is endorsed upon or annexed to it.laws ch.it is clear that,for the purposes of section,a mortgage constitutes a deed.see casey,at.
the supreme judicial court of massachusetts sjc has stated that a n acknowledgment is the formal statement of the grantor to the official authorized to take the acknowledgment that the execution of the instrument was his free act and deed.mcouatt,at.the sjc has also stated that n o particular words are necessary as long as they amount to an admission that the grantor has voluntarily and freely executed the instrument.id.citations omitted.massachusetts,however,permits a person acting under power of attorney to execute and acknowledge a mortgage for another.see.laws ch,the acknowledgment of a deed or other written instrument required to be acknowledged shall be by one or more of the grantors or by the attorney executing it.malaguti rosen,finding that a specific power of attorney extended the authority to borrow money and execute notes to mortgage property davidson reznikow,wl,at.land.april,finding that a power of attorney regularly provides authority to convey registered land.and thus the question that gives rise to this appeal what must a certificate of acknowledgement for a mortgage state when a person acting by power of attorney appears to acknowledge the mortgage 
the appeal itself comes to us by way of bankruptcy court.in,each of the demores filed separate voluntary petitions for bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.the schedule for each of the petitions listed the property and the mortgage in question.a single bankruptcy trustee,donald lassman,was appointed for both of the demores bankruptcy cases.
lassman,as trustee,then filed adversary actions against hsbc,which had received an assignment of the mortgage from hsbc mortgage,to avoid the mortgage.in avoiding a lien,such as a mortgage,a trustee invalidate s unperfected security interests,pursuant to a,and,put s the estate in the shoes of the creditor whose lien is avoided,pursuant to.in re traverse,cir.internal quotation marks,brackets,and citation omitted.the adversary actions lassman filed against hsbc on behalf of each of the demores bankruptcy estates were then consolidated.
in pressing the consolidated adversary action,lassman explained that the bankruptcy code authorizes a bankruptcy trustee to avoid a transfer of property by the debtor,such as a mortgage,where such a transfer is voidable under state law by a bona fide purchaser.see a.lassman then contended that,under section of chapter of the massachusetts general laws,the mortgage on the demores property is required to be recorded along with a valid certificate of acknowledgement.and,finally,lassman contended that the mortgage here is voidable under state law by a bona fide purchaser because the certificate of acknowledgement is materially defective under section.
to support this last contention,lassman argued that the certificate of acknowledgment does not clearly state that the execution of the mortgage was the free act and deed of the demores.lassman argued that this ambiguity arises because it is unclear from the certificate of acknowledgement whether the demores,molloy,or some combination thereof were present to acknowledge the mortgage.according to lassman,if only molloy appeared before the notary to acknowledge the mortgage,then the certificate of acknowledgement by its terms makes clear only that molloy had signed and thus executed the mortgage to hsbc mortgage as his free act and deed pursuant to the powers of attorney that the demores had granted to him for that reason,lassman argued,the certificate of acknowledgement is materially defective under section because it fails to do what mcouatt requires an acknowledgement to do make clear that the instrument being acknowledged here,the mortgage from the demores to hsbc mortgage had been executed as the free act and deed of that instrument grantors here,the demores.see at.
hsbc filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated adversary action.the motion contended that,if section requirement applies to the mortgage at issue here,the certificate of acknowledgement complies with section because the certificate does make clear that the execution of the mortgage was the free act and deed of the demores.in addition,hsbc contended that section requirement does not apply to the mortgage at issue here because section appears in chapter,which governs recorded land,while the underlying parcel that is subject to the mortgage at issue is registered land,which is governed by chapter 
hsbc further contended that,even if the certificate of acknowledgment does not comply with section,the certificate and other documents still provide constru
