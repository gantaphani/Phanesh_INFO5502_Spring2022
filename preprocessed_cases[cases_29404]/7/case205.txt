the internal revenue service appeals from the judgment of this circuit bankruptcy appellate panel,united states yellin in re weinstein,cir,affirming the judgment of the bankruptcy court,in re weinstein,in favor of jonathan yellin,the trustee in this bankruptcy case.the parties contest the interpretation of,and the irs argues that the bankruptcy code requires treatment of interest on postpetition taxes owed by the estate as a administrative expense,and yellin responds that the interest should receive a mere fifth priority.the panel and the bankruptcy court agreed with yellin,and in so doing disagreed with all four circuit courts that have previously considered the issue.to answer the question presented,we must consider the text of the statute,the context of prior caselaw against which congress wrote the bankruptcy code,the legislative history of that code,and the policies and purposes of priority treatment for postpetition taxes.we conclude that the irs offers the correct interpretation,and reverse.
the legal question presented by this case does not turn on the case facts,and a brief summary of those facts suffices to illustrate the circumstances under which that question arises.paul weinstein,the debtor in this case,filed a bankruptcy petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code in.paul grella,weinstein first trustee,sold assets from the estate,but did not file the required yearly income tax return.grella later filed income tax returns for the years through in.the irs subsequently determined that the estate owed,in addition to taxes,a total of in penalties and in interest.grella requested that this amount be reduced,and the irs agreed to forego the penalties and to reduce the estate interest obligation.
on november,the irs filed a request for payment of the remaining interest,which then amounted to.grella offered to pay this amount at first priority under a.after grella resigned as trustee,however,he was replaced by the current trustee,jonathan yellin.yellin suggested paying the irs at fifth priority under a that is,not at all,because the estate funds were insufficient to pay in full even the unsecured creditors who took second priority under a.the irs argued for first priority.
the bankruptcy court ruled in yellin favor,and the panel affirmed.we discuss their arguments below,after placing the problem in context.
because weinstein is a chapter bankruptcy,his estate must pay its debts in the order prescribed by.section a gives first priority to those types of claims listed in,which in turn gives first priority to those listed in b section b claims stem from the costs of administering the bankruptcy estate itself.among these claims are most taxes incurred by the estate,b b i,including fines or penalties related to those taxes,id.b c.no one disputes that the language of b b i refers to postpetition taxes such as those grella failed to pay.the parties disagree,however,whether that language includes interest on those taxes.
the irs maintains that b b i does include interest,and relies for this proposition primarily on nicholas united states,d.nicholas preceded the current bankruptcy code,but the supreme court has given considerable weight to caselaw in interpreting the current code.see dewsnup timm,d when congress amends the bankruptcy laws,it does not write on a clean slate.quoting emil hanley.the irs contends that nicholas stands for a rule of practice and that,as the court held was true in dewsnup,nothing in the code or the legislative history provides a sufficiently strong indication of congressional intent to change that rule.
yellin,however,argues that this case is governed by a,which provides that the estate shall pay at fifth priority interest at the legal rate from the date of the filing of the petition on claims paid under a because the tax claim at issue here is being paid under a due to the incorporation of into a and of b into claims that a applies and provides a sufficiently clear directive from congress that the courts may not consider nicholas,much less legislative history or policy rationales.this position the bankruptcy court and bankruptcy appellate panel took as well.
the position of the irs has much support.four circuits have considered the question whether b b i includes interest on postpetition taxes,and each has concluded that it does.see united states,in re,cir united states cranshaw in re allied mechanical,cir united states ledlin in re mark anthony,cir united states friendship college,in re friendship college,cir the same is true of a leading treatise in bankruptcy.see collier on bankruptcy,at king et,ed.t he courts generally and properly treat interest on postpetition taxes as an administrative expense.these cases did not,however,arise entirely under chapter.see,at arising wholly under chapter cranshaw,at dealing with interest accrued during a chapter phase after conversion to chapter ledlin,at same friendship college,at same.moreover,none addressed the relevance or irrelevance of a perhaps because of their less direct relationship to chapter.several bankruptcy courts of this circuit have dealt with the problem prior to this case,and have disagreed on the proper outcome.compare in re gould eberhardt gear mach,according status to interest on postpetition taxes,appeal dismissed,cir,and in re goodrich,same,with in re hospitality,relegating such interest to fifth priority 
a question of the interpretation of the bankruptcy code,like any other question of statutory interpretation,is a question of law that we review de novo.travelers ins.cambridge meridian group,in re erin food,cir.
we consider first the text of the statute.if sufficiently clear,that text assumes overriding importance.hartford underwriters ins.union planters bank,d united states ron pair,d w here the statute language is plain,the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.quoting caminetti united states.the bankruptcy court and the panel felt that a was clear in precisely this way,because it refers expressly to postpetition interest and assigns that interest fifth priority.we disagree with their analysis.
section b,examined in isolation,does not mention interest,either to include or to exclude it from the definition of a tax.similarly,does not mention interest.accordingly,these provisions alone do not resolve the question whether interest on postpetition taxes should receive the same priority status as the taxes themselves.if these were the only relevant provisions,we could conclude easily that congress had not spoken to the question and turn to auxiliary sources of statutory meaning.this approach was taken by the ninth circuit in ledlin,the most thorough of the prior circuit court opinions addressing the priority treatment of interest on postpetition taxes.at w e avoid the treacherous course of inferring from congress silence any affirmative intentions.quoting nlrb plasterers local union,d.
a fair review of the panel decision,however,requires us to discuss the different provisions within.section a does not mention interest,but a,interest at the legal rate from the date of the filing of the petition and assigns it a fifth priority.section a could control the outcome of this case in one of two ways.first,it might be that although b b i includes interest as a general matter,a overrides b b i in the specific context of chapter and directs that interest on postpetition taxes,like all other interest,be paid at fifth priority rather than at first priority.this reading would apply the principle that in statutory interpretation courts give specific language precedence over general language.see,varity howe,d describing this approach as a warning against applying a general provision when doing so would undermine limitations created by a more specific provision.
second,it might be that although b b i read in isolation would include interest,a provides textual evidence that b b i should not,in fact,be read to include interest,because the two provisions are meant to work in least in chapter because congress mention of interest in the one demonstrates that congress mentioned interest when interest was relevant.this reading would apply the principle that courts will seldom imply mention of an item in one statutory provision if another statutory provision expressly mentions the same item.see,city of chicago envtl.def.fund,d i t is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another.quoting keene united states,d alteration in original.
neither of these readings,however,finds such strong support in the statute text as to preclude use of nontextual means of interpretation.the first reading,under which a overrides b b i in chapter,supposes a conflict between two provisions of the conflict with which neither provision deals expressly.such a conflict provides a reason to move beyond the text and to examine a statute legislative history and apparent purpose.nor is it clear which provision is the more specific b b i applies to all bankruptcies,and a only to chapter but a applies to many different claims against the bankruptcy estate and b b i only to a specific type of administrative expense.the second reading,under which a influences the proper reading of b b i a reading which would then apply to all bankruptcies and not merely to chapter on too remote an inference to be fairly called a matter of plain meaning.section b,after all,is incorporated in a only indirectly through it is not inevitable that a drafter had or that a reader will have one section precise language firmly in mind while contemplating the other.section a express inclusion of interest does provide some legitimate evidence that b b i should not be read to contain an implied inclusion but that evidence is not so strong that we can end our analysis here.
accordingly,we consider second the context of the statute in bankruptcy caselaw.a large body of bankruptcy caselaw predates the bankruptcy code,and the supreme court in interpreting that code has assumed that congress meant to preserve some measure of continuity with the earlier cases.dewsnup,at.kelly robinson,d.we have followed the court lead quite recently.see irs cousins in re cousins,cir holding that the rule of bruning united states,d,survived the code enactment.
the case of nicholas united states,d,dominates the context of the statutory provisions in question.that case involved facts more complex than those we face today.in nicholas,the debtor went through subsequent phases of arrangement the procedure now governed by chapter of the code and bankruptcy now governed by chapter.during the arrangement phase,the trustee in nicholas failed to file tax returns or pay taxes due.during the bankruptcy phase,the irs requested payment of the underlying taxes together with penalties and interest accumulated from the time the taxes were due to the time of the period which encompassed part of the arrangement phase and all of the bankruptcy phase.nicholas,at.
the court held that the government should receive payment for interest that accrued on the tax claim during the period from the time the taxes were due to the time that the arrangement phase ended and the bankruptcy phase began.id.at.on this point eight justices agreed justice harlan did not,and commented that although the case was close he would prefer to see the government receive payment for interest over the entire period covered by its request,including the bankruptcy phase.id.at.harlan,concurring in part and dissenting in part.thus,all nine justices agreed that a postpetition tax claim included postpetition interest within the same phase of a bankruptcy proceeding,which is the less sophisticated point at stake in the present case.this view accords with language in the court caselaw prior to nicholas itself.see bruning united states,d in most situations,interest is considered to be the cost of the use of the amounts owing a creditor and an incentive to prompt repayment and,thus,an integral part of a continuing debt.interest on a tax debt would seem to fit that description.
this point has weighed heavily with several of the other circuit courts to reach the present question before us.see cranshaw,at noting that,in light of nicholas,congress may have reasoned that it was unnecessary to specify that interest would receive administrative priority ledlin,at.congress,in writing the bankruptcy code,would have taken into account that the courts would preserve the rule of nicholas unless otherwise directed.although a could potentially be read to provide such a directive,the import of that section discussed when read in full context.therefore,we best follow the intended statutory scheme by treating postpetition interest as part of a postpetition tax claim.because the postpetition tax claim itself receives first priority as an administrative expense,so should the interest on that claim.this argument is persuasive,but not conclusive,and so we continue our analysis to consider other sources of statutory meaning.
we consider third the legislative history of the statute.the bankruptcy code emerged from the reconciliation of bills passed by the house,cong,and the senate,cong.the house and senate judiciary committees prepared reports regarding their bills,reprinted in,reprinted in,but the only legislative history explaining the results of the reconciliation is the statements of the relevant subcommittee leaders in the congressional record,see cong.rec.statement of edwards,reprinted in hereinafter edwards statement id.at statement of deconcini,reprinted in hereinafter deconcini statement see also begier irs,d because of the absence of a conference and the key roles played by representative edwards and his counterpart floor manager senator deconcini,we have treated their floor statements on the bankruptcy reform act of as persuasive evidence of congressional intent.
the senate bill contained language that would have expressly given first priority treatment to interest on postpetition taxes,b b giving priority to taxes,including interest thereon,reprinted in c collier,supra,at app.pt.the house bill did not,b,reprinted in b collier,supra,at app.pt.as discussed above,the law as enacted contains no such express reference.the leaders explained that the language for represents a compromise.edwards statement,supra,at deconcini statement,supra,at.one might infer from this sequence of events that congress decided to exclude interest from the first priority,and indeed some courts have drawn this inference,in re stack steel supply.
it is not clear,however,whether the house language was adopted because it represented a different policy choice or because the conference committee viewed a specific reference to interest as unnecessary.with regard to a,the leaders stated that language referring to prepetition interest on prepetition claims had been removed because the general definition of claim in what would become since renumbered was sufficiently broad to include interest.edwards statement,supra,at deconcini statement,supra,at 
other arguments have been made based on the code legislative history.the irs calls to our attention the citation in the house report of a bankruptcy case decided by the ninth circuit that allowed postpetition interest as part of a postpetition tax claim,at citing bank united states,cir,reprinted in at.but that case does not discuss or reason out the question of interest,and so we hesitate to infer that its inclusion in the report carries much meaning.all in all,we think the legislative history of the relevant provisions is inconclusive,but tend to support the irs position due to the sponsors statements regarding.
we consider fourth,and finally,the policies underlying the statute.a court must not,of course,impose its own views of proper bankruptcy policy in place of those of the legislature.however,an understanding of the congressional policies underlying a statute,including the bankruptcy code,can help to reconcile otherwise indeterminate parts of the statutory text.
this case revolves around a dispute between creditors of the same debtor.bankruptcy law generally follows the principle that creditors with similar relationships to the debtor should receive similar treatment.see,in re hemingway,juniper dev.group kahn,cir discu
