when asian shrimp exporter foods om went bankrupt,red chamber,a california importer,was in possession of shrimp it had received on consignment from om.once red chamber had sold the shrimp,three different entities sought the million proceeds cooperatieve centrale,rabobank,a bank which had funded om operations,to which om was in debt bank of asia b of a,another bank which had funded om,to which om was in debt and sea foods company limited,om parent company to which om also was in debt.while the two banks sued red chamber directly,sea foods instead brought suit against om,and then sought to collect the consignment sale proceeds in red chamber possession by means of a writ of attachment.all three entities were successful in obtaining money from red chamber.red chamber settled with rabobank and b of a.after sea foods obtained a default judgment against om,red chamber was ordered to pay million to sea foods pursuant to its writ of attachment.we here consider red chamber appeal of the order directing it to pay million to sea foods pursuant to the writ of attachment,which was entered on the basis that red chamber had refused to comply with the writ in bad faith.
red chamber also brought suit against sea foods,arguing that the writ of attachment was the culmination of a conspiracy between sea foods and others,which had been entered into some years prior with the goal means of fraudulent red chamber to go into business with a financially unstable om,in order to be able to obtain recovery from red chamber for losses.sea foods,which was a mauritius company which conducted no business in california,moved to quash service for lack of personal jurisdiction.red chamber argued that sea foods california which it sought to collect million from red sufficient contacts with california to justify jurisdiction.the trial court disagreed.red chamber appeals.we have consolidated the two appeals for the purposes of argument and decision.we reverse the orders in both appeals.
factual and procedural background 
the entity now known as sea foods originally operated under the name of boulougne investments limited.on december,boulougne entered into an agreement with merrill lynch global emerging markets partners,merrill lynch global.the precise nature of the agreement is not clear from the record,as it was reflected in numerous written agreements,only one of which is part of the record on appeal.however,pursuant to the agreement,boulougne was to change its name and adopt new articles of incorporation pursuant to the agreement,merrill lynch global was to have a ownership interest in the new entity,sea foods.in turn,the ordinary shares of om were to be held by sea foods key to the operation of om was that merrill lynch global was to loan million to sea foods,to be further loaned to om.interest was charged by merrill lynch global at a rate of per year,to be paid every six months sea foods did not directly charge om interest.instead,it was agreed that sea foods shall procure that om declares sufficient dividends to enable sea foods to make all necessary interest payments.as agreed,on january,sea foods entered into a million loan agreement with om.pursuant to this agreement,any default under the merrill foods loan constituted an act of default under the sea loan.by february,sea foods owed merrill lynch million in interest it was not paid.
red chamber began in as a family business,and has grown to be one of the largest seafood importers in north america.in april,representatives of red chamber met with various individuals from om and merrill lynch global,in thailand,and discussed proposed business transactions.red chamber would later claim that it was not informed that om was owned by sea foods,nor was it told that om was capitalized by means of a million loan at a interest rate,and that om had already failed to make payments.red chamber takes the position that it would not have entered into business with om had it known any of these facts.it did not know,however,and therefore agreed to import shrimp from om.
the shrimp was shipped from om to red chamber on consignment when a shipment of shrimp would arrive,it would be accompanied by several documents,including a notice of arrival,a bill of lading,an invoice,and a bill of exchange.the bill of exchange would request payment,in a fixed amount,to be made to om bank,either rabobank or b of each shipment of shrimp would not be released to red chamber until red chamber had signed the related bill of exchange.however,as the shrimp was transmitted to red chamber on consignment,the amount that red chamber would ultimately pay for the shrimp could not be determined until after the shrimp was sold.therefore,although red chamber signed bills of exchange obligating it to pay certain amounts in connection with each shipment of shrimp,it would ultimately pay lesser amounts,based on the sales price of the shrimp after deducting its commission and related expenses.according to red chamber,when it was first faced with the discrepancy between the amount listed on the bills of exchange and the true amount due for the shrimp,red chamber asked its bank how to proceed.following instructions from its own not rabobank or b of chamber notated the difference on the notices of arrival,not the bills of exchange.
business was conducted between red chamber and om in this manner for some time,a situation that ultimately led to the banks lawsuits against red chamber.rabobank and b of a,the designated payees on the bills of exchange,assert that they were never made aware that red chamber signature on the bills of exchange was conditioned on its agreement with om to pay lesser amounts.whether this is a problem,however,depends on whether the banks were the ultimate payees of the bills of exchange,or were simply acting as collecting agents for om.the nature of om relationship with its banks is an issue of some dispute.it is uncertain whether om had assigned to the banks its right to the amounts to be paid by red chamber,or whether the banks were simply issuing the bills of exchange to facilitate om collection of the amounts due from red chamber to om.
in any event,this course of dealing continued until early when om went bankrupt om was in debt to both of its banks,as well as owing the initial million plus interest to sea foods.at the time of its downfall,the only assets om arguably owned were a seafood production plant in thailand,million in consigned shrimp in red chamber possession,and million in consigned shrimp proceeds in red chamber possession.the banks and sea foods each went after red chamber.in sea foods collection proceeding against red chamber,the dispute leading to the current appeal,the trial court ultimately concluded that red chamber had acted in bad faith,in that it fought all collection efforts,arguing different positions in each one,with the apparent intent of keeping the money for itself.as red chamber response to the collection efforts of each party was determinative of the trial court ruling below,we discuss the proceedings in some detail.
on april,sea foods brought suit in california against om for breach of the million loan agreement.on april,sea foods obtained a writ of attachment on all property of om.on may,the writ of attachment was served on red chamber.red chamber was concerned that the writ of attachment prevented it from selling the million in shrimp it had received on consignment from om.on may,sea foods wrote a letter confirming that the shrimp could be sold.sea foods indicated its intent to levy upon the proceeds of the sale of om consigned inventory and not upon the inventory itself.the shrimp was sold.it is agreed that red chamber ultimately had in its possession a total of million in proceeds from the sale of consigned shrimp.
in june,rabobank sued red chamber in federal court.rabobank alleged that it had entered into a credit facilities agreement with om by which it would advance money to om against bills of exchange that had been executed by purchasers of om shrimp including red chamber.rabobank alleged that it had understood that the shrimp had actually been sold to red chamber,which had unconditionally signed the bills of exchange agreeing to pay for it.once red chamber had signed a bill of exchange,rabobank would advance to om ninety percent of the face value of the bill of exchange,and would then expect to collect the full value of the bill of exchange from red chamber when it came due.rabobank alleged,however,that in september om and red chamber agreed to change their relationship from that of seller and buyer to one of consignor and consignee.they did so without telling rabobank,nor did they inform rabobank that om continued to inflate the prices on its invoices.in short,rabobank alleged that red chamber agreed to assist om in its commission of fraud on rabobank.rabobank alleged two causes of action red chamber.first,rabobank sought damages for red chamber failure to pay in full all of the bills of exchange on which rabobank had only received partial payment,and also those few bills of exchange relating to pending transactions on which rabobank had not been paid any amounts.the total unpaid amount was calculated at over million.second,rabobank sought damages,including punitive damages,for red chamber participation in om fraud.
red chamber defense to rabobank action included many arguments.in its august answer to rabobank complaint,red chamber raised as an affirmative defense,any monetary award in favor of rabobank based on the bills of exchange is subject to barred by,in whole or in part,the writ of attachment entered in favor of sea foods.in its may answer to interrogatories,red chamber appeared to acknowledge rabobank right to recover the lesser amounts calculated pursuant to the consignment agreement on the bills of exchange remaining outstanding however,red chamber also argued that rabobank had committed fraud rendering the bills of exchange void and entitling red chamber to a full refund of all amounts paid.in september,red chamber entered into a settlement agreement with rabobank,by which it paid rabobank million 
b of a also brought suit against red chamber,in federal court.the record on appeal does not include a copy of b of a complaint the record contains only characterizations of the theories argued in the b of a litigation,and these characterizations are not entirely consistent.what is significant,however,is that,in opposition to b of a action,red chamber argued,clearly and repeatedly,that b of a was not an assignee of the bills of exchange,but had instead acted only as a remitting bank to facilitate om collections from red chamber.in july,judgment was entered in favor of b of a and against red chamber in the amount of million,plus prejudgment interest,on the basis that b of a was a holder in due course of the bills of exchange.red chamber appealed the judgment.ultimately,in,while the appeal was pending,b of a settled with red chamber for a payment of million.
during this time,on december,sea foods obtained a default judgment against om for million.discovery was conducted against red chamber,and it is undisputed that,at the time of service of sea foods writ of attachment,red chamber had possessed million in om shrimp and an additional million in proceeds of sale of om shrimp.however,red chamber did not immediately turn the million over to sea foods.as relevant to this appeal,red chamber argued that the shrimp sale proceeds were not available for attachment,as those proceeds had been assigned to om banks,prior to the issuance of the writ of attachment and sea foods was liable to it for its initial fraud in not disclosing the truth about om.
code of civil procedure section provides a summary procedure by which the trial court may determine the interests in property of the judgment debtor in the hands of a third party.this summary determination,however,may not be made if the third party claim is made in good faith,and other circumstances exist.on january,sea foods moved pursuant to this section for an order for delivery of the million,on the basis that the million constituted om property which sea foods could obtain as om judgment creditor and that red chamber arguments were not made in good faith.as to the assertion that the shrimp sale proceeds had been assigned to the banks,sea foods argued that red chamber could not possibly be taking that position in good faith,as red chamber had argued the direct opposite in b of a action against red chamber.in short,sea foods argued that it was undisputed that the shrimp red chamber had received on consignment from om remained om shrimp,and the proceeds were thus om proceeds,which sea foods was entitled to obtain.it was sea foods position that if red chamber were also liable to the banks,that was a circumstance due entirely to red chamber own act of unconditionally signing the bills of exchange when it had received nothing in return,not due to any assignment of the shrimp sale proceeds.as to the assertion that sea foods was somehow liable to red chamber for fraud,sea foods noted that there were only bald allegations of some general fraud.
as the trial court could not even proceed under code of civil procedure section if red chamber made its claims in good faith,red chamber motivation became a key issue.the parties filed lengthy briefs on the issue,supported by declarations and documentary focusing on red chamber position in the b of a litigation.along with its opposition to the motion,red chamber filed a request for continuance for discovery or for a creditor suit.the request for continuance for discovery was conditional,seeking a continuance,t o the extent that the court needs additional evidence to make a determination as to the good faith nature of red chamber dispute.in the alternative,red chamber requested that the court refrain from making a determination pursuant to the summary procedure of code of civil procedure section,and proceed by way of creditor suit.red chamber set forth no basis for this alternative request,but cited to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b,the subdivision which provides that the trial court may not proceed via summary proceeding if the third person claim is made in good faith and the court determines that the interests of the parties should be determined in a creditor suit.
a hearing was held on february.the commissioner presiding over the hearing concluded that the motion had been brought in the wrong department of the superior court,and that it should be brought in the department which had issued the initial writ of attachment.as such,the court denied the motion without prejudice,and made no determinations of fact or law.
at this point,red chamber filed a new action against sea foods and merrill lynch global,for fraud.we will discuss this action at length below.we note,however,that a separate action was necessary because the summary procedure by which sea foods chose to pursue the funds in red chamber possession does not allow for red chamber to pursue a.sea foods would ultimately prevail in red chamber action,by means of a motion to quash for lack of personal jurisdiction.
sea foods returned to the department which had issued the writ of attachment and brought what was,in effect,the same motion to obtain the million that it had previously presented.sea foods again attempted to bring its motion under code of civil procedure section,arguing that this statute was somehow incorporated by reference into proceedings on a writ of attachment,overlooking code of civil procedure section,which provides the identical summary procedure for property in the possession of a third party on a writ of attachment.
red chamber filed the same papers in opposition,making the same arguments.in the introductory section of its opposition,in which it briefly set forth its arguments,red chamber added,the request for a determination under code of civil procedure section is not authorized by statute since that section is not an attachment remedy regardless of the inapplicability of section,there is a good faith dispute by red chamber as to the existence of the indebtedness claimed to be owed.red chamber also filed its same request for a continuance for discovery and its alternative request for a creditor suit.
a hearing on the motion was held on april,the parties agree it was approximately one hour in length.commissioner victor greenberg presided,and heard argument from both counsel on the issues.during the hearing,counsel for red chamber argued that the matter should proceed by means of a creditor suit.at one point,while counsel for red chamber was attempting to argue that red chamber should receive credit for the settlement to rabobank the following exchange occurred 
counsel for red chamber and that why the summary proceeding is very,very prejudicial to red chamber.all of those issues in the terms of discovery,presentation of witnesses,i mean these are very heavy issues that in a summary proceeding on declarations alone are extremely difficult to convey to the court.we also had requested the court continue or refer this matter to a creditor s case because i think that a creditor s lawsuit is the ultimate place where this dispute between sea foods and red chamber belongs.
the court i think that very suit is a possibility,but it can also be done using this method.
counsel for red chamber i agree,your honor.and i do dispute with the court but i do take issue with the court on that because the complexity of this transaction,the number of parties involved,the tremendous amount of documentation involved does lend itself to this type of summary proceeding.a creditor suit is the way to go.
a creditor suit,however,is not necessary when the third party is not acting in good faith,and the trial court was concerned with red chamber alleged good faith.in this proceeding,red chamber argued that it could not turn the shrimp proceeds over to sea foods because the money was always the banks yet,during the b of a lawsuit,red chamber had argued that the money was om,not the banks.concerned that the position taken in the b of a lawsuit was closer in time to the issuance of the writ of attachment,and was therefore red chamber first position,the court expressed doubts regarding red chamber good faith in denying the writ of attachment 
near the end of the hearing,red chamber counsel again argued that it was entitled to a continuance and creditor s suit as there were many disputed issues.the trial court indicated that it would reread red chamber filings in the b of a lawsuit because ultimately if i find that there was good cause for red chamber to take that position that may be determinative in and of itself.
the court permitted red chamber to file additional documents from the b of a litigation to better illustrate the position it had taken in that case.on may,the trial court issued its ruling,requiring red chamber to pay million to sea foods.the trial court noted that red chamber was now trying to cast itself in the role of a party attempting to establish the proper recipient of the shrimp proceeds among competing claimants,but that red chamber had previously argued against each different claimant right to the funds.the trial court concluded that red chamber had acted in a manner which could potentially have resulted in its unjust enrichment at the expense of the proper entity,and had therefore acted in bad faith.as such,the court concluded that red chamber did not act in good faith when it refused to comply with the writ of attachment.as to the determination of the interests in the million,the trial court concluded that red chamber had failed to prove its contentions regarding the existence and applicability of any offset against sea foods.noticeably absent from the trial court order was any determination that the shrimp sale proceeds were not subject to a previous assignment to the banks.
on june,red chamber moved for reconsideration,based on additional evidence regarding its position in the banks actions.in argument on the motion for reconsideration,red chamber again argued that this matter should be resolved in a creditor suit finally,red chamber argued that,at the very least,sea foods recovery must be reduced by the million that red chamber had paid rabobank,on the theory that red chamber position with respect to rabobank never changed,even though its position with respect to b of a might have.
the trial court denied reconsideration,on the basis that red chamber did not raise new or different facts entitling it to reconsideration.the court also concluded that,even if it considered red chamber submissions,its ruling would stand.
the court entered a final order requiring red chamber to pay the money to sea foods.red chamber filed a timely notice of appeal.that is the first appeal before us.
on march,red chamber brought suit against sea foods,merrill lynch global,and merrill lynch merrill lynch asserting fraud in the initial april meeting in thailand that induced red chamber to enter into business with om.the operative complaint is the first amended complaint,filed november.it alleges,as against sea foods,causes of action for fraudulent misrepresentation,fraudulent concealment,negligent misrepresentation,and civil conspiracy.red chamber specifically alleged that the motive behind d efendants scheme to induce it into a business relationship with om was to generate a source of income and expose other assets in california to satisfy repayment of the million owed to d efendants by om.defendants carried out that strategy when sea foods filed a lawsuit against om in the los angeles county superior court sea foods also used that action to obtain a writ of attachment that was levied on consigned inventory in the possession of red chamber worth millions of dollars which caused some portion of the damages for which red chamber seeks recovery in this action as to that action,red chamber alleges the writ of attachment was improperly levied because the proceeds of the sale of that inventory were payable to certain banks,not to om.
on december,sea foods filed a motion to quash service,arguing there was no basis for jurisdiction over it.specifically,it asserted that there was no basis for general jurisdiction,a contention with which red chamber does not argue.it also argued there was no basis for specific jurisdiction,in that its sole contact with california was its prosecution of its action against om and related collection proceedings against red chamber,which by some two years the alleged fraudulent conduct committed in thailand in april.red chamber opposed the motion,arguing that sea foods lawsuit was a sufficient basis for california to exercise jurisdiction over it.the trial court agreed with sea foods and granted the motion to quash.red chamber filed a timely notice of appeal.that is the second appeal before us.
issues on appeal 
in the first appeal,we consider whether the trial court erred in concluding red chamber denied the writ of attachment in bad faith.concluding that substantial evidence does not support that finding,we hold that the summary proceeding was not a proper procedure for determining red chamber liability to sea foods,and we will remand to enable sea foods to bring a creditor suit.in the second appeal,we consider whether sea foods action against om and collection efforts against red chamber create an implied consent to california jurisdiction for red chamber action against it.concluding that they do,we will reverse the trial court order granting the motion to quash.
discussion 
the summary process for collecting debts in the possession of third parties is not applicable 
to better understand the summary process envisioned by code of civil procedure sections and,it is necessary to consider their history.preliminarily,we note that code of civil procedure section,which sets forth the summary process in the context of a writ of attachment,is drawn from code of civil procedure section,the virtually identical section in the context of writs of execution.cal.law revision com,west civ,supp.foll.we therefore focus on the evolution of code of civil procedure section.
code of civil procedure section replaces code of civil procedure former section.that section provided,in pertinent part,the judge or referee may order any property of the judgment debtor,not exempt from execution,in the hands of any other person,or due to the judgment debtor,to be applied toward the satisfaction of the judgment but no such order can be made as to money or property in the hands of any other person or claimed to be due from him to the judgment debtor,if such person claims an interest in the property adverse to the judgment debtor or denies the debt.in other words,once the third person asserted an interest in the property adverse to the judgment creditor or denied owing any property to the judgment debtor,the trial court was powerless to act under that statute with respect to the disputed property,and a judgment creditor intent on collecting sums allegedly owed to the judgment debtor by a third person was limited to proceeding against the third person via a creditor suit.evans paye th,d.
c ourts struggled with how to give relief to a judgment creditor under the statute when it appeared the third person claim had been made in bad faith.evans paye,supra,th at,d,ultimately,in thomas thomas d,division one of the second appellate district engrafted a good faith exception onto the statute.the court concluded that if the third person denied the debt in good faith,the summary procedure could not be used and the judgment creditor had to proceed by means of a creditor suit.id.at.the court concluded that u nless it must be said that the third party claims are frivolous and a mere sham,the summary proceedings must be terminated and the judgment creditor left to pursue a creditor suit.id.at.
in,the legislature enacted code of civil procedure section.subdivision a of that section provides that,if a third person claims an interest in the property adverse to the judgment debtor or denies the debt,the court may,if the judgment creditor so requests,determine the interests in the property or the existence of the debt.however,subdivision b provides,the court may not make the determination provided in subdivision a if the third person claim is made in good faith and one of several conditions is satisfied.the legislative committee comment to code of civil procedure section explains that the good faith requirement of subdivision b is a codification of the rule of thomas thomas,supra,d at.legis.com,west civ.proc.ed.foll.in short,the purpose of the statute is to preclude a third person who has acted in bad faith from delaying the matter by compelling the judgment creditor to resort to a creditor suit to determine the existence of the debt.evans paye,supra,th at,d.
the third party claiming an interest in the property or denying the debt has the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the claim is made in good faith.evans paye,supra,th at,d.evidence that the third person denial of a debt owing to the judgment debtor is made in good faith can take many forms.for example,good faith could be shown by evidence that the third person genuinely believed the debt never existed or,if there was a debt,by evidence of the third person sincere belief that the obligation to the judgment debtor was dependent on a condition yet unfulfilled that payment on the debt had been excused by the occurrence of some event subsequent to the obligation or by the judgment debtor failure to perform that the obligation was incurred through mistake or fraud that an honest dispute exists as to the amount of the debt or that the debt already had been satisfied,in whole or in part.id.at,d.
we turn to the facts of this case.red chamber refused to turn the million in shrimp sale proceeds over to sea foods on the theory that the right to receive that money belonged to rabobank b of a,not om.the trial court concluded that red chamber made this claim in bad faith,relying on evidence that red chamber had previously defended against b of a lawsuit by asserting the shrimp sale proceeds had belonged to om,not b of a.this litigation strategy,had it been successful,may have subjected red chamber to claims of judicial estoppel.it does not,however,constitute bad faith.
the following facts are undisputed whenever om shipped shrimp to red chamber,that shrimp was accompanied by a bill of exchange payable to rabobank or b of a red chamber could not take possession of the shrimp without signing the bills of exchange red chamber,in fact,signed the bills of exchange red chamber made partial payments on the bills of exchange by the time of the hearing on whether red chamber had failed to comply with the writ of attachment in good faith,b of a had obtained a million judgment against red chamber,on the basis of the bills of exchange and by the time of the hearing on whether red chamber had failed to comply with the writ of attachment in good faith,rabobank had obtained a million settlement from red chamber,in connection with its claims arising out of the bills of exchange.under these circumstances,it is clear that red chamber denial of the writ of attachment was neither frivolous nor a sham.red chamber certainly possessed a good faith belief that,due to the transactions by which it obtained possession of the shrimp by signing the bills of exchange,the banks,and not om,were entitled to payment of the proceeds of the sale of the shrimp.the fact that,at the time of the good faith determination,the court in the b of a case had concluded that b of a was,in fact,entitled to payment,proves that red chamber contention was not baseless.
sea foods makes much of the evidence that red chamber obtained the shrimp from om on consignment,and further argues that there is an absence of evidence that the right to collect the shrimp proceeds was assigned to the banks.these are surely factors to be considered in determining whether red chamber is ultimately liable to sea foods on the writ of attachment.however,the issue before us is red chamber good faith in denying the writ of attachment.at the time it was served with the writ of attachment,red chamber had already signed bills of exchange which,on their face,obligated red chamber to remit the shrimp sale proceeds to the banks.while the exact nature of the web of transactions between om,red chamber and the banks remains unclear,it is apparent that red chamber had a good faith belief that the shrimp and shrimp proceeds in its possession were not owned by om,and therefore not subject to the writ of attachment.as such,we conclude substantial evidence does not support the trial court determination that red chamber failure to comply with the writ of attachment was in bad faith.
we next consider whether one of the circumstances exists that,coupled with red chamber showing of good faith,prohibits the trial court from proceeding summarily and mandates sea foods proceed by means of a creditor suit.undeniably,one such circumstance exists.the summary process is inappropriate if the third party denies the debt in good faith and t he court determines that the interests in the property or the existence of the debt should be determined in a creditor suit.code civ,subd.b.this is clearly such a case.in the instant case,the court summary process consisted of a argument numerous issues surround the determination of the interests in the million in shrimp proceeds.in particular,the court must determine the legal effect of the transaction by which red chamber obtained possession of the shrimp by signing bills of exchange in favor of the banks.was this a consignment or a sale of shrimp were the bills of exchange an assignment of om right to the funds to the banks or simply a means of collection for om did red chamber act of signing the bills of exchange create an obligation to pay the banks that was wholly unrelated to the shrimp,or was red chamber obligation to pay determined by its sale of the shrimp additionally,red chamber has now settled its disputes with both rabobank and b of a.it must be determined whether,and to what extent,red chamber should be given a credit against any obligation to om and,through it,sea foods for the amounts it paid rabobank and b of a.this would involve complex accounting issues wholly unsuited to the summary process contemplated by code of civil procedure section.
in sum,we conclude that the trial court erred in holding red chamber refusal to comply with the writ of attachment was in bad faith.we further conclude that the determination of the interests in the property at issue are inappropriate for the summary pro
