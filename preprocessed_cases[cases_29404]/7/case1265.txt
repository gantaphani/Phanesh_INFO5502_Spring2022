shortly before lance addison filed his bankruptcy petition,he converted a portion of his nonexempt assets into exempt assets.after the bankruptcy trustee trustee filed an objection to addison claimed exemptions,the bankruptcy court concluded that addison converted the assets with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor.as a result,the bankruptcy court reduced addison homestead exemption by,and denied the exemption claimed in his roth ira.the bankruptcy court also ruled that two college tuition savings accounts addison had established for his children were property of his bankruptcy estate and not exemptible.addison appealed the bankruptcy court decision,and the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirmed.
subsequently,the trustee initiated an adversary proceeding objecting to addison discharge.the bankruptcy court denied addison discharge,ruling as a matter of collateral estoppel that addison had acted with the intent to hinder,delay or defraud one or more creditors when he converted his nonexempt assets to exempt assets within one year prior to filing bankruptcy.addison also appealed this decision to the bap and immediately requested that the bap transfer the appeal to this court.the bap did so,and we now hear addison consolidated appeals.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
addison,a of a cable company,had personally guaranteed some of his company debt.in early the business was unable to pay its debts,and jp morgan chase chase,a company creditor,began to pursue addison on a million personal guarantee.around june,addison first sought the advice of bankruptcy counsel in an effort to protect himself from chase attempts to enforce the guarantee.on or about july,addison used of his nonexempt funds to establish a roth ira for himself and used another of the nonexempt funds to establish a roth ira for his wife.the funds came from a brokerage account that contained in nonexempt funds prior to these transfers.
on october,addison instructed his wife to use in nonexempt funds to make a voluntary principal payment on their home mortgage.addison wife transferred of this payment from the brokerage account mentioned above,and came from a bank account at bank.later that same day,addison filed an individual chapter bankruptcy petition.he chose the minnesota state exemptions and claimed his roth ira and the equity in the house as exempt.
in may,addison had established a college tuition savings account,pursuant to section accounts,for each of his two children.section account balances fluctuate with the equity markets,but on the date of his bankruptcy filing,the accounts were worth approximately combined.addison listed the section accounts on his bankruptcy schedules but claimed that the accounts were owned by his children and thus were not property of his bankruptcy estate.to the extent that the section accounts were property of the estate,however,addison claimed them as exempt.
the trustee objected to addison homestead and roth ira exemptions,and asserted that the section accounts were property of the estate not subject to any exemption.the bankruptcy court held an evidentiary hearing on the trustee objection and subsequently ruled in favor of the trustee on all three issues.the court found that addison made the house payment and the roth ira payment with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud his creditors,and thus denied,in full,addison claimed exemption in the roth ira and ordered that the homestead exemption be reduced by.the bankruptcy court also ruled that the section plans were property of addison bankruptcy estate and that they were not subject to any applicable exemption.
the bap affirmed,ruling that the bankruptcy court finding that addison had the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud his creditors when he converted the nonexempt assets into exempt assets was not clearly erroneous.the bap also affirmed the bankruptcy court determination that the section accounts were property of the estate and not subject to exemption.addison timely appealed to this court.
after the bankruptcy court found that addison intended to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor when he converted his nonexempt assets into his homestead and roth ira,the trustee initiated an adversary proceeding to deny addison discharge under a.because a debtor discharge can be denied under a if the debtor,with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor has transferred property of the debtor,within one year before his bankruptcy filing,and the bankruptcy court had already concluded that addison transferred nonexempt property to exempt property with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor within a year before his bankruptcy filing,the court denied addison discharge under a on collateral estoppel grounds.addison also appealed this ruling to the bap,which certified the appeal directly to this court.we now consider both of addison appeals.
ii.discussion 
addison argues that the bankruptcy court erroneously found that he converted nonexempt assets to exempt assets with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud one or more creditors.more specifically,addison contends that the bankruptcy court disallowance of his roth ira exemption claim and its reduction of his homestead exemption should be reversed along with the denial of his discharge.further,addison asserts that the bankruptcy court erred in ruling that the section accounts that he established for his children are property of his bankruptcy estate and in ruling that they are not subject to any exemption.like the bap,we review the bankruptcy court conclusions of law de novo and its findings of facts for clear error.official comm.of unsecured creditors farmland,in re farmland,cir.
disallowance of claimed exemptions 
the bankruptcy court found that addison acted with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud one or more of his creditors.shortly before filing for bankruptcy,addison converted nonexempt funds from a brokerage account and a bank account to pay down the mortgage on his home thereby increasing his homestead exemption.also,he converted nonexempt funds from his brokerage account into an exemptible roth ira.
under b of the bankruptcy code,a debtor can choose to exempt from property of the bankruptcy estate that property which is exempt under the applicable state or federal law.sholdan dietz,cir sholdan i b.here,addison elected to use the minnesota state exemptions,and claimed a homestead exemption of under.ann.and claimed his roth ira as exempt under.ann.these claimed exemptions were within the permissible amounts as provided by minnesota law.see in re sholdan,cir sholdan ii the scope of a exemption is determined by state law.however,under minnesota enactment of the uniform fraudulent transfers act ufta,a debtor may not claim an exemption in property obtained through a transfer made by the debtor with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor of the debtor.ann.see also sholdan ii,at u nder section of minnesota enactment of the uniform fraudulent transfer act ufta,a debtor may not claim a homestead exemption when he or she transfers the property with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud creditors in re tveten,i t clearly appears that under minnesota law a debtor in contemplation of bankruptcy may convert nonexempt property into exempt property,so long as the conversion does not violate the uniform fraudulent conveyance act.section b contains a lengthy list of factors or badges of fraud which a court may look to for help in determining actual intent.sholdan ii,at citing.ann.b.thus,addison claimed exemptions in his homestead and roth ira are not permitted if those assets were obtained by transfers made with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any creditor.ann.a.
additionally,when congress passed the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcpa it added,among other things,subsection o to of the bankruptcy code code under o of the code,the amount of a state homestead exemption is reduced to the extent that the value of the exemption is attributable to nonexempt property that the debtor converted into the homestead within years of filing for bankruptcy,if the conversion was made with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor.o thus,while the exemption addison claimed in his roth ira is allowable unless it violates.ann.a,the claimed homestead exemption is subject to both o and.ann.a.
homestead exemption 
the question here is whether the that addison claimed as his homestead exemption must be reduced by,under either minnesota law or o of the code,due to the mortgage payment.for purposes of o,the issue turns on whether addison acted with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor when he transferred nonexempt funds to reduce the mortgage on his homestead.congress did not provide any guidance regarding the construction of the phrase with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud when it enacted o,but the statutory language is similar,if not identical,to the language used in and of the code,as well as.ann.a.
section of the code provides that a trustee may avoid a transfer of assets by the debtor if the debtor made the transfer with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud any past or future creditor.a a.similarly,a bars a debtor discharge if he takes certain actions,including transferring,concealing,or removing property of the estate within one year before filing,with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor.a.due to the similar wording of those statutes,numerous bankruptcy courts have looked to the body of case law construing a and a to determine the meaning of with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor in o.see maronde,at it is only logical to assume that congress intended that by using essentially the same phrase in o,cases construing the fraudulent conveyance and discharge provisions also would apply to add body to the bare words of this new congressional language in re fehmel,wl,at.may,the phrase with the intent to hinder,delay or defraud a creditor contained in o is not defined in the bankruptcy code therefore,in interpreting the meaning of the phrase as contained in o,it is appropriate to look to case law interpreting a and a a in re agnew,construing the meaning of intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor in o from cases construing the meaning of intent to hinder,delay,or defraud in a and a in re lacounte,same in re sissom,same.
because direct evidence of fraudulent intent is rarely available,our cases have used the inferential badges of fraud approach to determine whether a debtor acted with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud,a creditor regardless of whether the intent language came from a state fraudulent transfer statute or applicable bankruptcy law.see sholdan ii,at approving badges of fraud approach to determine whether debtor acted with actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud under minnesota fraudulent transfer statute in ruling on objection to homestead exemption jackson star sprinkler of florida,cir using badges of fraud analysis to determine whether debtor made transfers with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud creditor under fraudulent transfer section of the bankruptcy act see also graven fink in re graven,cir comparing a actual intent to hinder,delay,or defraud language with intent to hinder,delay or defraud in missouri state fraudulent conveyance statute,noting that the two statutes use the same standard.given the similarity of the language among these statutes,we conclude that the badges of fraud approach should also apply to determine a debtor intent under o 
although both o and.ann,like a and a,use the disjunctive hinder,delay,or defraud,our circuit has been reluctant to deny a homestead exemption without a finding of intent to defraud.see sholdan i,at reversing bankruptcy court finding that debtor converted nonexempt property into exempt homestead with intent to hinder or delay,and remanding for bankruptcy court to determine whether debtor acted with intent to defraud panuska johnson in re johnson,cir noting that courts generally view the phrase hinder,delay,or defraud as a single test and refusing to separate out the terms fraud,hinder and delay in sholdan i,a old debtor,who had been sued for injuries caused by an automobile accident,sold substantially all of his nonexempt assets and used those proceeds to purchase a home with cash.id.at.at all times while living in his new home,sholdan had the assistance of a nurse.id.for approximately a year prior to purchasing the house the debtor had been living in an assisted living facility,and on nights when a nurse was not available to stay with him in his newly purchased home,the debtor would return to the assisted living facility to spend the night.id.additionally,for the years prior to residing at the assisted living facility,the debtor had not owned a home,but had lived in an apartment.id.
three months after purchasing the new home the debtor filed for bankruptcy and claimed his house as exempt.id.the trustee objected to the homestead exemption,asserting that the debtor had purchased the home with the intent to hinder,delay or defraud a creditor.id.the bankruptcy court sustained the trustee objection and disallowed the claimed homestead exemption,finding that the debtor had acted with the intent to hinder or delay a creditor when he purchased the home.id.the bankruptcy court did not rule on whether the debtor acted with intent to defraud a creditor.id.at.the district court affirmed,holding that it was not necessary to find an intent to defraud.id.at.we then reversed and remanded for the bankruptcy court to consider whether the debtor acted with the intent to defraud.id.in reversing,we stated that we do not mean to say that the test of hinder or delay might not prevail under another set of facts,but ruled that the facts of that case d id not support such a finding.id.
in the instant case,the bankruptcy court found sufficient evidence to establish that addison acted with the intent to hinder,delay,and defraud a creditor however,addison took less aggressive actions than those present in wherein we concluded that the facts did not support a finding of intent to hinder or delay.applying our precedent,we conclude that the record here does not support the reduction of addison homestead exemption based on an intent to hinder or delay.id.
thus,we are left with the bankruptcy court determination that addison converted in nonexempt funds into his homestead with the intent to defraud a creditor.the question of whether an individual acted with intent to defraud in converting property into exempt property is a question of fact,on which the bankruptcy court finding will not be reversed unless clearly erroneous.sholdan ii,at citing hanson first bank,cir.it is well settled that the mere conversion of assets to exempt assets is not in itself fraudulent.see also hanson,at it is well established that a debtor conversion of property to exempt property on the eve of bankruptcy for the express purpose of placing that property beyond the reach of creditors,without more,will not deprive the debtor of the exemption to which he otherwise would be entitled norwest bank nebraska,na tveten,cir it is well established that under the code the conversion of to exempt property for the purpose of placing the property out of the reach of creditors,without more,will not deprive the debtor of the exemption to which he otherwise would be entitled.nevertheless,w here the debtor acts with actual intent to defraud creditors,his exemptions will be denied.hanson,at.
before actual fraudulent intent can be found there must appear in evidence some facts or circumstances which are extrinsic to the mere facts of conversion of assets into exempt and which are indicative of such fraudulent purpose.sholdan ii,at quoting tveten,at in turn quoting forsberg security state bank,cir.in finding that addison had the requisite intent to defraud,the bankruptcy court properly looked to the badges of fraud enumerated in.ann.b and found four badges of fraud resulting from addison mortgage payment the transfer was to an insider addison retained control of the property after the transfer the transfer was made after addison had been sued on his personal guarantee and addison was insolvent at the time he transferred the funds to his homestead.additionally,the bankruptcy court noted that addison already had significant equity in his home before he made the transfer and that the payment only increased addison equity in the home,but did not reduce his monthly mortgage payment.while the bankruptcy court noted that there were badges of fraud favoring both sides,it found that the homestead transfer was made with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud addison creditors,as his intent was to keep value away from creditors.
the bankruptcy court underlying factual findings are themselves not clearly erroneous however,they do not identify any extrinsic evidence of fraud.in the absence of extrinsic evidence of fraud,we find clear error in the bankruptcy court ultimate determination of intent to defraud.as discussed above,i t is well established that a debtor conversion of property to exempt property on the eve of bankruptcy for the express purpose of placing that property beyond the reach of creditors,without more,will not deprive the debtor of the exemption to which he otherwise would be entitled.hanson,at.rather,for fraudulent intent to be found there must appear in evidence some facts or circumstances which are extrinsic to the mere facts of conversion of assets into exempt and which are indicative of such fraudulent purpose.sholdan ii,at quotations and citations omitted.
here,only the fact that addison had been sued or threatened with suit prior to making the mortgage payment was extrinsic to the fact of of the other facts cited relate to a debtor simple conversion of nonexempt property to exempt property on the eve of bankruptcy,which we have long held to be permissible if these facts alone constitute extrinsic evidence of intent to defraud hanson and johnson would have reached that same result.see hanson,at rejecting argument that extrinsic evidence established debtor intent to defraud where debtors,after defaulting on bank loans and talking to bankruptcy counsel,converted approximately into life insurance policies a couple of weeks prior to filing and prepaid an additional on their homestead mortgage two days before filing johnson,at agree ing that there is no fraud as to debtor homestead exemption,where debtor,in contemplation of filing bankruptcy,talked to bankruptcy attorney and paid off in debts against his home after creditors obtained judgments against him.moreover,the bankruptcy court finding that addison converted his nonexempt property to exempt property with the intent to keep value away from creditors does not provide extrinsic evidence of fraud as such an intent is not automatically impermissible.hanson,at tveten,at.
this case resembles hanson.the hansons,married farmers,defaulted on several bank loans when financial difficulties arose.at.before they filed for bankruptcy,the hansons consulted an attorney,and on the advice of counsel,they sold several nonexempt items to family members for value.id.a couple of weeks before filing for bankruptcy,the hansons took the proceeds from the sales of the nonexempt assets and bought life insurance policies on each of them with a value of approximately each.then two days prior to filing for bankruptcy they prepaid on their homestead mortgage.id.upon filing for bankruptcy,the hansons claimed their life insurance policies and their homestead as exempt.id.
a creditor objected to these exemptions,claiming that the debtors had converted nonexempt property to exempt property on the eve of bankruptcy with intent to defraud their creditors.id.the bankruptcy court denied the objection to the exemptions,finding that the hansons had done what was permissible under the law and that their actions did not constitute extrinsic evidence of fraud.id.at.after the district court affirmed,the creditor appealed to this court.id.
the hanson panel focused on whether extrinsic evidence established that the hansons converted their property with the intent to defraud their creditors and concluded that the bankruptcy court was not clearly erroneous in finding no fraudulent intent by the hansons.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,we noted that the bankruptcy court had found that the creditor did not establish any indicia of fraud and further noted that the hansons did not borrow money to place into exempt properties they accounted for the cash they received from the sales they had a preexisting homestead and they did not obtain goods on credit,sell them,and then place the money into exempt property.id.concluding that the debtors sold their nonexempt property for its fair market value and then used this money to take advantage of some of the limited exemptions available under south dakota law on the advice of counsel,we held that the bankruptcy court was not clearly erroneous in finding that the debtors lacked the intent to defraud and permitting the debtors to claim their full exemptions.id.
similar to the hansons,addison became insolvent albeit due to a personal guarantee being called rather than defaulting on loans and prior to filing for bankruptcy he sought the advice of counsel.after discussing prebankruptcy planning with his attorney,addison transferred some of his nonexempt assets in a brokerage account to fund roth iras for himself and his wife in the amount of each.this mirrors the hansons conversion of assets into life insurance policies,except that addison converted a lesser amount into the roth iras than the hansons did for their life insurance policies.additionally,addison made an principal mortgage payment on the day he filed his bankruptcy identical to the mortgage payment the hansons made two days prior to their bankruptcy filing.as in hanson,there has been no extrinsic evidence produced here that addison had any indicia of fraud other than the suit or threat of suit resulting from personal liability on a defaulted loan addison did not borrow money to place into exempt assets he had a preexisting homestead he did not obtain goods on credit,sell them,then place the money into exempt property and he did not attempt to conceal the transfers in his bankruptcy filings.
the sort of indicia of fraud necessary to find fraudulent use on an exemption would be,inter alia,conduct intentionally designed to materially mislead or deceive creditors about the debtor position or use of credit to buy exempt property.matter of armstrong,cir citations omitted.additionally,c onverting a very great amount of property could also be an indication of fraud,as could t he existence of conveyances for less than adequate consideration.id.in the present case,the record contains no extrinsic evidence of any of these indicia of fraud.the record only indicates that addison intent was to convert some of his nonexempt property to exempt property on the eve of bankruptcy,something that is well established in this circuit that he is allowed to do.hanson,at it is well established that a debtor conversion of property to exempt property on the eve of bankruptcy for the express purpose of placing that property beyond the reach of creditors,without more,will not deprive the debtor of the exemption to which he otherwise would be entitled.accordingly,we conclude that it was clear error for the bankruptcy court to find that addison had the requisite intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor when he converted some nonexempt property into his homestead on the day he filed bankruptcy.
additionally,circuit precedent upholding findings of fraudulent intent differ factually from this case.for example,in our most recent decision on the issue,sholdan ii,which came back before the court after our remand in sholdan i,discussed above,we upheld the bankruptcy court finding of intent to defraud,stating 
it is one thing to convert assets into exempt property for the express purpose of holding it as a homestead and thereby putting the property beyond the reach of creditors.however,it is quite another thing to acquire title to a house for no other reason than to defraud creditors.
sholdan ii,at 
in the present case,however,addison did not acquire title to a house for no other reason than to defraud creditors as sholdan had.addison had owned his house for years prior to his bankruptcy filing and merely converted nonexempt assets into the homestead to protect it from the reach of exact action that we implied was permissible in upholding the finding of intent to defraud in sholdan ii.id.
moreover,in tveten,we upheld the finding of intent to defraud based on the evidence surrounding the debtor conversion of nonexempt assets to exempt assets prior to bankruptcy at.in that case,the debtor was a physician who owed creditors nearly million,mostly on personal guarantees.id.at.when a number of the debtor investments declined in value,he met with a bankruptcy attorney,and then,on counsel advice,converted almost all of his nonexempt property approximately into exempt life insurance policies and annuities,through a series of transactions on the eve of bankruptcy.id.after tveten filed for bankruptcy,the trustee objected to his claimed exemptions in the property,and a creditor moved to deny his discharge.id.at.the bankruptcy court denied tveten discharge,prior to ruling on the objection to exemptions,finding that he had converted his nonexempt property to exempt property with the intent to defraud a creditor.id.we affirmed the denial of discharge,ruling that the finding of intent to defraud was not clearly erroneous,noting that tveten attempt to shield from creditors while attempting to discharge over million in debt went well beyond the purposes for which exemptions are permitted.id.at.although not citing to specific extrinsic evidence of intent to defraud,we noted that the entire pattern of conduct surrounding the conversions demonstrated fraudulent intent.id.
tveten differs markedly from the present case.unlike tveten,addison did not attempt to convert almost his entire net worth into exempt assets prior to bankruptcy.rather,addison left substantial nonexempt assets for his creditors to recover.in fact,the auction of some of addison nonexempt assets brought in proceeds in excess of.moreover,the total amount of converted assets at issue in this case is less than,only a fraction of the amount present in tveten.
in sum,we conclude that the bankruptcy court clearly erred in finding that addison converted nonexempt property into his homestead with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor.on the record before us,there is no extrinsic evidence of intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor sufficient to uphold that finding.the evidence only suggests that addison was converting nonexempt assets to exempt assets to place some but not all or substantially all of those assets beyond the reach of our precedent permits.
roth ira exemption 
the bankruptcy court also denied addison claimed exemption in his roth ira,finding that addison had transferred nonexempt funds into the roth ira with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor.again,the determination of intent is a finding of fact reviewed for clear error.sholdan ii,at.
the bankruptcy court found addison acted with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud regarding the transfer of funds to the roth ira for the same reasons as it found intent to hinder,delay,or defraud regarding the payment on the home mortgage.as discussed above,that finding of intent was clearly erroneous,and thus the disallowance of the roth ira exemption must be reversed as well.likewise,the bankruptcy court additional finding that addison real reason for converting nonexempt assets into the roth ira was just to keep the money out of the hands of creditors,will not suffice to establish intent to hinder,delay,or defraud as a debtor may intentionally convert nonexempt assets to exempt assets for the express purpose of keeping the money out of the hands of creditors,unless there is extrinsic evidence of fraud.see hanson,at it is well established that a debtor conversion of property to exempt property on the eve of bankruptcy for the express purpose of placing that property beyond the reach of creditors,without more,will not deprive the debtor of the exemption to which he otherwise would be entitled.
denial of discharge 
following the bankruptcy court ruling on the trustee objections to exemptions,wherein it found that addison had converted nonexempt assets into his homestead and roth ira with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor,the trustee filed an adversary proceeding objecting to addison discharge under a of the code.section a of the bankruptcy code states,in relevant part,that 
a the court shall grant the debtor a discharge,unless 
the debtor,with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor has transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed,or has permitted to be transferred,removed,destroyed,mutilated,or concealed 
a property of the debtor,within one year before the date of the filing of the petition 
a emphasis added.
the trustee objection to discharge cited,among other things,addison conversion of nonexempt assets into his homestead and roth ira.as there was no dispute that addison had made the transfers to his homestead and the roth ira within one year before his bankruptcy filing and that the transfers were made from property of the debtor,the only issue before the bankruptcy court was whether these transfers had been made with intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor.because the bankruptcy court had already determined,in ruling on the trustee objections to exemptions,that addison had made the transfers to his homestead and roth ira with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor,the bankruptcy court granted the trustee motion for summary judgment on collateral estoppel grounds and denied addison discharge.
in this case,the same standard applies to determine whether a discharge should be denied or whether a transfer of nonexempt property to exempt property should be voided both require proof that the debtor acted with the intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor.tveten,at because we reversed the bankruptcy court determination of intent to hinder,delay,or defraud a creditor on the exemption issues,the denial of discharge based on the collateral estoppel effect of that finding must also be reversed.
section accounts 
lastly,the bankruptcy court ruled that the two section tuition savings accounts that addison opened in for the benefit of his children were property of addison bankruptcy estate and not subject to any exemption.whether the section accounts are property of the bankruptcy estate is a legal conclusion reviewed de novo.see drewes vote in re vote,cir whether property is included in the bankruptcy estate is a question of law.citation omitted.
addison listed the section accounts in his amended bankruptcy schedules with a notation that he believed that the accounts were owned by his children,and thus not property of his bankruptcy estate.nevertheless,in case the accounts were determined to be property of the estate,addison claimed them as exempt under.ann.we conclude that the section accounts are nonexempt property of addison estate.
section a of the code,which was unchanged by bapcpa,states that e xcept as provided in subsections b and c of this section a debtor bankruptcy estate is comprised of all legal or equitable interest of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case.a.addison asserts that because he established the accounts for the benefit of his children,he had no legal or equitable interest in the accounts.addison relies on c to support his position.that section,which regards tax treatment of designated beneficiaries and contributors of section accounts,provides that a ny contribution to a qualified tuition program on behalf of any designated beneficiary shall be treated as a completed gift to such beneficiary which is not a future interest in property.c.because any contribution to a section account on behalf of a beneficiary is treated as a completed gift to the beneficiary,addison argues that the accounts are property of the beneficiaries and not of the contributor or owner of the account.we find this argument unavailing for several reasons.first,c deals with the tax treatment of contributions to section accounts,not ownership of the accounts.second,the accounts addison established for his children list addison as the owner of the accounts and the minnesota statutes governing the accoun
