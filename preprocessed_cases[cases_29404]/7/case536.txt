this appeal tests the limits of the good faith requirement applicable to petitions filed under chapter of the bankruptcy code.appellant nmsbpcsldhb,the landlord appeals from an order of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court denial of its motion to dismiss for lack of good faith.the landlord contends that the debtor,integrated telecom express,integrated,was never in financial distress and that the petition in this case was instead filed to frustrate the landlord claims and to increase the distribution of the debtor estate to integrated shareholders at the landlord expense.these contentions are corroborated by the record.first,according to schedules filed with the bankruptcy court,integrated had million in cash and million in other assets at the time that it filed for bankruptcy,and yet the landlord proof of claim lists the present discounted value of integrated lease obligations at approximately million.integrated schedules also list miscellaneous liabilities of approximately.thus integrated was highly solvent and cash rich at the time of the bankruptcy filing.even if the ipo class action claim,which was capped at million with integrated liability limited to a million reserve the balance to be paid by insurance was listed at its full alleged value,integrated was still solvent at the time of filing.second,in a smoking gun resolution approved by the board,and notwithstanding its strong financial position,integrated authorized a letter to the landlord threatening that if it did not enter into a settlement of the lease in the amount of at least million,integrated would file for bankruptcy so as to take advantage of b,which sharply limits the amount that a landlord can recover in bankruptcy for damages resulting from the termination of a lease.
the issue on appeal is whether,on the facts of this case,a chapter petition filed by a financially healthy debtor,with no intention of reorganizing or liquidating as a going concern,with no reasonable expectation that chapter proceedings will maximize the value of the debtor estate for creditors,and solely to take advantage of a provision in the bankruptcy code that limits claims on leases,complies with the requirements of the bankruptcy code.we conclude that such a petition is not filed in good faith and will therefore reverse.
integrated was a supplier of software and equipment to the broadband communications industry.in the summer of,integrated negotiated a lease of real property in silicon valley with the landlord.after several months of negotiation,during which the landlord evaluated integrated business condition and reviewed the company prospectus,integrated and the landlord executed a lease for a term of ten years beginning on february,with a monthly base rent of,increasing percent annually.the landlord was aware of the financial risks associated with integrated business and willingly accepted those risks.
was a very poor year for integrated.the market for many of the company products deteriorated,causing integrated to suffer net losses of million.integrated hired a management and technology consulting firm in december to help evaluate integrated operating alternatives.integrated also retained lehman brothers,an investment bank,in february,to assist in identifying,soliciting,and evaluating proposals for a sale or merger of integrated or its assets.unable to find a third party willing to enter into such a transaction,and unable to identify an alternative business model,integrated board of directors prepared a plan for the liquidation and dissolution of the company under state law.
in november,a securities class action styled richmon integrated telecom express,was filed in the southern district of new york naming integrated as a defendant,along with certain officers,directors,and underwriters of integrated.the class consists of individuals who purchased integrated stock between august,and december.the class action alleges claims in the amount of million for various violations of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of in connection with integrated initial public offering of securities.similar lawsuits concerning more than other companies initial public offerings have been filed and coordinated as in re initial public offering securities litigation.
on april,integrated board approved a plan of complete liquidation and dissolution under delaware law.the two major issues to be resolved prior to dissolution were the disposition of integrated intellectual property rights and its remaining obligations under the lease.in may of,the board approved the sale of substantially all of integrated intellectual property and related assets to real com,a corporation to be formed by certain of integrated officers and directors.the proposed purchase price was million plus assumption of integrated technical support and warranty obligations.
thereafter,integrated attempted to negotiate an accord and satisfaction of its lease.integrated asserts that,d uring this time,debtor first became aware that it might use chapter to,among other things,address landlord claims.appellee br.at.on august,the board authorized a chapter filing in the event that the landlord would not accept million as an accord and satisfaction of integrated obligations under the lease.the minutes of the august board meeting state,in pertinent part 
regel integrated ceo updated the board on his discussions with the landlord subsequent to the last board meeting.regel noted that the landlord did not appear to believe that the company would seriously consider making a bankruptcy filing.
murray of the law firm murray murray next reviewed with the board the draft letter to the landlord a copy of which was previously distributed to the board.
murray then reviewed with the board the timeline for a bankruptcy filing and related bankruptcy procedures.
various members of the board then asked questions of murray related to the draft letter to the landlord and the procedures for,and implications of,a possible bankruptcy filing by the company.a discussion among the board ensued,including a discussion of the costs and potential benefits and risks of proceeding with a bankruptcy filing.
following that discussion,regel asked the board for authority for management to negotiate a settlement with the landlord in an amount in the range of to million.a further discussion among the board ensued regarding the costs associated with a bankruptcy filing and potential costs of any litigation.after additional discussion,the board approved the following resolutions 
resolved that the officers of the company are,and each of them hereby is,authorized and directed to send the landlord the letter prepared by murray and murray in substantially the form reviewed with the board.
resolved further that the officers of the company are,and each of them hereby is,authorized and directed to negotiate a settlement with the landlord up to a maximum settlement amount of million.
resolved further that the board hereby appoints a special committee the committee that is hereby empowered on behalf of the board to authorize the officers of the company to enter into a settlement with the landlord up to a maximum settlement amount of million.
resolved further that the officers of the company shall be required to seek approval from the board prior to entering into an sic settlement with the landlord in excess of million.
resolved further that the officers of the company be,and each of them hereby is,authorized and directed to instruct bankruptcy counsel to begin to prepare the necessary paperwork for a bankruptcy filing.
resolved further that if the landlord is not willing to enter into a settlement agreement with a maximum amount of million,then the officers of the company shall be,and each of them hereby is,authorized and empowered on behalf of,and in the name of,the company to execute and verify or certify a petition under chapter of the bankruptcy code and to cause the same to be filed in the appropriate united states bankruptcy court the bankruptcy court at such time as said authorized officer executing the same shall determine.
on august,integrated bankruptcy counsel sent the landlord a letter stating that,if the landlord was unwilling to settle,the debtor was prepared to avail itself of various provisions in the bankruptcy code,including the cap on landlords claims set forth in b the letter asserted that even if integrated were to file bankruptcy solely to cap the lessor claim using bankruptcy code b,a use for which this code section is intended,integrated would not violate the good faith filing doctrine.
no settlement was reached.
proceedings in the bankruptcy court 
integrated filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code on october.according to schedules filed with the bankruptcy court,integrated had million in cash and million in other assets at the time that it filed for bankruptcy.the landlord filed a proof of claim listing the present discounted value of integrated lease obligations at approximately million.integrated schedules also list miscellaneous liabilities of approximately.
immediately after integrated filed its petition,integrated attempted to address the two major obstacles to dissolution the sale of its intellectual property assets and its remaining obligations under the lease.on october,the day after integrated filed its petition,integrated moved to sell its intellectual property assets at a public auction.the official committee of equity security holders the ocesh objected to the adequacy of integrated efforts to market the assets.ultimately,integrated was able to renegotiate the sale and to introduce other bidders.as a result,a new agreement was reached with real com for some,but not all,of the assets for million,an increase of.the remaining assets were sold for after confirmation of the plan of reorganization.
also on october,integrated moved to reject the lease.the landlord opposed the motion and,on october,filed a motion to dismiss the chapter proceeding on the ground that the petition was not filed in good faith.on january,the bankruptcy court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the motion to dismiss and the motion to reject the lease during which it heard evidence regarding integrated decision to file for chapter.after the close of evidence,the bankruptcy court determined that oral argument was unnecessary and denied the motion to dismiss from the bench.
the bankruptcy court explained at the hearing that integrated offered a number of reasons for the filing of the bankruptcy case,and that the court believe d there is validity to a number of those considerations.the court,however,did not expand on this statement except to stress that integrated was losing a lot of money.the court characterized the company financial losses as dramatic.according to the court,integrated was experiencing a dramatic downward spiral in september.as such,the court concluded that the board had an obligation,and appropriately exercised that obligation,to give the investors their money back.
alternatively,the bankruptcy court held that,even assuming that integrated stated reasons for filing the petition were not particularly persuasive,integrated desire to take advantage of the b cap on landlords claims was not a sufficient basis on which to dismiss the petition as a matter of law 
but even assuming that those other factors are not particularly persuasive,even assuming or accepting the landlord position,particularly illustrated by the board of directors minutes of august of,that the principal reason for the chapter case was to cap the damage claim for the landlord,i conclude that as a matter of law,that is not a debilitating fact.i held in in re ppi enterprises,aff,cir,and other cases have held,that it does not establish bad faith for a debtor to file a chapter case for the purpose of taking advantage of provisions which alter rights,including altering the rights of a landlord under state law.
the bankruptcy court was guided by the following proposition a s the case law clearly indicates,not limited to my case referring to the bankruptcy judge decision in ppi,the solvency of the debtor and the fact that the equity interest holders will receive a distribution does not serve as the basis for a finding of bad faith.the court thus saw no significance in the fact that the b cap would operate solely to the benefit of equity holders,as opposed to creditors 
what i think is also significant in this case is that this debtor had no significant debt 
the difference in this case is that the company was not at all leveraged.and if the distribution were,for the most part,or totally to go to the creditors,there would be no basis for the landlord to complain regarding some equitable principle.
but i do think the code makes any distinction.and i think that this case is different is because the debtor simply was not leveraged.and instead of the significant distribution going to debt holders it going to go to the shareholders.
the bankruptcy court then went on to discuss other decisions that agree with that proposition,namely that a solvent debtor can avail itself of the b cap,focusing in particular on in re sylmar plaza,cir,and characterizing sylmar as almost on all fours with the situation before me.
with respect to the equities of the case,the bankruptcy court found that,although the shareholders would realize a benefit from the bankruptcy in the form of a significant distribution,the shareholders are not coming out whole by any means.the court concluded that obviously you ca consider that they,the shareholders are being treated to any windfall.conversely,the court found that the landlord elected to ride with the bulls,when it entered into the lease with integrated,and that,as a sophisticated individual who took the risk hoping that his instincts were right,he must suffer the consequences of his instincts being wrong.on january,the bankruptcy court issued an order formally denying the motion for the reasons stated on the record at the hearing.
the bankruptcy court confirms integrated plan of liquidation 
the bankruptcy court held a confirmation hearing on april,and issued an order confirming integrated proposed plan of liquidation over the landlord objections on april.applying b,the landlord claim was reduced from million to million.
the plan of liquidation did not completely resolve the securities class action.instead,the plan reserved million of the debtor estate to satisfy any judgment that might be entered in the securities class action.when added to million in insurance coverage available to integrated,the plan effectively limited any potential judgment in the securities class action to million.the securities class voted in favor of the plan of liquidation.
the landlord appealed to the district court and moved the bankruptcy court to stay confirmation of the plan pending appeal.the bankruptcy court addressed the landlord motion for a stay at an april,hearing.the bankruptcy court reaffirmed its earlier ruling on the landlord motion to dismiss,making several observations to amplify the record on the issue.specifically,the bankruptcy court elaborated on the significance of the securities class action 
there is nothing in the law to suggest that the corporation can not avail itself to the distribution scheme set forth in the bankruptcy code in effecting that liquidation.in that regard,it also worth noting that this chapter case had the effect on the securities law plaintiffs similar to its effect on this landlord.it effectively reduced the recovery by the securities law claimants by treating them like shareholders pursuant to section b.
could the securities law plaintiffs obtain a bad faith ruling in this case i do think so for essentially the same reasons i think that the landlord can not.
with respect to the securities law action,i am puzzled to understand how that claim could be resolved in a law liquidation context absent a final resolution of that claim.in a law context,the securities law plaintiffs would have had a very strategic advantage,namely so long as there was a possible recovery against the corporation,the liquidation would be stalled indefinitely.
the bankruptcy court also commented on integrated financial affairs leading up to its decision to file for chapter 
the court are you saying that integrated telecom is a healthy company 
hazeltine your honor,integrated telecom as it sits here today is a very healthy company.at the time it entered for bankruptcy it was a very healthy company.they had 
the court they out of business,are they 
hazeltine they out of business.but their balance sheet looks great.they have million in assets,million in debts if the landlord claim is not capped.
they could become an investment company,invest that money and money.they just 
the court well,could.but i believe they would be in breach of their fiduciary duty if they did,and i made this observation back in january.
the bankruptcy court nevertheless stayed its confirmation order pending appeal,on the condition that the landlord post a million bond.
appeal to the district court 
the district court affirmed,holding that the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying the landlord motion to dismiss.the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court made two specific findings of fact that in september the debtor was in financial distress and that the board,consistent with its fiduciary responsibility,properly pursued liquidation in order to fulfill its obligations to its investors.the district court did not disturb either finding.
the district court understood the bankruptcy court to have alternatively ruled,as a matter of law,that even if the debtor principal reason for filing its chapter case was to cap the landlord damage claim,that alone was insufficient to establish bad faith.the district court concluded that the bankruptcy court legal ruling was based on a sound interpretation of relevant case law from this and other jurisdictions,and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.the district court rejected the landlord argument that permitting a solvent corporation to invoke the landlord cap would permit an end run around a core principle of bankruptcy law,the absolute priority rule that is,that creditors must be paid in full before stockholders can retain equity interests for any purpose.like the bankruptcy court,the district court observed that insolvency is not a prerequisite to filing under chapter.regardless,in light of the bankruptcy court finding that integrated was experiencing a dramatic downward spiral and that filing a chapter petition fulfilled the board obligations to shareholders,the district court concluded that no such end run had taken place.although the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court ruling,the district court extended the bankruptcy court stay of the confirmation order.
the landlord filed a timely appeal from the district court order.we expedited the appeal and stayed the bankruptcy court confirmation order pending the appeal.jurisdiction in the district court was proper under a,and we exercise jurisdiction under d.although this court jurisdiction is over the decision of the district court,d,review of the district court decision effectively amounts to review of the bankruptcy court opinion in the first instance.in re hechinger inv.of,cir.
chapter bankruptcy petitions are subject to dismissal under b unless filed in good faith,and the burden is on the bankruptcy petitioner to establish that its petition has been filed in good faith.in re sgl carbon,cir accord solow ppi enters,in re ppi enters,cir the debtor bears the burden of establishing good faith.whether the good faith requirement has been satisfied is a fact intensive inquiry in which the court must examine the totality of facts and circumstances and determine where a petition falls along the spectrum ranging from the clearly acceptable to the patently abusive.id.at.we therefore review for abuse of discretion the bankruptcy court refusal to dismiss a chapter petition for want of good faith.solow ppi enters,in re ppi enters,cir.a n abuse of discretion exists where the district court decision rests upon a clearly erroneous finding of fact,an errant conclusion of law,or an improper application of law to fact.sgl carbon,at quoting aclu black horse pike reg l bd.of,cir.
at its most fundamental level,the good faith requirement ensures that the bankruptcy code careful balancing of interests is not undermined by petitioners whose aims are antithetical to the basic purposes of bankruptcy 
a good faith standard furthers the balancing process between the interests of debtors and creditors which characterizes so many provisions of the bankruptcy laws and is necessary to legitimize the delay and costs imposed upon parties to a bankruptcy.requirement sic of good faith prevents abuse of the bankruptcy process by debtors whose overriding motive is to delay creditors without benefitting them in any way 
sgl carbon,at quoting little creek dev.commonwealth mortgage in re little creek dev,cir see also carolin miller,cir good faith requirement is indispensable to proper accomplishment of the basic purposes of chapter protection.the supreme court has identified two of the basic purposes of chapter as preserving going concerns and maximizing property available to satisfy creditors.bank of am.trust sav.ass lasalle,d accord toibb radloff,d discussing the congressional purpose of deriving as much value as possible from the debtor estate.each of these purposes informs our application of the good faith requirement 
review and analysis of the bankruptcy laws and relevant cases disclose a common theme and objective underlying the reorganization provisions avoidance of the consequences of economic dismemberment and liquidation,and the preservation of ongoing values in a manner which does equity and is fair to rights and interests of the parties affected.but the perimeters of this potential mark the borderline between fulfillment and perversion between accomplishing the objectives of rehabilitation and reorganization,and the use of these statutory provisions to destroy and undermine the legitimate rights and interests of those intended to benefit by this statutory policy.that borderline is patrolled by courts of equity,armed with the doctrine of good faith 
sgl carbon,at quoting in re victory constr,order stayed hadley victory constr,in re victory constr,see also marsch marsch in re marsch,cir the test is whether a debtor is attempting to unreasonably deter or harass creditors or attempting to effect a speedy,efficient reorganization on a feasible basis.united sav.ass of timbers of inwood forest,in re timbers of inwood forest,cir en banc stating that if chapter plan does not have a rehabilitative purpose,the statutory provisions designed to accomplish the reorganization objective become destructive of the legitimate rights and interests of creditors,the intended beneficiaries connell coastal cable,in re coastal cable,cir breyer,stating that there must be some least an arguable the chapter plan and the purposes that the chapter was designed to serve.
our cases have accordingly focused on two inquiries that are particularly relevant to the question of good faith whether the petition serves a valid bankruptcy purpose,by preserving a going concern or maximizing the value of the debtor estate,and whether the petition is filed merely to obtain a tactical litigation advantage.sgl carbon,at.
it is easy to see why courts have required chapter petitioners to act within the scope of the bankruptcy laws to further a valid reorganizational purpose.chapter vests petitioners with considerable automatic stay,the exclusive right to propose a reorganization plan,the discharge of debts,can impose significant hardship on particular creditors.when financially troubled petitioners seek a chance to remain in business,the exercise of those powers is justified.but this is not so when a petitioner amis lie outside those of the bankruptcy code.
id.at likewise,because filing a chapter petition merely to obtain tactical litigation advantages is not within the legitimate scope of the bankruptcy laws,courts have typically dismissed chapter petitions under these circumstances as well.id.at quoting in re marsch,at see also furness lilienfield,the bankruptcy provisions are intended to benefit those in genuine financial distress.they are not intended to be used as a mechanism to orchestrate pending litigation.
as the bankruptcy court recognized,integrated is unquestionably out of business,and therefore has no going concern value to preserve in chapter through reorganization or liquidation under the bankruptcy code.the question therefore becomes whether integrated petition might reasonably have maximiz ed the value of the bankruptcy estate.toibb,at.accord lasalle,at.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that it would not.
to say that liquidation under chapter maximizes the value of an entity is to say that there is some value that otherwise would be lost outside of bankruptcy.elizabeth warren,bankruptcy policymaking in an imperfect world,two empirically based economic assumptions underlie the attempt to preserve the value of a failing company orderly liquidation is likely to produce more to avoid more piecemeal liquidation and value is likely to be higher than liquidation value.collier on bankruptcy w here liquidation is appropriate,the code contemplates orderly liquidation and not a fire sale.at its most basic level,the bankruptcy code maximizes value by alleviating the problem of financial distress.see thomas jackson,the logic and limits of bankruptcy law the basic problem that bankruptcy law is designed to handle,both as a normative matter and as a positive matter,is that the system of individual creditor remedies may be bad for the creditors as a group when there are not enough assets to go around.as integrated conceded at oral argument,good faith necessarily requires some degree of financial distress on the part of a debtor.see sgl carbon,at courts,therefore,have consistently dismissed chapter petitions filed by financially healthy companies with no need to reorganize under the protection of chapter.emphasis added coastal cable,at to meet the good faith requirement many courts have held that a reorganization plan must bear some relation to the statutory objective of resuscitating a financially troubled corporation.emphasis added baker latham sparrowbush assocs.in re cohoes indus.terminal,cir although a debtor need not be in extremis in order to file such a petition,it must,at least,face such financial difficulty that,if it did not file at that time,it could anticipate the need to file in the future.in re dixie,cir recognizing that one factor relevant to good faith is whether the debtor is financially distressed and affirming dismissal of petition for,inter alia,use of bankruptcy proceedings despite the apparent good financial health of the debtor little creek,at determining whether the debtor filing for relief is in good faith depends largely upon the bankruptcy court evaluation of the debtor financial condition,motives,and the local financial realities.in re the bible speaks,concluding that,despite the absence of a statutory financial eligibility standard in chapter,t he legislative history to the bankruptcy code indicates that congress intended chapter to be resorted to by business entities which are experiencing some type of financial difficulty in re talladega steaks,dismissing petition where debtor presented no evidence that financial difficulties had precipitated the filing of the petition and indeed testified that the debtor debts and other financial obligations were substantially current.
to be sure,a debtor need not be insolvent before filing for bankruptcy protection.sgl carbon,at.
t he drafters of the bankruptcy code understood the need for early access to bankruptcy relief to allow a debtor to rehabilitate its business before it is faced with a hopeless situation.such encouragement,however,does not open the door to premature filing,nor does it allow for the filing of a bankruptcy petition that lacks a valid reorganizational purpose.
sgl carbon,at footnote omitted see also,in re,accordingly,the drafters of the code envisioned that a financially beleaguered debtor with real debt and real creditors should not be required to wait until the economic situation is beyond repair in order to file a reorganization petition.saying that there is no insolvency requirement,however,does not mean that all solvent firms should have unfettered access to chapter.despite the absence of an express financial eligibility requirement in the code sgl carbon emphatically rejected any such proposition 
courts,therefore,have consistently dismissed chapter petitions filed by financially healthy companies with no need to reorganize under the protection of chapter.those courts have recognized that if a petitioner has no need to rehabilitate or reorganize,its petition can not serve the rehabilitative purpose for which chapter was designed.
sgl carbon,at citations omitted.accordingly,the absence of a solvency requirement recognizes that even solvent firms can,at times,suffer from financial distress.id.at early access for solvent debtors designed to preempt a hopeless situation in re marshall,it is not uncommon for debtors to be solvent under the balance sheet test,and yet to have severe financial problems the united states bankruptcy law is designed to provide relief from creditor pressures for debtors with cash flow difficulties,even where they are clearly solvent under a balance sheet test.
both the bankruptcy court and the district court concluded that integrated faced financial distress because it was losing a lot of money,and was experiencing a dramatic downward spiral in september,and that,as a result,integrated had gone out of business.we do not see how bankruptcy offers integrated any relief from this sort of distress,which has no relation to any debt owed by integrated.that is,we can identify no value for integrated assets that was threatened outside of bankruptcy by the collapse of integrated business model,but that could be preserved or maximized in an orderly liquidation under chapter.because integrated dramatic downward spiral does not establish that integrated was suffering from financial distress,it does not,standing alone,establish that integrated petition was filed in good faith.
creditors that fear an impending default may seek to protect their claims,triggering the chaotic mix of repossession and judicial execution available at state law to which the bankruptcy code provides an alternative.warren,bankruptcy policymaking.at.the absence of an insolvency requirement encourages companies to file for chapter before they face a financially hopeless situation.sgl carbon,at.yet this is decidedly not the case here.the bankruptcy court recognized the unquestionable reality that the debtor simply was not leveraged and,apart from the landlord claim,had no significant debt.the court conclusion that i do think the code makes any distinction is legal error.
the absence of any financial distress facing integrated distinguishes the two principal cases relied on by the bankruptcy court and the district court.in ppi,an insolvent debtor defaulted on a lease with approximately million in rent remaining on the lease.at.the debtor chapter petition purported to serve two main purposes liquidating the debtor sole asset,namely,million in stock in del monte food,free of restrictions that would otherwise have limited its value to million and limiting the landlord lease termination damages under b.id.at.the debtor was successful on both fronts.the del monte stock was sold at a auction for million,id.at,and the landlord lease claim was capped at,id.at.
critically,the debtor in ppi claimed to have been insolvent.in addition to the landlord claims,the debtor had unsecured claims of approximately million,dwarfing the value of its only asset,the del monte stock.ppi,at.the landlord in ppi objected to these claims because the debt was owed to insiders of the debtor,namely,the debtor parent companies.the landlord argued that these insider claims should be recharacterized as equity interests,which would leave the debtor solvent by approximately million not including the landlord claim.id.at.this issue,however,was not raised on appeal,and we proceeded on the assumption that the debtor owed million in debt.ppi,at.accordingly,ppi stands for the proposition that an insolvent debtor can file under chapter in order to maximize the value of its sole asset to satisfy its creditors,while at the same time availing itself of the landlord cap under b.
we likewise understand in re sylmar plaza,which the bankruptcy court considered almost on all fours with the situation before me,to be a case in which chapter was used to maximize value for creditors.the debtors in sylmar plaza owned a shopping center that was subject to a secure loan from the bank.the debtors experienced cash flow problems and ultimately defaulted on the loan.at.bankruptcy allowed the debtor to sell the shopping center free and clear of the bank lien,which sale the bankruptcy court found to be in the best interest of the estate and all of its creditors.id.at.at order authorizing sale of real property free and clear of liens at,in re sylmar plaza,no.
the bank did not appeal the sale order.sylmar plaza,at.instead,the bank appealed from the confirmation of the debtor plan of reorganization,which took advantage of a provision in the bankruptcy code to calculate the bank claim according to the regular interest rate,rather than the default interest rate.id.in particular,the bank objected to the fact that the plan leaves the debtors solvent while permitting them to avoid paying interest at the default interest rate.id.at.
the ninth circuit affirmed the lower court finding of good faith,reasoning that insolvency is not a prerequisite to a finding of good faith,and the fact that a creditor contractual rights are adversely affected does not by itself warrant a bad faith finding.id.at.the court holding,however,can not be divorced from the facts of that case,which reveal that the bankruptcy code was used to maximize value for creditors as a whole.moreover,although the debtors appear to have come out solvent in sylmar plaza,there is no indication that they would have come out solvent had the bank claim not been limited,or that solvency was a foregone conclusion when the petition was filed.
in contrast,as noted above and detailed below,according to schedules filed with the bankruptcy court,integrated had million in cash and million in other assets at the time that it filed for bankruptcy,and yet the landlord proof of claim lists the present discounted value of integrated lease obligations at approximately million.integrated schedules also list miscellaneous liabilities of approximately.thus integrated was highly solvent and cash rich at the time of the bankruptcy filing.even if the ipo class action claim,which was capped at million with integrated liability limited to a million reserve the balance to be paid by insurance was listed at its full alleged value,integrated was still solvent at the time of filing.
in light of the foregoing,we conclude that the collapse of integrated business model does not support a finding of good faith.integrated was not suffering financial distress when it filed its petition,and the rulings of the bankruptcy court and the district court to the contrary constitute legal error.the failure of integrated business did not subject the company to any pressure on the value of its assets that could be reduced or avoided in an orderly liquidation under chapter.because integrated economic difficulties do not establish that integrated was suffering from financial distress,they do not,standing alone,establish that integrated petition was filed in good faith.
on appeal,integrated argues that its petition served a valid bankruptcy purpose because bankruptcy provide d a framework for the debtor to resolve the securities class action.appellee br.at.in this regard,the bankruptcy court made no findings that are entitled to deference.instead the bankruptcy court merely acknowledged that integrated offered a number of reasons for the filing of the bankruptcy case,and that the court believe d there is validity to a number of those considerations.emphasis added.a number of those considerations necessarily is less than all of those considerations,and the bankruptcy court did not identify which particular considerations had merit except to stress that integrated was losing a lot of money.moreover,colloquially at least,stating that there is validity to something is not the same as saying that something is valid.
nevertheless,integrated bore the burden of demonstrating good faith,and there is no evidence in the record from which a finding of good faith could be made based on the pending securities class action.there is no question,for example,that the securities class action did not place integrated in financial distress.when it filed its petition,integrated had assets of nearly million of which million was cash.integrated also had directors and officers d o insurance coverage of million.although the securities class claimed million,integrated concedes in its brief that it believed that the securities claim would be settled,likely within policy limits,for less than million.appellee br.at.in documents filed with the sec,including a proxy statement issued in anticipation of a vote on integrated plan of complete liquidation and dissolution under delaware law,integrated stated 
the company believes that the claims against it are without merit and intends to defend this lawsuit vigorously.while the outcome of these claims is currently not determinable,the company does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these claims will have a material adverse effect on the company financial position,results of operations or cash flows.
james regel,integrated ceo,testified that the above statement was true when the proxy statement was filed.integrated offers no argument that circumstances surrounding the securities class action changed between april of,when the board resolved to liquidate under state law,and october of that year,when the board decided to file under chapter.
in the end,integrated predictions proved accurate.the securities class ultimately voted in favor of a plan of liquidation that capped their claims at million.although the plan does not resolve the securities claims,it limits integrated liability for the securities class action to a million reserve.the securities class action will go forward,but the class has essentially capped its recovery at million the million reserve plus the million d o policy.the inescapable conclusion from the record is that the securities class action did not threaten any value of integrated that chapter seeks to preserve.this case is therefore entirely distinguishable from cases such as,where the debtor faced approximately lawsuits pending as of the filing date,with the prospect of the filing of an even more staggering number of suits over the course of years,at,or the bible speaks,where the debtor experienced two types of financial difficulty a cash flow problem which prevent ed it from meeting its current obligations and a staggering claim that may well exceed the value of the debtor assets and that pose d a threat to the debtor continued existence,at.see sgl carbon,at discussing these cases 
at the april hearing,the bankruptcy court suggested that the bankruptcy process facilitated the liquidation of the securities class action.first,the court reasoned that chapter effectively reduced the recovery by the securities law claimants by treating them like shareholders pursuant to section b.we can not find any evidence in the record to support a finding that this treatment forced the securities class to accept the million limit that the plan places on their potential recovery.nor could counsel for integrated and the ocesh support this finding when it was raised at oral argument.
second,the bankruptcy court observed that,i n a law context,the securities law plaintiffs would have had a very strategic advantage,namely so long as there was a possible recovery against the corporation,the liquidation would be stalled indefinitely.while the causal connection here may be more compelling,we fail to see how this observation distinguishes the securities class from any other typical creditor,since creditors often have strategic advantages outside of bankruptcy that they lack inside bankruptcy.
regardless,neither of the bankruptcy court observations establishes that integrated suffered financial distress,and neither supports a finding that liquidation under chapter offered a reasonable chance of maximizing the value available to satisfy all of the parties with an interest in integrated estate.rather than pursuing a valid bankruptcy purpose,these observations suggest that integrated filed for chapter in part to gain a litigation advantage over the securities class,a use of chapter that we emphatically rejected in sgl carbon.at holding that petition was not filed in good faith where debtor sole purpose was to put pressure on a claimant to accept the company settlement terms.
integrated argues that its petition served three additional purposes that support a finding of good faith.as with the securities class action,the bankruptcy court did not specify which,if any,of these asserted justifications had merit.our own review of the record convinces us that none of integrated proffered justifications warrant a finding of good faith.
first,integrated argues that chapter provide d an efficient procedure for the dissolution of debtor and distribution of its assets to parties in interest.appellee br.at.in the same vein,the ocesh argues that t he debtor chapter filing was in good faith because the debtor utilized the liquidation provisions under chapter of the bankruptcy code for the proper purpose of obtaining a quick,efficient,and orderly winding down of the operations of its failed business.ocesh br.at.dissolution,however,is not an objective that can be attained in bankruptcy.collier on bankruptcy after liquidation,any dissolution of the corporation or partnership that the parties desire must be effectuated under state law,since the code does not provide for dissolution of corporations or partnerships.nor is distribution,standing alone,a valid bankruptcy purpose.instead,the bankruptcy code allows for a distribution of the debtor estate pursuant to a valid plan of reorganization or liquidation.antecedent to any such distribution is an inquiry whether the petition and the plan are filed in good faith,whether they serve a valid bankruptcy purpose.neither integrated nor the ocesh offer any authority that the code can be used to effectuate a liquidation that has no hope of maximizing the value of the company,lasalle,at.toibb,at,but simply facilitates dissolution on terms favorable to equity interests.moreover,neither integrated nor the ocesh have identified any efficiencies that were realized in this bankruptcy that could not have been realized under delaware law.
second,integrated argues that chapter provide d court oversight to the proposed sale of its intellectual property as well as certain protections to the parties to the sale not available outside of chapter.appellee br.at.integrated intellectual property assets consist of patents,trademarks,copyrights,and trade secrets related to the company products and services.there is no dispute that the sale of these assets during the bankruptcy realized an additional million beyond the sale that integrated had negotiated prior to filing its chapter petition.under the circumstances of this case,however,this fact hardly justifies invocation of chapter.
for one,the increase in value was a result of integrated failure to adequately market the assets to potential bidders outside of the board and management when,on the very next day after it filed its petition,integrated moved to sell the assets at auction without further marketing,the ocesh challenged integrated sale as an improper exercise of business judgment.true,the ocesh is a creature of the bankruptcy code,appellee br.at,and,but for integrated petition,the ocesh would not have existed.but surely integrated did not need chapter to discover that a more open and competitive auction might increase the price obtained for its assets.
moreover,the increase in value was relatively insignificant,representing less than one percent of integrated total assets.integrated de minimis assets office equipment,inventory,by comparison,totaled.further,the net gain to integrated estate must also consider the fees paid from the estate to the ocesh committee members,attorneys,and professionals.in the end,this case is a far cry from ppi,where an insolvent debtor used chapter to increase the value of its sole asset by over percent million to million.that bankruptcy allowed for an additional million to be paid to the creditors of the debtors.ppi,at.
finally,integrated argues that chapter enable d the debtor to establish a bar date and define the universe of claims against it to assure that any distributions to its creditors and stockholders account for any inchoate claims.appellee br.at.essentially,integrated argues that,through the ocesh,shareholders were able to investigate potential claims and determine that none existed.the bankruptcy court made no finding that integrated was subject to inchoate claims that needed to be liquidated or barred,and integrated vague and passing references to potential disputes with its shareholders is entirely insufficient to establish a good faith expectation that chapter protection was necessary to protect integrated from such claims.
having determined that integrated was not in financial distress,and having rejected integrated post hoc rationalizations for filing under chapter,we turn to the ocesh argument that integrated desire to take advantage of the cap on landlord claims provided by b establishes good faith in and of itself.integrated makes a similar argument when it states that its petition properly sought a favorable forum for the consideration and resolution of other disputed claims,including the landlord claim.appellee br.at.
the bankruptcy court did not hold that integrated desire to take advantage of the b cap established good faith.instead,the bankruptcy court held that it does not establish bad faith for a debtor to file a chapter case for the purpose of taking advantage of provisions which alter rights,including altering the rights of a landlord under state law.emphasis added.we agree.indeed,we believe it to be a truism that it is not bad faith to seek to avail oneself of a particular protection in the bankruptcy enacted such protections with the expectation that they would be used.in re james wilson,cir it is not bad faith to seek to gain an advantage from declaring else would one declare it.
the far more relevant question is whether a desire to take advantage of a particular provision in the bankruptcy code,standing alone,establishes good faith we hold that it does not.just as a desire to take advantage of the protections of the code can not establish bad faith as a matter of law,that desire can not establish good faith as a matter of law.given the truism that every bankruptcy petition seeks some advantage offered in the code,any other rule would eviscerate any limitation that the good faith requirement places on chapter filings.
at least one bankruptcy court has dismissed for a lack of good faith a chapter petition seeking primarily to cap a landlord claim for future rent under b,in re liberate technologies,and other bankruptcy courts have similarly dismissed chapter petitions filed merely to take advantage of other singular provisions of the bankruptcy code.see place,cooper in re place,chapter petition filed to invoke trustee avoidance powers under bankruptcy code and to set aside transfer in re cal.sound,chapter petition filed to reject executory contract pursuant to a in re cardi ventures,chapter petition filed to assume and assign lease pursuant to f in re nancant,chapter petition filed to have certain tax liability determined pursuant to.for example,protects debtors by staying litigation against them during the pendency of the bankruptcy.yet courts universally demand more of chapter petitions than a naked desire to stay pending litigation,dixie,at.as one bankruptcy court put it 
the protection of the automatic stay is not per se a valid justification for a chapter filing rather,it is a consequential benefit of an otherwise good faith filing.a perceived need for the automatic stay,without more,can not convert a bad faith filing to a good faith one.
in re hba east.indeed,if there is a classic bad faith petition,it may be one in which the petitioner
