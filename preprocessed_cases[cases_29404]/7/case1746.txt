one commentator describes the frontier equivalent of mechanic liens 
if you furnish lumber to a man to build his house and he does pay you,you shoot him.if he sells the house and the new owner refuses to pay you,you shoot the new owner 
what this regime lacked in due process,it made up for in clarity,the importance of which is driven home by the somewhat opaque issue we tackle in this case whether a south lake tahoe redevelopment project was subject to acceptance by any public entity under california mechanic lien law.
the redevelopment project at issue was a joint venture between the south tahoe redevelopment agency the agency,a municipal agency,and el dorado,a developer and landowner.the project was intended to address urban blight in the city of south lake tahoe,and envisioned construction of a luxury hotel,marina building and parking structure,as well as an artificial wetland and estuary and a view corridor to the lake.
the city enacted a redevelopment ordinance,and el dorado and the agency signed a disposition and development agreement the agreement spelling out their respective duties.the agreement required the agency to acquire various properties and exchange them for properties el dorado owned.el dorado would then oversee construction of the project,while the agency would pay for related public improvements.the agency had several rights under the agreement it had approval authority over all construction drawings and plans,as well as any financing secured by the property.it also held a right of reverter if el dorado failed to perform.the agreement required the agency to issue a certificate of completion once el dorado finished work,which would be conclusive evidence of satisfactory completion of the project construction required by this agreement,in full compliance with the terms hereof.upon issuance of the certificate,the agency right of reverter and various approval rights would lapse.
the project was also under the jurisdiction of the tahoe regional planning agency trpa,a multistate environmental regulatory authority that oversees development in the lake tahoe region.the trpa had to approve the project both before and after construction,and el dorado had to post a bond to ensure compliance.
sundt was el dorado general contractor and dynamic finance was el dorado lender.sundt performed some preparatory groundwork for the hotel site,including excavation and grading.after work began,dynamic recorded a deed of trust on the premises to secure its loan.el dorado unfortunately ran into financial difficulty and filed for bankruptcy,owing money to both sundt and dynamic.the bankruptcy court sold off the project,and sundt and dynamic now dispute priority to the proceeds.sundt asserts it has a mechanic lien that trumps dynamic deed of trust.dynamic responds that sundt lien is invalid because it was recorded too late.the bankruptcy court found the lien untimely.the district court summarily affirmed,and sundt now appeals.
california,like other states,allows those who furnish labor or supplies to a construction project to claim a mechanic lien on the property,a right guaranteed by the state constitution.cal.const.art.xiv.if the owner fails to pay for services rendered,the lienholder can foreclose to recoup the debt.the lienholder has priority over the debtor general creditors and any security interest that attached after construction began.see generally miller starr,california real estate,at,ed james acret,california construction law manual,at,ed.the prospect of unknown liens makes property more difficult to sell,so state law requires lien claimants to record their liens in the public records promptly after construction is complete.claimants generally have days from completion to record,although the owner can take steps to shorten this period.see cal.
this deadline seems clear enough,but it only as certain as the day you start counting.parties often disagree about when a project is complete,particularly when only some minor details are outstanding.see,lewis hopper,d,considering whether a project was complete once four soap dispensers were installed acret,at.perhaps to forestall some of these disputes,california law prescribes completion equivalents events deemed to constitute completion.these include a the date the owner occupies or first uses the premises assuming construction has ceased b the date the owner accepts the project and c the date following certain work stoppages.cal.a c.this case involves a fourth completion equivalent,applicable only to a limited class of projects 
if the work of improvement is subject to acceptance by any public entity,the completion of such work of improvement shall be deemed to be the date of such acceptance 
id.emphasis added.unlike the other completion equivalents,this one is exclusive if it applies,it governs regardless of completion in any other sense.
the parties stipulated to all issues save whether the development project was subject to acceptance by any public entity.if it was,sundt lien was timely recorded if not,sundt missed the boat.sundt claims its work was subject to acceptance by both the agency and the trpa.it contends its obligations a to procure a certificate of completion from the agency and b to obtain approval from the trpa both constitute public acceptance requirements.dynamic thinks not,and we decide.
the statute does not define the phrase subject to acceptance by any public entity.california cases often apply the provision to public works,those built under contract with a public entity.see,dep t of indus.relations fidelity roof,th,d.in this context,the public entity acceptance is essentially equivalent to a private owner acceptance under subsection b 
california cases also apply the provision to other works,typically civic improvements such as roads,sidewalks,gutters or sewers built under private contract in connection with otherwise private construction projects.see raisch paving mountain view sav.loan ass n,d.streets,curbs,gutters,sidewalks,howard deason costa tierra,d.streets,curbs,gutters,sidewalks southwest paving stone hills,d.presumably streets richards hillside dev,d.streets,sewers,water mains mcgaw master craft homes,d,streets,curbs,gutters,sidewalks baxter home owners lenders,d.grading,excavation,storm drains.
the leading case is howard deason costa tierra,d,where various contractors claimed liens in connection with an apartment complex and related site work,asserting the project was subject to acceptance by the city.they pointed to several authorities,including the city building code and a subdivision ordinance requiring inspection and approval of street work by the city engineer.id.at.deason held that the subdivision ordinance was an acceptance requirement but that the building code was not.it explained 
routine inspections and approvals prior to commencement and during the progress of the work of improvement are not equivalent to a requirement of acceptance of the entire project by the governmental authority certificates of occupancy are issued after final inspection and determination that the building complies with provisions of the building code and relate only to the purposes for which a building is used or intended to be used.they are not evidence of acceptance or requirement of acceptance of the work of improvement 
defendants argue on this appeal that most localities throughout the state have adopted similar building codes governing all phases and types of construction that if this be deemed a requirement for acceptance by a governmental agency,then the other completion equivalents would not be effective in most instances.we do not believe the legislature intended this result.
we hold that the phrase subject to acceptance is not to be equated with inspection and approval or the issuance of certificates of occupancy under building regulations,but must find its base in some legislative enactment by the public authority.
sundt argues that both the certificate of completion and the trpa approval requirements find their base in some legislative enactment by the public authority.sundt notes,for example,that development agreements are legislative acts under state law.see
