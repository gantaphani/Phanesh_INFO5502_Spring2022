kenneth mccready has used the federal and state courts to harass ebay,and ebay customers.acting pro se,mccready has brought suits in many different courts,including twice in the united states district court for the central district of illinois,the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois,and iroquois county illinois circuit court.although mccready choice of fora may differ,his allegations and the respective outcomes do not.in fact,mccready has been wildly unsuccessful in each instance.
here,the two suits filed in the central district of illinois were dismissed,and we consolidated mccready appeals in order to provide a better understanding of the litany of his repetitive and frivolous legal maneuvers.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.additionally,we order mccready to show cause why he should not be sanctioned for his abuse of process.
mccready operated an online business in which he bought and sold various items through several accounts he had registered with ebay,the popular online marketplace.as with all users,ebay required mccready to abide by its user agreement.mccready dealings left several ebay users dissatisfied,and they used ebay feedback forum to voice their displeasure.the buyers complained that mccready failed to deliver the goods he sold or delivered goods of lower quality than he had advertised.ebay notified mccready of the complaints and informed him that his accounts would be suspended if he did not resolve them.after investigating the claims,ebay suspended mccready accounts in june or july,and advised him that he would be reinstated if he reimbursed the claimants.rather than make good on his sales,mccready embarked on retaliatory litigation.
the first lawsuit originated in the bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois,where mccready had filed for bankruptcy on april.on august,mccready petitioned for sanctions against ebay,alleging that ebay suspension of his account violated the automatic stay provisions of a.the bankruptcy court denied mccready petition.in an order dated march,the district court,on appeal,affirmed,agreeing with the bankruptcy court conclusion that ebay was not collecting debts but merely opting not to do business with mccready.
mccready brought his second suit in iroquois county illinois circuit court,where he filed a complaint against ebay and other defendants on november.the circuit court denied all of mccready claims and sanctioned him for litigating in bad faith.the appellate court of illinois affirmed.mccready ebay.may,cert.denied.
seeking to protect itself,ebay sued mccready on march,in california state court requesting declaratory relief allowing ebay to terminate its dealings with mccready.mccready removed the suit to federal court,but ebay successfully caused the case to be remanded to state court where default judgment was entered against mccready.
in the third action the first case on appeal,mccready filed an complaint in the central district of illinois on july,against ebay and numerous users of ebay.mccready alleged violations of the fair debt collection practices act,et the fdcpa,the fair credit reporting act,et the fcra,title of the bankruptcy code,and the electronic fund transfers act,et the efta.mccready alleged nine state law claims as well.
on december,the district judge dismissed all defendants other than ebay.on february,the court issued an order ruling on ebay motion to dismiss.in its order,the district court refused ebay request to apply res judicata to the federal claims,explaining that the lawsuits filed in california and illinois state courts involved only state law rather,the court evaluated mccready federal claims under federal rule of civil procedure b and dismissed the fdcpa and fcra claims but left intact mccready efta claim.the district judge declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over mccready state law claims,finding they raised novel issues of state law.he referred the case to a magistrate judge for disposition.
before proceedings with the magistrate judge got under way,mccready filed with the district judge a motion to reconsider his ruling dismissing his federal claims and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over his state law claims.the district judge denied this motion.soon thereafter,mccready filed with the district judge a second motion to reconsider,arguing that the district judge had misunderstood the basis of his claims.the district judge denied this motion as well.then the parties filed with the magistrate judge a stipulation to dismiss mccready only remaining claim under the efta with prejudice.the magistrate judge obliged on may.
the fourth lawsuit,which gives rise to the fifth,was filed by mccready in the western district of michigan and involved an ebay transaction.mccready had threatened legal action against bruce kamminga because kamminga sold a snowmobile to another buyer despite mccready having placed the highest bid.after mccready became aware that kamminga had consulted with david mcduffee,a lawyer,mccready sued both of them,alleging violations of the fdcpa in addition to various state law claims.
the defendants moved to dismiss,and the matter was referred to a magistrate judge.the magistrate judge converted the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment and recommended that the district judge grant relief to the defendants.the district judge did so by adopting the magistrate judge recommendation.mccready appealed.affirming in an unpublished order,the sixth circuit noted 
mccready accomplished the following in his objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation he repeatedly and inappropriately insulted the magistrate judge he insisted on the accuracy of his factual and legal assertions he characterized the defendants as liars and he threatened the district court with promises to file for a writ of mandamus if his cause of action was dismissed.mccready,however,failed to address the merits of the substantive issues raised in his complaint,challenged in the defendants motion to dismiss,and reviewed by the magistrate judge.rather,mccready filed a rambling,objection to the magistrate judge report and recommendation that contained numerous fundamental flaws in reasoning and analysis.mccready offered bold conclusions regarding facts and the law with little,if any support.
mccready kamminga,cir.what mccready failed to accomplish with his objections,the sixth circuit held,was to preserve any issues for appeal.id.notably,appended to the defendants appellate brief was a subpoena,issued by the court below,directing ebay to produce documentation relating to mccready.
in the fifth lawsuit the second case on appeal,mccready filed a complaint again in the central district of illinois,naming kamminga,mcduffee,and ebay as defendants.mccready alleged ebay production of documents in compliance with the subpoena in the michigan case violated title i of the electronic communications privacy act,the ecpa,and title ii of the ecpa,the stored communications act,the sca.on june,the district court dismissed mccready claims under rule b and stated 
t his court warned the parties that it would not allow this case to become trapped in a thicket of motions meant to harass adverse parties,increase the costs of the litigation,and cause vexatious delay.nonetheless,between may and may,mccready filed five motions.first,mccready filed a motion for default judgment and motion for entry of default against kamminga who was proceeding pro se for filing an inartful answer to the complaint.then on may,he filed a motion to strike mcduffee answer to the complaint and find mcduffee in contempt.also on may,mccready filed a motion to advance the filing date of a motion for sanctions against kamminga,since kamminga had filed an answer to mccready proposed motion for sanctions.on may,mccready filed a motion to strike mcduffee motion to dismiss,and on may,he filed the motion for sanctions against kamminga,which rendered moot his motion to advance the filing date.
