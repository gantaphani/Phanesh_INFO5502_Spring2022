this case involves a tangle of bankruptcy issues under the code as it existed prior to the effective date of the bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act of bapcp act,stat.the debtor,mark sidebottom,owned an eponymous construction company,sidebottom builders,sbi.david and jamie broyles are two of sidebottom creditors,who had contracted with sbi to build their dream home,but were left high and dry when sbi ceased performance.eventually,sidebottom personally and sbi as a company both filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code a little while later,before the chapter proceeding was fully resolved,sidebottom filed a petition for relief under chapter.the bankruptcy court and district court focused on the question whether the broyleses claims for fraud and conversion could be considered a liquidated,noncontingent debt for purposes of the chapter not,then the chapter proceeding was barred under e,because the debt exceeded.the district court concluded the bar of indeed applied and that sidebottom was thus not eligible for chapter relief.we agree that it was correct to dismiss sidebottom case,for the more fundamental reason that he was not entitled in these circumstances simultaneously to pursue chapter and chapter relief.
on april,david and jamie broyles hired sbi to construct a new residence on their property in indianapolis,indiana.the cost of the project was estimated at,which was to be paid in stages according to a schedule set out in the parties written contract.in order to receive the scheduled payments,sbi had to submit to the broyleses an application for payment certifying that the stipulated work had been completed.the contract permitted the broyleses to withhold payment for a variety of reasons defective work the filing or threatened filing of a mechanic lien the failure of sbi to make payments properly to subcontractors or for labor,materials,or equipment sbi failure to follow the plans or requirements of the contract or nonperformance of the work for that stage.
during the course of construction,the broyleses made four payments to sbi totaling,or of the full contract price.their last payment was made on october.shortly after that date,sidebottom notified them that sbi could not perform the contract and that it planned to file for bankruptcy relief.around december,the broyleses began receiving notices from various subcontractors stating that the broyleses were personally liable for payments that sbi owed to the subcontractors.the broyleses paid to one subcontractor,frank proctor.on january,the broyleses and sbi executed a contract termination agreement in which sbi acknowledged its breach.the broyleses then hired another construction company,hamilton homes,to complete the project at an additional cost of,well in excess of the remaining due under the contract.on april,the broyleses filed a complaint against sbi and sidebottom in the superior court of marion county,indiana,seeking damages for breach of contract,fraud,conversion,and unjust enrichment.
on april,hard on the heels of the broyleses suit,sbi filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under chapter of the code.about nine months later,on january,sidebottom followed with a personal chapter filing,which is the case of immediate relevance to this appeal.sidebottom petition naturally triggered an automatic stay of the state court proceedings against him,see a.the broyleses filed an adversary complaint in the personal bankruptcy,claiming that their fraud and conversion claims against sidebottom were nondischargeable under a a.the bankruptcy court scheduled an adversary proceeding on the matter for april,while it granted a general discharge to sidebottom with respect to his other debts on may.
at this point,matters became more complicated.less than two weeks before the adversary hearing,on march,sidebottom filed an overlapping petition for relief under chapter,which insofar as the broyleses claims were concerned covered exactly the same debts as the ongoing chapter proceeding.along with his application,sidebottom submitted a proposed plan and schedule of assets and liabilities.he listed the broyleses claim as a nonpriority,unsecured,disputed,unliquidated,and contingent claim of an unknown amount along with in unsecured priority claims and in other unsecured nonpriority claims in the schedule.his proposed plan represented that he would make monthly payments to his creditors in the amount of,totaling.
the bankruptcy court assumed that the new chapter filing required a stay of the scheduled adversary hearing in the chapter case.on july,it ordered the proceedings in the chapter nondischargeability action stayed until completion by the debtor of all payments required under a confirmed chapter plan,or dismissal or conversion of the chapter case.the broyleses moved to dismiss sidebottom chapter petition on two grounds first,that it was not filed in good faith,and second,that sidebottom debts exceeded the limit imposed by e.the broyleses alleged that sidebottom had filed the case for the sole purpose of avoiding the trial of the pending a a claim in the chapter proceeding.in addition,the broyleses alleged that their fraud and conversion claims represented a noncontingent,liquidated,unsecured debt and thus were covered by the cap in e.at the same time,the broyleses filed an objection to the confirmation of the chapter plan,arguing that it was not filed in good faith and that it unfairly discriminated against them.
after an evidentiary hearing,the bankruptcy court dismissed sidebottom chapter petition on the ground that the broyleses claims constituted a liquidated,noncontingent debt greater than the statutory cap for eligibility under chapter.the district court summarily affirmed the dismissal.
before this court,sidebottom argues that the district and bankruptcy courts were mistaken to conclude that the broyleses claim was liquidated.his argument is somewhat hard to follow,but essentially he appears to be asserting that the only party that owes money to the broyleses is his company,sbi,and that there was no reason for holding him personally liable for sbi debts.he goes on to assert that any contractual liability he himself may have had to the broyleses was covered by the may,general discharge in the chapter proceeding.the fraud and conversion claims,which he seems to concede survived that discharge,are not readily ascertainable indeed,he goes so far as to assert that the amount due under the contract with sbi was not readily determinable either.last,he argues that the broyleses claims against him are contingent,again because they depend on piercing the corporate veil.the broyleses,as one would expect,defend the bankruptcy court ruling.
simultaneous chapter filings 
although the parties have focused on e,a more fundamental question is apparent on the face of these proceedings,namely,whether sidebottom was entitled to maintain a chapter proceeding while a chapter proceeding involving the same debts was pending.a chapter case that follows a chapter case is a special form of serial or repetitive filing under the bankruptcy code it has been nicknamed a chapter filing.see lex coleman,individual consumer chapter cases after johnson an introduction to nonbusiness serial filings under chapter and chapter of the bankruptcy code,bankr.dev.in johnson home state bank,d,the supreme court held that the code did not expressly prohibit such filings where the chapter case was initiated after the chapter case had closed.looking at other code provisions governing serial filings,the court wrote that t he absence of a like prohibition on serial filings of chapter and chapter petitions,combined with the evident care with which congress fashioned these express prohibitions,convinces us that congress did not intend categorically to foreclose the benefit of chapter reorganization to a debtor who previously has filed for chapter relief.id.at.
the facts in johnson involved a chapter case that was begun after the conclusion of the chapter proceeding.sidebottom case,in contrast,involves a debtor effort to institute a chapter proceeding during the pendency of the chapter move dubbed a simultane
