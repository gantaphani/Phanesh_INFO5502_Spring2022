after judgment was entered in her favor,renfrow petitioned the bankruptcy court for prejudgment interest,attorney fees,and costs.her motion was denied with respect to attorney fees,partly denied regarding costs,and granted with regard to the prayer for prejudgment interest.in rejecting her claim for attorney fees,the court reasoned that the bankruptcy proceeding had involved only the question of the dischargeability of draper debt,and that under the law of this circuit an award of attorney fees is not permitted if only federal issues construing bankruptcy law were litigated,notwithstanding the express hold harmless provision contained within the divorce decree the bankruptcy court explained its ruling in the following words what happened here is that we were litigating dischargeability under a that has no basis in s tate law,and that the cases cited by draper are applicable.concordantly,i conclude that renfrow is not entitled to attorney fees and that will be the order.the bankruptcy court denied a substantial portion of renfrow costs on the basis that they were not recoverable under
