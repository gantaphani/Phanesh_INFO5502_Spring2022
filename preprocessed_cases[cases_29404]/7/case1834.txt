steve myrvang and joanne myrvang collectively the myrvangs appeal from the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court ruling that myrvang debt to his former spouse june cotner graves is nondischargeable.the myrvangs contend that the bankruptcy court determination of nondischargeability was erroneous as a matter of law.they further maintain that the district court erred in affirming the bankruptcy court imposition of a debt repayment plan and in granting a partial discharge of myrvang debt.the myrvangs also object to the bankruptcy court mandatory penalty for late payment.we conclude that the bankruptcy court properly interpreted a.we also conclude that the bankruptcy court acted within its equitable powers in ordering a repayment plan and the partial discharge of myrvang debt to graves.we reverse the imposition of the penalty provision for late payment because it exceeded the bankruptcy court equitable powers.
myrvang and graves divorced in.under the terms of their divorce decree,myrvang received,inter alia,his architectural practice and the couple marital residence subject to two mortgages,the first to bank of america in the amount of approximately and the second to seafirst bank in the amount of approximately.graves received a second home subject to a mortgage,a judgment in the amount of,and spousal maintenance to run for five years.the future royalties from two books written by myrvang and graves during their marriage were divided.the state court ordered that graves receive and myrvang of the royalties.
myrvang subsequently married joanne jurgich in.on december,the myrvangs filed for bankruptcy under chapter.five months later they converted their case to a chapter petition.on the date the petition was filed,myrvang had not paid approximately,including interest,of the amount he was ordered to pay graves under the terms of the divorce decree.graves filed an adversary complaint in the bankruptcy court against the myrvangs for a determination that the debts set forth in the divorce decree were nondischargeable pursuant to a.
before trial on graves adversary complaint,the trustee of myrvang estate sold his home and used the proceeds to pay off the mortgage owed by myrvang to bank of america.myrvang second mortgage to seafirst bank,however,remained outstanding 
following trial,the bankruptcy court reached several conclusions.first,myrvang was obliged to pay the sums listed in the divorce decree.second,the myrvangs had failed to satisfy their burden of proof as to the two affirmative defenses of inability to pay and greater benefit under a myrvang had the ability to pay his obligations based upon the disposable income test normally utilized in chapter proceedings,and the benefit to the myrvangs of discharging these obligations would not outweigh the detrimental impact that discharge would have on graves.
the bankruptcy court ordered that the myrvangs pay the sum of to graves over a five year period.the court ordered that the remainder of myrvang debt to graves be discharged.the bankruptcy court judgment also provided that if the myrvangs failed to make the payments as provided in its order,judgment would be entered against them in the full amount of myrvang indebtedness to graves and a penalty of would be assessed against them.the district court affirmed that portion of the bankruptcy court order holding that myrvang debt to graves was nondischargeable under a.upon the stipulation of the parties,however,the district court reversed that portion of the bankruptcy court judgment imposing individual liability against myrvang in her separate capacity.the myrvangs timely filed this appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.the myrvangs seek reversal of that portion of the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court judgment that myrvang is individually liable for the unpaid balance of the debt owed to graves pursuant to the divorce decree.
the myrvangs attack the bankruptcy court decision on the grounds that it determined myrvang present ability to pay under a a by improperly considering his past financial condition.the myrvangs base their argument on the bankruptcy court finding that the d efendants have consistently made maintenance payments to p laintiff as called for under the decree.they contend that the court should have made an estimate of myrvang prospective future income in considering whether he would be able to pay his debt.
in reviewing a bankruptcy court judgment we conduct de novo review of legal conclusions and clear error review of factual findings while m ixed questions of law and fact presumptively are reviewed de novo because they require consideration of legal concepts and the exercise of judgment about the values that animate legal principles.murray bammer in re bammer,cir en banc.we give no deference to the decision of the district court.see wolkowitz american research in re dak,cir.because the question whether a a requires a forward or backward calculation of income is a legal one,we review the bankruptcy court analysis de novo.
contrary to the myrvangs contention,the bankruptcy court made clear that it was taking into account both myrvang past payment history and future income stream.the court found that myrvang had the ability to pay because his maintenance payments to graves would be reduced and then ended altogether in the near future,leaving him more disposable income.similarly,the court determined that myrvang educational expenses would be reduced within two years when his son graduated from college,again increasing his future disposable income.we reject as baseless the myrvangs claim that there was simply no effort undertaken by the bankruptcy court to reach a conclusion as to how much money was available going forward.
the myrvangs contend that,even if the bankruptcy court correctly determined that myrvang was able to pay the amount awarded in the divorce decree,it erred in concluding that the balance of the equities under a b favors graves.because the balance of the equities test required the bankruptcy court to reach an equitable conclusion rather than a factual or legal one,we review the decision for an abuse of discretion.see bank of honolulu anderson in re anderson,cir per curiam appellate courts use the abuse of discretion standard to review bankruptcy court equitable actions terex metropolitan life ins.in re terex,cir bankruptcy court exercise of its equitable powers reviewed for abuse of discretion.
the myrvangs maintain that it was not by any means obvious from the evidence at trial that one party or the other had the weight of equity,let alone that the detriment to graves substantially outweighed the myrvangs s fresh start.this argument misapprehends the proper test for determining dischargeability under a b.it is the debtor and not the creditor who has the burden of persuading the bankruptcy court that a nondischargeable debt under a nonetheless qualifies for discharge.see in re jodoin,cir.bap hill smith.holding that the party claiming the exception to a statutory provision is required to prove the exception.the bankruptcy court determined that myrvang failed to satisfy his burden of persuasion.it did not abuse its discretion in weighing the equities.
the myrvangs assert that the bankruptcy court erred in compelling myrvang to repay his debt over a five year period.while conceding that a a does not specify the period of time over which payments should be made,the myrvangs contend that the bankruptcy court should have adopted the limitation on payment set forth in chapter.they maintain that a payment period is unreasonable as a matter of law.they point out that,had they not converted their chapter petition into a chapter petition,myrvang payment plan would have been limited to three years.the myrvangs further assert that because the disposable income test used by the bankruptcy court in determining myrvang ability to pay is derived from chapter,the bankruptcy court should have,for the sake of doctrinal consistency,also applied the preference of chapter for repayment plans as codified in d because the question of whether a permits the imposition of repayment plans is a legal one,we review the bankruptcy court decision de novo.
whether repayment plans are acceptable in the context of chapter proceedings appears to be a novel question.the parties do not cite a controlling case,and our research has revealed none.the bankruptcy court employment of a repayment plan would be impermissible under chapter.for this reason,at least one court has implicitly held that repayment plans under a should be limited to three years.see greenwalt greenwalt in re greenwalt,adopting the chapter test for determining ability to pay under a a and stating that u nder this standard,the court must critically assess the debtor budgeted expenses to determine the minimum the debtor could afford to pay over a period.
inconsistencies between chapters and,however,are relatively common.debts arising from fraud,fiduciary fraud,willful and malicious injury,and matrimonial obligations can be determined to be nondischargeable in chapter but are fully dischargeable in chapter.unlike the limitation set forth in chapter,chapter does not expressly prohibit a bankruptcy court from ordering a debtor to pay the debt in five years.
we are aided in our analysis by the supreme court interpretation of a and its exceptions.in cohen de la cruz,d,the court considered an appeal from a bankruptcy court decision that an award of treble damages against a for fraud was nondischargeable under a a.id.at.in affirming,the court explained that t he various exceptions to discharge in a reflect a conclusion on the part of congress that the creditors interest in recovering full payment of debts in these categories outweigh s the debtors interest in a complete fresh start.id.at.alteration in original quoting grogan garner,d see also in re bammer,cir discussing grogan and concluding that a acts as a limitation on the traditional goal of the bankruptcy act to provide debtors a fresh start.in light of the supreme court view of the congressional intent underlying a,it becomes less incongruous for a court to employ the chapter disposable income test,while at the same time foregoing the plan requirement.cohen makes clear that the a exceptions to discharge under chapter are special and need not conform precisely to the fresh start philosophy of the bankruptcy code.the bankruptcy court did not err in ordering repayment over five years.
the myrvangs next contend that the bankruptcy court erred in ordering a partial discharge of the debt.they maintain that nothing in the language of a authorizes a bankruptcy court to issue an order of partial discharge.instead,they assert,a bankruptcy court is compelled to make an choice.whether partial discharge is permissible under a is a legal question that we review de novo.
the myrvangs position admittedly has some support in case law.in united student aid funds,taylor in re taylor,cir.bap,the debtor petitioned the bankruptcy court to discharge his student loan debts under a on the grounds of undue hardship.the bankruptcy court granted the debtor a partial discharge of his debt.his creditor appealed.see id.at.the bankruptcy appellate panel for the ninth circuit bap reversed.see id.at.
the bap reasoned that the plain language of a,which provided for the nondischargeability of student loans unless exempting such debt from discharge would cause undue hardship,prohibited partial discharge.see id.at.because congress had failed to include the qualifier to the extent that such debt will cause undue hardship,the bap presumed that congress intended that a bankruptcy court should apply an approach in considering the discharge of a student loan.see id.at.
the bap recent decision in in re taylor,however,has already elicited criticism.the district court in great lakes higher education brown in re brown,rejected the bap view that the phrase such debts could be interpreted to require an approach.see id.at.the court reasoned that us ing an approach has the effect of rendering large debt more likely of discharge,and reward s irresponsible borrowing.id.at.the district court concluded that it should not be presumed that congress intended such a narrowing restriction on a bankruptcy court equitable powers.see id.
in in re greenwalt,a case decided prior to the bap decision in in re taylor,the bankruptcy court rejected the approach applied by some courts in construing a and concluded that a partial discharge is justified by a.id.at.it concluded that the such debt language of a meant that the court may review each liability separately.id.as we read in re greenwalt,it requires a bankruptcy court to divide a debtor liability to his or her former spouse into its separate,constituent obligations.the court may then discharge in total each separate obligation,resulting in a partial discharge of the total debt,but may not partially discharge a separate obligation.see id.this approach might yield inequitable results,as when one party total debt to his or her former spouse is composed of a very large obligation plus a much smaller one.in that case,if the debtor requested discharge and had an ability to pay an amount that was slightly less than the large obligation but much more than the small obligation,under in re greenwalt the bankruptcy court would have to discharge the large obligation in its entirety.the debtor would then be required to pay only the smaller obligation,despite his or her ability to pay much more.
in tennessee student assistance hornsby in re hornsby,cir,the sixth circuit rejected the notion that a bankruptcy court lacks the power to order a partial discharge of a separate liability.the court reasoned that a permits a bankruptcy court to order a partial discharge.see id.section a reads 
the court may issue any order,process,or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.no provision of this title providing for the raising of an issue by a party in interest shall be construed to preclude the court from,sua sponte,taking any action or making any determination necessary or appropriate to enforce or implement court orders or rules,or to prevent an abuse of process.
addressing the context of student loan discharges under a,the court reasoned that where undue hardship does not exist,but where facts and circumstances require intervention in the financial burden on the debtor,an treatment thwarts the purpose of the bankruptcy act.in re hornsby,at.
we agree with the sixth circuit reasoning in in re hornsby.its analysis applies with equal force to dischargeability proceedings under a.sec united states realty improvement.a bankruptcy court is a court of equity and is guided by equitable doctrines and principles except in so far as they are inconsistent with the act.citations omitted,cited in in re hornsby,at.moreover,as the supreme court has said in the context of interpreting the bankruptcy code,t he plain meaning of legislation should be conclusive,except in the rare cases in which the literal application of a statute will produce a result demonstrably at odds with the intentions of its drafters.united states ron pair,d quoting griffin oceanic contractors,d.we believe that construing the words such debt to preclude a partial discharge would run counter to the bankruptcy courts equitable powers under a.therefore,we hold that a bankruptcy court has the discretion to order a partial discharge of a separate debt arising out of the terms of a divorce decree.thus,the bankruptcy court did not err as a matter of law in concluding that it had the discretion to order a partial discharge.
bankruptcy rule,however,requires the bankruptcy court to make findings of fact and conclusions of law in all actions tried upon facts without a jury.jess carey in re jess,cir.the bankruptcy court did not make express findings to support its conclusion that myrvang was entitled to only a partial discharge of his debts to graves.thus,we can not tell from the present record how the court determined that some but not all of the amount owed to graves was dischargeable.therefore,we must vacate the district court judgment affirming the bankruptcy court order granting myrvang a partial discharge and remand to the bankruptcy court for further proceedings with directions that it
