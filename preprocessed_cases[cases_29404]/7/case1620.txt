debtor bruce simpson claims that his annuity is exempt property.his bankruptcy trustee objected to the exemption,the bankruptcy court sustained the objection,and the bankruptcy appellate panel bap affirmed.we conclude that,under the circumstances presented by the case,the annuity does not qualify as exempt property,either as life insurance or as a private retirement account,and we affirm.
simpson paid his bankruptcy attorney,who also sells financial products,for the purchase of a annuity known as the keyport index multipoint annuity the keyport annuity.simpson designated himself as the annuity contract owner and the annuitant.he designated his two sons as beneficiaries.
the keyport annuity is against the standard poor index.although the annuity interest rate depends on the performance of stocks in the index,the annuity has a guaranteed minimum growth of no less than on of the premium paid.the annuity contract states that the annuity is for irs purposes the annuity has no loan value,so simpson could not borrow against any part of the principal or accrued interest.the annuity contract provides that simpson would begin receiving payments on a specified income date.prior to the income date,simpson could surrender the annuity,but would be assessed an early surrender penalty.
the annuity promotional materials refer to it as a retirement savings tool with a taxable death benefit.the section entitled death benefit provides that,if simpson were to die prior to the income date,his beneficiaries could surrender the annuity without paying the ten percent penalty and would receive the principal,along with all interest accrued up to that point,as if it were fully vested.alternatively,they could keep the annuity,wait for it to mature,and then receive the payments simpson would have received.
a few months after purchasing the keyport annuity,simpson filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy under chapter of the bankruptcy code.he claimed that the keyport annuity was exempt under california civil procedure code section,which pertains to private retirement plans.simpson later filed an amended schedule,claiming that the annuity was also exempt under california civil procedure code section,which pertains to life insurance policies.
the trustee objected to simpson claimed exemptions for the keyport annuity.at the hearing on the trustee objection,simpson testified that he intended the annuity to provide a supplemental retirement income and viewed the annuity as an investment.he also testified that he viewed the annuity as containing a death benefit because of its waived penalty and accelerated vesting provisions.
the bankruptcy court sustained the trustee objections to simpson claimed exemptions and froze the annuity pending appeal.simpson appealed to the bap,which affirmed.simpson burkart in re simpson.this timely appeal followed.
we independently review a bankruptcy court decision on appeal from the bap.educ.credit mgmt.nys in re nys,cir.we review a bankruptcy court findings of fact for clear error,and review de novo a bankruptcy court conclusions of law,including statutory interpretations.demassa macintyre in re macintyre,cir.
whether the exemption statutes at issue apply to annuities is a question of statutory interpretation.in re macintyre,at.whether the features of a specific annuity,when considered together with the debtor intent,demonstrate that the product primary purpose and effect are life insurance,a retirement plan,or another financial instrument,is a factual determination that we review for clear error.jacoway wolfe in re jacoway.
california has enacted legislation opting out of the federal bankruptcy exemption scheme provided under.therefore,california law governs substantive issues regarding claimed exemptions.little reaves in re reaves,cir.
the bap and the bankruptcy court properly rejected simpson claim that the keyport annuity was exempt life insurance under california civil procedure code section a which provides 
unmatured life insurance policies including endowment and annuity policies,but not the loan value of such policies,are exempt without making a claim.
in deciding whether an annuity qualifies as exempt life insurance under california law,we undertake two inquiries.the first is a question of statutory interpretation,that is,whether the claimed statutory exemption includes the asset at issue.see lieberman hawkins in re lieberman,cir the scope of an exemption is a question of a law,which we review de novo.if the statutory exemption categorically includes the questioned asset,then the inquiry is at an end.if the asset is not categorically embraced within the statutory exemption,then the question is whether,as a factual matter,the particular financial instrument qualifies for the exemption 
in analyzing,we conclude that the section applies categorically only to life insurance and that annuities are not included within the statute reach.bernard coyne in re bernard,cir see also kennedy pikush in re pikush,aff,cir.
it is true that the statute has an important parenthetical reference to life insurance including endowment and annuity policies.however,we agree with the bap careful statutory analysis in pikush that this phrase was intended to clarify that life insurance that includes the essential features of an annuity or endowment policy does not lose its exempt character.at.as the bap noted 
had the california legislature intended to create an exemption for all endowment policies and annuity policies,whether or not they are life insurance policies,it presumably would have enacted a statute that exempted matured life insurance,endowment and annuity policies.
consistent with this analysis,and with our examination in bernard,we conclude that annuities are not included categorically within california statutory life insurance exemption.
because section applies only to life insurance,we next consider simpson argument that,alternatively,the keyport annuity is nonetheless exempt under the statute because it is actually a life insurance policy.after a thorough examination of the record,we conclude that the bankruptcy court did not err in determining that the keyport annuity did not constitute life insurance.
a annuity that provides a guaranteed stream of income and has no contingencies that can divest the debtor or his beneficiaries of their right to payment is an investment,not a life insurance policy.bernard,at pikush,at.to analyze whether a particular annuity falls within this rule,we examine the factors identified by the bap in turner marshack in re turner,namely whether the annuity is truly contingent whether the debtor can accelerate the maturity date whether the debtor can borrow against the policy who owns the policy whether payment of the premium is consistent with an investment or payment whether the seller was licensed to sell life insurance in the debtor state what,if any,is the opinion of testifying experts what provisions of the application are also part of the policy and whether a life insurance policy in the debtor state must contain a death benefit id.
the bap considered six of these factors and concluded that the keyport annuity was not life insurance based on the following findings 
unlike a life insurance policy,the payments under the keyport annuity are not contingent upon the debtor life 
the keyport annuity does not allow for the debtor to accelerate the maturity date 
the keyport annuity does not allow the debtor to borrow against it.
t he keyport annuity is in the nature of an investment because,i nstead of creating an immediate estate for the benefit of others,the annuitant reduced his immediate estate in favor of future contingent income.
s imply because the keyport annuity contains a death benefit does not make it the equivalent of a life insurance policy these limited death benefits do not change the fundamental purpose of the keyport provide the debtor with fixed,periodic payments for life or a stated period of time,without requiring his death to trigger sun life obligation to pay.
sun life is authorized to sell life insurance but this is not dispositive as to whether the annuity contract qualifies as life insurance ex
