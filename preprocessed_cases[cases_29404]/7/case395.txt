background 
on may,defendant joseph kennedy,filed an individual chapter bankruptcy petition in the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of new york.question a of the petition provided as follows 
if the debtor is an individual,list the names and addresses of all businesses in which the debtor was an officer,director,partner,or managing executive of a corporation,partnership,or sole proprietorship,or was a professional within the two years immediately preceding the commencement of this case,or in which the debtor owned percent or more of the voting equity securities within the two years immediately preceding the commencement of this case.

at trial,the government introduced evidence that defendant individually owned stock in sia prior to the filing of his bankruptcy petition,and that he also owned kai during the same period.with respect to sia,defendant stated in a march,deposition that he owned sia,and sia corporate books reflected that shares of stock of total outstanding shares were issued to defendant on january.sia filings with new york insurance department from january through october,which defendant signed under oath,also indicated that defendant owned of sia shares.finally,both defendant business associate,nancy crawford,and her attorney,michael polozie,testified as to their belief that defendant owned sia prior to the filing of his bankruptcy petition.
with respect to kai,the company tax returns for the years immediately preceding the filing of defendant bankruptcy petition,which were sworn to and subscribed by defendant,listed defendant as kai owner.kai forms for the years and reflected dividend payments to defendant in his individual capacity.defendant also submitted sworn declarations to the new york and pennsylvania insurance departments,both before and after his filing for bankruptcy,stating that he owned kai.finally,in the same sworn deposition on march,defendant stated that he owned kai.

in this opinion,we address the merits of the government appeal from the district court denial of a enhancement under b b.
discussion 
section b b of the sentencing guidelines provides for a enhancement of a defendant offense level if the offense involved a violation of any judicial or administrative order,injunction,decree,or process not addressed elsewhere in the guidelines.b b.in response to the government request for an enhancement under this section,the district court concluded,as a matter of law,that b b does not apply to defendant concealment of assets in a bankruptcy proceeding because such concealment did not constitute a violation of judicial process.reviewing this question of law de novo,see united states napoli,cir,cert.denied,d,we vacate the district court sentencing decision and adopt the majority view among the circuits that the concealment of assets in a bankruptcy proceeding constitutes a violation of judicial process within the meaning of b b.see united states kubick,cir united states mohamed,cir,cert.denied,d united states guthrie,cir united states webster,cir united states messner,cir.but see united states thayer,cir,cert.denied,d.
in reaching its decision that b b does not apply to cases of bankruptcy fraud,the district court relied on this court narrow construction of the phrase violation of judicial process in united states carrozzella,cir 
violation strongly suggests the existence of a command or warning followed by disobedience.this analysis in turn suggests that the term process the command or warning used,not in the sense of legal proceedings generally,but in the sense of a command or order to a specific party,such as a summons or execution issued in a particular action.this narrower reading is also consistent with the general as ejusdem construing general language in an enumeration of more specific things in a way that limits the general language to the same class of things enumerated.in the present circumstances,the word process follows injunction,order,or decree and is most easily read in the narrower sense of a command or order issued to a specific person or party.
carrozzella,at citations omitted see also thayer,at stating that,although the term judicial process in b b could be read to encompass an entire judicial proceeding,the entire bankruptcy proceeding,it seems more likely it was intended to be applied in a more circumscribed manner.
although the carrozzella panel expressed skepticism about whether the phrase violation of judicial process in b b was sufficiently broad to encompass a defendant concealment of assets in a bankruptcy proceeding,we emphasize that the views expressed in carrozzella were dicta 
our doubt on this matter need not be fully resolved because the failure of defendant conduct to fit comfortably within section b b reveals a fatal problem with imposing that section adjustment.that section applies only to a violation of any judicial or administrative order,injunction,decree,or process not addressed elsewhere in the guidelines.because defendant conduct is well within the heartland of the conduct addressed by section and fits only very doubtfully within section b b,we hold that it is addressed elsewhere.
carrozzella,at citations omitted emphasis in original.
in the absence of any binding circuit precedent on this issue,we disagree with the carrozzella panel suggestion that b b would not cover a defendant concealment of assets in a bankruptcy proceeding.we use basic statutory construction rules when interpreting the sentencing guidelines.see united states,cir.thus,we must give the words used their common meaning,absent a clearly expressed manifestation of contrary intent.united states demerritt,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.our analysis is that the plain meaning of the phrase violation of judicial process in b b includes within its scope violations of the bankruptcy process.
