in june,the plans filed a motion asking the bankruptcy court to order the trustee to show cause why he should not be held in contempt for failing to make timely payments,as required by the december order issued when m s was still in chapter.although the delinquent payments involved amounts due for the months of november and december and january,the plans waited approximately a year and a half,and until after m s was in chapter,before filing the motion to show cause why the trustee should not be held in contempt.after a hearing the bankruptcy court denied the motion in october,noting that the funds under the trustee control were subject to a perfected lien held by the first national bank of omaha.when m s was chapter debtor in possession before the trustee was appointed,m s had been able to use cash collateral to make contributions to the plans but the trustee did not clearly have that right.moreover,the bankruptcy court found no evidence that the trustee was even aware of the december order to make timely contributions or that he intentionally failed to comply with it.that order had been directed to the debtor in possession and predated the trustee appointment.the court concluded that the request for payment of delinquent contributions and liquidated damages sought by the show cause motion would be more appropriately resolved in the separate adversary proceeding the plans had brought seeking the same monetary relief

although the parties focus primarily on the district court jurisdiction,the first issue for us is whether we have jurisdiction over the appeal.we have an independent obligation to examine our jurisdiction and must address any jurisdictional problems we perceive even if the issue has not been raised by the parties.int l ass of fire fighters city of clayton,cir,citing,city of dallas,d yukon energy brandon,in re yukon energy,cir.
