application to monetary claims 
billups argues that the district court erred in applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel in this case because pemco was not a party to the bankruptcy proceedings pemco was not prejudiced by the omission of the claim in the bankruptcy proceedings and billups did not have the requisite intent to manipulate the judicial system.
in this case,judicial estoppel is raised in the context of a bankruptcy proceeding and a federal employment discrimination case therefore,federal law governs our analysis.see chrysler credit rebhan,cir,abrogated on other grounds by,grogan garner,d in re coastal plains,cir.judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine invoked at a court discretion.new hampshire maine,d internal citations and quotations omitted.under this doctrine,a party is precluded from asserting a claim in a legal proceeding that is inconsistent with a claim taken by that party in a previous proceeding.judicial estoppel is an equitable concept intended to prevent the perversion of the judicial process.james moore et,moore federal practice,ed.the purpose of the doctrine,is to protect the integrity of the judicial process by prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment.new hampshire,at.at internal citations and quotations omitted.this circuit has explained that,j udicial estoppel is applied to the calculated assertion of divergent sworn positions.the doctrine is designed to prevent parties from making a mockery of justice by inconsistent pleadings.american bank of jacksonville federal dep.ins,cir internal citation omitted see also,coastal plains,at explaining that,t he purpose of the doctrine is to protect the integrity of the judicial process by preventing parties from playing fast and loose with the courts to suit the exigencies of self interest.internal quotations omitted.in the eleventh circuit,courts consider two factors in the application of judicial estoppel to a particular case.salomon smith barney,harvey,cir.first,it must be shown that the allegedly inconsistent positions were made under oath in a prior proceeding.second,such inconsistencies must be shown to have been calculated to make a mockery of the judicial system.id.
recently,the supreme court observed that,the circumstances under which judicial estoppel may appropriately be invoked are probably not reducible to any general formulation of principle nevertheless,the court went on to enumerate several factors that inform a court decision concerning whether to apply the doctrine in a particular case.new hampshire,at.at internal citations omitted.courts typically consider whether the present position is clearly inconsistent with the earlier position whether the party succeeded in persuading a tribunal to accept the earlier position,so that judicial acceptance of the inconsistent position in a later proceeding creates the perception that either court was misled and whether the party advancing the inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage on the opposing party.id.this list is by no means exhaustive,however,because the court went on to explain that i n enumerating these factors,we do not establish inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining the applicability of judicial estoppel.additional considerations may inform the doctrine application in specific factual contexts.id.we conclude that the two factors applied in the eleventh circuit are consistent with the supreme court instructions referenced above,and provide courts with sufficient flexibility in determining the applicability of the doctrine of judicial estoppel based on the facts of a particular case.we recognize that these two enumerated factors are not inflexible or exhaustive rather,courts must always give due consideration to all of the circumstances of a particular case when considering the applicability of this doctrine.with these principles in mind,we turn to the issue at hand.
there is no debate that billups financial disclosure forms were submitted under oath to the bankruptcy court therefore,the issue becomes one of intent.before turning to the question of intent,however,we first outline a debtor duty to disclose under the bankruptcy laws and address some of billups other arguments.
