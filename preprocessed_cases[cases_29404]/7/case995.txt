the debtor,nan beth alt,appeals from an order of the district court affirming the bankruptcy court dismissal of her bankruptcy petition on the grounds that she is ineligible for chapter relief because the amount of her liquidated,unsecured debt exceeded the statutory limit,and because the record showed that her petition was not brought in good faith.the district court sustained the bankruptcy court decision,focusing principally on the issue of good faith.alt challenges both aspects of the bankruptcy court ruling.we find no error and affirm.
factual and procedural background 
nan beth alt is a licensed psychiatrist practicing in michigan.for the past several years,alt and members of her family have had a very contentious relationship with the internal revenue service.in,alt father,william alt,and her sister,karen alt,were convicted by a jury of various federal income tax offenses.on direct appeal,this court reversed their convictions based upon an improper jury instruction and remanded the case for a new trial.see united states alt,cir.upon remand,william alt pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to time served.see united states alt,cir.during the pendency of the appeal,the government sued william alt and other members of the alt family in a civil action to collect back taxes arising from through,along with interest and penalties.the district court judgment requiring william alt to pay was affirmed by this court on appeal.alt,at.
the irs asserts that nan beth alt failed to file federal income tax returns for the years and moreover,irs audits for the years and resulted in a combined tax deficiency for alt in the amount of.the irs also audited alt for the years through.initially,the audits for these years were assigned to the irs criminal investigation division for criminal fraud,but they were later returned to the division for civil fraud.
in may,alt assigned her accountant,earl gemmen,to represent her before the irs with respect to her tax liabilities for the years through.in july,gemmen sent a letter to the local irs office seeking assistance in compiling totals for the tax liability of nan alt and alt personal services corporation.specifically,gemmen wanted to know as quickly as possible the amount of alt entire liability.one week later,an irs revenue agent sent gemmen copies of reports relating to alt liability,not including interest,that the irs represented would give gemmen a reasonable figure to work with.gemmen followed up on the irs letter by asking for the interest calculations,or at least the effective interest rates.
in june,the irs sent alt a statutory notice of deficiency in the amount of for the years through.several months before the issuance of that notice of deficiency,alt had filed her initial petition for chapter relief in bankruptcy court.however,the bankruptcy court dismissed that petition when alt lawyer failed to appear at the scheduled confirmation hearing,and the petition had to be refiled after the deficiency notice was issued.in listing creditors holding unsecured,claims in the second petition,alt indicated that the irs had a claim arising from a tax assessment in the amount of.alt did not indicate the taxable year or years to which this assessment related.she also listed two different law firms as holding unsecured claims for attorneys fees in the total amount of,and a tax debt to the state of michigan.alt listed no other creditors.
in november,the irs filed a proof of claim in alt bankruptcy case,listing a secured claim for,an unsecured priority claim of,and an unsecured general claim for.the irs claim covered civil penalties from and,as well as income tax liability for and.it did not include tax liabilities arising from the years through,even though it had less than five months before issued a notice of deficiency for amounts due from those years.
in march,the government took alt deposition pursuant to federal rule of bankruptcy procedure.alt performance in the deposition was remarkable beyond providing her full name at the outset of the deposition,she was either unable or unwilling to be responsive to the most basic questions posed by the government.for example,alt stated that she was unaware of her street address and could not remember when she moved to her current residence.when asked for her telephone number,alt stated,i ca tell you that either.i do receive any calls there,as a rule.
further,even though alt than one year before the,as president,the corporate income tax return of clinical psychiatric medicine,her deposition testimony demonstrated an incredible lack of knowledge about the company.alt testified that she d id not know how many employees the company had,but that she believe d that four people worked there alt sister gretchen,mother,and alt herself.when asked what services gretchen performed for the company,alt responded,oh,i could tell you.alt claimed not to know who owned the stock of the corporation or whether she had any ownership interest in it.both alt attorney and her accountant were present during her deposition testimony.
within a few weeks of the deposition,the government moved to dismiss alt chapter petition,attaching,among other exhibits,the transcript of alt deposition.the government argued that alt did not qualify for chapter relief under e because she lacked regular income,and as of the date she filed her petition,she owed to the irs noncontingent,liquidated,unsecured debts greater than.the government argued that it was impossible to verify whether alt had regular income because of her during the deposition.with respect to the,liquidated,unsecured debt ceiling,the government represented that it had mailed alt a notice of deficiency for the years in the amount of on june.this tax debt was not reflected in alt second petition.finally,the government requested that i nsofar as the debtor petition was not in good faith,it should be dismissed outright,without any option for conversion to a chapter petition.
in her short written response,alt asked the court to deny the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the irs had filed a proof of claim in the much smaller total amount of,and that the deadline to file claims in her case had long passed.according to alt,the irs should be barred from alleging its claim is not as filed.alternatively,alt argued that,should the court find her ineligible under chapter,she be allowed to convert her petition to chapter.
at a later hearing on the government motion to dismiss,alt attorney told the bankruptcy judge that,at the time alt filed her petition,w i believed in good faith that the amount of the irs debt was within the jurisdictional limits of chapter and,in fact,the irs filed a claim in the amount of.in support of his assertion that alt was proceeding in good faith,the lawyer represented that alt had been making her payments consistently to the trustee.further,he said that he d id not believe he ever saw the june notice of deficiency sent to alt.
the bankruptcy court noted that it had reviewed alt deposition and was shocked.counsel for the bankruptcy trustee agreed with the court assessment of alt performance and noted further that the questions asked at deposition had still not been answered satisfactorily.the bankruptcy judge decided in open court that alt petition should be dismissed 
case dismissed.what the court has seen in this case is shocking.here is an educated person who apparently for some reason chose to seek bankruptcy counsel without bringing to his attention the fact that a letter had been received from the irs setting forth the amount of taxes which were owed which were clearly over the jurisdictional limit at the time.then coming into the bankruptcy the debtor takes to a deposition in which the answers are laughable at best,fraudulent and criminal at worst,indicating information that is not available to her.she does know her address,her phone number,where she lives,has never seen any checks being written.this is you may use my.this is not what bankruptcy is all about.
if the debtor has a dispute with the irs then the dispute has to be met,honestly and fairly.we do is not a haven for tax protestors,it is for the honest but
