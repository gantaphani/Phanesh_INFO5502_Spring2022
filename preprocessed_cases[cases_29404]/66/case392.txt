introduction 
summary judgment was entered in favor of defendants and respondents paul beck and the law firm of beck,llp collectively beck and against plaintiffs and appellants robert nielsen and william nielsen collectively the nielsens.
the issue we address in this legal malpractice case is whether there are triable issues of fact with regard to the statute of limitations.the resolution of this issue centers upon subdivision a of code of civil procedure section that tolls the statute if an attorney continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred.
we reverse because there are triable issues of fact.
factual and procedural backgrounda.facts 
the initial retention of beck.
the nielsens owned primepapers,primepapers,a company that cuts rolls of paper used by other commercial interests.
attorney richard berger referred the nielsens to beck to assist with the potential bankruptcy of primepapers.beck was hired by primepapers and its affiliate entity,primepapers louisiana ppl.the april,written fee agreement stated that beck was to represent primepapers and ppl in connection with a number of pending legal issues,including but not limited to the defense of claims brought against the company by various creditors and the resolution of the company outstanding obligations to its creditors through a workout or chapter or chapter bankruptcy filing.
by may,primepapers creditors had forced the company into involuntary bankruptcy.the bankruptcy proceedings were converted into a chapter reorganization and thereafter into a chapter liquidation.on march,the bankruptcy court entered an order closing the case.
the prologis action.
primepapers leased a building in rancho cucamonga,california from prologis california i,llc prologis.the lease for that premises contained a provision whereby prologis would waive a large amount of rent.however,in the event of default,this free rent had to be paid.the nielsens personally guaranteed the lease.
shortly after beck was retained,beck advised the nielsens to stop making rent payments to prologis.in april,prologis filed an unlawful detainer action against primepapers,ppl,and the nielsens in the san bernardino superior court.
in june,beck began representing primepapers,ppl,and the nielsens in connection with the unlawful detainer action.the june,written fee agreement recognized that p ursuant to our engagement several months ago on behalf of primepapers we are already representing primepapers as the primary defendant in the landlord action,which has been enjoined pursuant to the bankruptcy case beck described the representation as follows i was already representing primepapers in connection with its relationship with the landlord.this engagement authorized me to be retained on behalf of ppl and the nielsens individually who were guarantors of or otherwise on the prologis lease.
on september,the san bernardino trial court found against ppl on the issue of possession and against the nielsens in the amount of.in issuing a judgment in that amount,the trial court recognized that primepapers was in bankruptcy.
beck continued to provide professional services to primepapers,ppl,and the nielsens in attempts to settle the unlawful detainer case and to avoid enforcement proceedings by prologis,the judgment creditor.
the substitution of attorney.
on august and,beck met with attorney jerry zack,an attorney in ronald slates law firm.beck gave attorney zack his files and materials relating to the unlawful detainer case.
by this time,robert nielsen was unhappy with the professional services rendered by beck.he had lost confidence in beck abilities.robert nielsen believed beck had lied,was unprepared for the prologis trial,had caused the adverse verdict,and had provided confidential information to a third party.there is conflicting evidence as to whether he ever communicated his dissatisfaction to beck 
on august,the nielsens and beck executed a substitution of attorney form to replace beck with attorney slates.the substitution of attorney form was returned to attorney slates and then filed with the superior court on september.
according to robert nielsen,at the time the substitution of attorney form was signed,he felt very uncomfortable for beck to do any more work for him.everything that beck touched,it continued to get worse and worse and worse.however,after august,beck continued to work for the nielsens.
on september,and,robert nielsen contacted beck by telephone concerning appropriate tactics and procedures in resolving the prologis claims.
on october,beck mailed a bill to robert nielsen for professional services.the bill requested payment of for one hour of professional services rendered as follows 
in his deposition,beck described the conversations on september,and,as follows 
referring to the october,billing statement,is this for work you did in the prologis matter 
a.it represents exactly what it says.i had three telephone conversations with nielsen i was a bit surprised to hear from robert nielsen after i was substituted out,but he called me to tell me what was going on with slates zack and their efforts to negotiate with prologis.i do know that he asked me anything other than to tell me what they were doing and asked me if that was the right procedure to follow.it kind of checking up on his new lawyers with me,the way he would check up on me with dick berger.
do you remember anything else that was discussed with him in these series of phone calls with robert nielsen other than what you already testified to 
based upon these descriptions,all three of them concerned the status of negotiations and negotiating strategy with respect to prologis.those negotiations were being conducted by slates or zack.
i see that on december there a reference to options.i had testified earlier that i had informed nielsen that he had the options among others of a personal bankruptcy filing.i recalling specifically,i may well have reminded him that that was an option,but i did not consider myself to be rendering advice at this point.i was simply documenting the fact that he had contacted me,because i wanted to show him that i was still trying to be responsive to him although i was no longer his counsel.
on september,the nielsens filed this legal malpractice action against beck.the complaint sought damages for representation with regard to the bankruptcy and prologis cases.
beck filed a motion for summary judgment contending that the lawsuit was barred by the statute of limitations contained in code of civil procedure section.in opposing the motion,the nielsens argued that the statute of limitations was tolled under the continuous representation rule codified in subdivision a of section.
the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment.the nielsens appeal from the subsequently entered judgment.we reverse.
discussiona.standard of review.
summary judgment is properly granted where there are no triable issues of fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.we review the trial court decision granting a summary judgment de novo.in doing so,we liberally construe all conflicting facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.pacific shore funding lozo th,d crouse brobeck,phleger harrison,supra,th at,d daniels desimone,supra,th at,d.
b.the continuing representation tolling provision of code of civil procedure section.
code of civil procedure section sets forth the statute of limitations for legal malpractice.subdivision a states that a n action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission arising in the performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first.in no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed four years except that the period shall be tolled during the time that t he attorney continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred.
in laird blacker cal th at page,d,the supreme court quoted the legislative history in enunciating the purposes of tolling based on continuous representation.they are to avoid the disruption of an relationship by a lawsuit while enabling the attorney to correct or minimize an apparent error,and to prevent an attorney from defeating a malpractice cause of action by continuing to represent the client until the statutory period has expired.citation.accord beal bank,ssb arter hadden,llp cal th,d.
code of civil procedure section does not expressly state a standard to determine when an attorney representation of a client regarding a specific subject matter continues or when the representation ends,and the legislative history does not explicitly address this question.gonzalez kalu th,d gonzalez.however,a number of recent cases have addressed this standard.
worthington rusconi th,d worthington,as followed by lockley law office of cantrell,green,pekich,cruz mccort th,d lockley,properly enunciated the reasons for using an objective standard in malpractice cases generally.ordinarily,an attorney representation is not completed until the agreed tasks or events have occurred,the client consents to termination or a court grants an application by counsel for withdrawal.mallen smith,legal malpractice,ed.statutes of limitations.the rule is that,for purposes of the statute of limitations,the attorney representation is concluded when the parties so agree,and that result does not depend upon formal termination,such as withdrawing as counsel of record.id.at accord,shapero fliegel d.the failure to formally withdraw as attorney of record,standing alone,will not toll the statute of limitations under the rubric of continued representation hensley caietti th,d t he period of tolling should not turn upon the fortuity of the time of delivery of notice of discharge to counsel.worthington,supra,at,d.continuity of representation ultimately depends,not on the client subjective beliefs,but rather on evidence of an ongoing mutual relationship and of activities in furtherance of the relationship.worthington,supra,at,d,fn.omitted accord lockley,supra,at,d.
the limitations period can be tolled even though the client is aware of the attorney negligence.tichy th,d.also,consulting another attorney is not tantamount to ending a prior relationship,the court will not use that occurrence as a benchmark which,standing alone,signals the termination of the attorney and client relationship.worthington,supra,th at,fn,d.however,not every contact between an attorney and his client amounts to representation.gurkewitz haberman d.when contact manifests an ongoing mutual relationship and activities in furtherance of that relationship,then there can be a continuing relationship such that the tolling provision is to be applied.worthington,supra,at,d.
in our recent case of gonzalez,supra,th,d,an attorney abandoned a client.we held that in such situations,continuous representation should be viewed objectively from the client perspective id.at,d.this objective standard examines the evidence through the eyes of the client and is appropriate because otherwise an attorney could abandon a client without the client knowledge,and yet escape a legal malpractice lawsuit.in abandonment cases,the purpose of the rule would be obliterated.thus,the crucial inquiry in abandonment cases is when the client actually has or reasonably should have no expectation that the attorney will provide further legal services.citation.id.at,d.
in gonzalez,we did not mean to suggest that the standard,which is to be viewed by the client perspective,is to be applied universally,in all cases.rather,we compared abandonment cases to other types of malpractice lawsuits.in gonzalez,we noted that i n both worthington and lockley there were continuing contacts between the attorney and client regarding the specific subject matter of the representation.worthington and lockley held that those contacts established continuing representation and did not rule on the question whether an attorney representation of a client can continue when there are no contacts.worthington,supra,th at,d lockley,supra,th at,d.gonzalez,supra,th at,d.
thus,the inquiry in the matter before us is whether,using an objective standard,there are triable issues of fact about whether there was an ongoing relationship and activities in furtherance of the relationship.we now turn to that inquiry.
c.there are triable issues of fact with regard to the statute of limitations.
we agree with the nielsens that there are triable issues of fact with regard to tolling the statute of limitations.
there are triable issues of fact as to whether there was evidence of an ongoing mutual relationship and activities in furtherance of that relationship.
to satisfy the one year provision of code of civil procedure section,the nielsens legal malpractice case had to be filed within one year after the nielsens discovered,or through reasonable diligence should have discovered,the negligence of beck,unless the statute was tolled pursuant to subdivision a because beck continued to represent the nielsens.
there is evidence that robert nielsen was dissatisfied with beck representation as early as august.the nielsens legal malpractice lawsuit was filed on september.the nielsens contend that the statute of limitations had not expired because the substitution of attorney form was not filed until september,and even if the statute had expired,it was tolled because beck continued to represent them.
a strong argument can be made that the statute of limitations could not extend any later than august,when the substitution of attorney form was executed because it demonstrated that the ongoing relationship between beck and the nielsens had ended and beck would no longer be rendering legal advice.however,there is contrary evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that the relationship between beck and the nielsens had not been severed at the time the substitution of attorney form was signed,but rather,the statute was tolled through september.
on september,and,robert nielsen placed telephone calls to beck asking for advice.there is evidence that during these three telephone calls,beck rendered professional services.beck october billing statement requested payment for professional services rendered and described the services beck rendered as negotiations,options and strategy.beck testified in his deposition that during these telephone calls,robert nielsen asked for advice as to procedure,negotiations,and tactics to resolve the prologis case,and beck was responsive to those requests.thus,there is evidence from which a trier of fact could conclude that there was an ongoing mutual relationship and activities in furtherance of that relationship through september.if the trier of fact so concludes,then the statute of limitations would not have expired because the lawsuit was filed on september.tichy,supra,th,d client awareness of the attorney negligence and retention of malpractice attorney does not interrupt the tolling of the limitations period as long as client permits attorney to continue representing client regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged negligence occurred.
beck argues that the statute of limitations had expired.beck asserts that robert nielsen considered the relationship to be over,and in fact it was over,by the time attorney slates was hired and the substitution of attorney form was signed on august,rubinstein barnes d.statute not tolled where attorney represented client in dissolution,client considered representation over once decree entered even though thereafter client telephoned attorney once regarding support payments,but client did not ask attorney to take any action.beck states that he was simply being cordial when he discussed the pending litigation with robert nielsen and that the three conversations do not evidence a continuing relationship.this may be the conclusion that a trier of fact reaches.however,the fact that robert nielsen continued to ask beck for advice even after the substitution of a
