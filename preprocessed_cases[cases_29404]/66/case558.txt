in this medical malpractice mandamus proceeding,the defendant hospital seeks to recover privileged documents that were mistakenly provided to its designated testifying expert witness.we must decide whether texas rule of civil procedure d,known as the provision,preserves the privilege over rule e mandate that all documents provided to a testifying expert are discoverable.we hold that the inadvertent nature of the production in this case preserved the privilege under rule d and entitled the hospital to recover the documents upon realizing its mistake,provided the hospital designated expert does not testify at trial.the hospital has not attempted to name another testifying expert,instead indicating an intent to rely upon the expert to whom the documents were disclosed.so long as the hospital stands upon its testifying expert designation,rule plain language and purpose and the policy considerations that surrounded its amendment compel the conclusion that the documents may not be snapped back.accordingly,we deny the hospital petition for writ of mandamus without prejudice to any right the hospital might have to designate another testifying expert and recover the privileged documents.
background 
when mona palmer notified christus spohn hospital kleberg of her intent to file a health care liability claim arising out of her daughter brandi lee palmer death,the hospital internal investigator,sandra northcutt,conducted an investigation.that investigation generated a number of documents,labeled confidential communication prepared in anticipation of litigation,which form the basis of this mandamus action.the northcutt documents include northcutt memoranda summarizing her interviews with hospital employees and her correspondence to and from hospital counsel.a paralegal newly employed by the hospital counsel sent the northcutt documents to the hospital only expert witness on issues,nurse kendra menzies.according to the hospital counsel,the paralegal had recently moved to texas from california,where she understood that all materials forwarded to an expert witness remained confidential.she assumed the same rule applied in texas.
menzies expert report on brandi lee palmer listed the documents she reviewed in forming her opinion the northcutt documents do not appear on that list.plaintiff counsel sought to depose menzies,and issued a subpoena duces tecum requesting all documents furnished to and reviewed by menzies in connection with her consultation in the lawsuit.among the materials menzies brought to the deposition were the northcutt documents.this was the first time that the hospital and palmer counsel learned the privileged documents had been forwarded to menzies.when questioned about the documents that had been transmitted to her,menzies testified,i did read every bit.but,yes,i glanced through everything in the box.
the hospital filed an objection,assertion of privilege,and motion to return privileged documents pursuant to rule d of the texas rules of civil procedure,known as the snapback provision,seeking to recover the documents mistakenly produced to menzies.at the hearing on this issue,menzies testified by affidavit that she did not read the documents but rather glanced at them merely to identify what they were,and upon determining that they were not relevant to her needs,tossed them back in the box.the trial court overruled the hospital claim of privilege,stating it was unclear that menzies did not see certain specified documents.the court of appeals denied the hospital request for mandamus relief.we granted the hospital request for mandamus review to consider the application of rule d provision to the northcutt documents.mandamus is appropriate if we conclude that the documents are in fact privileged and have been improperly ordered disclosed by the trial court.see in re bass.
ii.discussion 
a.the parties arguments 
the hospital claims the northcutt documents were created or generated in connection with the hospital internal investigation conducted in anticipation of litigation therefore,the privilege shields them from discovery.see civ.a,b according to the hospital,the privilege was not lost when the documents were transmitted to menzies because waiver can only occur when privileged documents are voluntarily and knowingly disclosed,not when disclosure is inadvertent.the hospital claims this principle is embodied in rule d snapback provision,which mandates the return of privileged documents that have been inadvertently produced.because it properly invoked rule d provision,the hospital argues,the trial court erred in determining that the privilege was waived.the hospital further contends that rule e,which mandates disclosure of all documents provided to a testifying expert,is not implicated because the northcutt documents were not prepared by or for the expert,and even if they were,menzies did not read them.civ.c.under these circumstances,the hospital claims,the rule that protects the privilege against inadvertent disclosure prevails.
for purposes of this appeal,palmer does not dispute the privileged nature of the documents,nor does she challenge the hospital assertion that it complied with the procedures that rule d requires for the return of inadvertently produced documents.rather,palmer contends rule d provision does not apply to information that rule makes discoverable once it is provided to a testifying expert.palmer further challenges the hospital statement that menzies did not read the inadvertently transmitted documents,arguing a fact issue exists regarding the extent of her review.in any event,palmer contends,whether or not menzies actually relied upon the documents in forming her opinion is not dispositive,because implicit in rule disclosure requirement is the notion that documents an expert chooses to regard and those she chooses to disregard in forming an opinion are both relevant and necessary for effective.
we begin by examining the discovery rules in dispute,applying the same rules of construction that govern the interpretation of statutes.see basf fina petrochemicals zachry,dist,pet.denied see also in re emeritus,antonio,orig.proceeding holding that a rule of procedure is subject to the same rules of construction as statutes.when a rule of procedure is clear and unambiguous,we construe the rule language according to its plain or literal meaning.see.dep t of transp.needham.
discovery from testifying experts 
texas rule of civil procedure e,which defines the scope of permissible discovery from experts,provides in pertinent part as follows 
a party may discover the following information regarding a testifying expert 
the facts known by the expert that relate to or form the basis of the expert mental impressions and opinions formed or made in connection with the case in which the discovery is sought,regardless of when and how the factual information was acquired 
the expert mental impressions and opinions formed or made in connection with the case in which discovery is sought,and any methods used to derive them 
any bias of the witness 
all documents,tangible things,reports,models,or data compilations that have been provided to,reviewed by,or prepared by or for the expert in anticipation of a testifying expert testimony 
civ.e emphasis added.we must first decide whether this rule applies to the northcutt documents if it does not,the documents retain their privileged nature and may be recovered pursuant to rule d feature.
rule e was promulgated in to replace former rule,which permitted discovery of only those documents prepared by an expert or for an expert in anticipation of the expert trial and deposition testimony.civ.e repealed.under this former rule,privileged work product lost its protected status if the material provided to the expert was,in fact,relied upon by the expert as the basis for his or her testimony.see schattman,worth,orig.proceeding noting that privilege is waived when an expert relies on a privileged document as the basis for the expert opinion aetna cas.sur.blackmon,christi,orig.proceeding holding that an expert witness possession of documents did not automatically waive and privileges.thus,under the rule,if an expert did not rely on a privileged document,it was not discoverable.
to avoid the discovery disputes that frequently arose over what material an expert may or may not have relied upon,the rule was amended in to include more expansive language.in addition to documents prepared by or for the expert,the rule now mandates discovery of documents that have been provided to,or reviewed by a testifying expert.civ.e.the hospital argument that the northcutt documents were prepared by or for the hospital rather than by or for the expert,and that menzies did not read them in any event,erroneously ignores the rule disjunctive language.whether or not the documents were actually read by or prepared for menzies,they were clearly provided to the hospital testifying expert and thus fall within rule e plain language.
it is true,as the hospital claims and palmer does not dispute,that the northcutt documents constitute work product under rule,and that work product is carefully protected from discovery under our rules.civ.a.however,rule c specifically states that work product loses its protected status when it is provided to a testifying expert 
c even if made or prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial,the following is not work product protected from discovery 
information discoverable under rule concerning experts 
civ.c.because the northcutt documents were provided to the hospital testifying expert,the privilege does not protect them unless the provision requires their return.
c.the provision 
the provision was designed to protect the inadvertent disclosure of privileged material in order to reduce the cost and risk involved in document production.civ.cmt.the provision states that 
a party who produces material or information without intending to waive a claim of privilege does not waive that claim under these rules or the rules of evidence ten days or a shorter time ordered by the court,after the producing party actually discovers that such production was producing party amends the response,identifying the material or information produced and stating the privilege asserted.
civ.d.the rule is focused on the intent to waive the privilege,not the intent to produce the material or information.id.at cmt.
the provision has typically been applied when a party inadvertently produces privileged documents to an opposing party.see warrantech computer adapters,worth,no pet.holding that inadvertent production of privileged letter to opposing counsel did not waive the privilege under rule d see also in re parnham.lexis,wl,dist,orig.proceeding applying rule when privileged documents were inadvertently provided to opposing counsel during discovery in re aep.cent,antonio,orig.proceeding holding that privileged legal memorandum inadvertently produced to the opposing side must be returned under the provision.in this case,however,the privileged material was produced by a party to its own testifying expert,invoking rule e overlapping directive that all materials provided to a testifying expert must be produced.
the tension between the provision that protects privileged documents and the requirement presents an issue of first impression for our court.in resolving this tension,we consider the respective interests the rules were designed to protect.
competing interests 
as we have said,the provision was designed to ensure that important privileges are not waived by mere inadvertence or mistake.under the rule,a party who is less than diligent in screening documents before their production does not waive any privilege that might attach to them,presuming the party complies with rule d procedures.civ.d cmt.by permitting the recovery of documents inadvertently produced to the opposing side,the rule preserves the important interests that the doctrine was designed to protect,while at the same time visiting no harm upon the recipient for having to return documents it was not entitled to in the first place.under rule d,the production of documents without the intent to waive a claim of privilege does not waive the claim.
the concepts of waiver and the intent required to effect it,however,do not appear in our disclosure rule.see civ.c.rule,which governs work product,speaks not in terms of waiver but rather states that documents and tangible things provided to a testifying expert under rule,even if made or prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial is not work product protected from discovery.id.emphasis added.thus,it appears from the rule plain language that documents and tangible things provided to a testifying expert lose their designation irrespective of the intent that accompanied their production this makes sense in light of the important interests the requirement was designed to serve.
the expert witness occupies a unique place in our adversarial system of justice.see du pont de nemours robinson.considered to have knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,evid,that will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,the expert is generally held out to be,and is seen by the jury as,an objective authority figure more knowledgeable and credible than the typical lay witness.see robinson,at.for this reason,juries are prone to rely on experts to tell them how to decide complex issues without independently analyzing underlying factors.see id.as the supreme court has noted,e xpert evidence can be both powerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in evaluating it.daubert merrell dow,d quoting jack weinstein,rule of the federal rules of evidence is sound it should not be amended.
coupled with the expert vast potential for influence is the fact that experts are generally unfettered by requirements that constrain the ordinary witness.while lay witnesses may only testify regarding matters of which they have personal knowledge,evid,expert witnesses may testify about facts or data not personally perceived but reviewed by,or made known to them.evid.if the facts or data are of a type upon which experts in the field reasonably rely in forming opinions on the subject,the facts or data need not even be admissible in evidence.id.thus,in many instances,experts may rely on inadmissible hearsay,privileged communications,and other information that the ordinary witness may not.see id.moreover,an expert may state an opinion on mixed questions of law and fact,such as whether certain conduct was negligent or proximately caused injury,that would be off limits to the ordinary witness.evid.birchfield texarkana mem l.
armed with these advantages,the expert witness paints a powerful image on the litigation canvas.and it is typically the hiring attorney who selects the materials that will provide color and hue.just as a purveyor of fine art must examine the medium used in order to distinguish masterpiece from fake,a jury must understand the pallet from which the expert paints to accurately assess the testimony worth.given the importance that expert testimony can assume,the jury should be aware of documents and tangible things provided to the expert that might have influenced the expert opinion.in terms of determining what effect documents provided to an expert had in shaping the expert mental impressions and opinions,the attorney intent in producing the documents is irrelevant.
in light of these important policy concerns that underlie the rule,we conclude that rules e and c prevail over rule d provision so long as the expert intends to testify at trial despite the inadvertent document production.that is,once privileged documents are disclosed to a testifying expert,and the party who designated the expert continues to rely upon that designation for trial,the documents may not be retrieved even if they were inadvertently produced.of course,inadvertently produced material that could not by its nature have influenced the expert opinion does not evoke the concerns the rule was designed to prevent and the policy concerns underlying the rule disclosure requirement would presumably never arise.in that event,there would be nothing to prevent the rule application,although we note that a party seeking under such circumstances would bear a heavy burden
