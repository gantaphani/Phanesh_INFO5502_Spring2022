plaintiff doug williams appeals from the judgment entered after his legal malpractice complaint against larry russ and russ law firm was dismissed as a discovery sanction because williams allowed the destruction of most of his client files after obtaining them from russ.we affirm.
facts and procedural history 
doug williams was the administrator and trustee of an employee benefits and retirement plan known as epa.williams and epa initiated what evolved into a series of lawsuits and in federal court the epa actions that were eventually settled but which led to williams removal as the head of epa in.in,williams sued his former lawyer,bruce ashton,for legal malpractice,contending that ashton poor advice led to his removal as epa trustee.ashton was later granted summary judgment because the statute of limitations had run on williams causes of action.in may,williams sued larry russ and the law firm of russ,august kabat for legal malpractice based solely on their representation of williams in connection with the epa and ashton malpractice actions 
in february,williams demanded that russ turn over the entire williams client file.that demand was not made through any formal discovery process,however.instead,the documents were requested pursuant to the state bar rule requiring lawyers to turn over client files upon demand.rules conduct,rule d.in march,russ turned over to williams lawyer file boxes that russ said contained the entire file from his representation of williams.before doing so,russ lawyer,charles slyngstad,copied any correspondence between russ and williams,but did not copy any other portions of the file.williams put the file boxes in a storage space he rented for just that purpose.
williams lawyer,martin stanley,reviewed the contents of the file and copied about boxes worth that he deemed relevant to the action.in april,he wrote slyngstad and reported that based on his review,he would amend the complaint to include a breach of fiduciary duty claim because russ had allegedly concealed from williams that the epa settlement included a release of russ from malpractice liability as to williams.in june,williams filed a first amended complaint that added such a cause of action.
between march and december,williams fell behind on his rental payments to the storage facility where he kept his client file.the facility operators repeatedly notified williams that his default could lead to the sale of the items he was storing.williams made partial payments and promised to bring his account current,but never did so.on december,the boxes containing his client file were destroyed when no one made a bid to purchase them.williams did not tell russ the files had been destroyed.
in april,russ was granted summary judgment.we reversed that judgment in april,and remanded the case to the trial court because triable issues of fact existed concerning whether russ caused williams removal as epa trustee and whether williams suffered emotional distress damages from russ alleged breach of fiduciary duty.williams russ april,wl nonpub.opn.
in october,williams filed a second amended complaint that expanded the malpractice cause of action to include faulty transactional advice in connection with the operation of epa,including various fiduciary matters,compliance with federal laws governing retirement plans,insurance issues,and transactional and litigation matters.the breach of fiduciary duty claim was also expanded to include an allegation that russ,in conflict with williams best interests,had also signed an agreement tolling the limitations period for potential malpractice claims against him.in december,russ made a discovery request that included the boxes of documents he turned over to williams in march.williams objected that he had no obligation to produce the documents because they had once been in russ possession.on january,stanley told slyngstad that except for the boxes of documents he had copied,the client file had been destroyed.
russ moved to dismiss the action as a discovery sanction for williams conduct in allowing a large portion of the client file to be destroyed,thereby precluding russ from reconstructing the file and obtaining documents relevant to his defense.the motion was supported by a declaration from russ that his entire client file,which included correspondence,notes,research,pleadings,and other materials,had been turned over to williams in march.slyngstad submitted a declaration stating that the boxes turned over to williams at his rented storage facility constituted russ entire client file.before delivering the documents,slyngstad said he reviewed them and saw that they contained all of russ correspondence,notes,pleadings,and other materials relating to russ representation of williams from the early until russ representation ended.according to slyngstad,he copied only the correspondence that had been sent to or received by russ and assumed williams would preserve the boxes as evidence.
slyngstad declaration pointed out that the first and second amended complaints were filed after the client files were produced,with the second amended complaint coming after they were destroyed.documents relevant to the new allegations and claims of those two amended pleadings had been in the client files when they were turned over to williams,slyngstad said.according to him,these included documents relating to epa receipt of certain controversial insurance commissions,along with the legal advice williams and epa received on those commissions from lawyers who preceded russ documents relating to formal and informal complaints by employers and individual participants in epa retirement plans all the communications with the special master in the epa actions documents relating to those actions documents that were covered by the privilege or that constituted attorney work product and documents relating to the disputed tolling agreement alleged in the second amended complaint.if the original stipulation of settlement that williams complained of had ever existed,slyngstad said it too would have been in one of the boxes.according to slyngstad,it was no longer possible to determine what was kept or what had been destroyed.
finally,slyngstad declaration recounted williams evasive responses to various discovery requests that either directly or by necessary implication covered all or part of the contents of the client file,culminating in stanley reluctant admission in january that the file had been destroyed,except for the portion that stanley retained.
the motion also included the deposition testimony of the managers of the storage facility where williams kept the documents,along with records from that facility documenting williams history of late and partial payments and the numerous written and telephonic notices that warned him the contents of his storage facility would be sold if he did not pay his past due rent.
in opposition to the motion,williams submitted a declaration stating that he missed a few rental payments to the storage facility because he was in financial trouble and because he was recovering from back surgery in the months before the files were destroyed.according to williams,a tall,thin paralegal working for russ told him that russ had copied the file and he therefore believed russ had a copy of the entire file.no one at the storage facility told him the documents might be destroyed.had he known,he would have immediately paid his past due bill.he also declared that he had previously seen his entire file at russ office and that the boxes russ delivered to him did not appear the same as what he had seen before.williams lawyer,stanley,declared that the person who replaced williams as epa administrator secured boxes of epa plan files from russ,as per court orders in the epa actions.stanley said that the boxes russ delivered to williams were mostly pleadings and that he pulled out any documents relevant to this action.
based on this,williams argued that he had at most been negligent in letting the files be destroyed and that russ was equally at fault for not having copied the files.he also argued that russ bore the burden of showing prejudice from the lost files,that comparable evidence could be found elsewhere,and that,at most,lesser sanctions than dismissal were warranted,particularly jury instructions that an adverse inference to williams could be drawn from the loss of the files in his reply,russ had a declaration from slyngstad stating that the documents turned over to the new epa administrator were mostly epa operational business documents.
because the trial court could not determine what files had been destroyed or their effect on the first and second amended complaints,and because the issues were complex and time consuming,the court appointed a retired judge as discovery referee to resolve those issues.the referee found that williams had been negligent in allowing the files to be lost and recommended that the jury be instructed that it could,if it wished,draw an inference adverse to williams about the contents of the missing files.
russ objected to the referee report on three grounds the jury instruction permitting an adverse inference was an insufficient remedy and the referee recommendation was based on insufficient evidence because he did not review the remaining portions of the file retained by williams the referee finding that russ was provided other documentary evidence before the files were destroyed was not supported by the evidence and the finding of negligent spoliation by williams was wrong because the evidence showed it was intentional.
after permitting supplemental briefing by the parties,followed by lengthy oral argument,the trial court sustained all of russ objections to the referee findings and recommendations.the court did not blame the referee,whom it held in high esteem,but believed the trial court underlying reference order had not been sufficiently specific.because the trial court was far more familiar with the case,including its review of voluminous documents,the trial court found that it was more knowledgeable than the referee and was therefore in a better position to resolve the issue.
in a detailed minute order,the court made several findings that led it to conclude that a terminating sanction was proper williams was knowledgeable about litigation,particularly about the facts of this case,was very involved in and integral to this litigation,and had inventoried the contents of his client file more than once he demanded the file under the rules of professional conduct and was on notice that nonpayment of his storage rental fee would result in destruction of the file and after filing this action and demanding the file,he caused it to be destroyed by allowing the destruction to happen,then concealed the fact for two years.based on that,the court found that the destruction of the files was intentional and inferred that this was done to destroy evidence potentially favorable to russ.
the court found this spoliation was highly prejudicial to russ defense of the case.it is stunning to this court that williams would file a malpractice case,use the professional rules and demand his entire client file and then have it destroyed.it is not enough that williams counsel took what he thought was important and that russ copied some of the client file.the client file is a collection of documents.destruction of part of it destroys the integrity of the entire file.how do we know what was destroyed how do you prove a negative could there be a note or something written on something in the file that would be exculpatory we will never know its true value due to the conduct of the williams.although aware that sanctions should ordinarily be progressive and that lesser sanctions should be considered before dismissal,the court found dismissal was warranted.this was based on the findings made above,and findings that williams had a duty to maintain the client file and had the burden of proving no prejudice occurred,and that intentional spoliation raised an inference of extreme prejudice.based on the unique facts of this case,and after weighing williams culpability against the harm to russ,the court concluded dismissal was the appropriate sanction because lesser sanctions would not cure the harm done.the court then ordered the case dismissed.
on appeal,williams contends the court erred because he was merely negligent,he believed russ had copied the files,russ copied more than just the correspondence,and there was no evidence that significant portions of the file could not be retrieved from russ computer files or other sources and the court erred by placing the burden to disprove prejudice on williams.
discussion 
dismissal of the action was not an abuse of discretion 
spoliation of evidence means the destruction or significant alteration of evidence or the failure to preserve evidence for another use in pending or future litigation.willard caterpillar,th,d,overruled on other grounds in medical center superior court cal th,fn,d.such conduct is condemned because it can destroy fairness and justice,for it increases the risk of an erroneous decision on the merits of the underlying cause of action.destroying evidence can also increase the costs of litigation as parties attempt to reconstruct the destroyed evidence or to develop other evidence,which may be less accessible,less persuasive,or both,supra,at,d.while there is no tort cause of action for the intentional destruction of evidence after litigation has commenced,it is a misuse of the discovery process that is subject to a broad range of punishment,including monetary,issue,evidentiary,and terminating sanctions.code civ,subd.d,subds.a d,at,d.a terminating sanction is appropriate in the first instance without a violation of prior court orders in egregious cases of intentional spoliation of evidence.creative,creative cotton,th,d.
discovery sanctions are intended to remedy discovery abuse,not to punish the offending party.accordingly,sanctions should be tailored to serve that remedial purpose,should not put the moving party in a better position than he would otherwise have been had he obtained the requested discovery,and should be proportionate to the offending party misconduct.mcginty superior court th,d.
williams contends the trial court ruling violated these principles.this contention rests on a evidentiary challenge to the court finding that he intentionally destroyed the file.according to williams,the evidence shows he was merely negligent because he had been told russ had copied the entire file russ copied more of the file than he claimed significant portions of the file could be found elsewhere and he did no more than make late payments to the storage facility.as a result,williams contends lesser sanctions were warranted,such as instructing the jury it could draw an adverse inference from the loss of the file.see,supra,cal th at,d.
in support of his appellate contentions,williams relies on the facts most favorable to him and the referee finding that he acted negligently,not intentionally.this is contrary to the applicable standard of review,however.we review the trial court order under the abuse of discretion standard and resolve all evidentiary conflicts most favorably to the trial court ruling.we will reverse only if the trial court order was arbitrary,capricious,or whimsical.it is appellant burden to affirmatively demonstrate error and where the evidence is in conflict,we will affirm the trial court findings.sinaiko healthcare consulting,pacific healthcare consultants th,d.we presume the trial court order was correct and indulge all presumptions and intendments in its favor on matters as to which it is silent.karlsson ford motor th,d.
when the conflicting evidence is viewed through this standard,it is more than sufficient to affirm the trial court findings.within weeks of obtaining the file from russ,williams lawyer warned slyngstad that he found evidence in the file to support new claims and soon after amended the complaint accordingly.during the next few months,williams fell into a pattern of either late or partial payments on the rental space where he chose to store the file.despite numerous and repeated warnings from the storage facility that the contents of his storage space would be sold,williams did nothing to prevent their sale
