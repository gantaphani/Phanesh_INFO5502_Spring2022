in this case,we conclude that simultaneous means occurring at the same time.we recognize the folks at merriam webster reached that same conclusion some time ago,but in light of what occurred in this case,it apparently bears repeating.
vender fairfax appeals from an adverse judgment in his lawsuit for medical malpractice against deric lords.he argues the court erred in allowing lords to unilaterally delay his designation of retained expert witnesses pursuant to code of civil procedure section section until days after fairfax had designated his own.he also contends the court erred in allowing lords to designate,as one of his belated experts,a doctor who had previously consulted with fairfax about the same injury at issue here,in connection with a prior case.
we agree with the first contention,and because we conclude that lords belated designation of retained experts shouldbe stricken,we need not reach the second.section requires a simultaneous exchange of information,in which each side must either identify any expert witnesses it expects to call at trial,or state that it does not intend to rely upon expert testimony.when it comes to issues that both sides anticipate will be disputed at trial,a party can not merely reserve its right to designate experts in the initial exchange,wait to see what experts are designated by the opposition,and then name its experts only as purported rebuttal witnesses.whether such a strategy is somehow beneficial to defendants,as lords claims,is simply irrelevant.the trial court erred by acquiescing in it.
moreover,we conclude the error was prejudicial.this was a case in which liability turned almost exclusively on the issue of whether lords treatment of fairfax fell below the standard of care.the court erroneous decision to allow lords belated designation of retained experts,rather than require him to rely upon testimony from one of the numerous treating professionals identified on his initial designation,likely had an impact on the outcome of the trial.consequently,the case must be remanded for a new trial,during which lords shall be restricted to relying upon the expert testimony of those treating professionals.
fairfax originally injured his right ankle in an accident in.he obtained treatment for the injury from david smalley,and in november of,smalley performed an ankle fusion.after the fusion,the ankle continued to be painful,and fairfax sought further treatment,this time from lords.
in november of,lords performed surgery just below fairfax ankle,including placement of screws across the subtalar joint.fairfax continued to experience problems with the ankle,and in june of,lords performed a second surgery to remove some,but not all of the screws.
thereafter,fairfax commenced a lawsuit against smalley in riverside superior court,alleging smalley had fused the ankle bones at an inappropriate angle in february of,fairfax sought the services of kendall wagner,to do two things.first,he was to act as an expert witness and consultant regarding the care provided by smalley and second he was to consult with fairfax counsel in connection with his investigation of the care provided by lords.fairfax counsel then delivered to wagner the medical records from both smalley and lords,concerning the treatment of fairfax ankle.counsel later had at least one conversation with wagner regarding wagner opinions about the treatment rendered by both smalley and lords.however,the lawsuit against smalley was dismissed on summary judgment without wagner offering any testimony.
in may of,fairfax filed the instant lawsuit alleging medical malpractice against lords.as the case approached its scheduled trial date in june of,lords served a demand for exchange of expert witness information in compliance with section.
on april,fairfax served his expert witness designation,naming carol frey,as a retained expert,and reserving his right to additionally call as witnesses all physicians and health care providers who had treated fairfax.
on that same date,lords served a document he called his first designation of expert witnesses.despite that caption,however,lords document identified no retained witnesses,stating instead that he hereby gives notice that he is not designating any retained experts for the first exchange of expert witness information.he went on to state,however,that he expressly reserves the right to designate experts in rebuttal to fairfax designations.lords did specifically list treating physicians and other healthcare professionals who had examined or rendered treatment to fairfax,but did not state that he expected any of them to testify.instead,he merely stated that he also reserve d the right to call them as expert witnesses.
after receipt of fairfax designation,lords counsel made arrangements to retain an expert witness to counter the expected testimony of frey.he retained richard viehe,a podiatrist.then,on either may or,he contacted wagner during his initial conversation with lords counsel,wagner informed him that he believed he had previously been contacted by fairfax counsel in connection with prior litigation with smalley,but was willing to serve as an expert for lords.
lords counsel acknowledges he immediately recognized the potential conflict and contacted fairfax counsel.he claims that in order to ensure strict compliance with all ethical obligations,he ceased all contact with wagner pending resolution of the conflict issue.he explains that it was only after speaking with fairfax counsel,and satisfying himself that no confidences or work product had been disclosed to wagner,that he designated wagner as an expert witness.however,the only evidence of the initial conversation between counsel comes from fairfax attorney,who declared that he had merely confirmed the prior consultation with wagner,while refusing to disclose its content.
in any event,on may,the very same day lords counsel had initially contacted wagner,or the first business day thereafter,lords went ahead and designated him as an expert witness.the designation,which lords characterized as his second designation of expert witnesses,named both wagner and viehe as retained experts.in the document,lords also asserted that s ince plaintiff has the burden of proof as to all issues,defendant reserves the right to provide a supplemental designation of experts regarding all issues for which plaintiff designates an expert.
almost immediately,fairfax protested the designation,and several letters were exchanged between counsel.fairfax also moved,ex parte,for an order striking lords second designation.the court denied the ex parte motion without prejudice,and advised fairfax that the issue of disqualification could be raised by a motion in limine.
on june,fairfax filed his motion in limine to strike lords second designation of experts,arguing both that the designation of the retained experts was untimely,and that wagner,having previously consulted with fairfax counsel about the adequacy of the care he had received from both smalley and lords,was precluded from testifying on behalf of lords.with respect to the latter issue,fairfax counsel submitted declarations indicating that during the pendency of the prior case against smalley,he had a conversation with wagner in which we discussed his opinions regarding the care and treatment plaintiff received from both smalley and lords.
in his opposition to the motion to strike,lords defended his failure to designate any retained experts in his first designation,claiming that he had fully participated in the exchange by listing the numerous treating physicians and other healthcare professionals whom he reserved the right to call,while waiting to select and designate retained experts only after receiving fairfax own designation.he further argued that his designation of wagner as an expert was not only proper,but necessary,as he is the only other orthopedic surgeon of sufficient renown and fairness to counter fairfax expert,carol frey,who has a well established bias adverse to podiatrists in this community lords offered no evidence in his opposition to contradict the description given by fairfax counsel concerning his prior communication
