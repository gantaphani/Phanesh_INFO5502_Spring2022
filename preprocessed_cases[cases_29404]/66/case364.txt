six days after birth,plaintiff aidan leung suffered irreversible brain damage caused by kernicterus,a condition that results when an infant level of bilirubin a waste product of red blood cells which causes jaundice becomes toxic.through his guardian ad litem his mother,nancy leung,aidan sued his pediatrician,steven wayne nishibayashi,and his professional corporation,steven wayne nishibayashi,alleging that nishibayashi was negligent in his care and treatment.aidan also sued the hospital at which he was born,verdugo hills hospital the hospital,alleging that the hospital was negligent for,inter alia,failing to provide his parents with adequate education on neonatal jaundice and kernicterus,and failing to implement policies to reduce the risk of kernicterus in newborns.
aidan reached a settlement with nishibayashi and his corporation,under which nishibayashi agreed to pay the limits of his malpractice insurance,million,and to participate at a trial in which the jury would allocate the negligence,if any,of the hospital and nishibayashi and set the amount of damages.in exchange,aidan would give nishibayashi and his corporation a release of liability.the trial court ruled that the settlement did not meet the standard of good faith under code of civil procedure sections and,because it was grossly disproportionate to nishibayashi potential share of liability and to the total expected recovery.nonetheless,aidan and nishibayashi chose to proceed with the settlement.
the case was tried to a jury,which found both the hospital and nishibayashi negligent,and awarded damages of for past medical costs,for noneconomic damages,for future medical care with a present value of million and million for loss of future earnings with a present value of.apportioning fault,the jury found the hospital percent negligent,nishibayashi percent negligent,and plaintiff parents,nancy and kevin leung,each percent negligent.
ultimately,the court approved a minor compromise regarding aidan settlement with nishibayashi,and incorporated the verdict into a periodic payments judgment under code of civil procedure section,which declared the hospital jointly and severally liable for percent of all economic damages found by the jury and severally liable for its percent share of noneconomic damages the hospital appeals from the judgment.
in the published portion of our opinion,we address the hospital contention that common law,rather than code of civil procedure sections and,governs the effect of aidan settlement with and release of nishibayashi.under the common law release rule,a release for consideration of one joint tortfeasor operates as a release of the joint and several liability of the other joint tortfeasors.see,bee cooper cal,bee tompkins clay street cal,tompkins.according to the hospital,aidan release of nishibayashi in consideration of his million settlement payment released the hospital from its joint and several liability for aidan economic damages,though not for its proportionate share of aidan noneconomic damages such liability being several only and not joint,subd.a.
as we explain,although the california supreme court has criticized the common law release rule as applied to concurrent tortfeasors,the court has not abandoned it.stare decisis compels us to follow the rule.we therefore reverse that portion of the judgment imposing joint and several liability on the hospital for aidan economic damages.however,we urge the california supreme court to grant review,conclusively abandon the release rule,and fashion a new common law rule concerning the effect of a faith settlement on a tortfeasor liability.
because this holding does not affect the hospital several liability for aidan noneconomic damages,we address,in the unpublished portion of our opinion,two other contentions attacking the judgment.in response to those contentions,we conclude that substantial evidence supports the jury finding that the hospital negligence was a substantial factor in causing aidan brain damage,and that comments by the trial court neither improperly instructed the jury on causation nor influenced two jurors to change their votes on that issue.we therefore affirm that portion of the judgment that requires the hospital to pay its proportionate share of aidan noneconomic damages 
background 
plaintiff evidence 
jaundice,bilirubin,hyperbilirubinemia,and kernicterus 
in infants,jaundice manifests as a yellowish tint first to the skin and later to the whites of the eyes.it is caused by the buildup of bilirubin in the blood,a yellow waste product produced by the breakdown of red blood cells.all infants have rising levels of bilirubin for the first three to five days.the peak is close to the fifth day,unless there are conditions exacerbating the jaundice.absent such conditions,the level then reduces within a week or so as the infant liver develops and bilirubin is expelled,primarily in the stool a yellowish stool indicates expulsion of bilirubin.ensuring adequate milk intake so as to create sufficient stool to expel bilirubin is the primary way of preventing the infant bilirubin level from continuing to rise.
if not expelled,bilirubin can reach dangerous levels,called hyperbilirubinemia,and migrate to the brain where it can cause kernicterus,leading to severe brain damage.however,hyperbilirubinemia can easily be treated by phototherapy using lights called bililights to expose the infant to the blue light spectrum or,in extreme cases,an exchange transfusion a blood transfusion that totally replaces the infant blood.the first signs that hyperbilirubinemia has led to is,the first signs that the level of bilirubin is lethargy and a refusal to feed.
some infants have a higher risk of kernicterus than others.the clinical risk factors are,and include that the infant is male,of east asian descent,born at less than weeks gestation,exclusively breast fed and displays bruising,jaundice within the first hours,and weight loss.according to vinod bhutani,a neonatologist specializing in kernicterus who testified as an expert witness for aidan,the occurrence of kernicterus is rare.however,there has been a resurgence of the condition,because infants are commonly discharged earlier than hours after birth,and there is insufficient to assess the level of bilirubin and to give adequate support for breast feeding to ensure the infant is getting enough milk.
events leading to aidan brain damage 
aidan birth and hospital stay 
aidan was born at the hospital on a monday march,at his due date,as calculated based on an ultra sound of the fetus conducted by his mother obstetrician early in pregnancy,was april.he was born early,at weeks,days gestation.
aidan mother,nancy leung,decided to breast feed exclusively.the day of the birth,she tried to feed aidan every two hours,five or six times,but he showed little interest,and she could not tell if he was actually feeding.he seemed to latch on and then come off.nancy testified that she told two of the attending nurses,susan mcbroom and margaret mcclammy,that she was not sure she was doing it right.at least three times she said that she was concerned aidan was not getting enough milk.they would watch,kind of guide her a little bit,and say that he seems like he getting the hang of it.just keep trying.only one nurse,mcbroom,instructed her as she brought aidan to the breast,helped her position him,and observed that he seemed to latch on.the instruction lasted to minutes.two entries on aidan chart the last at on march reflected poor breast feeding.there were no other entries on the subject.
the next day,tuesday march,around,nishibayashi,aidan pediatrician,examined aidan.he told nancy and her husband,kevin,that aidan was healthy.he mentioned two bruises on the side of aidan head cephalohematomas,and said that such bruises were common at birth and nothing to worry about.when he asked if nancy intended to breast feed,she told him that she was going to give it a try.she asked if it was safe to take aidan home,and nishibayashi said that it was.he told the leungs to make a appointment for the next week.he gave no further instructions,and mentioned nothing about aidan having any risk factors for jaundice or kernicterus.
aidan discharge 
aidan was discharged at that tuesday,approximately hours after birth.the hospital provided the leungs with a manual,caring for yourself and your new baby the manual,and the nurses told the leungs to refer to it if there were any problems.no one at the hospital mentioned risk factors for jaundice or kernicterus.
when the leungs arrived at home with aidan,nancy made an appointment with nishibayashi for the following monday march.at home,she breast fed aidan and changed his diapers eight to ten times a day every two to three hours.aidan pattern of soiling diapers was consistent with what nancy had been taught in prenatal class at the hospital,and at some point she observed that aidan stool had a golden,curdy appearance.
aidan jaundice 
around noon on thursday march,nancy and kevin noticed that aidan eyes appeared yellow indicative of jaundice and his lips were chapped.they examined the section of the manual on jaundice,which suggested in their minds that the condition was common and posed no danger to aidan.the manual described jaundice in part as a common condition in newborn infants and stated that i n most instances,the jaundice is so mild that it can be ignored and usually will disappear without treatment.the manual mentioned that w hen the bilirubin level becomes too high,jaundice can be dangerous to your baby developing nervous system.however,it described this dangerous condition as occurring very rarely.in terms of the risk of it developing,the manual stated only that t he level at which jaundice may be dangerous depends on many factors your baby age,whether he was or premature,and whether he has any other medical conditions.it also stated that bruises to the baby head and face after birth will heal in a few days and are not dangerous to your baby.it contained no other information suggesting that aidan belonged to a class of infants at high risk of jaundice reaching dangerous levels,and suggested that if parents had questions about their baby jaundice,they should call the baby physician 
the thursday telephone call to nishibayashi office 
nancy called nishibayashi office.she testified that nishibayashi nurse answered and said that the doctor was with other patients.nancy said that aidan appeared yellow.the nurse told her not to worry,and said she would check with the doctor.the nurse returned and asked if aidan was feeding,peeing,and pooping.nancy said yes.the nurse said that it sounded as if aidan was doing all right,and suggested placing him in sunlight to treat the jaundice.nancy mentioned aidan chapped lips.the nurse said that it was probably sucking blisters from breast feeding,and suggested nancy apply lotion.nancy asked if she should wait until the scheduled appointment or bring him in now.the nurse advised to wait until the scheduled appointment.
the testimony of the nurse,julie donnelly,presented a different version.donnelly identified a phone message she wrote memorializing the conversation,which stated that aidan was slightly yellow but nursing well,and had good yellow stools and was voiding well.the phone message also indicated that nishibayashi told her to instruct nancy leung to watch for increased sleepiness,decreased appetite or jaundice.donnelly testified that nancy leung did not ask if she should bring aidan in immediately.if a parent called nishibayashi office,expressed concern about an infant condition,and asked to have the baby seen at the office,the practice of nishibayashi office was absolutely to see the infant,and more than likely the infant would be seen.also,when an infant is brought to the office,the baby is weighed to determine whether weight has been lost or gained.
nancy,however,denied that she told the nurse that aidan was feeding,peeing,or pooping well.she also denied that donnelly told her to watch for increased sleepiness or decreased appetite.
nishibayashi,who had been on the hospital medical staff with privileges to admit patients for years,testified that he was aware of the risk factors for jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia in newborns,some of which applied to aidan despite those risk factors,nishibayashi was not concerned about discharging aidan within hours of birth.aidan symptoms as described by donnelly indicated to nishibayashi that aidan jaundiced condition was mild.without any indication of dehydration,inadequate feeding or voiding,or a change in alertness,nishibayashi found no need for aidan to be brought to the office.rather,the scheduled appointment for the following monday was appropriate.
having read the section of the manual on jaundice which suggested that aidan condition was common and not dangerous and having received similar information from nishibayashi through his nurse,the leungs had no concern that aidan was in any danger and no concern that he should be examined immediately.they assumed that his jaundice would subside.
aidan kernicterus 
over the next two days,friday and saturday,nancy continued to try to breast feed aidan every two hours.the extent of his feeding varied.he soiled diapers,but she did not know whether the level of stool was normal.she and kevin placed him in the sun as recommended,and relied on advice contained in the manual,but there was no change in his jaundice.
by saturday evening,nancy and kevin noticed that aidan appeared lethargic.by early sunday,he was very sleepy and would not wake for feedings.nancy called nishibayashi office,and left a message with his answering service.an physician who was covering for nishibayashi called back.nancy described aidan symptoms,and the physician told her to take aidan to the emergency room at huntington memorial hospital immediately.
they arrived at huntington memorial around aidan was given an exchange transfusion to reduce the level of bilirubin,but it was ineffective.he had already suffered severe brain damage from kernicterus.further,his chapped lips were caused by dehydration,and he had lost two pounds since discharge.
child neurologist steven shapiro examined aidan in april.he described aidan condition as a type of cerebral palsy.aidan is likely to live a normal lifespan,but he can not move or talk.the portion of his brain that governs thinking was not affected,and he is thus likely to be of normal intelligence.he will need intensive care,medication,and physical and speech therapy for the rest of his life.although shapiro could not pinpoint a time at which aidan suffered brain damage,the toxicity probably began when the leungs noticed symptoms of and refusing to late saturday or early sunday.
c.the hospital negligence 
failure to implement sentinel event alert 
the hospital is accredited by the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations jcaho jcaho issues sentinel event alerts to member hospitals that convey information about major healthcare issues.
as explained by arthur shorr,an expert in hospital administration,hospitals do not practice medicine.rather,they provide the environment for physicians to practice medicine.in providing that environment,hospital procedures and the conduct of the hospital staff must meet certain community standards of care.according to shorr,jcaho standards are commonly recognized as the minimum accepted community standards for both member and hospitals.in shorr opinion,a sentinel event alert,although not a formal jcaho standard,carries equivalent weight,and a hospital is obligated to create its own policies and procedures to deal with the health care issue discussed in the alert.
in april,jcaho issued sentinel event alert alert regarding kernicterus it warned of the reemergence of kernicterus,and advised that i n order to identify these rare newborns at risk of kernicterus,certain organization systems and processes should be in place.the alert identified risk factors,and listed root causes such as the failure to recognize jaundice and measure bilirubin levels in infants,to provide a continuum of care,to provide appropriate information to parents and respond to their concerns,and to aggressively treat rising bilirubin levels.it also provided risk reduction strategies for hospitals to consider,including p olicies for assessing the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia in all infants by history,clinical evaluation and,if necessary,by laboratory measurement,and p rocedures for of all newborns within to hours by a physician or pediatric nurse,or,if this can not be achieved,decisions regarding timing of discharge or other must be based on risk assessment.the alert recommend ed that organizations take steps to raise awareness among neonatal caregivers of the potential for kernicterus and its risk factors review their current patient care processes with regard to the identification and management of hyperbilirubinemia in newborns and identify strategies from the above list of available risk reduction strategies that could enhance the effectiveness of these processes.
in shorr opinion,the issuance of alert required the hospital to take appropriate steps to ensure procedures were in place to reduce the risk of kernicterus in newborns.however,the hospital never responded by implementing any recommendations,a fact confirmed by david greer,the hospital director of quality management,and margaret mccormick,the hospital director of perinatal services.greer sent a copy of alert to relevant department heads,including mccormick,but did nothing else to or to implement any of the recommendations.according to greer,the hospital had no policy for assessing the risk of hyperbilirubinemia or kernicterus.mccormick,who supervised the nurses who provided newborn care and were responsible for identifying newborns at risk for hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus,testified that although her practice was to review sentinel event alerts and assess whether to recommend changes in nursing practices,she had no recollection of receiving alert or of any change of policy 
in shorr opinion,the hospital failure to implement any recommendations in alert to reduce the risk of a newborn developing kernicterus violated the hospital duty of care.implementation of the alert would have created the circumstances under which the nursing staff and nishibayashi could be expected to act differently in a material way in responding to the risk factors displayed by aidan and in dealing with the parents concern.shorr could not speculate,however,on what the outcome might have been for aidan.
failure to ensure a timely appointment,properly assess aidan risk,and educate the leungs 
vinod bhutani,aidan expert witness on the hospital and nishibayashi standards of care,also found that the hospital breached its duty of care.his opinions were all based on reasonable medical probability.the focus of his testimony was on steps that would have prevented hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus,rather than on treatment.he identified a series of failures by the hospital nursing staff to provide the leungs with adequate information and instruction.in his opinion,considered together,these failures contributed to aidan suffering brain damage.
timely appointment 
first,the nursing staff failed to instruct the leungs that a appointment within two to three days after discharge three to five days of age was mandatory.the necessity of such a appointment for an infant who is discharged within the first hours after birth is recognized as part of the standard of perinatal care for nurses as well as doctors based on guidelines endorsed by various medical and related organizations,including the american hospital association and the neonatal nurses association.the appointment is important,because various conditions,such as jaundice,may not appear at early discharge,and there should be an assessment of the baby condition,including whether the infant is feeding properly.for aidan,such an appointment had special importance,because he was discharged very early,within hours of birth and,as noted below,he was at an increased risk of developing hyperbilirubinemia leading to kernicterus.
according to bhutani,although the date of a appointment is decided by the pediatrician and the parents,the nurses have an independent duty to reinforce the need for a timely appointment.if in their judgment the pediatrician has suggested an appointment date that is outside the standard of care,the nurses have the duty to advise the parents or the pediatrician of their disagreement.
if nishibayashi had seen aidan within two to three days of discharge for instance,on the thursday of nancy leung telephone call to his office,bhutani testified that the following steps would have occurred aidan would have been weighed based on his age,he should have been gaining rather than losing weight nishibayashi would have asked nancy leung first hand questions relevant to assessing aidan level of jaundice such as whether the stools were changing color and whether aidan was getting enough to eat and he would have seen the progression of aidan jaundice it was already apparent in his eyes,and was clearly progressing.based on this information,administering a bilirubin test would have been good medical practice,though there was no requirement that nishibayashi do so.the important point was that aidan should have been examined,so that nishibayashi could assess whether aidan needed to be treated immediately or could be treated at home.such an assessment on thursday would have been a very important step,the last step in preventing the tragedy that aidan has gone through.
risk assessment 
second,the hospital failed to perform any risk assessment on aidan for jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia such as by testing for bilirubin or by evaluating the applicability to aidan of the clinical risk factors,failed to inform the leungs of aidan particular risk,and failed to emphasize that,because of that risk,a timely appointment was even more necessary for aidan than typical.at discharge,aidan showed some not all of the major risk factors male,east asian descent,bruising,breast feeding,as well as the minor risk factor of less than weeks gestation weeks,days,as calculated based on the ultrasound performed by nancy leung obstetrician 
bhutani found the information on jaundice that the hospital provided the leungs in the manual inadequate to fulfill the hospital duty.it was outdated published in and failed to reflect the more recent information on the risk of kernicterus provided by alert in and other publications.one of the purposes of alert was to change family education material,and its publication in was a major change in the standard of care for newborn jaundice.the manual was also inaccurate in stating that bruising on the baby head will heal and is not dangerous.cephalohematoma is a major risk factor for hyperbilirubinemia.had the hospital assessed aidan risk which was elevated,given his clinical risk factors and adequately educated the leungs on that risk as well as on breast feeding and detecting jaundice,discussed below,the leungs would have had the necessary information to accurately assess aidan condition and act appropriately.
detecting jaundice 
third,the hospital staff failed to teach the leungs how to detect jaundice by examining aidan skin.jaundice in infants appears first in the skin,and only later in the whites of the eyes.to detect its presence,parents should be trained on the proper method of inspecting the infant skin from head to toe under good lighting.this method the same one taught to nurses and resident physicians is straightforward an index finger is pressed on the forehead of the infant for seconds to a minute to blanch the skin,and is then removed the blanched spot is observed to see if the skin has a yellowish tinge.parents should also perform the same test on the infant sternum so as to detect the possible progression of jaundice down the body.according to bhutani,both the physician and the nurses have a duty to give such instruction however,it is easier for the nurses because of their frequent presence attending to the mother and infant.parents should be instructed that if they detect jaundice,they should call the doctor.
in aidan case,bhutani testified that there most likely would have been recognizable jaundice for at least two days before nancy leung called nishibayashi office.bilirubin is usually rising for the first three to five days and reaches its maximum close to the fifth day unless other causes exacerbate the jaundice.thus,aidan jaundice would have been increasing once it appeared.
when the leungs recognized jaundice in aidan,nancy called nishibayashi.but because recognizable jaundice likely had been present for at least two days prior to that call,nancy leung might have noticed signs of jaundice and called nishibayashi earlier,had she been properly educated.
breast feeding 
fourth,the nursing staff failed to provide sufficient coaching to nancy leung on breast feeding to ensure that she could recognize when aidan latched on to the nipple properly and when he received an actual transfer of milk as by recognizing the particular sound and feel of aidan swallowing.such coaching was especially important because of aidan very early discharge,because aidan was not feeding well at discharge,and because of his particular risk of hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus to expel bilirubin,it is essential that the infant take in sufficient milk.
bhutani found the written instructions that the hospital provided to nancy leung on breast feeding in the manual were accurate,but inadequate.the mother needs to be coached in this because it not a manual that you can use to assemble a bicycle.you actually have to be taught this.from the medical records,bhutani was aware that nurse mcclammy instructed nancy leung on breast feeding as well as other matters prior to discharge,but the instruction occurred for a very short period of time from what i can understand.further,the net result was that the baby had lost two pounds of weight between discharge and admission at huntington memorial hospital.so obviously the milk intake had not been adequate the baby was dehydrated and not getting enough to eat.with adequate milk intake,aidan would not have lost that amount of weight within to hours unless he had diarrhea and there was no evidence that he did.in bhutani view,aidan condition when admitted to huntington memorial was pretty profound evidence concerning the inadequate feeding.
conclusion as to the hospital negligence 
according to bhutani,given aidan risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia,the hospital staff should have instructed the leungs that a appointment within two to three days after discharge was mandatory they must ensure aidan was getting enough milk intake,not just pretending to suckle but was actually getting the milk intake they must look for sufficient urine and stool output,with the stools changing color so as to reflect the expelling of bilirubin,and they must look for any signs of jaundice infection and any change in behavior.in bhutani opinion,if these instructions had been given and followed,aidan severe hyperbilirubinemia could have been prevented.
nishibayashi negligence 
in bhutani opinion,nishibayashi conduct fell below the standard of care in two primary ways.first,he did not adequately educate nancy leung on the risks of jaundice and the need for a appointment because of that risk.second,based on nancy thursday telephone call,he should have seen aidan that day,examined him,and obtained information from nancy.nishibayashi could not assess the weight or skin color over the phone.
according to bhutani,aidan probably had hyperbilirubinemia on thursday.he based that opinion on aidan extremely high reading of when admitted to huntington memorial hospital and the normal progression of bilirubin levels of infants in the first three to five days of life.he also believed that aidan likely had lost weight,based on the fact that he was dehydrated and had significant weight loss two pounds when examined at huntington memorial hospital on sunday.
asked specifically about severe hyperbilirubinemia,bhutani testified that the condition is treatable and that timely treatment may prevent brain damage more likely than not.he also testified that if nishibayashi had seen aidan on thursday,there would have been a recognition of a need for further testing,there would have been a finding that,in fact,he had a high level of bilirubin and he needed treatment.
brain damage from elevated bilirubin usually starts off with a series of simple symptoms like excessive sleepiness and refusing to eat.when the leungs observed those symptoms on late saturday or early sunday,it was an indication that aidan brain was being affected.that is when the horse kind of left the barn i mean,that is what you do want to see happen,getting acute bilirubin encephalopathy so you can always reverse the process.
medical costs and life care plan 
the parties entered a stipulation that the leungs had paid incurred reasonable and necessary medical costs of.
life care planner jan roughan prepared a life care plan for aidan,containing certain variable recommendations based on his condition.forensic economist robert johnson,estimated that the future medical costs of this plan,based on a life expectancy of years and,depending on which variables the jury might conclude were necessary,ranged from a present value of to.he estimated that aidan lost earning capacity,depending on his level of education bachelor degree to professional degree,ranged from a present value of to.
ii.hospital evidence 
sylvia koyer folland and sharon lynn nelson,two of the nurses who cared for aidan while he was in the hospital,testified that he showed no signs that he was at risk of jaundice and appeared healthy.nurse margaret mcclammy testified concerning the instructions on breast feeding,jaundice,and other topics she gave nancy leung before discharge the instruction occurred as mcclammy went through a check list of items,a process that took approximately minutes.she instructed that if jaundice occurred within the first hours,then nancy should call her pediatrician.
heidi funk,an expert in nursing care,testified that the hospital nursing staff met the standard of care in all respects in caring for aidan and nancy.in her opinion aidan did not appear at risk for jaundice,and the staff had no duty to advise the leungs of the risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia in her interpretation of aidan medical records,the breast feeding was going well at the hospital,and the bruises on aidan head did not appear related to jaundice using a standard classification system based on a physical examination of aidan,he appeared to be at weeks gestation,not premature the staff had no duty to instruct the leungs how soon to make a appointment,and nurse mcclammy instruction to call the pediatrician if jaundice developed within the first hours was within the standard of care the issuance of alert did not immediately change the standard of care for assessing the risk of kernicterus,and given the lag time required between issuance of new health care information and implementation,the hospital failure to implement any recommendations of the alert by the time of aidan birth in was within the standard of care the instructional material provided to nancy leung at discharge was within the standard of care and the instructions on breast feeding given by nurse mcclammy were adequate.
according to paul hofmann,a healthcare consultant,alert did not have equivalent weight as a jcaho standard,and did not obligate the hospital to take any action other than reviewing the alert and considering whether it needed to take any action.
rebecca fletcher,an instructor in family education at the hospital,testified that nancy leung paid for several classes,including classes on breast feeding,infant care,and parenting.in the parenting classes taught by fletcher,a minute videotape was played,a two to three minute portion of which covered jaundice,supplemented by three to five minutes of questions and lecture.the information in the video was from.it referred to physiologic jaundice as being so mild it generally does not require treatment.it did not discuss any of the risk factors that applied to aidan.the lecture message was that,if the infant is not eating well and is turning yellow,the parent should immediately call the doctor or get the infant to a healthcare facility,because the condition could be serious though treatable.fletcher also played a short video on breast feeding,in which the subject of how to tell whether there is a transfer of milk is covered.
stacey helvin,a life care planner,prepared an alternative life care plan for aidan,which two expert witnesses glenn fowler,a pediatric neurologist who examined aidan,and kimberly bedell,a pediatric physiatrist specializing in rehabilitation of special needs children found suitable.
forensic economist ted vavoulis calculated the present value of aidan lost earnings to range depending on whether he received a bachelors,masters,or professional degree between and.he calculated the cost of stacy helvin life care plan in present value,depending on aidan life expectancy and whether aidan resided in a group home after age or resided at home with attendant care,to range between and.he calculated the cost of jan roughan plan in present value to be.
iii.nishibayashi evidence 
kevin white,a pediatrician,testified that nishibayashi care of aidan was within the standard of care.as of,the standard of care did not require nishibayashi to inform the leungs of aidan risk for hyperbilirubinemia,did not require an appointment earlier than a week after birth,and did not require nishibayashi to have aidan seen in response to nancy leung thursday phone call.
iv.verdict 
in a special verdict,the jury found that the hospital,nishibayashi,and the leungs were separately negligent in their care of aidan,and that the negligence of each was a substantial factor in causing aidan harm the jury allocated the percentage of negligence as follows nishibayashi,percent the hospital,percent and the leungs,percent.the jury awarded past medical costs of,future medical costs of,at a present value of million,lost future earnings of million,at a present value of,and emotional distress damages of.
discussion 
settlement with and release of nishibayashi 
the hospital contends that common law,rather than code of civil procedure sections and,governs the effect of aidan settlement with and release of nishibayashi according to the hospital,the common law principle,as held in controlling california supreme court authority,is that a release for consideration of one joint tortfeasor operates as a release of the joint and several liability of the other joint tortfeasors.see,bee,supra,cal.at tompkins,supra,cal.at.the hospital argues that under this rule,aidan release of nishibayashi in consideration of his million settlement payment released the hospital from its joint and several liability for aidan injuries.in other words,while the hospital remains liable for its proportionate share of aidan noneconomic damages such liability being several only and not joint,subd.a,the hospital is released from its joint and several liability for aidan economic damages 
as we explain,although the california supreme court has been critical of the release rule and limited its application in some circumstances,the court has not abandoned it with respect to concurrent tortfeasors who produce a single injury.under the doctrine of stare decisis,we conclude that we remain bound by the supreme court decisions applying the rule,and therefore we reverse the judgment against the hospital to the extent it requires the hospital to pay economic damages for which it was jointly and severally liable with nishibayashi.at the same time,we urge the california supreme court to grant review,abandon the release rule,and fashion a new common law rule concerning the effect of a faith settlement on a tortfeasor liability.
background 
before trial,aidan entered a written settlement agreement and release with nishibayashi,under which nishibayashi would pay the limit of his malpractice insurance policy,million,pursuant to a specified payment schedule during aidan life,and would participate as a defendant in the trial.in exchange,aidan would release nishibayashi and his professional corporation from all claims.the settlement was conditioned on the court approving a minor compromise for aidan,and on the court finding the settlement to be in good faith under sections and.it also provided that the release and discharge of nishibayashi did not apply to the hospital.
nishibayashi moved for a declaration of good faith settlement.the trial court denied the motion,agreeing with the hospital that the settlement did not meet the good faith standard of,associates cal d,in that the settlement amount was grossly disproportionate to nishibayashi potential share of liability and to the total expected recovery 
rather than abandoning the settlement,aidan and nishibayashi elected to pursue it,and amended their agreement to delete the condition requiring the court to declare the settlement to be in good faith,though the condition requiring approval of the minor compromise remained.on may,aidan filed a petition to approve the compromise of his claim against nishibayashi.on may,shortly before trial,with the consent of aidan counsel,the court continued the hearing on the petition in order to have it reviewed by a staff attorney in the probate department.the court stated that a new date for hearing on the petition would be scheduled after the review was complete.
meanwhile,the trial occurred,and the jury returned its verdict on july,awarding damages and finding nishibayashi percent negligent and the hospital percent.on july,after the court informed aidan attorney of recommendations for changes to the proposed special needs trust,aidan filed a revised petition which was heard on september.
aidan counsel argued that the settlement was in aidan best interests because although nishibayashi was percent liable for the judgment,aidan parents had determined that it was economically unfeasible to try to obtain more from him than the million settlement,and it was in aidan interests to receive the settlement funds immediately in order to ensure his continuing care.further,according to aidan attorney,the hospital remained jointly and severally liable for the entire amount of economic damages in the judgment.thus,regardless of the settlement,aidan could collect the full sum of economic damages from the hospital alone.for his part,nishibayashi counsel argued that the hospital could seek equitable indemnity from nishibayashi for amounts it paid in excess of its percentage share of the judgment.
the hospital did not oppose the petition,and did not initially argue that the common law release rule would extinguish the hospital joint and several liability for aidan economic damages.rather,it argued that if the petition were approved and aidan settled with nishibayashi,then under the terms of the settlement,the hospital would be relieved of its joint liability for nishibayashi percent share of the economic damages.
after argument,the court granted the petition to approve the minor compromise,but referred the revised plan for a special needs trust to the probate department for further review.the order approving the minor compromise was not signed and entered until october.
in the meantime,the parties filed competing versions of the judgment.as part of that debate,the hospital filed objections to the judgment which invoked the common law release rule and argued that the settlement with and release of nishibayashi released the hospital joint liability for aidan economic damages,leaving only the hospital several liability for its proportionate share of the in noneconomic damages.alternatively,the hospital argued that its liability was reduced as reflected in the rest d torts,to its comparative share of economic percent.the court rejected the arguments,finding that the common law release rule was not the current state of the law,and noting that it would be nice to have a court of appeal opinion on it and maybe this is the case that is going to do it.and i would urge you to go find out.the court entered judgment on november.
the hospital then moved to vacate the judgment,reiterating its argument that aidan settlement with and release of nishibayashi released the hospital joint and several liability for aidan economic damages.the court denied the motion.
discussion 
as here relevant,section applies to a release only if it is given in good faith before verdict or judgment to one or more of a number of tortfeasors claimed to be liable for the same tort.under section,such a release does not release the other tortfeasors unless it so provides reduces the claims against the other tortfeasors in the amount of the consideration paid in the settlement or in the amount stipulated,if that amount is greater and bars claims against the released tortfeasor for contribution.section,which provides the procedure for determining good faith,adds that a determination of good faith also bars any claim for equitable indemnity based on comparative fault see far west financial d s cal d,section bars all equitable indemnity claims,including total equitable indemnity.
the california supreme court has identified two major goals served by sections and equitable sharing of costs among the parties at fault and the encouragement of settlements.abbott ford,superior court cal d,abbott ford.based on these goals,the court adopted a flexible standard for determining good faith,which involves consideration of a number of factors,including whether the settlement amount is grossly disproportionate to the settling defendant liability,supra,cal d at see abbott ford,supra,cal d at.
here,aidan settlement with nishibayashi does not fall under the provisions of sections and the trial court found the settlement was not in good faith,because it was grossly disproportionate to nishibayashi individual liability therefore,the effect of aidan settlement with nishibayashi on the hospital liability depends on the common law.
before the enactment of section,the california supreme court followed the common law rule that a release of one joint tortfeasor for consideration constitutes a release of all,thus barring the plaintiff from pursuing the action against the remaining joint tortfeasors.bee,supra,cal.at chetwood california national bank cal,tompkins,supra,cal.at see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,tracing common law rule thaxter,joint tortfeasors legislative changes in the rules regarding releases and contribution hastings,same.the term joint tortfeasor was used loosely,referring to all tortfeasors who were jointly and severally liable for the plaintiff harm.as the supreme court explained the rule that the release of one joint tortfeasor releases all the others is intended to prevent double recovery for the injury and is based on the theory that there can be but one compensation for the joint wrong,that each joint tortfeasor is responsible for the whole damage,that the cause of action is satisfied once the injured party is paid for his injury by one of the joint tortfeasors,and that the receipt by the injured party of any sum,if accepted as payment in satisfaction of the cause of action against one joint tortfeasor,is in law full satisfaction as to all joint tortfeasors.lamoreux san diego.ry.cal d,lamoreux see mesler bragg management cal d,mesler see also rest d torts appen,reporter notes,explaining origin of rule in england.moreover,the supreme court applied the rule even if the release expressly reserved the right to sue the remaining tortfeasors.bee,supra,cal.at reservation of plaintiff rights against other defendants held nugatory and of no effect,and declared void as being repugnant to the legal effect and operation of the release itself.
because the release rule could work unintended hardship,the court adopted the concomitant rule that if the plaintiff entered a covenant not to sue instead of a release,the other tortfeasors were not released.pellett sonotone cal d,pellett kincheloe retail credit,cal d.such a covenant did not release the other tortfeasors,because its language was not a release but a promise not to prosecute the suit.mesler,supra,cal d at.
although before enactment of section the court chipped away at the release rule,it never fully repudiated it.its decisions leave the rule in effect as to concurrent tortfeasors,such as nishibayashi and the hospital,whose independent acts concur to produce a single harm.
in ash mortensen cal d ash,the court acknowledged the release rule,but refused to apply it to successive tortfeasors who produced separate,though related,injuries.the court held that the plaintiff release of the negligent driver in a car accident in which the plaintiff was injured did not bar her malpractice suit against the treating doctors who aggravated the injuries she suffered in the accident.id.at.the court reasoned that a release of a cause of action against a wrongdoer is not a release of a separate or distinct cause of action against another independent wrongdoer we are of the opinion that a release of the original wrongdoer should release an attending doctor from liability for aggravation of the injury if there has been full compensation for both injuries,but not otherwise.citations.id.at.
but the court did not overrule the release rule as applied to concurrent tortfeasors who produce a single injury it has been held in some cases involving unliquidated tort demands that the payment of any sum in consideration of the release of one of several joint or independent concurrent tortfeasors will be presumed to have been made and accepted as full compensation or satisfaction for the alleged injury.citations.there is also authority to the contrary.citation.but whatever may be the rule with regard to a settlement with joint or independent tortfeasors whose acts concur to produce a single injury,it does not follow that such presumption should be indulged where,as here,the injured person claim embraces separate injuries caused by independent successive tortfeasors and is liquidated by a judgment against the original tortfeasor.id.at,italics added.thus,while the court refused to apply the release rule to successive tortfeasors who produce separate injuries,it did not overrule the release rule as applied to concurrent tortfeasors who produce a single injury.
one year after ash,in pellett,supra,cal d,the court refused to apply the release rule to a plaintiff covenant not to execute on any future judgment that might be obtained against one joint pledge that was not strictly a release or a covenant not to sue,although it par took somewhat of the nature of both.id.at.in its discussion of the relevant law,the court reiterated t he rule in this state,applied in many cases,that a release of one joint tortfeasor is a release of all citations,but that a mere covenant not to sue one joint tortfeasor does not release the others.id.at.the court candidly observed,however,that the distinction between a release and a covenant not to sue is entirely artificial.as between the parties to the agreement,the final result is the same in both cases,namely,that there is no further recovery from the defendant who makes the settlement,and the difference in the effect as to third parties is based mainly,if not entirely,on the fact that in one case there is an immediate release,whereas in the other there is merely an agreement not to prosecute a suit.pellett,supra,cal d at.
pellett was followed by lamoreux,supra,cal d,a wrongful death action in which the court again refused to apply the release rule.the court held that the plaintiff claim against the railroad whose train struck the decedent car was not barred by the plaintiff release of the decedent employer,who had been sued along with the railroad,but who received a release in a collateral worker compensation proceeding.the court acknowledged that s ome california decisions which followed the general rule that the release,for a consideration,of one of several asserted joint tortfeasors bars an action against another have stated that it is immaterial whether the person who made the payment for the release was or was not legally liable.id.at.rather than disapproving such decisions,however,the court distinguished them,because none of them involved the settlement of a claim based upon a special limited liability such as workmen compensation,the settlement of which does not,as a matter of law,constitute full payment or satisfaction for all the damage suffered.ibid.
in,the same year the court decided lamoreux,the legislature enacted section.as of that date,the state of the common law,never repudiated by the california supreme court,was that a release for consideration of one concurrent tortfeasor who acted with other tortfeasors to cause a single harm barred suit against the others.section abrogated that rule only as to releases given in good faith and before verdict or judgment.later,in,responding to the california supreme court decision in american motorcycle superior court cal d,the legislature enacted section,which,among other things,codifies the american motorcycle result by providing that a section settlement bars claims for partial or comparative indemnity as well as for contribution,supra,cal d at.but the california supreme court,to date,has not authoritatively abandoned the release rule.to the contrary,as late as,in mesler,supra,cal d,the court implicitly acknowledged that the rule remains part of california common law.
in mesler,the trial court granted the summary judgment motion of the defendant parent corporation.the plaintiff appealed,and while the appeal was pending,settled with and released another defendant that was a subsidiary corporation of the parent.as stated by the supreme court,the issue presented was whether a plaintiff may pursue a tort action against a parent corporation on the theory that it is the alter ego of its subsidiary,the alleged tortfeasor,after entering into a settlement and release agreement with the subsidiary.id.at.resolution of this issue depended,in part,on whether settlement with an alter ego was covered by section or whether the common law release rule applied.in discussing the release rule,the court noted that t he rule was based on the misconception,as dean prosser suggested,that a satisfaction is the equivalent of a release.citation.however,while a satisfaction is an acceptance of full compensation for the injury a release is a surrender of the cause of action,which may be gratuitous,or given for inadequate consideration.citation.even if it could be said that any sum the plaintiff received in settlement was a compensation for the joint wrong citation,the rule produced unfair results.for example,a plaintiff who settled with a defendant of modest resources for an amount below the value of his damages did not have his claim fully satisfied nevertheless,under the common law rule he could not seek further compensation from other defendants.mesler,supra,cal d at.
the court in mesler thus recognized the dubious lineage of the release rule and questioned its wisdom.but the court also acknowledged its continued viability as part of california common law.in summarizing the issue presented in the case and its holding,the court stated at issue is the applicability of section,which abrogates the common law rule that settlement with one alleged tortfeasor bars action against any others claimed liable for the same injury.we conclude that the statute does apply,and thus release of an alleged tortfeasor under these circumstances does not preclude suit against its claimed alter ego.id.at,italics added,fn.omitted.later in its discussion,the court was even clearer concerning the viability of the release rule the alter ego corporation would be dismissed together with the subsidiary under the common law release rule,unless section applies.id.at,italics added.it thus appears that the court was acknowledging the continued viability of the release rule in california common law 
since enactment of section,at least three decisions by courts of appeal have recognized that the common law applies when section does not.thomas general motors d,acknowledging that e xcept as modified by section,the former law still applies,and a release of one joint tortfeasor is a release of all,but applying common law rule that a covenant not to sue does not release joint tortfeasors to a case involving multiple defendants who executed covenant after judgment was entered and an appeal filed watson mcewen d,satisfaction of judgment against negligent lessee barred action against landowner section held not applicable because it applies to a release before judgment,and therefore release rule applied,because e xcept as modified by that section,the rule is that a release of one joint tortfeasor is a release of all apodaca hamilton d,release of negligent driver of dump truck also released rock company that negligently overloaded the truck w hatever fault may be found with it,we do not question that,except as it may have been modified by section,the rule in this state,applied to many cases,is that a release of one joint tortfeasor is a release of all.
our research has disclosed only one decision,river garden farms,superior court d river garden farms,which holds that after the passage of section,the common law release rule does not apply to faith settlements.in river garden farms,the trial court approved minors compromises for claims against three of four tort defendants,but made no determination whether the settlements were in good faith under section,subdivision a.the case was decided before the enactment of section,which specified the procedure for determining good faith.following the trial court denial of its motion to dismiss,the fourth defendant petitioned for a writ of mandate,contending that the settlements were not in good faith.river garden farms,supra,d at.in a holding later endorsed by the california supreme court see,supra,cal d at,the court held that the definition of good faith must be consistent with the purposes of section sharing of costs among tortfeasors and encouragement of thus must involve consideration of whether the settlement is within a reasonable range of the settling defendant share of liability.river garden farms,supra,d at.
but in a separate portion of the opinion,the court also held that section abrogated the release rule,even for settlements not in good faith.the court reasoned that section purpose of encouraging settlements can not with the rule releasing all upon the release of one,because a n injured party would have little motivation for settling with one defendant at the possible sacrifice of his claim against the other.id.at.the court declared only its utter demise and its supersession by statutory controls are consistent with the settlement goal of the contribution law.section implicitly but firmly dispatched it.id.at.
we find several problems in this analysis.first,it ignores the express language of section,which by its terms applies to a release only when given in good faith before verdict or judgment.given this language,it is difficult to see how section can be read to implicitly dispatch the release rule for faith settlements occurring after verdict or judgment.second,it does not accord proper respect for stare decisis,and fails to consider that,although the california supreme court certainly appeared to be moving toward abandoning the release rule entirely,it did not do so.third,as we have noted,in mesler decided after river garden farms,the california supreme court necessarily acknowledged that the release rule remained part of california common law.for all these reasons,we find river garden farms unpersuasive 
because the california supreme court never repudiated the release rule with respect to concurrent tortfeasors,such as nishibayashi and the hospital who act independently to cause a single injury,and because mesler necessarily assumed the continued viability of the release rule as applied to the issue presented in that case,we are unable to hold,as aidan requests us to do,that the rule is no longer part of california common law.we agree with many of aidan arguments.the rule lacks a creditable heritage.it can create unintended and inequitable results,resulting in the plaintiff receiving an inadequate settlement from a defendant of modest means and unintentionally releasing another culpable tortfeasor with no opportunity to receive additional compensation from that tortfeasor.the rationale of the release a plaintiff double largely been eviscerated by california modification of the joint and several liability rule to require allocation of damages based on each tortfeasor percentage of fault,subd.a see dafonte,cal th,and by the adoption of the right of partial indemnity on a comparative fault basis among multiple tortfeasors american motorcycle,supra,cal d at.
but our role as an intermediate appellate court in a case such as this is not to disregard controlling supreme court precedent,or to purport to find in sections and an implicit abrogation of that precedent with respect to faith settlements in violation of the statutory language.rather,our role is to defer to the california supreme court for any reconsideration of the doctrine.rodriguez bethlehem steel cal d.we do so here,and urge the california supreme court to repudiate the release rule once and for all 
we note,as well,that should the release rule be abandoned,there is an important related issue,namely,the extent of the set off to which the defendant is entitled after a codefendant enters a settlement that does not qualify under section.the hospital asserts that the rule stated in section of the restatement of torts should be adopted as the common law rule applicable to faith settlements.under that rule,t he plaintiff recoverable damages from a jointly and severally liable tortfeasor are reduced by the comparative share of damages attributable to a settling tortfeasor who otherwise would have been liable for contribution to jointly and severally liable to defendants who do not settle.on the other hand,aidan argues that the tortfeasor should receive only a pro tanto,dollar for dollar set off,regardless of whether the settlement was in good faith.we express no opinion on the subject,and leave it to the supreme court,should it repudiate the release rule in this case,to determine the proper approach.
because the release rule applies,we reverse that portion of the judgment imposing joint and several liability on the hospital for aidan economic damages.however,because the hospital remains liable for its proportionate share of noneconomic damages,we address,in the unpublished portion of our opinion,the hospital contentions that substantial evidence fails to prove that the hospital negligence was a substantial factor in causing aidan brain damage,and that the trial court improperly instructed on causation and influenced two jurors to change their votes.
ii.substantial evidence of causation 
the hospital contends that there is insufficient evidence to prove that its negligence was a substantial factor in causing aidan brain damage.the substance of its argument is that the proof of causation is speculative,because no evidence proves that,absent the hospital negligence in failing to stress the need for a appointment or to educate the leungs,nishibayashi or the leungs would have acted differently or aidan would not have suffered brain damage.
we disagree.the evidence permitted the jury to infer that the hospital negligence as a implementing alert,not properly assessing aidan risk of hyperbilirubinemia,not adequately educating the leungs on that risk,not adequately educating them on detecting jaundice,and not adequately educating nancy leung on breast a substantial factor that,along with nishibayashi negligence,caused aidan to suffer kernicterus and resultant brain damage.of course,in judging the sufficiency of the evidence to prove causation,we review the entire record in the light most favorable to aidan,drawing all reasonable inferences in support of the judgment.south llc laconic limited partnership th.
the substantial factor standard of causation is a relatively broad one,requiring only that the contribution of the individual cause be more than negligible or theoretical.citation.thus,a force which plays only an infinitesimal or theoretical part in bringing about injury,damage,or loss is not a substantial factor citation,but a very minor force that does cause harm is a substantial factor citation.this rule honors the principle of comparative fault.bockrath aldrich chemical cal th,bockrath.
as here applicable,the element of causation is satisfied when a plaintiff produces sufficient evidence to allow the jury to infer that in the absence of the defendant negligence,there was a reasonable medical probability the plaintiff would have obtained a better result.citations.citation.espinosa little of mary hospital th,espinosa.moreover,causation in fact is ultimately a matter of probability and common sense a plaintiff is not required to eliminate entirely all possibility that the defendant conduct was not a cause.it is enough that he introduces evidence from which reasonable persons may conclude that it is more probable that the event was caused by the defendant than that it was not if,as a matter of ordinary experience,a particular act or omission might be expected to produce a particular result,and if that result has in fact followed,the conclusion may be justified that the causal relation exists.in drawing that conclusion,the triers of fact are permitted to draw upon ordinary human experience as to the probabilities of the case.citation.raven gamette th,raven.further,the question is not whether each individual strand of the hospital negligence,viewed in isolation,was a substantial factor in causing aidan injury,but whether the entire fabric of that negligence,viewed as a whole and in conjunction with nishibayashi conduct,was a substantial factor.
we begin with nishibayashi negligence,because it provides essential context for considering the effect of the hospital negligence.
bhutani concluded that nishibayashi conduct fell below the standard of care because,in part,nishibayashi should have examined aidan on the thursday of nancy leung telephone call to his office and obtained information on aidan condition.the evidence proved that this negligence constituted a substantial factor in causing aidan brain damage.
the evidence left little doubt that had nishibayashi examined aidan,he would have diagnosed and treated his condition.his lack of concern in response to nancy leung telephone call was based on the description of aidan condition relayed by his nurse,julie donnelly that aidan was slightly yellow but nursing well and had good yellow stools and was voiding well.but substantial evidence showed that he was not provided with accurate information.nancy leung testified that donnelly simply asked whether aidan was feeding,pooping,and peeing,to which nancy replied yes.nancy denied that she described that aidan was doing these things well,and denied saying that aidan was voiding well.moreover,in nancy account,she informed donnelly of aidan chapped lips a possible sign of dehydration after donnelly had already spoken to nishibayashi.donnelly written message memorializing the conversation with nancy does not mention chapped lips.of course,on appeal we resolve all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the judgment,and thus nancy version of the conversation prevails and constitutes substantial evidence that nishibayashi made his diagnosis on incomplete and inaccurate information.
had nishibayashi actually examined aidan on thursday,substantial evidence proved that he would have diagnosed aidan hyperbilirubinemia.he reasonably could be expected to have observed aidan progression of jaundice it was already recognizable to the leungs in aidan eyes.he would have observed aidan chapped lips as noted at huntington memorial hospital,that condition was not normal and was related to dehydration.he would have learned that aidan had lost weight julie donnelly testified that infants are weighed when examined at nishibayashi office,and bhutani opined,based on aidan weight loss of two pounds when admitted to huntington memorial on sunday,that aidan had lost weight by thursday.such a weight loss was a danger sign suggesting a need for to bhutani,by that date aidan should have been gaining,not losing,weight.it is also reasonable to expect that nishibayashi would have inquired of nancy leung and obtained accurate information from her on the topics julie donnelly inquired about whether aidan was feeding properly and his stools were adequate to expel bilirubin.he also may have done a bilirubin test according to nishibayashi,it would have been good medical practice,though not required.thus,it is certainly probable that a pediatrician of years experience such as nishibayashi would have detected aidan hyperbilirubinemia and treated it.as bhutani testified,if nishibayashi had seen aidan on thursday,there would have been a recognition of a need for further testing and there would have been a finding that aidan had a high level of bilirubin and he needed treatment.had he done so,aidan condition would not have progressed to kernicterus.
we now turn to the hospital negligence,which worked in combination with nishibayashi negligence to cause aidan brain damage.
according to arthur shorr,the hospital was negligent by failing to implement any recommendations of alert to reduce the risks of a newborn developing kernicterus.bhutani found the hospital negligent in related ways the nursing staff failed to instruct the leungs that a appointment within two to three days after discharge was mandatory,failed to properly assess aidan risk for developing hyperbilirubinemia and discuss that risk with the leungs,and failed to adequately educate the leungs on detecting jaundice and nancy leung on proper breast feeding.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment and drawing reasonable inferences from that evidence,these various components of negligence exacerbated each other and worked with nishibayashi negligence to cause aidan brain damage in two ways.first,absent the hospital negligence,it is likely that aidan condition would not have progressed to hyperbilirubinemia.second,absent the hospital negligence,it is likely that once aidan condition did progress to hyperbilirubinemia as of thursday,aidan would have been examined and treated by nishibayashi.
aidan was born at the hospital on a monday and released tuesday,approximately hours later.as compared to other infants,he was at an increased risk of developing hyperbilirubinemia and kernicterus he showed four major clinical risk factors being male,being of east asian descent,being breast fed,and having bruises,and one minor risk factor being less than weeks weeks,on the ultrasound of the fetus taken by nancy leung obstetrician.according to bhutani,the hospital nursing staff should have recognized aidan risk,communicated it to the leungs,and stressed that a appointment within two to three days of discharge was mandatory.it may be inferred that knowledge of aidan he had an elevated danger of developing a condition from unmonitored jaundice that could lead to brain information that would have materially changed the way his parents attended to aidan once he was discharged from the hospital.had the hospital not been negligent in failing to implement alert,had the nursing staff not been negligent in failing to properly assess and inform the leungs of aidan risk,and had the staff also not been negligent in failing to inform the leungs that a appointment within two to three days after discharge was mandatory,the likelihood of aidan hyperbilirubinemia occurring and going untreated would have been substantially reduced.the leungs would have understood the heightened need to monitor aidan breast feeding and stool,to examine him for jaundice,and to have his risk for hyperbilirubinemia assessed in an appointment no later than thursday three days after his monday discharge.
this negligence was exacerbated by the hospital negligent failure to provide sufficient coaching to nancy leung on breast feeding.nancy testified that while in the hospital,she told two of the attending nurses,susan mcbroom and margaret mcclammy,she was not sure she was breast feeding correctly.at least three times,she told them that she was concerned aidan was not getting enough milk.the nurses encouraged her to keep trying,but only once did she receive any coaching.for five to ten minutes,as nancy put aidan to her breast,nurse mcclammy instructed her,helped her position him,and observed that he seemed to latch on.according to bhutani,however,the relevant standard of care required more the coaching should have ensured that an actual transfer of milk from mother to infant was taking place,and should have ensured that nancy knew how to detect that such a transfer was occurring as by the sound of aidan swallowing and the feel of his body as he did so.bhutani testified that specific instructional coaching was essential it not a manual that you can use to assemble a bicycle.
nancy testified that although she fed aidan every two to three hours at the hospital and later at home as recommended,she did not know to what extent aidan was actually feeding.in reality,he was not getting sufficient milk.by the time he was admitted to huntington memorial hospital the sunday after his birth,he had lost two pounds and was dehydrated.the jury could reasonably infer that one cause of aidan not getting enough milk was the hospital failure to adequately coach nancy on ensuring an actual transfer of milk was taking place.in turn,the evidence proved that not getting enough milk was a primary cause of aidan brain damage adequate milk intake prevents hyperbilirubinemia,because it creates sufficient stool to expel bilirubin.because the hospital negligence in failing to adequately coach nancy on breast feeding was a cause of aidan inadequate milk intake,it could also be reasonably inferred that such negligence was a cause of aidan hyperbilirubinemia,kernicterus,and brain damage.
another exacerbating omission by the hospital identified by bhutani was the failure of the nursing staff to teach the leungs how to detect jaundice in the skin.according to bhutani,the nursing staff should have taught the leungs the same method of detection used by nurses and residents a simple matter of pressing an index finger on the infant forehead,and later the sternum,for a short period to blanch the skin,then lifting the finger and examining the whitened skin for any yellowish tinge.this omission was significant because,according to bhutani,aidan extraordinarily high bilirubin level of when admitted to huntington memorial on sunday and the normal progression of bilirubin in infants suggested that aidan likely had recognizable jaundice for at least two days before nancy leung thursday call to nishibayashi office.the jury could reasonably infer that if the leungs had been taught to recognize jaundice in the skin by the simple test described by bhutani,and if they had been instructed on aidan increased risk for hyperbilirubinemia and the imperative of a timely appointment,they would have tested aidan and recognized his jaundice sometime before thursday and requested or insisted on an appointment.the evidence showed that such a request or demand for an appointment would have been met according to julie donnelly,nishibayashi nurse,the doctor practice was to see and examine an infant when a parent expressed concern and requested an appointment.at such an appointment,aidan condition could easily have been assessed and treated.
besides being able to infer that aidan condition would not have progressed to hyperbilirubinemia absent the hospital negligence,the jury could also infer that the hospital negligence caused an appointment on the thursday of nancy leung telephone call to nishibayashi not to occur.in this way,too,the hospital negligence was a substantial factor in causing aidan brain damage.
as applied to aidan,the information on jaundice that the hospital provided the leungs in the manual and other sources was misleadingly incomplete.the manual described jaundice in part as a common condition in newborn infants and stated that i n most instances,the jaundice is so mild that it can be ignored and usually will disappear without treatment.of course,given aidan risk of developing kernicterus,any sign of jaundice was a cause for concern and could not be ignored.the manual mentioned that w hen the bilirubin level becomes too high,jaundice can be dangerous to your baby developing nervous system,but it described this dangerous condition as occurring very rarely.for aidan,however,the risk was much higher.in terms of evaluating the risk,the manual stated only that t he level at which jaundice may be dangerous depends on many factors your baby age,whether he was or premature,and whether he has any other medical conditions.although it mentioned the minor risk factor of premature birth,it did not mention the major risk factors displayed by aidan male,east asian descent,breast feeding,and bruising.indeed,the manual was affirmatively misleading as to the presence of aidan bruises it stated that bruises to the baby head and face after birth will heal in a few days and are not dangerous to your baby.the manual communicated no information suggesting that aidan belonged to a small class of infants at high risk of jaundice reaching dangerous levels.
not knowing of aidan increased risk,the leungs reasonably interpreted the manual as conveying the message that,like most infants,aidan was in no real danger.based on that understanding,they did not question the erroneous advice nancy received from nishibayashi nurse,did not insist on nishibayashi seeing aidan immediately,and acceded to waiting until the scheduled monday appointment.had nancy requested or insisted on an appointment,one would have occurred as already noted,julie donnelly testified that if a concerned parent called and asked for an appointment,nishibayashi practice was to see the child.
thus,the jury could reasonably infer that the hospital negligence in failing to inform the leungs of aidan heightened risk of kernicterus from unmonitored jaundice,exacerbated by its misleadingly incomplete as to aidan instruction on jaundice and its failure to stress the importance of an early appointment to monitor aidan bilirubin level,combined with nishibayashi negligence to cause the leungs not to obtain an immediate appointment with nishibayashi on thursday.indeed,it is difficult to imagine that new and attentive parents such as the leungs,had they been aware of the heightened risk that their infant might be on track to suffer irreversible brain damage and that his jaundice needed to be assessed,would not have taken aidan to his pediatrician or some other health care provider when the leungs noticed definite warning signs on thursday yellowish eyes indicating jaundice and chapped lips perhaps indicating dehydration.
as we have already noted,substantial evidence proved that,if a thursday appointment had occurred,nishibayashi would have diagnosed and treated aidan hyperbilirubinemia.thus,the hospital negligence,which along with nishibayashi negligence caused an appointment on thursday not to occur,also caused aidan condition to progress to kernicterus and brain damage.
causation is a matter of probability and common sense raven,supra,th at,based on ordinary human experience as to the probabilities of the case.id.at.viewing the entire record in the light most favorable to the judgment,drawing all inferences in support,and considering the interrelated nature and exponential effect of the hospital negligent omissions as a whole,a rational trier of fact could conclude that such negligence played more than a merely negligible or theoretical role bockrath,supra,cal th at in the events that led to aidan kernicterus.to a reasonable medical probability,absent the hospital negligence,aidan would have obtained a better result espinosa,supra,th at,in that his condition would not have progressed to hyperbilirubinemia,or at the very least he would have been seen and treated by nishibayashi on thursday.
the hospital cites two recent cases to support its argument that the evidence of causation is too speculative and that common sense inferences are inadequate.neither is helpful.
in the first,huitt southern california gas th,the plaintiffs were injured in a natural gas explosion when they attempted to light a water heater pilot light.the odorant of the natural gas had been absorbed as it traveled through stainless steel pipes,and the plaintiffs were unaware that their attempt to bleed off air from one of the pipes resulted in a dangerous buildup of gas.the issue was whether the gas company failure to warn of odor fade was a substantial factor in causing plaintiffs harm.id.at.the court of appeal held that the failure to warn was not a substantial factor,because plaintiffs failed to prove that they would have received any such warning plaintiffs were required to establish a substantial link,or nexus,between the failure to warn and their injuries.instead of introducing evidence to establish a link between the two,plaintiffs relied on common sense and common experience to convince the jury that if a warning had been issued,the accident would have been avoided.in doing so,the trial court allowed the jury to use hindsight to conclude that plaintiffs would have acted differently if they had known of odor fade.as explained above,mere knowledge is not enough to establish causation because it ignores the lack of evidence that any warning issued would have reached plaintiffs.id.at,italics added.
of course,here there is no question that the omitted warnings would have reached the hospital negligence was in failing to provide warnings specifically to them.and there is little doubt that they,after receiving such warnings,would have acted differently to ensure that aidan remained healthy.indeed,it would defy common sense to believe that attentive parents of a newborn such as the leungs would not heed a warning that their baby was at risk of suffering irreversible brain damage from unmonitored jaundice,and would not take reasonable adequate feeding and stool,testing for jaundice,and insisting on an examination when danger signs prevent any harm to the child.
the second decision,bowman wyatt th,is equally inapposite.in bowman,this court found the evidence insufficient to prove that defective brakes on a dump truck were a substantial factor in causing the driver to collide with a motorcyclist,because the record contained no direct or circumstantial evidence indicating that the truck driver applied the brakes before the accident.rather,the evidence showed simply that the truck driver did not see the motorcyclist.id.at.we find nothing in this decision helpful in resolving the present case.as we have detailed above,a chain of reasonable inferences supports the jury finding that the hospital negligence was a substantial factor in causing aidan brain damage.
iii.comment and verdict finding on causation 
the hospital contends that the trial court misinformed the jury on causation and wrongly influenced two jurors jurors and to change their votes from no to yes in response to the question of the special verdict form regarding whether the hospital negligence was a substantial factor in causing aidan injury.the record is to the contrary.
comment on causation 
background 
as to the hospital,nishibayashi,nancy leung,and kevin leung,the special verdict form asked the jury to answer yes or no to the question whether the named actor was negligent in the care or treatment of aidan questions,and if so,whether that actor negligence was a substantial factor in causing harm to aidan questions,and and,given that represents the total negligence that was the cause of aidan harm,w hat percentage of the is due to the negligence of each named actor,if any question.
after the jury foreperson announced that the jury had reached a verdict,the court examined the special verdict form at sidebar with the attorneys and noted that there was an inconsistency.as completed,the verdict form answered yes to whether the hospital,nishibayashi,and the leung were negligent,yes to whether nishibayashi negligence was a substantial factor in causing aidan injury,and no to whether the negligence of the hospital and the leungs was a substantial factor.however,despite the no answer to whether the hospital and the leungs negligence was a substantial factor,the verdict inconsistently,in apportioning the total negligence that was the cause of aidan harm,specified percentages not only for nishibayashi percent,but also for the hospital percent,nancy leung percent,and kevin leung percent.
the court stated i going to have to explain to them,if the hospital and the leungs are not a substantial factor,the number reflecting their percentage of negligence in causing aidan harm should be zero.if they were a substantial factor,they have to answer the prior question yes which asked whether each individual negligence was a substantial factor in causing aidan harm.counsel for the hospital responded,i think you do,too,and the attorneys for nishibayashi and aidan agreed.
the court then instructed the jury as follows okay,ladies and gentlemen,after all that time,i appreciate how hard you worked,you do have a verdict yet.it is internally inconsistent.let me explain to you what the problem is.although you find in question that the hospital was negligent,in question,you find that negligence was not a substantial factor in causing the harm.in the last question,however,you attribute percent of the negligence to the hospital.if it is not a substantial factor,that number should be zero.if it is a substantial factor,then the answer to question should be yes.but it one or the other,okay.you ca find them not a substantial factor but then percent responsible.so i going to ask you to go back and figure out what you really meant or what you really want,and adjust the form accordingly.okay all right,thank you,ladies and gentlemen.
immediately after the jury retired,the hospital attorney stated,just for the record,and i do know if the court wants to clarify this,but it was also inconsistent with regards to and leung because they were not found as a substantial factor as well.the court had the jury return,and then instructed let me rephrase.you need to do this not only with respect to the hospital but with respect to and leung as well.if you have found that a party negligence was not a substantial factor,then the responsibility for the negligence should be zero.if you find,however,that there is some fault to be attributed to them,then you have to find they were a substantial factor in causing the harm.so with respect to anybody that is inconsistent such as that,and that includes the hospital and i believe and leung,you need to go back and figure out which of your options you choosing.if i neglected to say anything about and leung,it was a mistake on my part earlier.i thought i said it,but the lawyers pointed out i did,okay.italics added.the hospital attorney did not object to the court comments.the jury retired and returned with a verdict,the polling of which we discuss below in connection with the contention that the court coerced two jurors into changing their votes on causation.
discussion 
characterizing the italicized statement above as a legally erroneous instruction on causation,the hospital contends that it was not required to object to preserve the alleged error.according to the hospital,the challenged comment told the jury that if it found any fault,regardless of whether that fault played any role in causing aidan brain damage,it had to find that the responsible party was a substantial factor in causing aidan injury.the hospital interpretation is,at best,strained.
when the court gives an instruction to the jury that is incorrect on the law,no objection is needed.lund san joaquin valley railroad cal th,lund see code civ.if,however,the instruction is correct on the law,but is too general,lacks clarity,or is incomplete citations,a party may challenge the instruction on appeal only if it had asked the trial court to give a clarifying instruction.lund,supra,cal th at see conservatorship of gregory th.
here,the court comment was not an instruction on the law,but part of larger directions on how to correct an inconsistency in the verdict form.construed,as it must be,in light of the specific questions and findings on the verdict form to which it referred,as well as the other relevant jury instructions insulation highlands ins.th,jury instructions must be construed as a whole,the challenged statement was correct.
the inconsistency in the verdict was the same for the hospital and the verdict reflected findings,in response to specific questions,that the individual negligence of the hospital and the leungs was not a substantial factor in causing aidan injury,but also,in response to question,contained an allocation for each of them of a percentage of the total negligence that was the cause of aidan harm.the court first correctly informed the jury of the inconsistency in the verdict form regarding the hospital and correctly stated the resolution if the hospital negligence was not a substantial factor in causing aidan injury,then the hospital allocation of negligence in question should be zero if the hospital negligence was a substantial factor,then the answer to question,which asked whether the hospital negligence was a substantial factor in causing aidan injury,should be yes.
having neglected to mention the inconsistency in the verdict form as to the leungs,the court almost immediately sought to clarify by having the jury return and stating that the jury need ed to do this referring to appropriately correcting the responses in the verdict form on either causation or allocation of negligence not only with respect to the hospital but with respect to and leung as well.the court continued if you have found that a party negligence was not a substantial factor,then the responsibility for the negligence referring to question,which asked for an allocation of the total negligence that caused aidan injury should be zero.if you find,however,that there is some fault to be attributed to them referring to a finding under question that they shared a percentage of the total negligence that caused aidan harm,then you have to find they were a substantial factor in causing the harm.the jury had been correctly instructed at the close of the case pursuant to caci on the definition of causation,and pursuant to caci that it must assign percentages of responsibility to any person listed on the verdict form whose negligence or other fault was a substantial factor in causing aidan leung harm.
thus,in context,the challenged statement was simply a shorthand way of communicating that before assigning a percentage of the total negligence that caused aidan brain damage to an actor listed in question or,as the court said,if you find some fault to be attributed to them,then the jury first had to find the actor negligence to be a substantial factor in causing aidan brain damage or,as the court said,then you have to find they were a substantial factor in causing the harm.the court did not misstate the law on causation,but rather correctly directed the jury on how to resolve the inconsistencies in the completed verdict form.at worst,the court direction was incomplete or lacked clarity.to preserve any claim of error,the hospital was obligated to object its failure to do so forfeits its contention.lund,supra,cal th at.
in any event,on much the same reasoning,even if we were to construe the challenged comment as an incorrect statement of the law,it is not reasonably probable that a different result would have been reached in the absence of the error.soule general motors cal th.the hospital interpretation of the court if the jury found any fault it must find based on isolating it from the entire record of which it is a part.that the hospital counsel did not seek to clarify the point strongly suggests what is otherwise apparent in light of the entirety of the relevant record especially the specific questions and findings on the completed verdict form to which the comments were directed,no one,the jury included,would have reasonably understood the court comments to eviscerate the concept of causation on which the jury had earlier been instructed.
polling the jury 
background 
following the court directions on how to correct the inconsistencies in the verdict findings,the jury retired,and then returned again with a verdict.the verdict form contained the same responses as before,except that now it answered yes to whether the negligence of the hospital and the leungs were substantial factors in causing aidan harm.the court stated,okay.it appears to be correct this time.the clerk then read the verdict.
the hospital asked that the jury be polled.when the clerk polled the first jurors with respect to the yes answer to question whether the hospital negligence was a substantial factor in causing harm to aidan,seven jurors answered yes,and jurors including juror answered no.when it was juror turn to answer,the juror asked,is this the hospital juror interjected that it was.juror then responded,yes.the court,also attempting to clarify,stated,okay.this is substantial factor,question.juror then said,no.
at that response,the court stated,okay.then you do have a verdict,ladies and gentlemen.juror then stated,i sorry.yes.
the court then had the clerk ask the question again,beginning with juror,and urged all the jurors to pay attention.when the clerk asked the question again whether the hospital negligence was a substantial factor in causing aidan harm,juror answered yes,but then juror answered no.the court noted y ou still do have a verdict then.there are still four no juror,juror,juror and juror.juror then responded,i was a yes.i apologize for that.on inquiry by the court,the juror stated again,is a yes.
the court had the entire panel polled again.this time,nine jurors,including juror and,answered yes when asked whether their verdict was that the hospital negligence was a substantial factor in causing aidan harm.the same nine jurors answered affirmatively on the remaining polling questions,thus confirming the special verdict.
discussion 
pointing to the lengthy and contentious deliberations,the hospital contends that the court singled out the no votes,thus signaling that they were holding up a verdict and coercing juror and into changing their votes.the hospital asserts that the court should have sent the jurors out for further deliberations.code civ,if upon inquiry or polling,more than of the jurors disagree thereto,the jury must be sent out again,but if no disagreement is expressed,the verdict is complete and the jury discharged from the case.
by failing to object to the court comments and to the polling procedure,the hospital has forfeited its contention.any challenge to the verdict based on the polling must be asserted before the jury is discharged if the purported defect is apparent and could be corrected,or else the challenge is forfeited.bell bayerische motoren werke aktiengesellschaft th,see keener,cal th,henrioulle marin ventures,cal d.the hospital contends that the purported error could not have been cured.but even in the hospital telling,the court comments were only inferentially coercive.as we have noted,the court simply identified the no votes by juror number,a fact already apparent to the other jurors from the polling itself.any suggestion that the court comment was coercive could have been cured by an objection before any further polling,a clarifying admonition from the court,a reiteration of the duty of each juror to decide the case for herself,and a direction to retire to deliberate so as to confirm how each juror voted on each question.the contentiousness of prior deliberations did not obviate the curative effect of such a course.
in its reply brief,the hospital contends that further deliberations would have resulted in greater pressure on the dissenting jurors to change their votes.however,further deliberations,as the hospital noted in its opening brief,was precisely what section provided for the section states that i f upon inquiry or polling,more than of the jurors disagree thereto,the jury must be sent out again.we conclude that the hospital has forfeited its contention that the verdict is invalid because juror and were coerced into changing their votes.
even if the hospital had not forfeited the contention,we would find no coercion in the court comments.the record shows that initial confusion in responding to the polling,not coercion,was at work.juror was confused about the question,asking,is this the hospital and answering yes,then no,then apologizing and answering yes again.similarly,juror explained,i was a yes.i apologize for that,and on immediate inquiry by the court,stated again,is a yes.in response to further formal polling,juror and reiterated their yes responses.nothing in this record suggests that the jurors comments indicating initial confusion and their subsequent confirming of their yes votes in response to renewed polling should not be taken at face value.the hospital contention that the jurors were coerced is purely speculative.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed insofar as it imposed joint and several liability on the hospital for aidan economic damages,and affirmed insofar as it imposed several liability on the hospital for aidan noneconomic damages.otherwise,the judgment is affirmed.aidan is dismissed as moot.each side shall bear its own costs.

because we reverse the judgment as to the hospital joint and several liability for aidan economic damages,we do not address the hospital issues related to that portion of the damage award.those contentions are that the court erred in excluding evidence of future insurance coverage,in awarding and calculating prejudgment interest on future periodic payments,and in requiring the hospital to provide security for the periodic payments filed a contending that the trial court erred in permitting the hospital to purchase an annuity payable to the hospital as security for its future damage payments.because we reverse the judgment against the hospital for aidan economic damages,aidan is moot.because we reverse the judgment as to the hospital joint and several liability for aidan economic damages,we do not address the hospital issues related to that portion of the damage award.those contentions are that the court erred in excluding evidence of future insurance coverage,in awarding and calculating prejudgment interest on future periodic payments,and in requiring the hospital to provide security for the periodic payments filed a contending that the trial court erred in permitting the hospital to purchase an annuity payable to the hospital as security for its future damage payments.because we reverse the judgment against the hospital for aidan economic damages,aidan is moot.
the section on jaundice stated in relevant part jaundice is a common condition in newborn infants physiologic or normal jaundice usually appears on the second or third day of life in healthy babies it often disappears within a week.about of babies get physiologic jaundice.in premature babies,it is even more likely to develop.about of infants born prematurely will have jaundice during the first week of life.it may last longer in these infants,becoming most noticeable between the fourth and seventh days of life.in most instances,jaundice is so mild that it can be ignored.it will usually disappear without treatment.however,if the condition is more severe,or if the jaundice is present at birth or appears during the first hours of life,treatment most likely will be necessary.the section discussed the major cause of jaundice the of bilirubin and the relationship between frequent breast feedings and the expulsion of bilirubin in the stool.in terms of risk factors,it mentioned only that t he level at which jaundice may be dangerous depends on many factors your baby age,whether he was or premature,and whether he has other medical conditions.when the bilirubin level becomes too high,jaundice can be dangerous to your baby developing nervous system.this happens very rarely.if your doctor is concerned that your baby may have serious jaundice,a very small sample of your baby blood will be taken to measure the bilirubin to see if it is close to a dangerous level.the section discussed treatment phototherapy and exchange transfusion and advised if your baby has jaundice,you undoubtedly will want additional information about its cause and treatment.the baby doctor or nurse can answer your questions about your infant condition.in another section,the manual advised that jaundice often appears or gets worse on the third or fourth day.call your baby care provider if jaundice does clear up in a few days.it also stated that y our baby head and face may be bruised or red from the birth.this will heal in a few days and is not dangerous to your baby.the section on jaundice stated in relevant part jaundice is a common condition in newborn infants physiologic or normal jaundice usually appears on the second or third day of life in healthy babies it often disappears within a week.about of babies get physiologic jaundice.in premature babies,it is even more likely to develop.about of infants born prematurely will have jaundice during the first week of life.it may last longer in these infants,becoming most noticeable between the fourth and seventh days of life.in most instances,jaundice is so mild that it can be ignored.it will usually disappear without treatment.however,if the condition is more severe,or if the jaundice is present at birth or appears during the first hours of life,treatment most likely will be necessary.the section discussed the major cause of jaundice the of bilirubin and the relationship between frequent breast feedings and the expulsion of bilirubin in the stool.in terms of risk factors,it mentioned only that t he level at which jaundice may be dangerous depends on many factors your baby age,whether he was or premature,and whether he has other medical conditions.when the bilirubin level becomes too high,jaundice can be dangerous to your baby developing nervous system.this happens very rarely.if your doctor is concerned that your baby may have serious jaundice,a very small sample of your baby blood will be taken to measure the bilirubin to see if it is close to a dangerous level.the section discussed treatment phototherapy and exchange transfusion and advised if your baby has jaundice,you undoubtedly will want additional information about its cause and treatment.the baby doctor or nurse can answer your questions about your infant condition.in another section,the manual advised that jaundice often appears or gets worse on the third or fourth day.call your baby care provider if jaundice does clear up in a few days.it also stated that y our baby head and face may be bruised or red from the birth.this will heal in a few days and is not dangerous to your baby.
nishibayashi was called as a plaintiff witness,and was examined by plaintiff counsel.nishibayashi counsel later interrupted his examination technically,so as to allow plaintiff to take other witnesses out of order,and did not resume until after plaintiff rested.although some of nishibayashi testimony thus occurred in nishibayashi defense case,our summary does not make that distinction.nishibayashi was called as a plaintiff witness,and was examined by plaintiff counsel.nishibayashi counsel later interrupted his examination technically,so as to allow plaintiff to take other witnesses out of order,and did not resume until after plaintiff rested.although some of nishibayashi testimony thus occurred in nishibayashi defense case,our summary does not make that distinction.

testimony by two attending nurses also confirmed the absence of any specific procedure to reduce the risk of kernicterus.cathy werner,a staff nurse in the hospital perinatal unit,assisted in aidan delivery and was the first nurse to assess his condition.she testified that she provided some instruction to nancy leung on breast feeding the first time she nursed,but aidan was not interested.she gave no other instruction.she had never seen alert and was not aware of its content.she was,however,aware of risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia,and had warned parents about those factors and jaundice many times in the past,because she considered it part of her job in providing patient safety as a mcbroom,one of the nurses who attended to aidan and nancy leung in the newborn nursery department,knew some of the risk factors for severe asian descent among other races,bruising,trouble breast feeding,and premature birth.although she did not remember aidan,nothing in his chart suggested that she discussed the risk of jaundice or kernicterus with the leungs.part of her job responsibility was to warn of that increased risk and recommend increased vigilance,but aidan appeared healthy and was not jaundiced at discharge and thus she found no need to give specific advice on jaundice or kernicterus.testimony by two attending nurses also confirmed the absence of any specific procedure to reduce the risk of kernicterus.cathy werner,a staff nurse in the hospital perinatal unit,assisted in aidan delivery and was the first nurse to assess his condition.she testified that she provided some instruction to nancy leung on breast feeding the first time she nursed,but aidan was not interested.she gave no other instruction.she had never seen alert and was not aware of its content.she was,however,aware of risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia,and had warned parents about those factors and jaundice many times in the past,because she considered it part of her job in providing patient safety as a mcbroom,one of the nurses who attended to aidan and nancy leung in the newborn nursery department,knew some of the risk factors for severe asian descent among other races,bruising,trouble breast feeding,and premature birth.although she did not remember aidan,nothing in his chart suggested that she discussed the risk of jaundice or kernicterus with the leungs.part of her job responsibility was to warn of that increased risk and recommend increased vigilance,but aidan appeared healthy and was not jaundiced at discharge and thus she found no need to give specific advice on jaundice or kernicterus.
using a standard classification system to assess newborn maturity based on a physical examination,the nursing staff estimated aidan gestational age at weeks.however,bhutani testified that in assessing the risk of hyperbilirubinemia,standard practice required assuming that aidan was at the younger gestational age,because you want to give the benefit of doubt to the baby w e want to be more vigilant than less vigilant.using a standard classification system to assess newborn maturity based on a physical examination,the nursing staff estimated aidan gestational age at weeks.however,bhutani testified that in assessing the risk of hyperbilirubinemia,standard practice required assuming that aidan was at the younger gestational age,because you want to give the benefit of doubt to the baby w e want to be more vigilant than less vigilant.

at times,bhutani testimony whether treatment as of thursday would have prevented aidan brain damage was confusing.as we read the record,the confusion lay primarily in bhutani frequent failure to respond to the precise question asked,in his insistence that prevention not treatment of hyperbilirubinemia is preferred,and in his refusal to state which specific treatment option continued breast feeding,phototherapy,or exchange transfusion should have been used because a specific bilirubin reading was not direct examination,plaintiff counsel asked if phototherapy on thursday and friday would have prevented aidan brain damage.bhutani answered somewhat if aidan had gotten enough to eat,that would have been a first step then,if the bilirubin had been measured as an outpatient,if the baby had a progression of jaundice and then on that basis was deemed to have needed lights,that would have prevented his hyperbilirubin level going to.later,on by the attorneys for nishibayashi and the hospital,he gave the following whether he believed,if aidan had been seen on thursday,we would be here today,bhutani testified,h opefully not.depends on what the bilirubin level was on that day.he acknowledged that the level was not known because no test was,when asked,is it true that on thursday it is more probable than not that the child could have been cured bhutani replied in a lengthy,ultimately way t hat would kind of fly against the data that we have in the bilirubin normalgram that bilirubin values are rising fairly linearly,steadily,progressively,for the first hours and then they flatten out and then they remain elevated unless the liver matures and then starts to get rid of the jaundice.clearly on sunday the baby liver was not mature in getting rid of the jaundice.and so more likely than not the bilirubin was elevated on thursday,friday,saturday and reached the level of on sunday.the question really is as to what that number is.and without a measurement we can only guess at the level because no test was whether,if hyperbilirubinemia was present on thursday,it was still treatable,bhutani again answered that on monday,tuesday,wednesday the baby was also probably hyperbilirubinemic.and if one counts as feeding and giving enough milk to the baby as treatment rather than prevention,it a question of what you preventing and what you treating.if i treating hyperbilirubinemia,then feeding and phototherapy are the treatments.if i talking about acute bilirubinencephalopathy or brain damage,then exchange transfer is the treatment.so we need to get our definitions straight because they have different connotations for different parts of the illness.asked whether nishibayashi would have recognized on thursday that aidan needed to be treated,bhutani emphasized prevention and not treatment going from the now that we have the hindsight that we know where the baby was with the bilirubinemia value of and working our way back,we came down to thursday when the mother did make the communication with the pediatrician and we came back to wednesday,so it gets us to the same position and we start prospectively where the baby is being discharged.since we do know what the future is going to be,the key part of that is for the baby to be seen on the age three to five days.and if the risk factors are present,to see the baby earlier rather than later,and may even require more than one visit.asked if it was his opinion that on thursday aidan could have been diagnosed and cured,bhutani testified again,i think you making multiple jumps because it depends on getting the bilirubin value,then reacting to the bilirubin value,and it depends on what the bilirubin value was.if the bilirubin value was already very high,then there would have been a different response to a hyperbilirubin value of.despite these somewhat rambling and answers,when he focused on specific questions his testimony became clear that he believed aidan hyperbilirubinemia would have been successfully treated at a thursday examination.when asked to focus on severe hyperbilirubinemia,the condition he believed aidan had on thursday when the leungs called nishibayashi office,he testified that severe hyperbilirubinemia is preventable and treatable,and when timely treated may prevent brain damage more likely than not.when asked specifically whether,had aidan been seen on thursday,there would have been a recognition of a need for further testing,there would have been a finding that,in fact,he had a high level of bilirubin and he needed
