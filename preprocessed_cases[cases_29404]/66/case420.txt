john church sued his former employer for breach of contract,misrepresentation,and various labor code violations.we will call that lawsuit,which is not on appeal here,the employment case.the superior court in that case sustained a demurrer to the labor code claims on the ground they were barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
subsequently,church brought a second action,which is the subject of the current appeal and which we will call the malpractice case.it is a suit for legal malpractice against the attorney who filed the lawsuit in the employment case,respondents daniel jamison and the law offices of daniel jamison church alleged jamison failure to file the complaint in the employment case sooner resulted in labor code claims being.jamison filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in the malpractice case on the ground that he did not commit malpractice in the employment case because the labor code claims were either before he was retained or,alternatively,were not when he filed the complaint in that case.the latter of these alternate arguments directly contradicts the superior court order sustaining the employer demurrer to the labor code claims in the employment case.
in the malpractice case,the superior court granted jamison motion for judgment on the pleadings based on its conclusion that jamison could not be held liable for legal malpractice because he had timely filed the complaint in the employment case.thus,the superior court judge in the malpractice case disagreed with the superior court judge in the employment case.church appeals the judgment in favor of jamison in the malpractice case.the employment case is still pending,on the remaining claims of breach of contract and misrepresentation.the defendants in that case,keith wilcox and wilcox,hokokian jackson,have appeared here as amici curiae.
the judgment is reversed.we publish that portion of this opinion that addresses vested vacation because our analysis conflicts with the analysis adopted in sequeira insectaries,th,d sequeira and the position taken by california division of labor standards enforcement dlse regarding a application of the statute of limitations.
summary of issues and conclusions 
facts and proceedings 
the facts stated here were taken from the pleadings in the malpractice case and documents subject to judicial notice,such as the pleadings and other documents filed in the employment case.
church discussed the prospects of working for wilcox,hokokian jackson whj,an accountancy corporation that maintains its principal place of business in fresno county.church alleges that keith wilcox and rick jackson represented to him that,if he moved from south carolina to fresno,he would be employed by whj on the following terms compensation at a rate of per month,termination only for good cause,bonuses based on production,and at the conclusion of one year of employment he would unconditionally become a shareholder in the corporation and share in its profits.in addition,church and the corporation agreed that his compensation for the first year of employment would be deferred and considered his into whj,which would be considered paid at the end of his first year of employment.if church did not want to purchase an ownership interest at the end of his first year,he would then be paid an amount equal to his salary for the first year.
based on these and other terms,church was employed by whj from may,through may,to provide auditing and health care consultancy services.in may,church and whj failed to reach an agreement for his purchase of an ownership interest in the corporation.instead,they made a second oral agreement.this second agreement provided that the deferred compensation from the first year would be treated as church purchase of an ownership interest in whj in may,the parties would agree to the final terms of church by the end of may with the deferred compensation being applied to the purchase price,church would immediately be paid the deferred compensation if no agreement was then reached on his purchase of an ownership interest in whj,and church salary for his second year would be paid on a monthly basis.
in may,the parties again failed to reach an agreement on the terms of church purchase of an ownership interest and they agreed the deferred compensation would be paid in june.church demanded payment in june,but whj did not pay him.church alleges that whj has still not paid him for his first year of work.
on august,church retained jamison to act as his lawyer and represent his interests in his dispute with whj.on april,jamison filed a complaint for church and against whj in the fresno superior court.slightly more than two months later,jamison executed a substitution of attorney form which ended his representation of church in the employment case against whj.
on july,new attorneys representing church filed a first amended complaint in the employment case.they filed a second amended complaint two months later,and the superior court sustained a demurrer to the second amended complaint with leave to amend.the attorneys filed a third amended complaint against breach of contract,intentional misrepresentation,negligent misrepresentation,labor code violations,and unjust december.whj filed another demurrer and the hearing was set for april.
the tentative ruling stated that the general demurrer to the labor code claims on the grounds they were untimely would be overruled because church allegations were sufficient to raise the possibility that whj was estopped from raising the statute of limitations as a defense.in addition,the tentative ruling stated that the general demurrer to the count containing the labor code violations would be sustained with leave to amend so that church could allege whether he resigned or was discharged.see,discharged employee shall be paid final wages within hours,when final wages are due to employee who resigns.
after hearing argument,however,the superior court changed its tentative ruling and on april,sustained the general demurrer to the claims included in the fourth and fifth counts of the third amended complaint without leave to amend on the basis that the cause of action is barred by the applicable statute of limitations.
on april,less than one year after the general demurrer to church claims under the labor code in the employment case was sustained,church filed a complaint for legal malpractice against jamison.the malpractice complaint alleged that,had jamison exercised proper care and skill in the lawsuit against whj,church would have been able to recover from wilcox for violations of the labor code including,but not necessarily limited to,reimbursement for business expenses required by labor code,failure and refusal to pay church when his wages became due and payable under labor code,interest on all due and unpayable sic wages under labor code,waiting time penalties under labor code and attorney fees pursuant to labor code.
jamison responded to the malpractice complaint by filing a demurrer on the ground that the action against him was not brought within the period of limitations contained in code of civil procedure section.specifically,jamison argued that church should have discovered jamison malpractice,allegedly based on the failure to timely file the labor code claims,when whj filed any one of its three demurrers that raised the statute of limitations defense.jamison also argued that church suffered actual injury,for purposes of church legal malpractice claim,as soon as church incurred attorney fees contesting the demurrers of whj that raised the statute of limitations defense in the employment case.
in october,the superior court overruled the demurrer filed by jamison to the malpractice complaint and stated,it is simply too early to decide that church claims are.the superior court was unwilling to draw factual inferences about what church knew or should have known and when he actually incurred attorney fees.
jamison answered church first amended complaint for malpractice and breach of contract.on december,jamison filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings in which he asserted that he could not have committed malpractice because the statute of limitations applicable to church labor code claims had either expired before his representation started or,alternatively,had not yet expired before he filed the complaint against whj.expressly disagreeing with the rulings made in whj favor on whj demurrer in the employment case,the superior court in the malpractice case granted jamison motion for judgment on the pleadings.
church appealed in the malpractice case,which appeal we currently consider.trial of the remaining claims by church against whj,in the employment case,remains pending.
discussion 
vii.payment for vested vacation 
facts and contentions 
church malpractice claim relating to his labor code cause of action for unused vested vacation time is less factually complicated than the other labor code claims.in short,church asserts that he earned vacation during his first year of employment with whj,he did not use that vacation time,and whj did not pay him for his unused vacation time after he stopped working.
specifically,church third amended complaint in the employment case alleged that,as of may,church had accrued days of paid time off pursuant to whj employment policies at the rate of per hour which he had not taken.as a result,church is now due and owing vacation pay in the amount of.church initial complaint in the employment case alleged his employment with whj continued until may.
church claim for unused vested vacation was eliminated from the employment case by the april,order of the superior court that sustained whj demurrer to his labor code causes of action on statute of limitations grounds.in the legal malpractice action,church alleges that jamison negligence resulted in the loss of his claim for vested vacation.
jamison contends that he filed church claim for vested vacation in a timely manner and,therefore,the superior court erroneous ruling was the sole cause of church loss of that claim.as a result,jamison concludes,church can not state a cause of action for legal malpractice regarding church claim for vacation pay.
legal issues 
an employee right to be paid for vacation time that has not been used when the employment ends is addressed by labor code section,which provides in full 
unless otherwise provided by a agreement,whenever a contract of employment or employer policy provides for paid vacations,and an employee is terminated without having taken off his vested vacation time,all vested vacation shall be paid to him as wages at his final rate in accordance with such contract of employment or employer policy respecting eligibility or time served provided,however,that an employment contract or employer policy shall not provide for forfeiture of vested vacation time upon termination.the labor commissioner or a designated representative,in the resolution of any dispute with regard to vested vacation time,shall apply the principles of equity and fairness.italics added.
the text of labor code section provides the basis for answering the legal question crucial to church malpractice did his statutory claim to be paid for unused vested vacation time accrue for statute of limitations purposes.
accrual date of claim under labor code section 
under labor code section,an employee has the right to be paid for unused vacation only after the employee is terminated without having taken off his vested vacation time.thus,termination of employment is the event that converts the employer obligation to allow an employee to take vacation from work into the monetary obligation to pay that employee for unused vested vacation time.consequently,church cause of action to enforce his statutory right to be paid for vested vacation did not accrue until the date his employment was terminated.had church filed a cause of action seeking payment for unused vested vacation before his employment with whj ended,that cause of action would have been dismissed as premature.code civ,civil actions can only be commenced within the applicable period after the cause of action shall have accrued.
church alleged that his employment with whj continued until may.therefore,we conclude that his cause of action seeking payment for unused vested vacation did not accrue and could not have been filed in court any earlier than may.
applicable statute of limitations 
there are three statutes of limitations that might apply to a claim by a former employee seeking payment for unused vested vacation because the claim could be characterized as one based on an oral employment contract,a written employment contract,or a liability created by statute.a limitations period applies to oral contract claims.code civ,subd.a limitations period applies to claims based on written contracts,subd.a limitations period applies to an action upon a liability created by statute,subd.a.
in the employment case,jamison filed the complaint against whj on april,which is less than one year after church employment was terminated on may.consequently,the complaint was filed within all of the potentially applicable limitation periods and we need not decide which period applies.
limitation on right to payment for vested vacation 
background on the dlse interpretation 
amici curiae urge us to conclude that church right under labor code section to be paid for all vested vacation at his final rate in accordance with such contract of employment or employer policy respecting eligibility or time served is limited by a second application of the statute of which applies the limitations period in reverse to limit the years for which vested vacation must be paid upon termination.church disagrees,as do we 
in sequeira,supra,th,d,a terminated employee filed an application with the california labor commissioner seeking payment for all unused vacation time that had accumulated over the years he had worked for his former employer.id.at,d.the labor commissioner limited the award to the employee to payment for unused vacation earned but not taken within the four years prior to his termination.this limit was based on the position that a claim for vacation time earned prior to that period was barred by the statute of limitations applicable to written contracts.ibid.the trial court and the appellate court agreed that the employee was barred from recovering for unused vacation that had vested more than four years before his termination.
the appellate court rationale for limiting the employee recovery to the last four years of his years of employment was based on deference to the position taken by the dlse in interpretive bulletin.sequeira,supra,th at,d.in that bulletin,the dlse concluded that the statute of limitations begins to run as the vacation is earned or at the point when the employee is eligible to take the vacation because the employee can take an affirmative step to enforce his or her right to the vacation by simply using it.id.at,d.the sequeira court stated the dlse interpretation of the labor code and its conclusions regarding the application of the statute of limitations were entitled to great weight and would be disregarded only if clearly unreasonable.sequeira,at,d.
after the decision in sequeira,however,the california supreme court decided tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d,tidewater and morillion royal packing cal th,d,morillion,which address the weight that courts should give certain interpretations by the dlse.
in tidewater,the court concluded that the dlse interpretative policies contained in its manual were regulations and,as such,were void because they were not promulgated in accordance with the administrative procedure act,et.tidewater,supra,cal th at,d.in morillion,the court noted that it had repeatedly rejected the argument that courts should give deference to interpretative policies of the dlse.morillion,supra,cal th at,d.
in accordance with tidewater and morillion,we will give no weight to the interpretations that may be implied from section of the enforcement policies and interpretations manual of the dlse which states 
statute of limitations.the statute of limitations for recovery of vacation pay claims is two years from the time of termination on an oral contract and four years on a written contract.the california courts in sequeira,supra,th,d adopted the view of the dlse in this regard.see,written before the sequeira case was decided.
specifically,to the extent that section of the enforcement policies and interpretations manual implies that the dlse still takes the position that a two or period should be used to measure backward from the employee termination date to determine how much unused vacation must be paid,we give no weight to that position.further,because the portion of the opinion in sequeira that gave great weight to the dlse interpretive bulletin is inconsistent with the principles set forth in tidewater and morillion,the sequeira court conclusion that the statute of limitations applies in reverse to limit an employee recovery for unused vacation time no longer stands on firm ground.
in addition,the context and circumstances that produced the dlse creation of a period detract from its convincing effect.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d,recognizing the situational nature of an agency legal opinion regarding the interpretation of a statute and that the interpretation may sometimes be of little worth.first,the dlse expertise does not extend to provisions in the code of civil procedure that control the application of statutes of limitation second,the dlse analysis never mentioned the requirement in code of civil procedure section that a claim can not be commenced before it accrues and starts the limitations period running.in short,the dlse was not operating in its area of expertise and did not consider all of the relevant rules of law.
accordingly,we will decide the issue anew based on the language of labor code section and the fundamental principles of law that govern the application of statutes of limitations.
construing labor code section 
labor code section states that all vested vacation shall be paid to a terminated employee as wages the use of the words shall and all in this phrase is not ambiguous.shall is mandatory.all is a word of inclusion,not exclusion.in dalton baldwin d,the court addressed a statute use of the word all as follows to us the word all means not only any right,or every right,but the entire inclusiveness of the word excludes no right whatever.accord,daniels mcmahon th,fn,d lamar city council of so.d,ordinance used all to mean the whole of or the greatest quantity.
based on the plain and ordinary meaning of the statutory language,labor code section can not be interpreted to exclude unused vacation that vested more than two or four years before the employee was terminated from the unused vacation time for which a terminated employee must be paid.pratt vencor,th,d plain meaning of unambiguous statute governs.neither is that plain and ordinary meaning overcome by the supreme court opinion in suastez plastic cal d,which was cited in sequeira.sequeira,supra,th at,d.suastez addressed the subject of vesting,a subject entirely different from that which we address here.finally,we reject the notion that administrative inconvenience can be a basis for ignoring the plain and ordinary meaning of labor code section.sequeira,supra,at,d the dlse explained that unless the statute of limitations were applied,w e would be required to review the entire employment history of the person to determine if any vacation was owed.
because labor code section can not itself be the source of a period that limits the right to recover for unused vested vacation,we next consider whether such a period can be derived from the principles of law governing the application of statutes of limitations.
dual application of statute of limitations 
the dlse interpretive bulletin states that the obligation to use vacation arises as it is earned so the statute of limitations is running sequeira,supra,th at,d.based on this position,the dlse applied the statute of limitations twice once at the outset of the review of the claim to limit the time within which the claim may be brought after termination,and again to limit the from the date of termination liability of the employer exists.both applications of the statute of limitations are to be based on whether the vacation contract or policy involved was written or oral,two years or fours sic years.dlse opinion letter.
this unusual dual application of a statute of limitations is troubling for a number of reasons.first,aside from sequeira,the parties have not cited and we have not located any other cases in which a court has adopted this unusual dual application of a statute of limitations.the approach was without precedent when the dlse adopted it.
second,it is based on the idea that an employee has the obligation to use vacation the source of this obligation is not identified.the obligation does not exist at common law,and it is not expressly created by the labor code.neither have the parties identified any statutory language from which it may be implied.finally,the source of the purported obligation to use vacation time can not be contractual.if it were contractual,presumably the terms of the contract,which could vary from one relationship to another,would control the specific details of the obligation.for example,an employer might choose to offer employment contracts or institute a policy that gives its employees the right to defer taking vacation for as long as they like this flexibility in contracting and employment policies leads to the conclusion that the purported obligation to use vacation time is not included in all employment contracts as either a matter of law or of fact.in sum,we are unconvinced that all california employees who earn vacation time are subject to an obligation to take vacation.see bonn california state university,chico d.public employer may not direct employee to expend accumulated vacation.
third,the dlse dual application of the statute of limitations is based on the erroneous premise that the statute of limitations begins to run when the employee earns the vacation benefit.california principles governing when a statute of limitations commences preclude this court from agreeing with the dlse position.one fundamental principle is that a statute of limitations begins to run only when the cause of action has accrued and not before.code civ.a second fundamental principle is that generally the accrual of a cause of action sets the date as the time when,under the substantive law,the wrongful act is done,or the wrongful result occurs,and the consequent liability arises.citation.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.this date also can be described as when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements citations davies krasna cal d,the limitations period can not run before plaintiff possesses a true cause of action.yet an employee earning a vested vacation benefit is not the event that completes a cause of action in all of its is not the wrongful act from which liability arises.
because the dlse period is based on the statute of limitations applicable to contracts,we will use a contractual theory of liability to analyze the dlse premise that the statute of limitations begins to run when vacation is earned.under a contractual theory of liability,the wrong that is an essential element of the claim is the defendant breach.armstrong petroleum oil gas th,fn,d careau security pacific business credit,d.as a result,a breach of contract claim does not accrue until there has been a breach of the contract.in the context of an employee earning vacation,that earning of not create a breach of contract by the employer or the employee.therefore,no claim accrues and no statute begins to run at the time vacation is earned.in other words,if an employee filed a civil action for breach of contract on the day vacation was earned,code of civil procedure section would require that the action be dismissed as premature 
in summary,a cause of action for breach of contract accrues for statute of limitations purposes only after there has been a breach of the contract,the point at which vacation time is earned can not be equated to a breach of contract and,therefore,the statute of limitations applicable to contracts does not begin to run when vacation time is earned.accordingly,we conclude that the statute of limi
