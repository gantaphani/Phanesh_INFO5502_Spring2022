nurit avivi appeals the trial court grant of summary judgment in her malpractice claim against respondents centro medico urgente medical center and edward rubin.she argues that her expert witness was qualified to provide an opinion about the standard of care to which respondents were held and that the expert declaration,if admitted,would have established a triable issue of fact.the trial court excluded the declaration because the expert did not say he was familiar with the standard of care in southern california.we conclude that the appropriate test for expert qualification in ordinary medical malpractice actions is whether the expert is familiar with circumstances similar to those of the respondents familiarity with the standard of care in the particular community where the alleged malpractice occurred,while relevant,is generally not requisite,and is not in this case.because appellant expert disclosed sufficient familiarity with similar circumstances to entitle a jury to hear his opinion,we reverse and remand with directions that the trial court deny summary judgment.
factual and procedural history 
on september,while visiting the united states from israel,appellant injured her right hand and arm in a fall.at respondent medical center,physician assistants nonphysicians set her arm in a splint and gave her pain medication.she returned to respondents for examinations on september and september.at these examinations,she complained about continued pain and swelling.the physician assistants gave her additional pain medication and instructed her to keep wearing the splint.
after she returned to israel,appellant had her arm examined by an orthopedist,arieh arielli,on september.arielli observed that the fingers on her right hand were blue,cold and stiff.he concluded that respondents splint restricted the blood circulation in her right arm because it had been applied too tightly.he removed the splint and replaced it with a full cast.on december,arielli diagnosed appellant with a number of permanent injuries from the splinting of her arm.
on september,appellant brought a medical malpractice action against respondents.respondents moved for summary judgment on april.in support,respondents submitted the declaration of charles lane,a surgeon who had practiced and taught hand surgery in the los angeles area for several years.according to lane,respondents treatment of appellant was reasonable and within the standard of care in the local medical community.
in opposition,appellant submitted the declaration of arielli.arielli stated he had treated thousands of fractures during his career,and had spoken with american doctors and reviewed american publications regarding the treatment of fractures in the united states.however,arielli did not explicitly state that he was familiar with the local standard of medical care in the community where respondents treated appellant,and respondents objected to his declaration on that ground.
at the hearing on the summary judgment motion,the trial court ruled that arielli opinion was not admissible because arielli was not familiar with the standard of care in southern california.because arielli was the only expert declaration appellant offered to dispute lane declaration,the trial court ruled appellant had failed to show the existence of a triable issue of fact as to respondents negligence and granted summary judgment.this is a timely appeal from the entry of judgment.

the trial court excluded arielli declaration because he did not demonstrate familiarity with the standard of care in southern california.the relevance of geographic location to expert qualification in medical malpractice cases has evolved over time.several supreme court decisions from the first half of the century mention location either in their formulation of the standard of care or in their summary of the requirements an expert must meet in order to testify about the standard of care.see mccurdy hatfield cal d,lawless calaway cal d,trindle wheeler cal d,lewis johnson cal d,hesler california hospital cal.
