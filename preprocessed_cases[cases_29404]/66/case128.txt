samuel cleveland,through his provisional curator,bobbie jean cleveland cleveland,appeals the district court ruling in favor of the united states on claims of medical malpractice,brought under the federal tort claims act ftca,et cleveland challenges certain evidentiary rulings and the district court final determination that she failed to prove that the defendant conduct fell below the requisite standard of care.
samuel sought admission to the emergency room at the bayne jones army community hospital bjach,presenting with symptoms,a slightly elevated respiration rate,and a medical history of diabetes.samuel was first seen by a triage nurse,who took his medical history and classified him as a category four,a low priority patient.samuel did not indicate that he had a prior history of serious medical conditions,including congestive heart failure,hypertension,and other chronic conditions,nor did he state that he was currently taking medications.physician assistant george eubanks eubanks then examined samuel and concluded that he did not need a chest or other further tests.eubanks diagnosed samuel with an upper respiratory infection,bronchitis,and sinusitis,and prescribed a variety of medications entex,proventil,and zithromax.he then discharged him.
during the time samuel was in the emergency room,eubanks did not consult with an attending physician.furthermore,eubanks did not review samuel medical file,which contained his full medical history,including his prior congestive heart failure,until one hour after his discharge.after receiving and reviewing the file,eubanks did not believe that the file indicated any reason to call samuel back into the er.
two days later,samuel returned to the er.he was diagnosed with pneumonia resulting from congestive heart failure.he eventually went into respiratory and cardiac arrest,became comatose,and remained so until his death several years later.samuel underlying condition of acute congestive heart failure led to his incapacitation and eventual death.
samuel wife brought suit against the united states under the ftca,alleging medical malpractice.cleveland asserts that the employees of the bjach,specifically physician assistant eubanks,failed to meet the requisite standard of care.she alleged that the employees of bjach misinterpreted her husband symptoms and thus misdiagnosed and mistreated the acute onset of congestive heart failure.she contends that had her husband been properly examined and treated when he was initially admitted to the emergency room,the doctors would have determined that he was suffering from acute congestive heart failure and could have prevented his eventual deterioration.to prove this failure,the expert witnesses who testified on cleveland behalf focused on the actions eubanks took when diagnosing samuel.
wanda poret poret,a certified legal nurse consultant,was prepared to testify on cleveland behalf that the bjach employees deviated from the acceptable standard of care by neglecting to take a chest film and failing to diagnose congestive heart failure.in her report,she opined that had samuel been treated for congestive heart failure on his initial visit,his subsequent deterioration could have been prevented.the united states objected to her admission as an expert witness,arguing that,as a nurse,she was not qualified to testify as to the standard of care owed by physician assistant eubanks.the district court excluded her testimony without a written memorandum of reasons for the ruling.
cleveland also proffered testimony by jay piland piland,who treated samuel when he was transferred from the bjach to the intensive care unit icu of rapides regional medical center after he slipped into a coma.piland is an internist who does not currently work in an emergency room setting piland testimony focused on samuel health after he was admitted to the icu and on the medical conditions that resulted in samuel coma.during the course of piland deposition,cleveland attorney,over repeated objections by the united states,questioned whether samuel was given the proper care when initially admitted to the emergency room at bjach.piland opined that when a patient presents with respiratory distress it is important to review a patient full medical history so that the diagnosing physician is aware of any chronic conditions that the patient may have because respiratory distress may signal more significant medical problems,including congestive heart failure.he opined that in light of samuel chronic conditions,which eubanks would have learned from samuel medical records,eubanks should have run further tests when samuel presented with the upper respiratory infection,as his symptoms could have signaled a more serious underlying condition.piland cautioned,however,that in his opinion,further testing would not necessarily have revealed the underlying heart failure.
early in the bench trial,the united states moved to exclude piland expert testimony based on cleveland failure to provide a report prepared by piland pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure a b.the district court denied that motion,concluding that because he was a treating physician,piland was excluded from the written report requirement.after piland gave his deposition testimony,the united states reurged the motion to exclude,arguing that piland was not qualified to testify as to the care and treatment of samuel at the bjach or to the relevant standard of care,as he was an internist and not an emergency room physician.applying daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,the district court concluded that although piland was qualified as an expert in internal medicine,his testimony went beyond the scope of a treating physician and thus did not meet the daubert test for reliability.the district court thus excluded piland testimony as to the standard of care in an emergency room.
joe rankin rankin,an expert in radiology,testified during his deposition about taken of samuel chest upon his second visit to the er.rankin had no role in samuel treatment.he stated that the chest indicated that samuel heart was enlarged and showed evidence of congested vasculature.rankin testified that it was likely,judging from the size of the heart,that it had been enlarged two days before the film was obtained,on the day of samuel initial visit to the er.this condition could have signaled a serious underlying heart condition,such as incipient heart failure.cleveland attorney also asked whether it was customary for a patient with a history of heart conditions to be.rankin answered that though he was not qualified to offer an opinion as to when a physician should order,in his experience people with histories of heart problems are.
cleveland also proffered an expert in internal medicine,carlos cuenca cuenca cuenca reviewed samuel medical records for the purposes of testifying at trial,but had no part in samuel treatment.cuenca opined that when an individual with a history of congestive heart failure presents at the emergency room with an upper respiratory infection,that patient should have a chest,as the respiratory distress could be a signal for further heart problems.cuenca suggested that because eubanks was unaware of samuel full medical history,he failed to treat him adequately.he concluded that more aggressive treatment at the time of samuel initial visit to the emergency room could have prevented the eventual respiratory and cardiac arrest.
during the depositions of both cuenca and rankin,the attorney for the united states objected to questions that focused on the standard of care in an emergency room setting,stating that neither had been admitted as experts in emergency care.no formal ruling as to the testimony of rankin and cuenca was issued by the district court.
in its defense,the united states relied on the testimony of john mcmillan mcmillan,who reviewed samuel medical file in preparation for testifying at trial.mcmillan had practiced emergency medicine for years and was proffered as an expert in that field.he concluded that physician assistant eubanks did not deviate from the standard of care in an emergency room.he gave his opinion that eubanks was correct to conclude that samuel had an upper respiratory infection and treat him only for that condition.he disagreed with cleveland experts opinions that a more extensive should have been done,specifically rejecting the notion that a chest was medically indicated,and concluded that the treatment given samuel for the upper respiratory infection was appropriate.mcmillan also stated that it is not typical for the medical records of patients to be available when treated in an emergency room and that eubanks failure to consult them prior to treating samuel was not a deviation from the standard of care.
after a bench trial,the district court found in favor of the united states.the district court first observed that louisiana law requires that a plaintiff in a medical malpractice suit establish the applicable standard of care,a breach of that standard,and the causal connection between the breach and the injury.the district court further noted that if the relevant area of medicine is considered a specialty,then the expert testimony must be from physicians with expertise in the specialty.the district court concluded that because none of cleveland witnesses were experts in the field of emergency medicine,cleveland had failed to adduce testimony from an expert as to the applicable standard of care or a breach thereof.the district court noted that rankin and cuenca were not experts in the field of emergency medicine and furthermore,did not attempt to establish what the national standard of care was for specialists in the field of emergency medicine.
cleveland appeals,protesting the district court exclusion of the testimony of nurse poret and piland testimony as to the standard of care,as well as the district court decision not to credit the testimony of cuenca and rankin.cleveland also contests the district court ultimate finding that she failed to carry the burden of proof.
the united states is immune from suits save as it consents to be sued.united states mitchell,d.the federal tort claims act constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity.see b.under the act,the united states is liable for the acts of its employees only under circumstances where the united states,if a private person,would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.sanchez rowe,cir internal quotation omitted.here,the bjach is a government entity and thus subject to the waiver of immunity under the ftca.see hayes united states,cir noting that the ftca waiver of sovereign immunity is generally applicable to the bjach.state substantive law applies in suits brought under the ftca,simon united states,cir,and we apply the law of the state in which the suit arises,lucas united states,cir.see also hollis united states,cir under the ftca,liability for medical malpractice is controlled by state law.
under louisiana law,the plaintiff in a medical malpractice suit has the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence 
the degree of knowledge or skill possessed or the degree of care ordinarily exercised by physicians licensed to practice in the state of louisiana and actively practicing in a similar community or locale and under similar circumstances and where the defendant practices in a particular specialty and where the alleged acts of medical negligence raise issues peculiar to the particular medical specialty involved,then the plaintiff has the burden of proving the degree of care ordinarily practiced by physicians within the involved medical specialty.
that the defendant either lacked this degree of knowledge or skill or failed to use reasonable care and diligence,along with his best judgment in the application of that skill.
that as a proximate result of this lack of knowledge or skill or the failure to exercise this degree of care the plaintiff suffered injures that would not otherwise have been incurred.
it is generally necessary to use an expert witness to prove a medical malpractice claim.broussard andersson,so d,see also lindner hoffman,so d,stating the general rule that in order to establish a claim of medical malpractice,the plaintiff must demonstrate the degree of care ordinarily exercised by a physician in a particular medical specialty.importantly,w here the alleged acts of negligence raise issues peculiar to the particular specialty involved,then only physicians in that specialty may offer evidence of the applicable standard of care.id.in other words,to succeed in a medical malpractice claim against a medical specialist,the plaintiff must offer testimony of the applicable standard of care in the particular specialty of the allegedly negligent doctor and the proffered expert must specialize in that peculiar field.
we review the district court decision to exclude expert testimony for an abuse of discretion.united states clements,cir.if we determine that the district court abused its discretion in excluding evidence,this court will not overturn the decision unless the ruling affected the substantial rights of the complaining party.united states ragsdale,cir quoting bocanegra vicmar,cir.
cleveland challenges the district court decision to exclude poret testimony.under louisiana law,a nurse may not testify against a physician.furthermore,the louisiana courts have observed that emergency room physicians and employees are governed by different standards of care.wright hca health serv.of louisiana,so d,differentiating between the standard of care applicable to emergency room physicians and the standard governing the nursing staff.thus it is without question that under louisiana law,poret could not testify as to the standard of care governing an emergency room physician.see taplin lupin,so d,holding that a registered nurse is not qualified to testify as to whether a doctor,certified in internal medicine,breached the applicable standard of care.in this case,however,we must consider whether louisiana law permits a nurse to testify against a physician assistant.
both parties and their experts applied the standard of care of a physician to eubanks alleged acts of medical negligence.this is consistent with louisiana law,which indicates that physician assistants may perform most of the same tasks as physicians,frequently without direct supervision indeed,the louisiana legislature specifically noted that one of the goals of establishing a physician assistant program in the state was to enable physicians to delegate certain health care tasks to physician assistants.
poret written report focused exclusively on the failure of the physician assistant at bjach to meet the requisite standard of care.in her opposition to the united states motion to exclude poret testimony,cleveland attempted to argue that poret was qualified to read and explicate the chronology of care samuel received at bjach,as poret possesses a bachelors degree in nursing and is a certified legal nurse consultant.however,this argument is inapposite given the content of her report.as a nurse,poret is not qualified to testify as to a physician standard of care or the standard of care governing a physician assistant who stands in the place of the treating physician.see broussard,so d at stating the rule that only physicians qualified in a particular medical field may testify as to the standard of care owed by physicians in that specialty.the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding poret testimony as she was not qualified to testify as to the standard of care applicable to a physician assistant.
cleveland also argues that the district court abused its discretion in excluding portions of piland testimony.the district court ruled that piland testimony went beyond the scope of a treating physician,by offering his opinion on the standard of care owed by emergency room physicians.the district court noted that piland was qualified as an expert in internal medicine but had not worked in an emergency room other than during a brief time during his residency.thus,applying the standards articulated in daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals,d,the district court concluded that the acceptable standard of care for an emergency room was not within the scope of his expertise as an internist.
