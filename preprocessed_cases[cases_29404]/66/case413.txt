defendant and appellant dan joshua castro,castro appeals an order granting a motion for new trial obtained by plaintiff and respondent marian tortorella tortorella in her medical malpractice action against him 
by way of background,castro brought a motion for summary judgment,asserting the care he rendered to tortorella was consistent with the standard of care,and that no negligent act or omission by him either caused,or was a substantial factor in causing,harm to tortorella.in opposition thereto,tortorella presented an expert declaration stating the preoperative evaluation by castro fell below the accepted standard of care,and that the sinus surgery he performed on her was unnecessary.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of castro on the ground tortorella opposing papers failed to raise a triable issue with respect to the causation element of a cause of action for medical malpractice thereafter,the trial court granted tortorella motion for new trial based on the equities and the policy favoring resolutions on the merits.
we conclude the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of castro.tortorella opposing expert declaration,asserting the surgery castro performed on tortorella was unnecessary,was sufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact as to causation.if surgery is performed unnecessarily,the mere fact the surgery was performed is sufficient to constitute harm to the patient.because the grant of summary judgment was legally erroneous,the trial court properly granted tortorella subsequent motion for new trial,even though it did so on improper grounds.
accordingly,the new trial order is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
on april,tortorella,who had a history of facial pain and pressure,underwent an mri of her sinuses ordered by a physician.
on april,tortorella was examined by another physician.he found her symptoms were sinugenic and prescribed the antibiotic cipro,the steroid nasal spray nasacort,and the antihistamine clarinex.
on april,tortorella met with a dentist,who attributed her symptoms to sinus problems.
on may,tortorella first presented to castro with progressive,chronic and disabling rhinosinusitis bilaterally.he performed an endoscopic nasopharyngoscopy and determined tortorella had a septal deviation bilaterally with percent airway narrowing,a concha bullosa with thick mucous obstructing the middle ostium and a poorly draining middle turbinate and sphenoethmoid recess.castro concluded tortorella was an appropriate candidate for bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery and septoplasty and partial turbinectomy.
on may,tortorella underwent bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery,septoplasty and partial turbinectomy performed by castro at ucla medical center,and was discharged the same day.at the initial follow up visit on may,castro performed a bilateral sinus debridement and suction of nasal debris.on june,tortorella again saw castro and underwent another endonasal sinus debridement.tortorella did not return to castro for further care,believing something was done wrong in the surgery.
proceedings.
on august,tortorella filed a complaint for medical malpractice against castro and the regents of the university of california regents tortorella alleged castro was negligent in examining,diagnosing and treating her,causing permanent and serious injuries to her sinus and nasal system,as well as high blood pressure,head and facial pain.
castro motion for summary judgment.
castro moved for summary judgment,asserting the care he rendered to tortorella was consistent with the standard of care,and to a reasonable medical probability,no negligent act or omission by him either caused,or was a substantial factor in causing,harm to tortorella.
castro motion was supported by the expert declaration of paul toffel.according to toffel,castro complied with the standard of care in all respects tortorella was an appropriate candidate for the endoscopic sinus surgery performed by castro based on her history of sinus complaints,as well as the results of the physical examination via endoscopy and the mri scan the preoperative workup was performed entirely within the standard of care castro duly informed tortorella of the risks,benefits and alternatives to surgery and tortorella appropriately consented to the surgery and the may,surgery was performed entirely within the standard of care,as were the two subsequent sinus debridements.
with respect to the key issue of causation,the toffel declaration stated there was no reasonable medical probability that anything castro did or failed to do in the care and treatment of tortorella caused or was a substantial factor in any injury to her persons with chronic sinusitis are born with the disease and have a hereditary tendency for sinuses to inflame and to a reasonable medical probability,tortorella alleged symptoms of facial pain were not due to any care rendered by castro.
tortorella opposition.
in opposition,tortorella argued,summary judgment must be denied because triable issues of material fact exist in regard to the care and treatment of the plaintiff where she underwent unnecessary endoscopic surgery.
tortorella opposition papers were supported by the declaration of ellis berkowitz,a specialist in the field of otolaryngology.berkowitz stated based on a careful review of the medical records and the mri and ct scans of the sinuses,i am able to conclude with a high degree of medical probability that the evaluation and the endoscopic sinus surgery performed by castro on may,fell below the accepted standard of care in the field of otolaryngology.italics added.specifically,castro misread the mri scan this misreading of the mri scan led him to schedule tortorella for surgery castro scheduled tortorella for surgery days after his initial evaluation he did not try medical therapy before surgery the mri scan did not reveal pathology in the sphenoid sinus,yet castro removed tissue there.further,t here were no diagnostic considerations by castro of nasal and sinus allergy,underlying dental pathology or even some type of neuralgia.without any clear understanding of the patient or her problem,he chose to perform major endoscopic sinus surgery just two weeks after his initial evaluation.the cultures at surgery revealed an anaerobic bacteria was found in the sinuses,but there is no indication in the medical record that castro advised any medical treatment for this condition.as noted,these specific failures fall below the standard of care and on this record are an indication that the surgery was unnecessary.italics added.
trial court ruling granting summary judgment in favor of castro.
on march,the matter came on for hearing and was taken under submission.
on march,the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of castro,ruling,tortorella has failed to raise a triable issue of fact on the issue of causation,which her expert declaration fails to address.the court has reviewed the additional cases cited by counsel orally hanson grode,supra,th,d and mann cracchiolo cal d,and finds that neither case supports any different conclusion by the court.accordingly,castro is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.
motion for reconsideration.
on march,tortorella filed a motion for reconsideration,arguing causation is axiomatic where the surgery was unnecessary.however,assuming the trial court was unable to draw this conclusion from the opposing declaration of berkowitz,tortorella submitted a supplemental declaration by berkowitz,explaining the unnecessary surgery did in fact cause a direct injury to her.
castro opposed the motion,asserting tortorella had failed to present any newly discovered facts or circumstances.
on april,before the hearing on the motion for reconsideration,the trial court entered judgment on the summary judgment in favor of castro.
on may,the trial court denied the motion for reconsideration,ruling the entry of judgment deprived the trial court of its jurisdiction to reconsider its order granting summary judgment.
motion for new trial.
on april,nine days after entry of judgment,tortorella filed a notice of intention to move for new trial on various grounds,including i nsufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other decision,or the verdict or other decision is against law,subd.and e rror in law,occurring at the trial and excepted to by the party making the application,subd.
in the motion for new trial,tortorella reiterated that causation is axiomatic where the surgery was unnecessary.tortorella assert ed that where there been testimony establishing a breach of care with a high degree of medical probability,and the resulting surgery was unnecessary,the magic word causation may be inferred from the fact that an endoscopic surgery procedure removing human tissue is an injury.however,in the event the trial court could not draw this conclusion from the declaration of berkowitz filed in opposition to summary judgment,tortorella resubmitted the supplemental declaration of berkowitz from the motion for reconsideration,explaining the unnecessary surgery did in fact cause injury to her.
the supplemental expert declaration elaborated surgery on the sinuses changes the normal sinus anatomy,and may result in further sinus infections,even worse than the patient had before the procedure.in this case,the surgery changed the patient normal sinus anatomy and function.the unnecessary sinus surgery also put the patient under significant risk of anesthetic injury,bleeding and postoperative infection.these were risks directly caused by the unnecessary surgery.a trial on medical treatment was clearly indicated before taking the patient to surgery and subjecting her to these various risks without indication.
in opposing the motion for new trial,castro argued tortorella failed to establish entitlement to a new trial,she failed to show the existence of any newly discovered evidence,and she failed to demonstrate the evidence now being presented could not have been produced earlier had she been diligent.
on may,the trial court heard and granted the motion for new trial.it granted the motion based on the equities of the circumstances.the summary judgment motion was granted based on the failure of plaintiff to provide any expert testimony supporting causation.the motion to reconsider was denied for jurisdictional reasons and not on the merits.with legal precedence preferring resolutions on the merits rather than through technical errors,the court rules that the trial go forward,with the supplemental declaration providing the missing support and the element of causation.
castro filed a timely notice of appeal from the order granting a new trial.
contentions 
castro contends the order granting a new trial must be reversed because there was no statutory basis for granting a new trial the trial court improperly granted a new trial on the equities and on a policy favoring disposition on the merits the order for new trial could not have been based on newly discovered evidence because tortorella failed to demonstrate the new evidence could not have been discovered earlier through the exercise of reasonable diligence and the new trial order can not be upheld on any alternative ground.
discussion 
propriety of motion for new trial following grant of motion for summary judgment.
a threshold issue is whether a motion for new trial may be brought following the grant of a motion for summary judgment.
the early decision of gray cotton cal,states,proceedings for new trial do not lie to secure the of the decision of a motion.id.at.
however,the law since has evolved see,carney simmonds cal d,holding a motion for a new trial is appropriate following an order granting judgment on the pleadings and it now is settled that a motion for a new trial is appropriate following an order granting summary judgment,even though,strictly speaking,summary judgment is a determination that there shall be no trial at all.citation.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.
therefore,tortorella was entitled to bring a motion for new trial following the grant of summary judgment in favor of castro.
trial court rationale for granting a new trial is immaterial the new trial order will be upheld if correct on any ground.
section prescribes seven grounds upon which a new trial may be granted here,the trial court granted a new trial based on the equities of the circumstances as well as legal precedence preferring resolutions on the merits rather than through technical errors.the trial court ruling does not fit within the statutory framework.
nonetheless,the trial court rationale does not bind us.with certain exceptions not relevant here,section provides in relevant part on appeal from an order granting a new trial the order shall be affirmed if it should have been granted upon any ground stated in the motion,whether or not specified in the order or specification of reasons italics added.therefore,the order granting a new trial will be upheld if it should have been granted upon any ground raised in tortorella motion.
we now examine whether the new trial motion should have been granted upon a ground raised by tortorella.
tortorella motion for new trial established the decision granting summary judgment constituted an error in law therefore,the grant of the motion for new trial was correct in result and will be affirmed.
standard of appellate review.
a n appellate court will rarely disturb an order granting a new trial and then,only on a clear showing of abuse of discretion.citation.however,where the ground under consideration is that the original judgment order is against the law,the area of judicial action generally is not one involving discretion.the initial choice of the trial court challenged by a motion on this ground was either right or wrong,and this is the nature of the evaluation which must be made in passing upon said motion in re marriage of beilock d.
trial court erred in granting castro motion for summary judgment because tortorella opposition papers were not silent on the issue of causation berkowitz opposing declaration,to the effect that castro performed unnecessary surgery on tortorella,was sufficient to raise a triable issue as to causation the erroneous grant of summary judgment was cured by the order granting new trial.
to reiterate,the expert declaration of berkowitz filed in opposition to summary judgment stated based on a careful review of the medical records and the mri and ct scans of the sinuses,i am able to conclude with a high degree of medical probability that the evaluation and the endoscopic sinus surgery performed by castro on may,fell below the accepted standard of care in the field of otolaryngology.italics added.specifically,castro misread the mri scan this misreading of the mri scan led him to schedule tortorella for surgery castro scheduled tortorella for surgery days after his initial evaluation he did not try medical therapy before surgery the mri scan did not reveal pathology in the sphenoid sinus,yet castro removed tissue there.further,t here were no diagnostic considerations by castro of nasal and sinus allergy,underlying dental pathology or even some type of neuralgia.without any clear understanding of the patient or her problem,he chose to perform major endoscopic sinus surgery just two weeks after his initial evaluation.the cultures at surgery revealed an anaerobic bacteria was found in the sinuses,but there is no indication in the medical record that castro advised any medical treatment for this condition.as noted,these specific failures fell below the standard of care and on this record are an indication that the surgery was unnecessary.italics added.
although the trial court read this declaration as being silent with respect to the issue of causation,it seems that unnecessary surgery is injurious and causes harm to a patient.even if a surgery is executed flawlessly,if the surgery were unnecessary,the surgery in and of itself constitutes harm.surprisingly,despite the volume of medical malpractice litigation,there is a dearth of case law in california on this point.however,emerson bentwood,is instructive.
there,a plaintiff,who underwent a hysterectomy after suffering from intermittent pelvic pain for years,brought a medical malpractice action against the surgeon,alleging the hysterectomy was unnecessary.emerson,supra,at.the pl
