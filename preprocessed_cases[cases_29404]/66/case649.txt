in this appeal from the superior court,we consider the correctness of jury instructions given in a medical malpractice action.the plaintiff below alleged that both his family physician and an emergency room physician breached the standard of care by failing to diagnose him with appendicitis before his appendix ruptured.the jury was instructed on the applicable standard of care,as found in.the jury was further offered an explanation of the standard of care using language not found in the statute,but conforming to pattern jury instructions.it is this explanatory language that the plaintiff below objected to,arguing that it gave the impermissible impression that the standard of care is subjective in nature,and requires of a physician only good faith.the trial court overruled the plaintiff objection,finding that the challenged language gave the jury a helpful,informative and accurate explanation of the standard of care.we agree and affirm.
below roger corbitt,corbitt brought this medical malpractice action against vijay tatagari tatagari and bayview medical center,bayview alleging that they should have diagnosed him with acute appendicitis and referred him to a surgeon in time to permit surgery before his appendix ruptured.corbitt claims that the surgery and recovery time necessitated by his ruptured appendix was more extensive than if either tatagari or bayview had properly diagnosed his condition prior to his appendix rupturing.after trial,the jury returned a verdict for the defendants,tatagari and bayview.this appeal followed.
corbitt began experiencing intense abdominal pain on the morning of december.the pain was such that corbitt left work and drove two hours to see his family doctor,tatagari.corbitt testified at trial that the pain was so severe that he asked to lie down while waiting for tatagari to see him.tatagari testified,however,that when he saw corbitt,corbitt was sitting up and did not appear to be in extreme pain.tatagari took a medical history from corbitt and conducted a physical examination.when tatagari examined corbitt,he found that corbitt pain was in the epigastric region of the abdomen,which is located just above the stomach,under the rib cage.corbitt did not indicate any pain in the right lower quadrant of his abdomen,where the appendix is located.tatagari diagnosed corbitt with either acute gastritis or peptic ulcer,which were both consistent with corbitt physical exam.tatagari did not believe corbitt was suffering from appendicitis because of the lack of pain in the right lower quadrant.tatagari prescribed prilosec,a medication for both gastritis and ulcer,and advised corbitt to go to the emergency room if his symptoms worsened.
later that same afternoon,corbitt pain increased and he went to the emergency room at kent general hospital now bayview.at the emergency room,corbitt was seen by hamilton carter carter.carter read corbitt medical chart,conducted a physical examination,and ordered diagnostic tests,including an.again,corbitt indicated that the pain he was experiencing was limited to the epigastric region of his abdomen,not the right lower quadrant.by this time,corbitt had also vomited blood,an indication that his stomach was bleeding,consistent with an ulcer.carter reviewed the results of the and saw nothing that he felt would indicate an obstruction or appendicitis.the did indicate a small bit of matter,called a fecalith,in the area of the appendix,however.corbitt argued to the jury that this indicated a problem with his appendix that should have been explored further,but carter testified that given the absence of pain in the area,he did not believe appendicitis was a reasonable possibility.although the technician indicated that consultation may be required,carter did not consult anyone further regarding the results until after corbitt had been discharged.carter testified that consultation did not change his initial diagnosis,which excluded appendicitis as the cause of corbitt distress.
carter believed that peptic ulcer was the most likely diagnosis,and he prescribed medication accordingly.corbitt remained in the hospital and after four hours had passed while he was on the medication,corbitt felt somewhat better.this improvement confirmed the diagnosis in carter mind and he discharged corbitt with instructions to see his primary doctor within three days and return to the hospital if his symptoms worsened.for the next three days,corbitt continued to experience pain.on december,a family member telephoned tatagari office and informed tatagari assistant that corbitt was still in pain and now had blood in his urine.according to tatagari,his assistant told corbitt to go directly to the hospital.corbitt denies that he was instructed to go to the hospital.
then,on december,corbitt again made an unscheduled visit to tatagari office.by this time,corbitt reported to tatagari that he had been experiencing fever and constipation for the previous two days.also on this visit,for the first time,corbitt indicated pain in the right lower quadrant of his abdomen.tatagari suggested that corbitt go to the hospital for further testing but corbitt refused,so tatagari referred him to a surgeon,sidney barnes barnes.corbitt went to see barnes that same day.barnes examined corbitt but found that he did not have a surgical abdomen,and,therefore,barnes thought it was unlikely corbitt was suffering from appendicitis.according to barnes,he did recommend further testing,but corbitt elected not to pursue that route.
the following morning,december,corbitt returned to bayview in extreme pain.barnes was called in to examine corbitt and again did not believe corbitt was suffering from appendicitis,but scheduled immediate surgery to explore the source of corbitt pain.during surgery,it was discovered that corbitt appendix had ruptured,probably sometime during the previous night.as previously noted,corbitt contends that the surgery was more extensive and the recovery time more prolonged because he did not have his appendix removed until it had already ruptured.
in his complaint,corbitt alleged that both tatagari and carter breached the applicable standard of care on december by failing to take an adequate history and performing incomplete physical examinations,particularly in failing to conduct a rectal exam.corbitt further claimed that tatagari had breached the standard of care by failing to instruct him to go to the hospital on december,and failing to diagnose appendicitis on december.finally,corbitt alleged carter was negligent on december in his reading of the,which showed the presence of a fecalith.
at the trial in this matter,it was elicited that tatagari is an internist,or a general physician for adults,and that he is foreign born and foreign educated.there was further testimony that,although the standard for detecting appendicitis is the same for all physicians,only a surgeon,such as barnes,can render the required treatment for appendicitis,which is surgery.furthermore,there was evidence that carter had not passed the certification boards for emergency medicine,despite having taken the examination two or three times.in addition to these attacks on the defendants competence,both sides presented expert testimony on whether or not tatagari and carter had met the standard of care.as to the december telephone call,corbitt expert indicated that tatagari would have met the standard of care if he instructed corbitt to go to the hospital,or if he had told corbitt to come directly to his office.
at the close of the case,the jury was instructed with the standard medical malpractice jury instruction,which reads as follows 
under a delaware statute,a healthcare provider that does not meet the applicable standard of care commits medical malpractice the standard of skill and care required of every healthcare provider in rendering professional services or healthcare to a patient shall be that degree of skill and care ordinarily employed,under similar circumstances,by members of the profession in good standing in the same community or locality,and the use of reasonable care and diligence.
each physician and healthcare provider is held to the standard of c
