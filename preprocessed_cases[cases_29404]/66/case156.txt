the decedent,abraham karam,executed a trust agreement in that divided his assets equally between a marital trust and a residual family trust.in,the decedent entered into a contract with sagemark consulting,then known as cigna financial advisors,to review his personal finances for a fee.the contract provided that sagemark would prepare a personal financial plan based upon its evaluation of relevant documents to be furnished by karam.despite sagemark awareness of the trust agreement and its repeated requests to be sent a copy,sagemark never received the document.sagemark report nevertheless stated that,under the decedent current situation,no federal estate tax would be due upon the death of the first spouse either the decedent or his wife,carole karam,and that any federal estate tax would not be due until the death of the surviving spouse.when the decedent died in september of,his estate was worth approximately million.contrary to sagemark report,roughly million in federal estate taxes was due as a result of karam death.
the plaintiffs,who are karam wife and children,subsequently filed suit against sagemark,alleging both a breach of contract and violation of the michigan consumer protection act mcpa.after a jury verdict for the plaintiffs in the amount of approximately million,the district court granted sagemark motion for judgment as a matter of law.on appeal,the plaintiffs argue that sagemark was untimely in seeking judgment as a matter of law and,in any event,that the district court erred in granting sagemark the requested relief.sagemark,on the other hand,contends that the district court judgment should be affirmed both on the merits and because the plaintiffs filed their complaint after michigan statute of limitations had run.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the district court grant of judgment as a matter of law,reinstate the jury verdict,and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
karam trust agreement contained what is known as a tax equalization clause,which required that the assets subject to the trust be divided equally between the marital trust and the residual family trust.the theoretical advantage of an equalization clause is that,because of progressive estate tax rates,two smaller distributions on the deaths of each spouse will result in less total estate tax liability than would one large distribution on the death of the survivor.equalization clauses,however,are relatively uncommon in estate planning.more prevalent is the normal estate distribution,where the bulk of the decedent assets pass to the surviving spouse in a form that qualifies for the unlimited marital deduction under federal law.because the distribution to the surviving spouse is not taxed,the imposition of the estate tax is deferred until that spouse dies.with an equalization clause,in contrast,the half of the decedent assets that do not pass to the surviving spouse are immediately subject to the estate tax,less a general exemption that was in effect at the time of karam death.
in july of,after responding to a solicitation from sagemark,karam entered into a contract with the company pursuant to which sagemark was to provide a financial plan regarding estate planning,investment planning,retirement planning,and business succession planning in exchange for a fee.sagemark employees catherine imerman and david moss were involved in the process of providing the financial plan.imerman testified that sagemark true purpose for providing karam with the financial plan,unbeknownst to karam,was to convince him that he needed life insurance that sagemark was prepared to sell him.
the contract between sagemark and karam provided that karam would provide advisor with financial and personal data necessary to prepare your plan,and that on the basis of the documents you provide advisor will prepare and present a personal financial plan summarized in written form.sagemark,however,never received a copy of karam trust agreement,despite requesting it from both karam and his attorney.
without reviewing the trust agreement that he knew existed,moss proceeded to prepare an estate planning report that was delivered to karam on august.moss had previously informed karam that the plan would not address investment planning,retirement planning,or business succession planning because these types of advice were not relevant to karam situation.the report stated that,under karam current situation,no federal estate tax would be due upon the first spouse death,and that any federal estate tax would be deferred until the surviving spouse died.moss made this statement in the report because he assumed that karam trust agreement provided for a normal distribution.although karam subsequently modified his trust agreement three times,none of the amendments affected the equalization clause.
karam died on september,leaving an estate worth approximately million.the plaintiffs subsequently learned that roughly million was owed in federal estate taxes.their claim for damages flows from the federal and state tax liabilities and their loss of use of the money that was needed to pay the taxes.
procedural background 
karam law offices of ralph kliber 
in october of,the plaintiffs brought a malpractice action against karam former lawyer and the lawyer law firm.they also sued the bank that served as cotrustee of the trust agreement for negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,and a violation of the mcpa.karam law offices of ralph kliber.the plaintiffs contended that karam intent at the time he signed the trust agreement differed from what actually appeared in the text of the document.id.at.although the michigan court of appeals opinion does not state this directly,the plaintiffs apparently argued that karam intended to have a normal estate plan that would have distributed the bulk of his assets to his wife.see id.at discussing a letter written by a vice president of the defendant bank,which incorrectly stated that karam trust provided for a normal distribution scheme see also sorkowitz lakritz,wissbrun associates,karam was a dispute concerning the decedent intent regarding alternative estate planning approaches.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.this decision was affirmed by the michigan court of appeals,which held that,under michigan law,extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to show that the decedent intended an outcome different from that set forth by the language of the estate documents.id.at.because karam trust agreement contained an unambiguous equalization clause and because there were no disputes about which documents constituted the estate plan,the court concluded that extrinsic evidence was inadmissible to show a variance.id.at.
the present lawsuit 
the plaintiffs filed the present lawsuit on september,naming sagemark and three other entities as defendants.sagemark removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.the district court granted partial summary judgment in august of,dismissing several of the plaintiffs claims and all of the defendants other than sagemark.
when the jury trial began the following month,sagemark filed a motion in limine to exclude any extrinsic evidence of karam intent that conflicted with the provisions of the trust agreement.the district court granted sagemark motion.during the trial,however,at least two of karam family members testified that they had understood that no federal estate taxes would be due as a result of karam death.the family members did not explain the basis for their understanding.sagemark nevertheless failed to object.
the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs,specifically finding that sagemark breached the contract with karam karam did not commit the first substantial breach of the contract by failing to provide sagemark with the trust agreement the claim did not accrue before september,the breach caused the plaintiffs in damages the plaintiffs in their individual capacities are beneficiaries to the contract between sagemark and karam sagemark violated the mcpa by engaging in one or more unfair,unconscionable,or deceptive methods,acts
