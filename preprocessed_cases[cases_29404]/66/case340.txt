on june,the superior court issued an order denying the petition the order adopted a detailed tentative ruling of the court setting forth the court factual findings and legal conclusions.the court concluded with the following statement the evidence that supports discipline of petitioner license and revocation of his probation is extensive.sandarg probation required that he obey all laws.he violated that condition when he was convicted for of methamphetamine in february.he violated condition four,that he file quarterly reports under oath,when he did not disclose his arrest for methamphetamine did not disclose that he had been cited for unsafe operation of a water craft and when he falsely claimed that he had abstained from the unauthorized use of drugs.
sandarg violated condition seven of his probation when he failed to notify the board in writing of his address changes and that he was living at two different addresses.
condition twelve of probation required that sandarg abstain from the use and possession of controlled substances unless legally prescribed for medically or dentally diagnosed health reasons for a bona fide illness or condition.he violated this condition when he used and possessed methamphetamine on february,when he obtained hydrocodone over the internet without an exam,when he wrote prescriptions for hydrocodone,vicoprofen,cyclobenzaprine,robaxin,vioxx and methocarbamol to himself,when he used the possessed anabolic steroids without valid prescriptions,when he possessed two manufacturer bottles of alprazolam xanax at his residence,and when he possessed prescriptions for cyclobenzaprine and alprazolam xanax ostensibly prescribed by dinh,who stated that he did not issue such prescriptions.
sandarg is an unapologetic and unreformed abuser of illegal and prescription drugs alike,with apparently no interest whatsoever in rehabilitation.the board was justified in revoking his license,on a preponderance of the evidence as a probation violation and on clear and convincing evidence as an original revocation proceeding.
judgment was entered in favor of the board and against sandarg on july.this appeal followed.
contentions 
sandarg contends that the superior court should have granted his petition with respect to the board accusation on the grounds that he was not convicted of any crimes,there was no admissible evidence of his long term possession and abuse of controlled substances,there was insufficient evidence to support judge thomas findings,and the board intentionally withheld evidence from its own expert toxicologist,fred fung,with respect to revocation of his probation,sandarg contends that the superior court should have granted his petition on the grounds that judge thomas applied the wrong standard of proof,that his probation period was not extended as the board contends and thus the period expired,and that judge thomas erroneously concluded that the terms of sandarg probation were violated.finally,sandarg argues that the award of costs should be overturned because judge thomas erroneously refused to compel a deputy attorney general to testify regarding the matter and because there was insufficient evidence to support the amount of the costs awarded.
we shall address sandarg argument that judge thomas applied the wrong standard of proof in the published portion of the opinion.all other arguments are addressed in the unpublished portion of the opinion.
discussion 
standard of review 
the right to practice one profession is a fundamental vested right and if a person license to practice that profession is revoked by an administrative agency,when a petition for a writ of mandate is brought for restoration of the license,the trial court must apply its independent judgment to its review of the facts underlying the administrative decision.citations.green board of dental examiners th,green.
under the independent judgment rule,the trial court must weigh the evidence and make its own determination as to whether the administrative findings should be sustained.when an appeal is taken from the trial court determination,it is given the same effect as any other judgment after trial rendered by the court the only question is whether the trial court not the administrative agency findings are supported by substantial evidence.citation.conflicts in the evidence must be resolved in favor of the judgment and where two or more inferences can be reasonably drawn from the facts,the reviewing court must accept the inferences deduced by the trial court.citation.however,the trial court legal conclusions are open to our examination to determine if errors of law were committed.citation.
evidence is substantial if any reasonable trier of fact could have considered it reasonable,credible and of solid value.citation.additionally,a reviewing court may look to the findings in the administrative agency decision for guidance in determining whether the trial court judgment is supported by substantial evidence.citation.green,supra,th at.
sandarg forfeited the claim of error that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court judgment 
we must presume that the record contains evidence to support every finding of fact of the trial court unless the appellant proves otherwise.schmidlin city of palo alto th,schmidlin.a party who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding must set forth,discuss,and analyze all the evidence on that point,both favorable and unfavorable.doe roman catholic archbishop of cashel emly th,doe.further,a party who challenges the sufficiency of the evidence must present the facts in a light most favorable to the prevailing party.schmidlin,at.
the appellant must also provide a summary of the significant facts in the record and provide references to the record to support his or her claims regarding the evidence.cal.rules of court,rule a c a c.it is not up to the court to search the record to determine whether the appellant assertions about the evidence are true.schmidlin,supra,th at.when an appellant fails to fully analyze the evidence with specific citations to the record,or only presents facts and inferences favorable to his or her position,the contention that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence is deemed forfeited.see id.at doe,supra,th at.
here,sandarg does not provide a coherent summary of the evidence and does not set forth,discuss and analyze most of the evidence relied upon by the board.instead,sandarg devotes most of his brief to evidence he claims is favorable to him and to rearguing hotly disputed factual issues.sandarg also fails to provide record citations to support many of the purported facts he relies upon 
worse still,sandarg repeatedly makes factual assertions that are demonstrably false.for example,sandarg alleges that the board had no evidence of drug abuse by sandarg.this is not true.the board had a mountain of evidence to support its allegation that sandarg abused drugs,including but not limited to sandarg confession under oath in his plea agreement that he used methamphetamine,and the testimony of two police officers the administrative law judge found to be credible witnesses.
officer boldt,for example,testified at the administrative hearing and stated in his police report that,at the time of his arrest,sandarg displayed signs of being under the influence of was sweating profusely,had slurred speech,and had dilated pupils.boldt further testified that in jail sandarg admitted to boldt that he had used methamphetamine.sandarg ignores officer boldt testimony and the other evidence of his abuse of drugs.
because sandarg has failed in his obligations concerning the discussion and analysis of the evidence relied upon by the superior court,we deem the claim of error that there was no substantial evidence to support the judgment forfeited.doe,supra,th at schmidlin,supra,th at.
sandarg failed to show any errors in the trial court conclusion that the board was justified in revoking sandarg license pursuant to the accusation 
a.the alleged violations of hipaa 
sandarg argues that the board obtained documents in violation of hipaa.he contends that the board,without a subpoena,warrant or patient releases,obtained from pharmacies documents allegedly related to prescriptions written by sandarg for his patients,prescriptions written by sandarg treating doctors for sandarg,and purchases of medications made by sandarg and his father 
sandarg,however,does not identify the provision of hipaa that was allegedly violated,cite any statutory or case law authority to support his claim that hipaa was violated or provide any analysis of an alleged hipaa violation.sandarg does not even describe precisely what he contends hipaa prohibits.he has therefore forfeited any claim of error arising from an alleged hipaa violation.badie bank of america th,when an appellant fails to raise a point,or asserts it but fails to support it with reasoned argument and citations to authority,we treat the point as waived.
even overlooking sandarg forfeiture,we reject the argument on the merits.the regulations enacted pursuant to hipaa place restrictions on certain covered entities in their use and disclosure of confidential health care information.a see also.in this case,the pharmacies,as health care providers,are covered entities the board and its investigators are not.see also.the board therefore is not bound by hipaa.
moreover,as the superior court recognized,the pharmacies are expressly authorized to disclose protected information to a health oversight agency for oversight activities authorized by law,including licensure or disciplinary administrative proceedings.d.contrary to sandarg contention,the board is a health oversight agency.for purposes of hipaa,a health oversight agency is an agency or authority of the united states,a state,a territory,a political subdivision of a state or territory,or an indian tribe,or a person or entity acting under a grant of authority from or contract with such public agency,including the employees or agents of such public agency or its contractors or persons or entities to whom it has granted authority,that is authorized by law to oversee the health care system whether public or private or government programs in which health information is necessary to determine eligibility or compliance,or to enforce civil rights laws for which health information is relevant.b v,emphasis added.the board fits within that definition,as it is charged with protecting the public by exercising its licensing,regulatory,and disciplinary functions over dentists in this state.bus.
additionally,the remedy for the pharmacies alleged violation of hipaa is civil and criminal sanctions against the pharmacies.see,acara banks cir,the remedy is civil and criminal penalties there is no private cause of action doe board of trustees of university of illinois d,same runkle gonzales d,same.as the superior court noted,t here is no remedy against the board agent nicas and the dea,the investigators who obtained the health information,for they had no duty of confidentiality under hipaa.
sandarg contends that the administrative law judge should have excluded evidence allegedly gathered in violation of hipaa.the board argues that the exclusionary rule does not apply to administrative proceedings relating to the revocation of a license to practice dentistry even assuming there was a hipaa violation,we do not reach the issue of whether the exclusionary rule applies because sandarg failed to show that a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the admission of evidence that allegedly was collected in violation of hipaa.
a judgment can not be reversed based on the erroneous admission of evidence u
