the instant appeal arises from adversary proceedings brought in bankruptcy court.defendant,robert parker,the debtor below,appeals the district court order affirming the bankruptcy court order permanently enjoining defendant from prosecuting a state legal malpractice claim against plaintiff,thomas goodman,his former counsel.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
in july,defendant hired plaintiff,a kentucky lawyer,to act as his counsel in chapter bankruptcy proceedings brought to discharge defendant debts.defendant did so on the advice of counsel after a kentucky state court entered judgment against him in an estate dispute brought by his siblings,finding defendant liable in the amount of.on november,plaintiff filed a chapter bankruptcy petition on defendant behalf.the bankruptcy court appointed robin browning brock brock to serve as trustee of defendant bankruptcy estate.defendant discharged plaintiff as counsel on august.
nearly one year later,on july,defendant brought suit against plaintiff in kentucky state court asserting three claims for for legal malpractice,and a third for breach of fiduciary duty both defendant and trustee brock,as trustee of defendant bankruptcy estate,were named plaintiffs in that case.defendant complaint in kentucky state court hereinafter collectively legal malpractice claim or legal malpractice suit alleged that plaintiff acted as his counsel concerning the possibility defendant could obtain relief of some kind by filing a petition in bankruptcy until august,at which time defendant terminated the relationship.at the complaint asserts that plaintiff prepared and filed defendant chapter petition,and represented defendant in all matters involved in and all matters related to the bankruptcy proceeding.id.at 
in support of the two legal malpractice claims for relief,defendant alleged that plaintiff negligently represented defendant,breached one or more legal duties he owed defendant,and deviated adversely from the standard of care that applied to him.at he additionally asserted that plaintiff failed to advise defendant concerning certain matters about which plaintiff had a legal duty to advise him id.at the third claim,for breach of fiduciary duty,purportedly followed plaintiff refusal to turn over defendant original case file upon request.id.at apparently,plaintiff initially told defendant that a copy of the approximately file would be available for purchase at a rate of cents per page or for the cost of copying at a commercial print shop.id.at on the matter of damages,defendant asserted that each instance of legal malpractice left him in a worse financial position,damaging both his reputation and credit record with consequent future damages.id.at,for the breach of fiduciary duty claim,based solely on plaintiff actions concerning the original case file,defendant alleged financial damages only.defendant alleged that he retained counsel to assist him in obtaining the original file without paying plaintiff quoted fee,and although ultimately successful in doing so,that plaintiff should be liable for his attorney fees.all relief requested in the state law claim was sought in favor of defendant and trustee brock.id.at 
trustee brock filed a notice of intent to abandon the bankruptcy estate interest in defendant legal malpractice suit against plaintiff,and no interested parties objected.nevertheless,on may,the bankruptcy judge entered an order voiding trustee brock notice of intent to abandon the estate interest in the lawsuit.subsequently,trustee brock sold the legal malpractice claim against plaintiff at public auction to lawyers mutual insurance company lawyers mutual,plaintiff malpractice insurer,for the sum of.on september,the bankruptcy judge entered an order approving the sale hereinafter order of sale.defendant failed to appeal the order of sale,and did not obtain a stay.lawyers mutual consummated the sale by paying in full the purchase price to the bankruptcy estate.notwithstanding the consummated sale,defendant continued to prosecute the legal malpractice suit in kentucky state court 
as a result,plaintiff initiated an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court seeking injunctive relief.specifically,plaintiff asked the bankruptcy court to enjoin defendant from prosecuting the legal malpractice suit against plaintiff on the basis that it had been sold to lawyers mutual,and in the alternative,defendant lacked standing to prosecute the suit,which constituted property of the bankruptcy estate.on december,the bankruptcy judge issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting defendant from continuing to prosecute the state legal malpractice suit.on february,wl,the bankruptcy judge ordered that the preliminary injunction become permanent.defendant timely appealed the injunction to the district court.the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court permanent injunction on june.defendant then timely appealed to this court.
discussion 
standard of review 
we directly review the bankruptcy court decision,and not the district court decision below.in re trident assocs,cir.a de novo standard of review applies to the bankruptcy court legal conclusions,while factual findings will only be disturbed if clearly erroneous.in re waterman,cir.
b.the injunction properly issued 
on appeal,defendant contends that the bankruptcy court erred when it enjoined defendant from prosecuting the legal malpractice suit in kentucky state court.in support of his challenge,defendant advances various arguments,but the crux appears to be that the bankruptcy court order of sale was not valid.first,defendant claims that kentucky public policy prohibits the sale of legal malpractice claims.second,defendant argues that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enter the order of sale.the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction,defendant says,because the legal malpractice at the very least,one claim for after his bankruptcy petition was filed and,accordingly,was not property of the estate.we affirm the bankruptcy court injunction.
statutory mootness m 
defendant myriad formulations of his challenge to the bankruptcy court injunction all sound in a thinly veiled attempt to collaterally attack the bankruptcy court now final order of sale.plaintiff contends that m renders attacks on the order of sale moot inasmuch as defendant failed to obtain a stay of the sale.indeed,defendant freely admits he took no appeal from the order of sale,and that the sale has been fully consummated.we agree with plaintiff.thus,we begin by dispelling any notion that we sit in review of the bankruptcy court order of sale.defendant attempts to assail the validity of the bankruptcy court order of sale,however indirectly,are statutorily moot.
title b permits a bankruptcy trustee to sell property of the estate after notice and hearing.once the bankruptcy court authorizes the sale of property under,that same section limits appellate review 
the reversal or modification on appeal of an authorization under subsection b or c of this section of a sale or lease of property does not affect the validity of a sale or lease under such authorization to an entity that purchased or leased such property in good faith,whether or not such entity knew of the pendency of the appeal,unless such authorization and such sale or lease were stayed pending appeal.
m.by its terms then,b ankruptcy mootness rule applies when an appellant has failed to obtain a stay from an order that permits a sale of a debtor assets.in re park plaza assocs,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.what is more,it limits appellate review of a consummated sale regardless of the merits of legal arguments raised against it.in re made in detroit,cir emphasis added.a majority of our sister circuits construe m as creating a per se rule automatically mooting appeals for failure to obtain a stay of the sale at issue.see in the matter of the ginther trusts,cir united states salerno,cir in re stadium mgmt,cir matter of gilchrist,cir in re the charter,cir in re sax,cir in re magwood.the third circuit applies an alternative two part approach,finding an appeal moot under m if the party failed to obtain a stay and reviewing courts can not grant effective relief without impacting the validity of the sale.krebs,valley motors,cir rejecting the per se rule see also pittsburgh food beverage,ranallo,cir declining to adopt either the per se rule or the two part approach.our circuit has yet to decide whether to adopt the per se rule preferred by the majority of sister circuits.because the result in the instant case will be the same under either formulation,we again decline to adopt one controlling approach.
under the majority approach,defendant attempts to impugn the validity of the order of sale must necessarily fail.the bankruptcy court authorized the order of sale pursuant to,thereby conveying the legal malpractice suit to lawyers mutual in its entirety defendant neither sought nor obtained a stay of the sale,nor did defendant appeal from the order of sale.rather,the sale became final and was consummated.defendant failure to obtain a stay renders moot any direct challenge to the order of sale.see the ginther trusts,at salerno,at stadium mgmt,at gilchrist,at the charter,at sax,at magwood,at.
the same result follows under the third circuit two part approach.see krebs,at.first,defendant failed to obtain a stay of the sale.second,no effective relief could be granted without impacting the validity of the sale.see id.this second requirement flows from one underlying rationale for the bankruptcy mootness consummation of a sale in bankruptcy greatly limits the ability of reviewing courts to fashion effective relief.ranallo,at stadium mgmt,at.a stay serves to maintain the status quo pending appeal,thereby preserving the ability of the reviewing court to offer a remedy and holding at bay the reliance interests in the judgment that otherwise militate against reversal of the sale.in re cgi,cir.in his reply brief,defendant argues that we can grant some suitable relief without affecting the sale.specifically,defendant claims that resolution of the dispute between parker and goodman concerning the right to prosecute the claims,would in no way affect the creditors of the bankruptcy estate because the trustee already received payment from lawyers mutual in satisfaction of the sale.reply br.at suitable relief in defendant mind consists of a judgment permitting defendant to prosecute the legal malpractice suit notwithstanding the now final sale.quite clearly,such relief would materially modify the asset purchased by lawyers mutual.in fact,the very value of the asset to lawyers mutual,plaintiff malpractice insurer,lies in foreclosing prosecution of those claims.one can not challenge the validity of a central element of a purchase without challenging the validity of the sale itself.the charter,at see also stadium mgmt,at rejecting relief sought because it would change the deal that the purchaser made.any relief permitting defendant to prosecute the state law claims would therefore affect the validity of the sale.see id.
at oral argument,when asked why no direct appeal was taken from the bankruptcy court order of sale,defendant replied that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enter the order of sale in the first place.cast in a different mold,defendant argued essentially that he had no obligation to appeal from a purportedly invalid and illegal order this argument,for its force,depends upon defendant repeated protestations that the legal malpractice suit did not constitute property of the bankruptcy estate.several courts of appeals have considered similar arguments designed to evade the effect of m,and their decisions prove instructive here.
sax,at,concerned a maritime lien claimant appeal from a bankruptcy court order approving the sale of a yacht as property of the debtor estate.on appeal,the lien claimant argued that because the yacht was not property of the estate,the sale was not under and bankruptcy mootness did not apply.id.at.the sax court held the lien claimant appeal moot because the sale was authorized under b and the lien claimant failed to obtain a stay of the sale.id.at.with respect to the claim that the yacht was not property of the estate and could thus not be sold pursuant to b,the sax court aptly reasoned,section m does not say that the sale must be proper under b it says the sale must be authorized under b.id.the bankruptcy court acted under b when it authorized the sale and,thus,it matters not whether the authorization was correct or incorrect.id.at.
perhaps most pertinent to our purposes,the court examined the lien claimant alternative argument that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the yacht did not constitute property of the estate 
the appellants raise the jurisdictional argument as if it somehow negates or excuses their failure to obtain a stay.it does not.this appeal is moot because the lien claimants failed to obtain a stay,so we can not reach the question of whether the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to approve the sale the bankruptcy court made the determination that it had jurisdiction an issue which it had jurisdiction to decide.that decision stands unless it is appealed properly.despite the maxim that subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time,valid procedural rules can not be ignored just because the jurisdictional decision is being challenged rather than the decision on the merits.to accept this argument would be to ignore valid procedural requirements.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted,emphasis added.the court concluded by carefully noting that its holding merely required that proper procedures be followed to obtain appellate review of bankruptcy which,in the context of that case,required the lien claimant to obtain a stay of the sale.id.at.
in ranallo,at,the third circuit considered a debtor appeal from a bankruptcy court order approving the b sale of assets of the debtor wholly owned subsidiary.the debtor attempted to secure a stay,but the bankruptcy court denied his motion and the sale was consummated.id.at.on appeal from the order,the debtor argued that the assets sold were not property of the bankruptcy estate and therefore that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the sale and its order was void.id.at.pertinently,with respect to the jurisdictional argument,the court observed,
section m does not distinguish between a challenge to an order approving a sale predicated on jurisdictional grounds and a challenge based on other grounds.we recognize that it might be claimed that a bankruptcy court usurped power so that even absent a stay,notwithstanding section m,an order reversing an order approving a sale permissibly could affect the validity of the sale assets.such a case in theory could arise if the bankruptcy court approved the sale of assets not even colorably within its jurisdiction.but we are not concerned with that possibility as the bankruptcy court,at least arguably,had jurisdiction over the subsidiary assets which the debtor indirectly owned through its ownership of the subsidiary.
id.at emphasis added.ultimately,the ranallo court concluded that the debtor appeal was moot inasmuch as finding in favor of the debtor would affect the sale validity.id.at.
other appellate panels have joined the sax and ranallo courts in concluding that m moots appeal from an unstayed order of sale notwithstanding claims that the property sold did not constitute property of the estate and that the bankruptcy court thus lacked authority.see in re vance,cir whether or not the sale was proper is irrelevant.the charter,at also in re rare earth minerals,cir to recognize an exception to statutory mootness whenever a claimant asserts that her property was wrongly assumed into the estate would seriously undermine the purpose of m and could destroy the rule altogether.but rutherford,rnh,cir noting that bankruptcy court jurisdiction does not extend to property that is not part of a debtor estate,and finding property not in existence at the time of the sale in bankruptcy could not have been conveyed,mistakenly or otherwise.
similarly,a previous panel of our circuit found claims that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction on other grounds irrelevant to the question of bankruptcy mootness in richards swinebroad denton auctioneers,wl cir unpublished,an opinion with persuasive effect.on a motion for reconsideration,the district court in richards concluded that the debtors appeal from the bankruptcy court order authorizing sale was moot.while before us on appeal,the debtors argued that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enter the order because it had modified their voluntary chapter plan in doing so.id.at.we found it unnecessary to address the debtors jurisdictional argument because they failed to obtain a stay.id.we reasoned 
the debtors objections if valid,at most demonstrate error by the court,and error does not render the court order void for lack of jurisdiction.if any error was committed by the bankruptcy court in the exercise of its authority over the debtors petition,the remedy lies with an appeal and a stay of the sale pending appeal.the clear intent of congress in cases such as this is to protect the interest of bona fide purchasers.
id.therefore,we concluded the debtors appeal was moot.the fifth circuit has similarly held on two separate occasions.see the ginther trusts,at creditors challenging subject matter jurisdiction on ground that debtor lacked standing to become a debtor in bankruptcy gilchrist,at claim that court lost jurisdiction when it sua sponte dismissed the case on the ground that there was no attorney to represent the corporate debtor.
all this cataloguing of precedent is to say we are in good company when we reject defendant jurisdictional attack on statutory mootness.this is not a case where the bankruptcy court usurped power,as by approv ing the sale of assets not even colorably within its jurisdiction.see ranallo,at.the bankruptcy court below at least arguably had jurisdiction over the legal malpractice suit.the bankruptcy code defines property of the estate to include all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement of the case,and a ny interest in property that the estate acquires after the commencement of the case.a.as legal and equitable interests,causes of action that belong to the debtor constitute property of the estate under a.in re cannon,cir see also bauer commerce union bank,clarksville,cir.additionally,rights derivative from the debtor causes of action constitute an interest in property that the estate acquires.see in re,cir w ith limited exceptions,the estate encompasses everything that the debtor owns upon filing a petition,as well as any derivative rights,such as property interests the estate acquires after the case commences.
colorably,then,the legal malpractice suit in the instant case was property of the estate under.although the parties each devote substantial portions of their briefs on appeal to the question whether the legal malpractice suit was properly classed property of the estate,we decline to explore the matter further.to engage in a discussion of this question on the merits would be to defeat the very purpose of the bankruptcy mootness provision.weingarten nostat,serv.merch,cir to accept defendant argument would rob m mootness of its force,since an appeal of a bankruptcy court order will typically question whether a given transaction is authorized by the bankruptcy code.made in detroit,at noting limits appellate review of a consummated sale regardless of the merits of the legal arguments raised against it.defendant arguments on this point are quite clearly tailored to affect the validity of the order of sale,which the bankruptcy court authorized pursuant to.
it is worth noting as well that,in concluding that the legal malpractice claim at issue here was property of the estate,the bankruptcy court passed on the issue of its own jurisdiction.chicot county drainage dist.baxter state bank.the court has the authority to pass upon its own jurisdiction and its decree sustaining jurisdiction against attack,while open to direct review,is res judicata in a collateral action.defendant allowed his opportunity to litigate the issue of jurisdiction to pass when he failed to appeal the order of sale,and failed to obtain a stay of the sale.defendant failure to obtain a stay is fatal to his position,regardless of whether there was jurisdiction.see gilchrist,at.if the bankruptcy court erred in the exercise of its authority over the debtor petition,the remedy lies with an appeal and a stay of the sale pending appeal.richards,wl,at see also sax,at despite the maxim that subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time,valid procedural rules can not be ignored just because the jurisdictional decision is being challenged rather than the decision on the merits.because no stay of the sale issued,we can not now permit defendant to impugn the validity of the order of sale.
however,we have previously acknowledged that state law may provide exceptions to the bankruptcy mootness rule,unless federal interests mandate different results.park plaza,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.for example,where state law would otherwise permit the transaction to be set aside,an exception to mootness may lie.see also cgi,at.it is here that defendant public policy argument comes into play.defendant relies on coffey by collins jefferson county bd.of,but coffey is inapposite.
there,a woman asserted claims of negligence against a director of grounds for the school district.id.at.the school district hired an attorney to represent the director until two weeks before trial,at which time they cut off assistance to him.id.at trial,the director confessed judgment in the amount of,and in satisfaction of that judgment,assigned all claims he might have against the school district attorneys to the woman.id.the coffey court found the assignment void as against public policy because of its collusive nature.id.at.the result followed from the fact that proof of negligent conduct is required to recover,the assignee may not be privy to the information necessary to show negligence,and damages were not readily ascertainable.id.none of these considerations are present where a debtor bankruptcy estate sells a legal malpractice suit to the defending attorney malpractice insurer.the malpractice insurer,for reasons too obvious to state,does not desire to prove up the claim of malpractice,nor to collect monetary damages.additionally,the malpractice insurer who purchases a legal malpractice suit against its insured enters into the transaction as a matter of business,and not in lieu of a judgment for its prior negligence.there is nothing collusive about a debtor bankruptcy estate selling a cause of action to garner funds to repay the creditors.thus,defendant has not shown that kentucky law or public policy requires the bankruptcy sale of the legal malpractice suit to be set aside.
at any rate,any exceptions must not be construed in such a way to undermine role in protecting the finality of a sale in bankruptcy.see rare earth minerals,at also sax,at t o look for exceptions would increase litigation,which would seriously undermine the finality and certainty imposed by m.section m reflects a strong preference for safeguarding the finality of a sale in bankruptcy.weingarten nostat,at ranallo,at krebs,at stadium mgmt,at sax,at.finality is important because it minimizes the chance that purchasers will be dragged into endless rounds of litigation to determine who has what rights in the property.sax,at.in the case at bar,finality considerations carry even greater force where the property at issue is a legal malpractice suit,purchased at auction by the lawyer malpractice insurance carrier undoubtedly to foreclose the possibility of lengthy litigation.cgi,at finding stay of the sale intrusive to the extent that it prevents the good faith purchaser from proceeding with the malpractice action,leaving the company with an asset that it has paid for but can not put to use as it sees fit.
consequently,inasmuch as defendant collaterally attacks the bankruptcy court order of sale in these proceedings,defendant must fail.we find defendant attempts to invalidate the order of sale moot.
