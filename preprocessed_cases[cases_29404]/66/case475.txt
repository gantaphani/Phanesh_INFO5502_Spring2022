introduction 
plaintiffs and appellants russell duncan duncan and shari duncan duncan collectively the duncans appeal from the judgment entered after the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of defendant and respondent yemelyan spivak,spivak.duncan contends the trial court erred in concluding the limitations period set forth in code of civil procedure section rendered his medical malpractice claim.as more fully explained below,section sets forth a and a limitations period.the statute provides in pertinent part that regardless of the limitation period,the time for the commencement of action shall be one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the injury,whichever occurs first.section goes on to exclude from its limitation periods any claim in which the plaintiff can show the presence of a foreign body,which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect,in the person of the injured person.
in the first part of this opinion we conclude that a staple used during duncan hernia surgery is not a foreign body and thus duncan claim is not tolled by the foreign body exception set forth above.however,we are also called on to decide whether duncan claim nevertheless escapes section limitations period because,despite his diligent attempts to do so,he was unable to discover the negligent cause of his injury.for the reasons set forth herein,we conclude section does not necessarily bar a claim filed more than one year after a plaintiff suspects medical negligence and serves a notice of intent to sue when that plaintiff subsequently receives medical advice allaying those suspicions.in our view,such facts merely raise a question of fact,appropriately resolved by a jury,regarding what constitutes discovery of the injury and reasonable diligence that should result in discovery.the dissent concludes that the filing of a notice of intent to sue will in every case constitute discovery of an injury as a matter of law.
we set forth this summary of our holding at the outset in order to clearly convey the exact nature of what we decide here whether,as a matter of law,a plaintiff discovered or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered the negligent cause of his injury when he experiences pain,suspects professional negligence,consults an attorney who files a notice of intent to sue,but is subsequently unable to support his lay suspicion of negligence with medical fact despite numerous consultations with doctors and even an additional surgery.we conclude he does not discover his injury within the meaning of section under such circumstances.thus,the facts alleged by duncan do not,as a matter of law,require the legal conclusion that the limitations period expired prior to initiation of the action.
we further conclude duncan has alleged facts that would support a finding he was diligent within the meaning of the statute.for the reasons stated herein,we reject respondent and the dissent position that a mere suspicion of professional negligence triggers the limitations period under section regardless of diligence.we further reject respondent and the dissent position that the initiation of a notice of intent to sue under the specific alleged facts of this case triggers the limitations period as a matter of law.as this matter is before us on summary judgment we,of course,do not decide whether the facts alleged actually constitute diligence such that the limitations period is tolled,but rather leave that factual conclusion to the trier of fact.
facts and procedural history 
summary of facts 
while at work,duncan experienced pain in the lower right groin,near the right scrotum,and was taken to an emergency room in corcoran.there he was seen by both an emergency room physician and a surgeon,schuster.both doctors diagnosed duncan injury as a groin pull.when duncan continued to have severe burning pain,duncan consulted with sherwin,a family doctor,who diagnosed duncan with a hernia and referred him to a surgeon,spivak.spivak also diagnosed duncan with a hernia and recommended a laparoscopic hernia repair.
on october,spivak performed a right,laparoscopic,inguinal hernia repair on duncan at central valley general hospital in hanford.as part of the repair procedure,spivak affixed surgical mesh to duncan abdominal wall using several surgical staples.spivak stated in his supplemental declaration that the surgical staples were purposefully placed in duncan abdominal cavity with the intent they remain there permanently he therefore concluded they served a therapeutic purpose as a fixation device.
following the surgery,duncan was taken to the surgical recovery room where,upon arousing from the anesthesia,he immediately experienced heightened pain in areas of his body that were previously asymptomatic,namely,his right hip,inner thigh and groin,and numbness in his upper right leg.these symptoms,which resembled an electrical shock coupled with numbness,were not present before the hernia repair surgery and,in fact,were far different from the complaints which prompted duncan to seek medical treatment in the first place.before the surgery,duncan only felt pain in his right groin area,which would spread to the stomach area,causing an upset stomach.he would also experience discomfort when he had a bowel movement.
duncan asked an attending nurse about these new symptoms and was told not to worry,because it was part of the surgery.during a postoperative examination on october,spivak affirmed what the nurse had said.five days later,when duncan saw spivak for a examination,his pain had become experienced numbing in the outer thigh and a burning sensation down the inner thigh.at that time,spivak advised duncan that the pain would go away in time and told him to go back to work.no appointment was scheduled.
in late october,duncan returned to his job as a construction worker.by this time,his pain was a lot worse than before the surgery,and he was ingesting large doses of pain relief medication just to get through the workday.increasing pain caused duncan to seek the advice of a neurologist,richard pantera,on december.pantera was unsure what was causing duncan pain and said they may need to do exploratory surgery.pantera told duncan the pain might be related to the hernia repair surgery,but he was sure.as a preliminary measure,pantera placed duncan on additional medication to see if the pain would resolve.
on december,duncan saw spivak partner,schuster,about his continuing pain and was prescribed ultram,a.schuster purportedly advised duncan that the symptoms he was experiencing were a nerve problem,which could be corrected by a course of injections to kill the nerve.dissatisfied with schuster answer and proposed course of treatment,duncan decided to stop treating with spivak office.duncan did not return to spivak office after december.
in february,duncan telephoned two different attorneys to inquire about his status,to ask what he ought to do about his pain,and to determine what his rights were.one of these attorneys was david drexler of sherman oaks,a plaintiff medical malpractice attorney,whom duncan authorized to obtain and review his medical records to see what was wrong.on february,drexler sent spivak a notice of intention to commence a legal action based on professional negligence on duncan behalf in accordance with section 
meanwhile,on february,duncan saw another physician,gregory rhodes,regarding his ongoing complaints.rhodes advised duncan that something was wrong,and that he needed exploratory surgery.rhodes therefore referred duncan to edward felix,a specialist in laparoscopic surgery.duncan initially testified in his deposition that at that time he was unaware that something was wrong,that he did not know that spivak had done anything wrong,but he just knew he was in a lot of pain.duncan testified later in his deposition,however,that pantera and rhodes thought he needed exploratory surgery because something was wrong.
on march,felix performed exploratory laparoscopic surgery.felix discovered that a portion of duncan inferior lateral mesh rolled up,forming a firm hard ridge with scar tissue around that ridge which was entrapping the genital branch of the genital femoral nerve.felix looked for a staple that might be irritating a nerve,but found none.although felix corrected the problem that he had discovered,duncan complaints persisted without any improvement whatsoever.
on april,felix saw duncan for a postoperative appointment.duncan told felix he still had a fair amount of pain but felix told him that was not unusual.during a postoperative visit on may,duncan was still complaining of pain in his testicles and hot flashes and pain in his scrotum,but felix told him that the nerve sensitivity may markedly improve over time and may even return to normal.
in april,duncan received a letter from his attorney,drexler,declining to represent him further.the letter advised duncan that if he wished to pursue the matter he should contact another attorney immediately,and warned him that failure to act could cause his action to be barred by the statute of limitations.duncan admits receiving this letter in april 
on june,duncan consulted espinas,a neurologist,but no diagnosis is found in the record.in february,duncan began treating with kevin hiler,who performed an open exploratory surgery in april.hiler discovered and removed a surgical staple directly through the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.in hiler opinion,felix did not detect the staple in the laparoscopic procedure he performed months earlier because the staple had been obscured by its location.hiler further opined that the staple he found was the cause of duncan ongoing complaints following the october operation,that it was placed in the nerve during that operation,and that under the applicable standard of care,spivak should have promptly reoperated on duncan to look for the source of his postoperative complaints.duncan testified in his deposition that he did know that spivak had done anything wrong until he had surgery with hiler.
duncan was aware of her husband condition from the beginning,as he told her about the problems he was experiencing following the hernia repair operation.duncan also told his wife about consulting with attorney david drexler.
this lawsuit 
on june,duncan attorneys served spivak with a section notice on duncan behalf.on october,duncan filed a complaint in fresno county superior court alleging a single cause of action against spivak for medical negligence.on march,duncan filed a separate complaint alleging loss of consortium damages against spivak.
spivak answered both complaints,contending that both actions were filed after expiration of the statute of limitations set forth in section.the actions were consolidated for all purposes.
on september,spivak moved for summary judgment,alleging that both complaints were barred by the limitations period set forth in section.the duncans filed opposing papers on november,and spivak replied on november.on november,the trial court heard oral argument regarding the summary judgment motion,and took the motion under submission.on november,the trial court granted spivak motion as to both complaints.the trial court concluded that the statute of limitations commenced to run in february,when duncan consulted drexler about pursuing a professional negligence action against spivak,and when drexler,as duncan agent,served spivak with notice of intent to sue pursuant to section 
on december,judgment was entered in spivak favor and,on december,spivak served notice of entry of judgment.on january,duncan filed a timely notice of appeal.on february,duncan filed an amended notice of appeal,which included shari duncan,who was not mentioned in the original notice of appeal,as an appellant.

subdivision o of section states in relevant part 
o for purposes of motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication a defendant or has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action,even if not separately pleaded,can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant or has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff or to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the plaintiff or may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.
spivak motion for summary judgment attempted to show that there is a complete defense to the professional malpractice and loss of consortium claims in the duncans complaints,subd.o.that defense is the statute of limitations.
statute of limitationsa.duncan professional malpractice claim 
the parties do not dispute that the applicable limitations period for duncan professional malpractice claim is contained in section.section provides in pertinent part 
in an action for injury or death against a health care provider based upon such person alleged professional negligence,the time for the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the injury,whichever occurs first.in no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed three years unless tolled for any of the following upon proof of fraud,intentional concealment,or the presence of a foreign body,which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect,in the person of the injured person.
thus,section contains two periods of period and a period,both of which must be met.rose fife d.the period begins to run when the plaintiff discovers the harmful effect,the physical manifestation of the wrongful act.the negligent cause of that effect is not a concern for the period.id.at.
here,duncan experienced the effects of spivak alleged wrongful acts at the earliest in october,when he felt pain immediately following the hernia repair surgery.his complaint was filed in october.therefore,duncan met the period of limitations,a fact that spivak does not contest.
year limitations period 
because the limitation period was satisfied,the issue here is whether the limitation period was applicable and,therefore,bars the action.the period commences when the plaintiff is aware of both the physical manifestation of the injury and its negligent cause.rose fife,supra,d at.accord,gutierrez mofid cal d,gutierrez.
a.the foreign body exception 
duncan contends the limitations period was tolled because the staple hiler ultimately removed was a foreign body,which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect.ashworth memorial hospital d.ashworth.our supreme court has explained that the presence of a foreign body tolls the limitations period,but that t he statute makes clear that the period is not similarly extended.thus,regardless of extenuating circumstances,the patient must bring his suit within one year after he discovers,or should have discovered,his injury.gutierrez,supra,cal d at,accord,sanchez south hoover hospital cal d.
in ashworth,the second district court of appeal held that in cases involving the foreign body exception the limitations period does not commence until the patient discovers,or through reasonable diligence would have discovered,the existence of the foreign body and its negligent cause of his injury.ashworth,supra,d at.the plaintiff in ashworth brought a medical malpractice action after discovering her doctor had left cotton pledgets or sponges in her body during an operation to remove kidney stones.noting the unique characteristics of this form of malpractice and the legislature special treatment of the foreign body exception,the court held the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the plaintiff was aware of the cotton pledgets and the role they played in her ailments.id.at.as the court explained in ashworth 
it is said the statutory foreign body exception only tolls the outside limitations period and not the discovery period.hills aronsohn d.what this means,of course,is that the foreign body exception in section lifts the outside limit entirely if a nontherapeutic foreign body has been left inside a patient.it gives that patient an unlimited time to discover or to use reasonable diligence to discover the presence of the foreign body.but once the patient discovers or through reasonable diligence would have discovered the foreign body and its role in her injury she only has one year to file her lawsuit against the practitioners responsible for leaving the foreign body inside her.that is,the patient is not free to completely ignore the statute of limitations just because she finds out her doctor left something inside her body which is causing her harm.she must still act within one year of her discovery the foreign body exists and is the negligent cause of her injury.ashworth,supra,d at.
the issue the duncans present is whether the staple was a foreign body,with no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect that would in essence toll the limitations period until hiler discovered and removed the staple in april 
generally,the foreign body exception applies where a foreign body is inadvertently left in the patient,such as a surgical sponge.trantafello medical center of tarzana d.for example,in trantafello the court found the foreign body exception inapplicable to acrylic that had been intentionally implanted in the plaintiff during disk surgery for the therapeutic purpose of maintaining a space between the vertebrae.the court concluded that while the acrylic may not have had a therapeutic effect it allegedly was the cause of the plaintiff injuries,the evidence established that it still had a therapeutic purpose,the doctor who implanted it intended that the acrylic maintain the space between the vertebrae.ibid.thus,the fact that the acrylic did not act as intended did not change the fact that the doctor who implanted it intended it to perform a therapeutic purpose.
similarly,in hills aronsohn,supra,d,the court held that intrabreast silicone injections do not satisfy the foreign body exception.in so holding,the court explained 
we have found nothing to persuade us that the foreign body doctrine was intended to cover situations such as the case before us where a substance was intentionally introduced into a patient body to extend the foreign body doctrine to a substance which was introduced intentionally for a therapeutic purpose would undermine the clear legislative intent to restrict the foreign body exception to situations where the foreign substance was unintentionally left in a patient body.hills aronsohn,supra,d at,fn.omitted.
there is no issue of fact in this case regarding whether spivak intentionally inserted the staple as part of the hernia repair procedure,or whether the staple served a therapeutic purpose.spivak offered evidence that the surgical staple was intentionally implanted during the surgery for the therapeutic purpose of affixing the mesh to the abdominal wall,with the intent that it permanently remain there.the duncans failed to offer any evidence to refute spivak statements.as spivak points out,hiler declaration implies only that spivak negligently placed the staple and thereafter negligently failed to remove it before it became embedded in scar tissue hiler declaration says nothing about the staple intended purpose.hiler declaration may raise an issue of fact regarding whether the staple had a therapeutic effect,since the staple apparently caused duncan injury by being placed through a nerve however,it does not raise an issue of fact regarding whether the staple purpose was therapeutic,as the evidence establishes that spivak intended the staple to hold the mesh in place.see,trantafello center of tarzana,supra,d at.
citing osborne county of los angeles d.osborne,the duncans contend that the staple may have originally served a therapeutic purpose,however,the fact that hiler removed the staple means that the staple no longer had a therapeutic purpose.as spivak notes,osborne is distinguishable from the present case.in osborne,the surgery in question was for the express purpose of removing the pins and screws that were placed in the plaintiff during an earlier surgery to repair the plaintiff leg and hip fractures.id.at.one screw,however,was overlooked during the later surgery.though hospital records showed that the hospital was aware the screw remained in the plaintiff hip,the screw was not removed until eight and a half years later.id.at.after its removal,the plaintiff applied for leave to present a late claim,which the county denied.ibid.
the court,recognizing that the only reason for the second surgery was to remove the previously inserted pins and screws,noted that the negligence consisted of failing to remove the screw while plaintiff was under defendant care.osborne county of los angeles,supra,d at.the court found that while the screw was presumably a therapeutic prosthetic device when originally inserted and may have been left in the plaintiff intentionally for sound medical reasons,the record showed no awareness or reasonable suspicion by the plaintiff that the screw was improperly left in his hip.ibid.the court therefore held that the county erroneously denied osborne application for leave to present a late claim.
here,the surgery spivak performed on duncan was not for the specific purpose of removing a previously inserted object,but to repair a hernia.the hernia repair required the placement of mesh in duncan,which was affixed to the tissue with surgical staples.thus,the surgical staples were not improperly left in duncan body,but were intentionally placed there for a therapeutic purpose,as a permanent fixation device.that the staple may have been improperly placed,and therefore ultimately required removal,does not change the conclusion that the staple was intended to serve a therapeutic purpose.although the staple may have pierced the nerve,there is no evidence that the staple therapeutic purpose changed over time.
in ashworth,the court explained how a foreign body that once served a therapeutic purpose can qualify for the foreign body exception 
section now requires that the foreign body exception have no therapeutic purpose or effect.however,this requirement can be satisfied even if the foreign body had such a purpose or effect when originally placed in the patient body.it is enough the foreign body was not removed after it had ceased having this therapeutic purpose or effect.otherwise the drainage hose left in the patient in huysman kirsch cal d and all the other sponges,pins,needles,and similar objects left in patients in the paradigm foreign body cases would not qualify for the foreign body exception.for,in nearly all these cases,the tube or sponge or other object indeed had a therapeutic purpose or effect at the time it was inserted into the patient drain the wound or absorb blood or hold a bone in place.but the continued presence of these items for weeks,months or years after the wound was closed had no therapeutic value.at some point these articles only represented a threat of injury.sensibly,after enactment of section the foreign body rule still applies to foreign bodies even though they had a therapeutic purpose or effect at the time they were placed in the patient so long as it can be shown they were allowed to remain there too long.ashworth,supra,d at.
thus,once an intentionally inserted object no longer serves a therapeutic purpose,it becomes a foreign body with no therapeutic purpose or effect.the screw in osborne and the cotton pledgets or sponges in ashworth clearly no longer served therapeutic purposes.in contrast,here spivak failure to remove the staple was negligent,if at all,not because the staple no longer served a therapeutic purpose,but because the staple was improperly placed,it pierced the nerve.this is exactly the opinion hiler offered in his declaration opposing the the staple was placed in the nerve during the hernia operation and that spivak failure to immediately perform exploratory surgery and remove the staple before it became embedded in scar tissue was below the standard of care.hiler offered no opinion as to whether the staple continued to serve a therapeutic purpose.this simply is not a case where the doctor left a foreign object in the patient body without any intended continuing treatment purpose,as in ashworth and osborne.
rockefeller moront,further supports this conclusion.in rockefeller,the court of appeal held that a suture that was improperly affixed to an organ during hernia repair surgery did not constitute a foreign object sufficient to delay accrual of new york statute of limitations for medical malpractice.the court reached this conclusion because items such as sutures are deliberately introduced into the body and intended to perform the continuing function of securing the surgical closure.at.noting that objects such as surgical clamps,scalpels and sponges serve a temporary medical function during the surgery and are normally intended to be removed after the surgery is complete,the court reasoned that when such objects are left behind,no assessment of the medical professional expert judgment or discretion in failing to remove them is necessary to establish negligence.rockefeller moront,supra,at.
in contrast,the court recognized that when a claim is based on the improper placement of fixation devices such as sutures,that claim 
is more accurately characterized as a challenge to the defendant doctor medical judgment and,his placement of the not as one predicated on defendant failure to remove medical material that should have been extracted at the close of the operation if plaintiff were permitted to proceed with this action,defendants would be called upon to justify the doctor professional judgment and the practices he employed in providing plaintiff with medical task which would be rendered extremely difficult due to the significant lapse in time and the attendant loss of evidence and witnesses likely to coincide with the delay.rockefeller moront,supra,at,see also shah lehman missouri court of appeal held that cement restrictor intentionally placed into the plaintiff and intended to be left there as a medical implant during hip replacement surgery not a foreign object,although it became imbedded in her thigh muscle court applied rule stated in earlier missouri case,hershley brown,that if the foreign object is intentionally introduced in the body and is intended to remain there,even if the procedure is performed in a negligent manner,the negligence does not fall within the tolling provision shah,at.
in the instant case,duncan claim is more accurately characterized as a challenge to spivak medical judgment and treatment than as a challenge based on spivak failure to remove medical material that should have been extracted at the close of the operation.if duncan case were permitted to proceed,spivak would be required to justify his professional judgment and the practices he employed in providing duncan with medical treatment.as the court reasoned in rockefeller,a claim based on a medical professional deliberate implantation of a fixation device in the wrong place does not transform it into a foreign object.such a claim is more readily characterized as one predicated on negligent medical treatment,which,like misdiagnosis,is a category of malpractice not covered by the foreign object rule.rockefeller moront,supra,at.
finally,the duncans,relying on dicta in ashworth,contend that the statute of limitations did not commence until hiler surgery in april because the failure to remove the surgical staple constituted a continuing tort so that the right of action continued until the staple was removed,and the operation was not complete until all appliances necessary to a successful operation had been removed from his body.see ashworth,supra,d at.
the first contention fails because,as explained in osborne,the tort continues only until the time that the plaintiff leaves the defendant care,which in duncan case was december.osborne county of los angeles,supra,d at.see also huysman kirsch,supra,cal d at,sanchez south hoover hospital,supra,cal d at,trombley kolts d,holding medical malpractice claim extended during the entire period the defendant surgeon was in charge of the plaintiff case,and her right of action became complete only when she terminated the relationship and sought the aid of other surgeons.the second contention fails because the staple was not required to be removed to complete the operation instead,it is undisputed that spivak intended the staple to be inserted and to remain in duncan body as part of the operation.therefore,the operation was complete not when the staple was removed,but when the hernia repair procedure concluded on october.
thus,for the reasons set forth above,we conclude that the staple is not a foreign body subject to the tolling provision of section.
b.when did duncan discover the injury 
because we conclude the staple is not a foreign body,the relevant inquiry regarding when the limitations period commenced is when the plaintiff discover ed,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,his injury.duncan claims there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether he should have discovered his injury through the use of reasonable diligence because he sought out an attorney and multiple medical opinions about his condition and its possible cause soon after his initial treatment by spivak.spivak argues that duncan suspicion of wrongdoing that prompted him to seek legal advice constituted discovery of his injury.the dissent argues that the filing of the notice of intent to sue under section constitutes discovery of the injury as a matter of law.
as stated by the supreme court in gutierrez,supra,cal d at,the term injury,as used in section,means both a person physical condition and its negligent cause.citations.thus,once a patient knows,or by reasonable diligence should have known,that he has been harmed through professional negligence,he has one year to bring his suit.see also rose fife,supra,d at.the period commences when the plaintiff is aware of both the physical manifestation of the injury and its negligent cause.
duncan of course knew of his physical condition immediately upon waking from the original operation.it is reasonable to conclude he further at least suspected its negligent cause,at the latest,when he consulted an attorney in february of.his suspicions were allayed,however,when subsequent physicians concluded his physical condition did not have a negligent cause.he did not discover the facts essential to his claim,that a staple from the original surgery was in fact the cause of his physical condition until april when exploratory surgery by yet another doctor revealed the offending surgical staple.thus,were we to hold,as a matter of law,that duncan harbored the requisite subjective suspicion necessary to accrue the period of limitations when he consulted with the attorney in,we would be requiring him to sue during a time that there was absolutely no objective basis for believing any malpractice had occurred.
spivak contends this is the proper result because prior case law indicates that a subjective belief of wrongdoing,a suspicion commences the running of the statute.spivak relies on recent supreme court cases which effectively interpret the discovery of facts underlying a wrongful death or personal injury claim to include mere suspicion of facts underlying the claim.see,norgart upjohn cal th,d,norgart jolly eli lilly cal d.none of these cases,however,address the medical malpractice situation where a plaintiff suspicions are allayed by subsequent objective medical opinions.nor do these cases specifically address the delayed discovery rule as it is set forth in section.accordingly,as set forth below,we conclude a plaintiff claim is not necessarily under the period set forth in section immediately upon a suspicion of wrongdoing where he subsequently receives objective medical advice to allay those suspicions.
cases involving the limitations period in section 
this conclusion is consistent with the supreme court analysis in gutierrez,supra,cal d,a case which did involve the limitations period in section and where the court reasonably concluded that the limitations period commenced when a woman was immediately aware she had received a hysterectomy during a surgery she understood to be to remove a tumor from her appendix.gutierrez,supra,cal d at.several doctors confirmed her suspicions of malpractice soon after the initial surgery.she contacted an attorney,however,who advised her that she did not have a viable claim.plaintiff subsequently received different legal advice,that she did have a legal claim,and filed suit more than one year after the initial surgery.id.at.the supreme court rejected her contention that the statute of limitations should be tolled because of the legal advice she received,instead concluding the cause of action begins to run no later than the time the plaintiff learns,or should have learned,the facts essential to his claim.id.at.the facts essential to the claim being,in that case,that she had received a hysterectomy.here,the fact essential to duncan claim is that a staple from the original surgery was misplaced,a fact he may have been suspicious of but that he had been told was an incorrect suspicion prior to april.thus,the basis for the accrual of the suit in gutierrez,supra,cal d,was not an absence of knowledge of fact,but absence of knowledge of the law 
even more analogous to the facts before us is a case decided last year by the fourth district,kitzig nordquist th,d kitzig.in kitzig the plaintiff sued her dentist for malpractice based on his alleged negligence in providing dental implants over an almost four year period.id.at,d.during the third year of treatment,the plaintiff experienced food escaping from her nose when she ate and bubbles coming from her nose when she brushed her teeth.id.at,d.she became suspicious the dentist may have done something wrong and sought a second opinion.id.at,d.the second doctor told her everything looked okay and she returned to the defendant.on appeal,the defendant dentist contended that the limitations period under section accrued when the plaintiff sought a second opinion because she subjectively suspected wrongdoing.the court rejected this argument despite the plaintiff testimony that she was suspicious her doctor may have done something wrong in may almost years before filing suit.id.at,d.the court concluded those suspicions did not,as a matter of law,accrue the statute of limitations.while the kitzig court grounded much of its analysis on the fact that a second opinion should not trigger the accrual of the statute because it would hinder the relationship,the court also recognized that the purpose of the statute of limitations was to punish dilatory plaintiffs.id.at,d.recognizing this goal,the court refused to conclude that,as a matter of law,a suspicion automatically triggers the limitations period.id.at,d.though here duncan had discontinued treatment with the defendant physician,the analysis set forth in kitzig nevertheless supports our conclusion that a jury could reasonably conclude that a subjective suspicion of malpractice may not be adequate to accrue the period set forth in section where the evidence shows the plaintiff also had objective evidence to allay those suspicions upon his diligent attempts to confirm them.
ii.other delayed discovery cases 
we do not ignore,of course,the seemingly contradictory language from our supreme court in jolly eli lilly,supra,cal d at page,wherein the court,stated a plaintiff need not be aware of the specific facts necessary to establish the claim that is a process contemplated by pretrial discovery.compare,gutierrez,supra,cal d at,the limitations period accrues no later than the time the plaintiff learns,or should have learned,the facts essential to his claim.this language was reaffirmed and extended in norgart,supra,cal th,d,where the court concluded a father wrongful death suit was barred under section,subdivision establishing a statute of limitations in wrongful death cases because he immediately suspected some wrongdoing after his daughter death.the court stated that a plaintiff discovers the cause of action when,simply put,he at least suspects that someone has done something wrong to him citation,wrong being used,not in any technical sense,but rather in accordance with its lay understanding citation.norgart,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
norgart,on its face,appears to support the conclusion that duncan claim must be because the act of seeking legal advice and serving spivak with a notice of intent to commence legal action indicates he suspected wrongdoing by spivak.however,norgart was a wrongful death action brought against a drug manufacturer wholly outside of the context of section and did not consider the issue presented here whether suspicion triggers the commencement of the limitations period where that suspicion is allayed by contradictory objective medical fact.there is nothing in norgart that compels the conclusion that suspicion of wrongdoing as a matter of law triggers the commencement of the limitations period under section where there is also evidence of diligence in attempting to acquire medical facts to support the suspicion.rather,in rose fife,supra,a court of appeal case which examined the delayed discovery rule in the context of section,the court concluded the plaintiff claim was barred by the period because the evidence showed she had a suspicion of wrongdoing and yet did not take any affirmative action to confirm her suspicions.rose fife,supra,d at.the court did not conclude that the suspicion alone triggered the period,rather it implied that the suspicion triggered a duty to pursue facts to support that suspicion.the court held as a matter of law that a reasonable person would have suspected wrongdoing by fife and would have inquired she would have gone to find the facts rather than waiting until october for the facts to come to her.citation.ibid.thus,where the plaintiff has gone to find the facts a question of fact exists as to whether that person was diligent.ibid.acknowledging that generally the reasonability of a plaintiff belated discovery is a question of fact.
this acknowledgment that a potential plaintiff diligence is not contrary to the dissent conclusion irrelevant even when that plaintiff may suspect professional negligence comports with common sense.people generally seek the advice of professionals because they do not have the education,information or experience to reach a reasonable conclusion without professional advice as to what is causing their pain.some physical pains require medical expertise in order to determine their cause,some do not.a person who slips and falls and immediately has ankle pain knows what caused the ankle pain.if,on the other hand,that person has ankle surgery but still experiences significant residual pain,he may have no way of knowing without a medical opinion whether that is as good as his ankle is going to get or whether the surgeon performed the surgery in a negligent manner.in circumstances where a person is aware something is physically wrong,but where the cause is not readily apparent to a lay person,we conclude that person must exercise reasonable diligence in order to avoid the consequences of section limitations period.thus,once someone suspects that their physical symptoms were caused by professional negligence they do have a responsibility to exercise reasonable diligence in discovering the cause of those symptoms.and whether a person has exercised reasonable diligence to discover the cause of their injury necessarily depends on the facts of the individual case.
further strengthening this interpretation of section is the fact that in norgart and jolly the court was applying the delayed discovery doctrine to extend an otherwise limited statute of limitations.see,subd.in this case,however,as in kitzig,the delayed discovery doctrine is written into a statute to shorten an otherwise conclusive statute.thus,to the extent the court in norgart noted that the whole purpose of the application of any particular statute of limitations is to strike a balance between the public policies of giving security and stability to human affairs and,on the other hand,disposing of claims on the merits,the legislature has chosen in section to strike that balance by refusing to extend claims beyond three years and further punishing dilatory plaintiffs by limiting their limitations period to one year.see norgart,supra,cal th at,fn,d.thus,under section unlike,subd.there need be no concern that claims will be delayed indefinitely because defendants are protected by the period of limitations nonetheless.additionally,the express language of the delayed discovery rule as stated in section includes as a factor the plaintiff diligence.therefore,to the extent norgart,jolly and other cases discussing delayed discovery under other statutes imply that diligence or the reasonableness of a plaintiff reliance on medical advice is irrelevant,they are distinguishable.
finally,we note that our position also finds support in hills aronsohn,supra,d,a case quoted at length in the dissent.hills involved a woman hills malpractice claim for negligent injection of silicone in her breasts.the defendant doctor moved for summary judgment under both the and limitations periods of section.id.at.the court of appeal affirmed the trial court grant of summary judgment,concluding that hills claim was barred by the limitations period because she admitted she experienced pain in her breasts more than four years before ever filing suit.id.at.the court nevertheless analyzed the limitations issue,concluding that her action may have been timely under the one year period had it not been barred under the limitations period.the court stated that hills had to be aware of the negligent cause of her harm in order to trigger the limitations period,and that a question of fact existed as to whether she even could have discovered the negligent cause of her harm absent submitting to a serious operation.the court did not address whether hills suspected negligence,but appears to presume she did,refusing to bar hills claim based on the limitations period merely because she did not submit to an operation to uncover the negligence sooner.id.at.we refuse to hold that submitting to such drastic surgery is the sole means by which a plaintiff may make the requisite showing of diligence.here,duncan did submit to surgery in an attempt to uncover the nature of his harm,and still could not ascertain the negligent cause of his injury 
iii.kleefeld superior court 
respondent further relies on kleefeld superior court th,d kleefeld.in kleefeld the plaintiff wife died after treatment by a chiropractor and,within five days of her death in january,plaintiff contacted the board of chiropractic examiners to express his suspicion his wife received inappropriate treatment by defendant.kleefeld,supra,th at,d.approximately seven months later in august plaintiff was informed of the board decision to discipline the defendant,and plaintiff filed suit more than months after that in october.id.at,d.the court concluded plaintiff suit was on the grounds that the plaintiff immediately suspected wrongdoing and failed to file suit within one year of that suspicion.the court concluded that the plaintiff diligence was irrelevant to the running of the statute of limitations.id.at,d a plaintiffs diligence after he has become suspicious of wrongdoing is not relevant to the running of the statute of limitations once a plaintiff actually has the requisite suspicion,the statute of limitations commences to run.it is not tolled by efforts to learn more about the matter short of filing suit.
to the extent the court in kleefeld concluded that a plaintiff diligence in discovering the facts that may substantiate his or her suspicions of wrongdoing is irrelevant under section we respectfully disagree.rather,as stated by the supreme court in norgart,supra,the purpose of any statute of limitations is to protect defendants from the stale claims of dilatory plaintiffs.citations.it has as a related purpose to stimulate plaintiffs to assert fresh claims against defendants in a diligent fashion.norgart,supra,cal th at,d.thus,a plaintiff suspicion of wrongdoing should only act to accrue the limitations period where as in rose fife,supra,d,for example a plaintiff suspects wrongdoing and yet fails to act on those suspicions.in any event,kleefeld is distinguishable in that there the plaintiff waited more than one year to file suit even after he had factual confirmation of the negligent cause of the injury.kleefeld,supra,th at,d.
iv.effect of the serving of the section notice 
additionally,as we previously pointed out,the express language of section includes as a factor the plaintiff diligence and the limitations period was clearly intended to punish dilatory plaintiffs.for these reasons,unlike our colleague in dissent,we do not consider the serving of the notice of intention to commence a legal action pursuant to section to be determinative of whether the limitations period has commenced an analysis that renders the filing of a section notice absolutely determinative of the statute of limitations issue would penalize diligent plaintiffs who have sought medical confirmation of their subjective suspicions of negligence but are dissuaded by contrary objective medical fact.penalizing a diligent plaintiff,under a provision of a statute intended to penalize dilatory plaintiffs,is contrary to the statute and contrary to basic fairness.moreover,there is nothing in section which compels such a conclusion.to the contrary,the purpose of section is to encourage the parties to settle their dispute prior to the filing of a lawsuit in order to decrease the number of litigated malpractice actions.see woods young cal d.this legislative goal surely is not furthered by holding that,as a matter of law,the filing of the notice under section starts the proverbial clock ticking on the limitations period in section.instead,such a holding would encourage plaintiffs to file suit even where they have no objective basis for believing their claim to be meritorious we do not dispute that the serving of a section notice may be a determinative factor in a case where,for example,there is evidence of suspicion but no attempts to confirm that suspicion.however,we can not agree that it is a determinative factor in every case as a matter of law.instead,we conclude that the serving of a section notice is,in this case,merely a factor that the jury can consider when deciding whether a particular plaintiff was diligent.
v.this case 
if,under the facts of this case duncan harbored suspicions and yet failed to seek any further medical advice for a year,we would rely on the statutory language to conclude that he,through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,that a staple placed by spivak was the cause of his pain similarly,if duncan waited more than one year after his april surgery to file suit we would not hesitate to apply the limitations period against him.however,the evidence indicates that duncan diligently tried to discover whether something spivak did caused his pain.under these facts,we can not as a matter of law conclude he has either discovered his injury or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered his injury simply because he harbors some suspicion of wrongdoing.we believe such a situation is what the limitations period was intended to protect against.see rose fife,supra,d at.the period begins to run when the plaintiff discovers the harmful effect,the physical manifestation of the wrongful act.the negligent cause of that effect is not a concern for the period.thus,we conclude the appropriate standard under section is that a plaintiff suspicion of wrongdoing only accrues the period of limitations against him if he fails to be diligent in his attempts to confirm that suspicion or if his suspicions are confirmed or the cause of his injury obvious and he fails to file suit.see,also,enfield hunt,supra,d at.determining a question of fact existed regarding a plaintiff diligence where evidence available to plaintiff and his attorney indicated plaintiff would have a weak or unmeritorious case.it would be contrary to public policy to reach a result in this case which would in effect require an attorney to file a malpractice action at a time when the evidence available to the attorney indicates the action has no merit.this approach comports with the statute itself and presents no unjust result to the defendant,who is protected by the limitations period in any event.
there is some dispute in the record regarding when duncan subjectively believed spivak had done something wrong to him.spivak urges that duncan consultation with a lawyer eliminates any possibility duncan did not have a subjective belief spivak had done something wrong.duncan testified in his deposition that he knew something was wrong but he was not sure spivak was the cause.as we explain,however,duncan subjective belief is not the only factor to consider when deciding the accrual of the period where there is evidence of diligence in discovery of the facts.thus,we reject spivak contention below and on appeal that evidence of diligence is irrelevant.accordingly,there is a triable issue of fact regarding whether duncan was diligent in discovering the facts which formed the elements of his claim.if the jury concludes he was not reasonably diligent in attempting to confirm those suspicions,then the period accrued when the jury determines he suspected spivak of wrongdoing.
b.the loss of consortium claim 
the statute of limitations for loss of consortium is one year from the date of the spouse injury,and there is no tolling during the pendency of the spouse personal injury action.priola paulino d.meighan shore th,d.the accrual of a cause of action for loss of consortium may be delayed pursuant to the discovery rule until the plaintiff is aware of the injury and its negligent cause.uram abex d.jolly eli lilly,supra,cal d at.accordingly,whether duncan claim was timely filed will depend on when the jury concludes the limitations period commenced against duncan.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed.costs are awarded to appellant.
i dissent,respectfully.the trial court was correct.russell duncan duncan february service of a notice of intent to sue yemelyan spivak spivak for injuries caused by spivak professional negligence started the running of the statute of limitations.duncan failure to file his lawsuit within that limitations period bars his claim.
the majority concludes that the service of the notice of intent to sue is but one of several relevant factors the trier of fact may consider in determining whether duncan was diligent in discovering the facts which formed the elements of his claim,ante,at.that presents two concerns for me.first,to the extent the notice of intent to sue is one of several factors to consider,it is the trump card,and as such,it decides this case as a matter of law.second,phrasing the issue as whether duncan was diligent in discovering the facts which formed the elements of his claim presents a fundamental difference of opinion between us as to what code of civil procedure section is all about.
i believe the issue of diligence died with the service of the notice of intent to sue,that the notice of intent to sue constitutes duncan admission that he then believed spivak professional negligence caused him injury,and that the limitations period started to run with that service.
i also believe that whether duncan was diligent in discovering the facts to form the elements of his claim after february is irrelevant to a statute of limitations analysis in professional negligence cases.facts are not necessary to start the running of the limitations period.a layperson suspicions of harm caused by professional wrongdoing will suffice.once the limitations period began to run,duncan had only to timely file his lawsuit to be compliant with section.his failure to discover facts tending to support his cause of action,with or without diligence,does not toll,suspend,or extend the limitations period.nor does the early discovery of the supportive facts shorten the limitations period.whether duncan ever discovered the facts necessary to file his lawsuit is simply not part of this legal issue.
the interpretation and application of the discovery exception to the statute of limitations of section begins with a fundamental understanding of statutes of limitations,accrual of causes of action,and the related discovery rule.our supreme court most recent discussion of these subjects is in norgart upjohn cal th,d.in norgart,the court explained the following about the statute of limitations 
statute of limitations is the collective term commonly applied to a great number of acts,or parts of acts,that prescribe the periods beyond which a plaintiff may not bring a cause of action.citations.it has as a purpose to protect defendants from the stale claims of dilatory plaintiffs.citations.it has as a related purpose to stimulate plaintiffs to assert fresh claims against defendants in a diligent fashion.citations.inasmuch as it necessarily fix es a definite period of time citation,it operates conclusively across the board,and not flexibly on a basis.citations.that is to say,a cause of action brought by a plaintiff within the limitations period applicable thereto is not barred,even if,in fact,the former is stale and the latter dilatory contrariwise,a cause of action brought by a plaintiff outside such period is barred,even if,in fact,the former is fresh and the latter diligent.norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d.
the court in norgart recognized that it is for the legislature alone to establish any particular limitations period under any particular statute of limitations,subject only to constitutional restraints.norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d.a plaintiff,naturally,must file suit within the applicable limitations period after accrual of the cause of action.id.at,d.the court summarized the accrual rules as follows 
the general rule for defining the accrual of a cause of action sets the date as the time when,under the substantive law,the wrongful act is done,or the wrongful result occurs,and the consequent liability arises.citation.in other words,it sets the date as the time when the cause of action is complete with all of its elements citations the elements being generically referred to by sets of terms such as wrongdoing or wrongful conduct,cause or causation,and harm or injury citations.norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d.
the court further recognized the most important exception to the general rule defining the accrual of a cause of action is the discovery rule,which may be expressed by the legislature or implied by the courts.norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d.the discovery rule postpones accrual of a cause of action until the plaintiff discovers,or has reason to discover,the cause of action.ibid.the court noted that as it explained in jolly eli lilly cal d,
t he plaintiff discovers the cause of action when he at least suspects a factual basis,as opposed to a legal theory,for its elements,even if he lacks knowledge,simply put,he at least suspects that someone has done something wrong to him citation,wrong being used,not in any technical sense,but rather in accordance with its lay understanding citation.he has reason to discover the cause of action when he has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.citation.he has reason to suspect when he has notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry citation he need not know the specific facts necessary to establish the cause of action rather,he may seek to learn such facts through the process contemplated by pretrial discovery but,within the applicable limitations period,he must indeed seek to learn the facts necessary to bring the cause of action in the first can not wait for them to find him and sit on his rights he must go find them himself if he can and file suit if he does citation.norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted,quoting jolly eli lilly,supra,cal d at.
thus,the determination of whether a plaintiff has discovered the cause of action is made from the layperson point of view.further,norgart makes clear a plaintiff mere suspicion of wrongdoing is enough to constitute discovery the plaintiff need not have actual knowledge of the elements of his or her claim.instead,the plaintiff has the applicable limitations period to learn the facts necessary to bring the cause of action.in case there was any doubt about this concept,the court clarified it by explaining 
not inconsistent with the proposition that the plaintiff discovers the cause of action when he at least suspects a factual basis for its elements,even if he lacks knowledge thereof,is language like that which appears in jolly,to the effect that a suspicion of one or more of the elements of a cause of action,coupled with a knowledge of the others,will commence the applicable limitations period.citation.such words do not cast doubt on the sufficiency of suspicion of the elements of a cause of action without knowledge.to quote jolly again a plaintiff need not know the specific facts necessary to establish the cause of action.citation.rather,such words merely make plain what is true a sufficiency of suspicion of one or more of the elements with knowledge of the others.norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,fn,d,italics in original,citing jolly eli lilly,supra,cal d at.
this rule is consistent with california supreme court cases applying the discovery rule to professional negligence actions under section,sanchez south hoover hospital cal d,and gutierrez mofid cal d,both of which the court in norgart noted the jolly decision relied upon.norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d.as the court explained in rose fife d.
our supreme court has often discussed the rule requirement of discovery of the negligent cause of injury.when a plaintiff has information which would put a reasonable person on inquiry,when a plaintiff reasonably founded suspicions have been aroused and the plaintiff has become alerted to the necessity for investigation and pursuit of his or her remedies,the period commences.possession of presumptive as well as actual knowledge will commence the running of the statute.sanchez south hoover hospital,supra,cal d at,accord jolly eli lilly,supra,cal d at,gutierrez mofid,supra,cal d at.
thus,in sanchez the court held the statute of limitations began to run on a plaintiff medical malpractice claim when the plaintiff,who had remained in the hospital eight days following the birth of her stillborn baby,with continuous drainage from a caesarean incision she felt was not healing properly,had become alerted to the necessity for investigation.sanchez south hoover hospital,supra,cal d at.the court stated the plaintiff reasonably founded suspicions were undeniably aroused while she was in the hospital,both by the recognition of her own symptoms and by external corroboration in the form of a hospital employee statement,upon observing her condition,that they have done a mess with you.id.at.the court concluded the statute clearly began to run when the plaintiff was discharged from the hospital on march,since her deposition revealed she believed she had been a victim of malpractice.id.at.as the court explained referring to her state of mind at the time of discharge she said yes,i did think they had done something wrong because of all the time that i stayed there suffering.it is fair to conclude that by march,plaintiff had become alerted to the necessity for investigation and pursuit of her remedies.the statute of limitations commenced,and since more than one year elapsed before her complaint was filed the action was manifestly barred.ibid.
our supreme court in gutierrez cited the same rule from sanchez a plaintiff is charged with presumptive knowledge of his negligent injury,and the statute commences to run,once he has notice or information of circumstances to put a reasonable person on inquiry,or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his investigation gutierrez mofid,supra,cal d at,italics in original,citing sanchez south hoover hospital,supra,cal d at.while,as the majority points out,the plaintiff in gutierrez was clearly aware of the facts that formed the basis of her claim,the physician had performed a hysterectomy instead of an operation for appendicitis or to remove a tumor,the court did not limit the discovery rule in professional negligence cases to situations where the plaintiff knows the facts that form the basis of the claim.the court,instead,concluded that if one has suffered appreciable harm and knows or suspects that professional blundering is its cause,the fact that an attorney has not yet advised him does not postpone commencement of the limitations period.gutierrez mofid,supra,at,italics added.
in short,our supreme court has established a standard for the discovery rule that a plaintiff discovers his or her cause of action when he or she suspects a factual basis for its elements,when he or she has information which would prompt a reasonable person to make inquiry about the claim,not when the accuracy or validity of suspicions is confirmed or sufficient information to succeed on the claim is acquired.
the majority opinion ante,at pp.states,in relevant part,as follows 
duncan of course knew of his physical condition immediately upon waking from the original operation.it is reasonable to conclude he further at least suspected its negligent cause,at the latest,when he consulted an attorney in february of.his suspicions were allayed,however,when subsequent physicians concluded his physical condition did not have a negligent cause.he did not discover the facts essential to his claim,that a staple from the original surgery was in fact the cause of his physical condition until april when exploratory surgery by yet another doctor revealed the offending surgical staple.thus,were we to hold,as a matter of law,that duncan harbored the requisite subjective suspicion necessary to accrue the period of limitations when he consulted with the attorney in,we would be requiring him to sue during a time that there was absolutely no objective basis for believing any malpractice had occurred.
i have four concerns with the language.first,i do not understand the evidence to be that duncan physicians in concluded that his physical condition did not have a negligent cause.the evidence simply indicates they could not find the staple in march,or any apparent cause of duncan symptoms accordingly,duncan attorney concluded in april that it would be impossible to establish any negligent cause of duncan pain.second,the law did not require duncan to have an objective basis for the filing of litigation.clearly,a subjective belief was sufficient.third,duncan subjective opinion did not have to be based on all facts necessary to prove his case.those facts were to be discovered during the remainder of the statute of limitations period or during pretrial discovery.fourth,the quoted portion of the majority analysis does not even mention the service of the notice of intent to sue required by section and served in february.
section,subdivision a provides that n o action based upon the health care provider professional negligence may be commenced unless the defendant has been given at least days prior notice of the intention to commence the action.while no particular form of notice is required,the notice must notify the defendant of the legal basis of the claim and the type of loss sustained,including with specificity the nature of the injuries suffered,subd.b.for purposes of section,professional negligence means negligent act or omission to act by a health care provider in the rendering of professional services,which act or omission is the proximate cause of a personal injury or wrongful death,provided that such services are within the scope of services for which the provider is licensed and which are not within any restriction imposed by the licensing agency or licensed hospital,subd.f.
the purpose of the waiting period required by section,subdivision a before filing a medical malpractice action is to decrease the number of medical malpractice actions filed by establishing a procedure that encourages the parties to negotiate outside the structure and atmosphere of the formal litigation process.citations.woods young cal d.the section notice,however,serves more than this purpose it also evidences a plaintiff intent to sue.see,bennett shahhal th,fn,d plaintiff notice clearly evidenced the specific intent to sue.the plaintiff decides when to give the statutory notice of intent to sue.woods young,supra,at.thus,the triggering event in all cases for accrual purposes is not necessarily service of the section notice of intent to sue instead,it is awareness of the cause of action,which in this case is shown by duncan suspicion of wrongdoing as evidenced by the section notice of intent to sue.naturally,a plaintiff may refrain from serving a section notice of intent to sue until during the last days of the limitations period,thereby extending the limitations period for and days from the date of accrual of the cause of action.woods young,supra,at.
the above cited decisions of our supreme court merely require a layperson to suspect a factual basis in order to start the running of the statute of limitations.however,here,duncan did more than suspect a factual basis.pursuant to section,subdivision b,he told spivak the following 
please be advised,pursuant to code of civil procedure,that russell duncan intends on commencing a legal action against you for professional negligence.it is claimant contention that as a result of your professional negligence they sic suffered personal injuries and related damages including,but not limited to,medical,hospital and incidental expenses physical and mental pain and suffering and loss of earnings.
the record of duncan suspicions of medical negligence in february could not be more clear.thus,when duncan served the section notice,duncan had discovered his cause of action he had knowledge of injury the pain suspicion of wrongdoing and suspicion that the injury was caused by spivak improper care.the service of the notice conclusively established that the statutory period commenced in february.because the evidence demonstrates,as a matter of law,that the statutory period commenced over one year before duncan filed his lawsuit,his negligence claim against spivak is barred.
one has to wonder why duncan attorney served the notice of intent to sue in february.it was served merely four months after the initial surgery or,more importantly,months before the,statute of limitations if one assumes that the notice of intent to sue can be served within days of october,the anniversary of the initial surgery,thereby extending the limitations period.one assumes service was made in good faith and based on duncan subjective opinion.based on the record,one also assumes it was served without a medical opinion to substantiate it.so,what was the hurry the answer to that question has not been pointed to in the record.however,the practical effect of its service is that when duncan filed his action in october,he was saying that he was correct in his suspicions in february but he just did not know it as well as he did more than a year later.unfortunately,in my view,his premature service of the section notice now bars his action.
the majority acknowledges that norgart and jolly state that a plaintiff discovers the cause of action when the plaintiff suspects someone has done something wrong to him or her,but contends that nothing in norgart compels the conclusion that a suspicion of wrongdoing commences the limitations period under section where there is also evidence of diligence in attempting to acquire medical facts to support the suspicion,ante.this ignores,however,the critical fact that duncan served the section notice.once the notice was served,diligence was no longer an issue for limitations purposes,since duncan had discovered his claim.once the notice was served,suspicion,and the fact that the suspicion was allayed by inconclusive or contradictory objective medical fact,was no longer an issue for limitations purposes.once the notice was served,the limitations period commenced to run,and duncan obligation was to seek to learn the facts necessary to bring the cause of action within the following period,and file suit if he did.see,norgart upjohn,supra,cal th at,d,within the applicable limitations period,the plaintiff must indeed seek to learn the facts necessary to bring the cause of action in the first place he must go find them himself if he can and file suit if he does italics added.
the fact that duncan later obtained another medical opinion that suggested spivak did not render negligent treatment can not thereafter have an effect on the running of the statute of limitations.to hold otherwise would be to establish a rule that the statute of limitations may be suspended or tolled if a plaintiff belief that his or her health care provider was negligent changes.this is not what section states.see kleefeld superior court th,d no tolling provision in the limitation,not even for fraud or concealment,much less for the pursuit of evidence of negligence sanchez south hoover hospital,supra,cal d at.
i also find support for that conclusion in the analogous circumstances described by our supreme court in gutierrez mofid,supra,cal d.the court held that the discovery limitations period for medical malpractice is not delayed,suspended,or tolled when a plaintiff with actual or constructive knowledge of the facts underlying his malpractice claim is told by an attorney that he has no legal remedy.id.at.the court reasoned that since the plaintiff presumptive knowledge of her claim caused her to seek legal advice,as well as start the running of the limitations period,the fact she received discouraging legal advice which led to loss of a cause of action was not a risk that should be borne by the defendant doctor.id.at.similarly,the fact that duncan attorney prematurely served notice of intent to sue and then abandoned him,and the fact that duncan first exploratory surgeon missed the offending staple,should not be risks borne by spivak.
moreover,to allow a plaintiff to wait to file suit until his or her suspicions of wrongdoing are confirmed by another health care provider runs contrary to norgart and jolly,which require only a layperson suspicions regarding negligent injury to commence the limitations period.in addition,such a rule effectively resurrects former section,which was repealed by its terms effective january.former section required the attorney for a plaintiff in an action for professional negligence to file a certificate of merit on or before the date of service of the complaint declaring that the attorney had consulted at least one licensed physician and surgeon,dentist,podiatrist or chiropractor knowledgeable in the relevant issues,and that the attorney concluded on the basis of such review and consultation that there is reasonable and meritorious cause for the filing of such action.stats,ch.
the majority attempts to distinguish the cases of norgart and jolly by claiming they do not specifically discuss the discovery rule as set forth in section.as discussed above,however,th
