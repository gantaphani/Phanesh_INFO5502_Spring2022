no satisfactory excuse can be made for the district court delay of over twelve years in entering findings of fact and conclusions of law after a bench trial.having carefully reviewed the record,however,we are convinced that the judge determinations not only are unassailable on appeal but represent the most plausible analysis of the conflicting expert testimony at the heart of this federal tort claims act ftca case.the judgment is affirmed.
background 
on october,wendell and patricia hollis,next friends of their daughter mariana hollis,filed suit for damages pursuant to the ftca alleging that following mariana premature birth at the william beaumont army medical center wbamc,in texas,she received insufficient and negligent medical care,which rendered her blind.a bench trial began on january,and concluded on february.the parties submitted briefs.there was no further activity until the court rendered judgment more than years later in favor of the defendant.
the district court made the following relevant findings of fact and conclusions of law at the time of the events from which the claim arose,wendell hollis was an army officer stationed at fort bliss,texas.on february,his wife patricia hollis gave birth to a very premature daughter,mariana,at wbamc in el paso,texas.mariana weighed roughly one pound five ounces at birth grams,and her chances for survival were very uncertain.while hospitalized,mariana was monitored and treated for diseases and conditions to which premature infants are subject,particularly lung problems and retinopathy of prematurity rop,the latter of which gave rise to the instant lawsuit.suffering rop is recognized as a risk of premature infants,particularly those like mariana,who weigh less than grams at birth.many premature infants are also born with respiratory problems,which require the use of supplemental oxygen.it was known at the time of mariana birth that the use of supplemental oxygen increased the risk that the infant would develop rop.once rop developed,it progressed in stages.if the rop was detected by examination at an early stage,and if the health of the infant permitted,the use of supplemental oxygen could be discontinued.regardless whether the condition was detected whether the use of oxygen was discontinued,a certain percentage of rop cases regressed naturally and spontaneously.at rop stage five,the retina would completely detach,and the infant would be rendered blind in that eye.at the time of mariana birth,a surgical procedure called a vitrectomy existed to reattach the retina however,the success rate was not high.
when mariana was approximately seven weeks old,an rop examination was conducted,and the results were negative.thereafter,mariana continued to breathe with the assistance of supplemental oxygen.roughly six weeks later,when she was weeks old,a second rop examination was performed.this time,rop was discovered,with detachment of the retina in both eyes.mariana was thereafter seen by specialists and underwent a vitrectomy to attempt to reattach the retina of one eye however,the surgery was unsuccessful,and mariana sustained total and permanent loss of vision.
the plaintiffs contended that the physicians at wbamc failed to obtain their informed consent to the use of oxygen to help mariana breathe.the district court determined under texas law that the plaintiffs failed to prove a lack of informed consent,because wendell hollis testified that doctors did inform him that the use of oxygen could cause mariana eyes to suffer retinal detachment and,although the doctors never used the word blind,the consent which was obtained after this warning was sufficiently informed.the district court further concluded that any lack of informed consent was not the proximate cause of the damage suffered,because mariana had such severe respiratory problems that withholding oxygen was not a viable option,as the alternative was probably death.
the court found that a more difficult issue raised by the plaintiffs was whether the timing and frequency of the rop examinations fell below the requisite standard of care.the court recognized that the plaintiffs experts contended that waiting six weeks to make a second rop examination fell below the standard of care applicable in.the court,however,made the following findings and concluded that the timing of the examination did not fall below the applicable standard of care and,further,that the timing of the examination could not be established as the proximate cause of mariana blindness in,the medical profession recognized that a certain percentage of premature babies would fall victim to rop and that,in a certain percentage of those cases,detached retinas would occur cases of rop were found even in premature babies who were not on supplemental oxygen many premature babies using supplemental oxygen did not fall victim to rop at the time of mariana birth,neither the american academy of pediatrics nor the academy of ophthalmologists had adopted a standard calling for the frequent examinations advocated by plaintiffs academy of ophthalmologists advocated the examination of a premature infant before discharge and of those showing signs of rop,and the pediatric academy called for examinations before discharge and every three to six months thereafter it was impossible to tell from the medical evidence in mariana case when the rop process began or when it reached the stage of retinal detachment therefore,whether an exam conducted within three weeks of the first exam,as was advocated by plaintiffs experts,would have disclosed commencement of the rop process was speculation and the alternative treatments cryotherapy,scleral buckling,and vitamin e therapy which the plaintiffs argued could have been provided had the rop been diagnosed prior to stage five were experimental and controversial,and whether mariana doctors would have recommended them and whether her parents would have consented were pure speculation.
the court therefore determined that the plaintiffs had not established that the physicians treatment fell below the applicable standard of care as it existed in and,further,that assuming arguendo the physicians had been negligent,the plaintiffs had failed to show that the negligence was a proximate cause of mariana blindness.the court thus rendered judgment in favor of the government.the plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.

informed consent 
appellants initially complain that the district court disregard ed the consent issue because its reasons for judgment dealt only with the issue of oxygen,and nowhere did the court discuss the withholding of treatment for the emerging rop and the failure to inform them of the alternative treatments available.
with regard to the issues of withholding treatment for the emerging rop or informing the parents of what treatments were available,appellants have failed to demonstrate that these allegations sustain a cause of action for failure to obtain informed consent.at trial,the plaintiffs argued that if a therapy other than a vitrectomy had been available at stage three of the rop,the doctors were required to inform them of that alternative treatment,and,in turn,the plaintiffs would then have had the opportunity to give the necessary informed consent thus,the doctors omissions caused a lack of informed consent.the definitive response to these contentions was,however,pointed out by the district court mariana disease was not discovered at stage three.plaintiffs purely hypothetical argument is not viable in light of the fact that mariana rop was not discovered until stage five.
moreover,the district court did address the availability of alternative treatments in the context of the
