the detroit international bridge company dibc and its parent centra,collectively centra,believed that more divided them from windsor,ontario than united them.for one thing,the detroit river separates windsor from michigan.for another,windsor and centra disagreed as to the future of the ambassador bridge,the bridge that spans the detroit river while centra sought to add a second span to the bridge,windsor wanted to stop that expansion.yet centra was wrong in concluding that more divided than united.it turns out that windsor and centra were both employing the same law firm,gowling lafleur henderson,llp gowlings while windsor hired gowlings to help the city oppose the second span,centra hired gowlings to help the company raise money to fund the construction of that same span.although centra wanted to expand its connection to windsor,it was hoping to do so with an additional bridge,not by sharing legal counsel thus,centra sued gowlings for damages,alleging breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duties,and legal malpractice.the district court granted summary judgment for gowlings,holding that centra impliedly consented to any conflict of interest in gowlings simultaneous representation of adverse clients regarding the construction of the second span of the ambassador bridge.the district court found implied consent because it concluded that centra was aware that gowlings had previously represented parties including windsor directly adverse to centra in cases where gowlings was not representing centra.we believe that the district court erred in its granting of summary judgment.centra established genuine issues of material fact regarding not only whether it impliedly consented to the conflict of interest,but also whether it could even consent to the conflict in the first instance.furthermore,the district court abused its discretion in granting summary judgment prior to discovery.we,therefore,reverse the district court judgment and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
factual background 
t he ambassador bridge the bridge which spans between windsor,ontario and detroit,michigan is owned jointly by related parties of centra joint appendix at pls.br.in opp to defs.mot.for summ.at internal quotation marks omitted citation omitted.dibc,along with its subsidiary,the canadian transit company ctc,owns,operates and maintains the ambassador bridge,the busiest and single most important commercial border crossing between canada and the united states.at first am.compl.dan stamper is president of both dibc and ctc.
between and,gowlings had consistently represented centra in a variety of matters.gowlings is one of canada largest law firms,with eight offices throughout canada and one in moscow.at defs.br.in supp.of mot.for summ.at.despite centra longtime association with gowlings,gowlings partner david estrin estrin has occasionally taken adverse positions to centra.for example,in,estrin began to represent the buffalo and fort erie public bridge authority,and through that representation estrin learned that centra planned to build a competing bridge in close proximity to the one that the buffalo and fort erie public bridge authority operated.in order to defend his client interests,on may,estrin wrote a letter to stamper on gowlings letterhead on behalf of the buffalo and fort erie public bridge authority.in that letter,estrin declared of gowlings that w e are the solicitors for the buffalo and fort erie public bridge authority.at letter from estrin to ambassador bridge may.estrin sent a letter to the same effect on september.
in,estrin accepted another client whose interests would soon turn adverse to centra the city of windsor.according to centra,windsor has long worked to frustrate centra plans,having opposed and hindered the development,maintenance and operation of the ambassador bridge.at first am.compl.yet when windsor first hired estrin and gowlings,it was to help the city resolve problems with the high volume of traffic from the ambassador bridge,a role not directly adverse to centra.according to estrin,however,the general representation of windsor gradually turned adverse to ctc,a centra subsidiary.at,david estrin decl.what prompted the turn toward adversity was centra filing of two plans involving the ambassador bridge in june,ctc applied to windsor for site plan approval for more toll booths as well as a bridge deck extension the site plan for the existing ambassador bridge.a month later,ctc filed a preliminary review permit application with the united states coast guard for twinning the ambassador bridge the bridge plan.at estrin decl.t winning the ambassador bridge refers to building a second bridge a twin alongside the original.
estrin,on behalf of windsor,opposed the site plan but did not explicitly take a position as to the bridge plan.on september,estrin sent a letter to stamper in response to the site plan,and the letter included notice of gowlings role a s you know,we are the solicitors for the city of windsor concerning this matter.at letter from estrin to stamper.estrin and gowlings involvement in opposing centra site plan was even clearer to centra on september,when windsor officials,estrin,stamper,and other centra representatives met to negotiate a resolution regarding the site plan.
estrin believed that the bridge plan and the site plan were directly related therefore,estrin claims that his opposition to the site plan also served as opposition to the bridge plan.stamper,however,viewed the site plan as a matter totally separate from the bridge plan the plaza deck expansion has absolutely nothing to do with and is not part of or dependent upon the development of dibc proposal to build a second span at the ambassador bridge at,dan stamper decl.whether or not the parties initially believed that the site plan and bridge plan were related,the site plan settlement between centra and windsor explicitly disentangled the two plans 
the corporation windsor confirms and the owner centra acknowledges that the corporation approval of the development contemplated by the subject site plan application does not constitute an endorsement by the corporation of the proposal by the owner to twin the existing ambassador bridge as proposed in the owner july,preliminary review permit application,or a waiver by the corporation of the corporation right to require an official amendment or otherwise object to or deny the corporation approval for a second ambassador bridge span or twinning including any works or undertakings required or to be used for the purpose,nor shall the corporation approval of the development contemplated by the subject site plan application or any associated or corollary approval or agreement be pleaded as an estoppel of the corporation in that regard.
at site plan control.
furthermore,in and,estrin defended against centra objections windsor proposed regulations regarding transportation infrastructure,which specifically mentioned the ambassador bridge as subject to the regulations.thus,centra was aware that gowlings and estrin were representing windsor adverse interests in several matters in which gowlings was not representing centra,but centra allegedly was not aware of any of gowlings and estrin work on behalf of windsor in opposing the bridge plan.
despite awareness of gowlings occasional representations of other clients with interests adverse to centra,centra continued to employ gowlings,which had been one of its law firms for over twenty years.for instance,in june,stamper sought gowlings assistance in certain tax work.before accepting the work,a gowlings attorney searched for any potential conflicts of interest but did not identify any.then again,most importantly for the case at hand,in november,centra sought gowlings assistance in creating a to bond offering by which to finance the twinning of the ambassador bridge.shortly thereafter,windsor employed gowlings to help the city oppose the bridge plan.on september,estrin sent a letter to the coast guard opposing the construction of the twin bridge.according to centra,as a result of estrin letter,the coast guard demanded an environmental assessment from centra that will cost centra on the united states side of the bridge and on the canadian side.thus,by september,gowlings was simultaneously helping centra procure funding for the bridge expansion and assisting windsor in trying to halt the bridge expansion.
both centra and gowlings claimed ignorance as to this conflict of interest.according to stamper i was not aware that gowlings was representing windsor in opposition to the second span until september,when i saw estrin letter to the coast guard opposing the second span.at stamper decl.estrin claimed to be even more clueless until a few weeks before centra filed this lawsuit,i was completely unaware that centra,dibc,or ctc had retained gowlings on any other matter.at no time have i had communications with anyone associated with gowlings about any work that they may have done on behalf of centra,dibc or ctc.at estrin decl.
despite estrin assertions that he knew nothing about gowlings prior work for centra,centra alleged in its lawsuit that estrin may have possessed a legal memorandum that had been previously prepared for centra.between and,centra was engaged in lengthy litigation with canada regarding the ownership and possession of the canadian half of the bridge.during the course of this litigation,gowlings acquired extensive information regarding centra and the ambassador bridge 
in the course of gowlings serving as the companies representative before cra canada revenue agency with respect to the controversies,the companies revealed detailed,confidential financial and operational information about the ambassador bridge and shared other confidential information about the companies efforts to preserve and enhance the value of their franchise to own and operate the ambassador bridge and be in a position to expand replace that bridge when necessary to meet competitive threats posed by other border crossing facilities.
at,fred calderone decl.of particular interest was a memorandum that the firm of goodman goodman created that compiled all of the documents,both public and private,that goodman goodman believed to be the documents proper and relevant to the defense of centra to an encroachment upon their ownership and control by the city of windsor,the province of ontario and the dominion of canada.at,patrick moran decl.although a different law firm prepared the memorandum,centra provided to gowlings the goodman legal memorandum and all of its supporting documents.this collection of materials,according to centra,is very similar to the research that estrin described in his letter to the coast guard.
procedural background 
on november,centra filed a diversity action against estrin and gowlings in the district court for the eastern district of michigan.on december,centra filed its first amended complaint.the amended complaint sought relief for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duties,and legal malpractice,all stemming from gowlings simultaneous and adverse representation of both centra and windsor.
before any opportunity for discovery,gowlings requested summary judgment as well as dismissal.centra filed a federal rule of civil procedure f motion requesting that the district court first allow an opportunity for discovery 
the two motions cite and rely upon exhibits,almost all of which fall outside of the pleadings.part of these exhibits are affidavits containing numerous factual allegations that are highly disputed by plaintiffs.defendants,without the plaintiffs having the opportunity to depose the affiants,much less having the benefit of any discovery,would have this court accept these allegations as true,accurate and undisputed.
at pls.mot.to conduct disc.at.on february,the district court denied centra motion to conduct discovery.when centra asserted that a total lack of discovery left it with the evidentiary equivalent of a half deck of cards,the district court responded that i do think there is an adequate showing under rule f to permit discovery.it seems to me like you got at least your two aces plus a lot of other cards up your sleeve,and i going to require that you file a response.at,mot.to conduct disc.hr g at.
on april,the district court granted gowlings motion for summary judgment.according to the district court,plaintiffs confine their lawsuit to michigan rules of professional conduct a,and argue that defendants did not properly obtain plaintiffs consent regarding this conflict.while not necessarily applying michigan law,a number of courts have recognized that the client may impliedly waive its consent to an attorney conflict of interest.at,order granting summ.at.determining that it was legally possible for centra to waive any objections to gowlings conflict of interest,the district court concluded that stamper continued retention of gowlings effectuated waiver after years of notice regarding gowlings representations of other clients with interests adverse to centra 
although stamper declares that he was unaware of gowlings representation of windsor until september,the court finds that this testimony is fatally inconsistent with the uncontested facts regarding the september letter to stamper,the meeting later that month where the parties discussed the site plan,which he and defendant estrin both attended,and the resulting february site plan agreement that also mentioned the bridge plan.
at order at.because the conflict was waived,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of gowlings.the district court order made no mention of centra claims regarding gowlings use of confidential material.
on may,centra filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.analysis 
a.the grant of summary.the applicable law 
in diversity cases we apply the rules and substantive law of the forum state,which is michigan in this case.himmel ford motor,cir.the issues before us touch on matters of professional responsibility,suggesting some important questions as to the appropriate choice of law for this case.under similar circumstances,we have applied the forum state standards in a malpractice action.woodruff tomlin,cir.en banc,cert.denied,d.however,we need not resolve the exact question of what michigan principles would indicate as the applicable standards of professional conduct because,for the issues we must address today,michigan standards of professional conduct are consistent with the other possible sources of law,making any asserted conflict of laws a false conflict.williams toys r us,cir unpublished.for instance,the district court for the eastern district of michigan has adopted the michigan rules of professional conduct as the applicable federal rules of professional conduct.see district court for the eastern district of michigan,local rule b.in addition,the restatement third of the law governing lawyers restatement and the edition of the american bar association aba model rules of professional conduct aba model rules are consistent with michigan rules of professional conduct in all respects that now appear relevant for this case.thus,we will apply the michigan rules of professional conduct,and we will look to the aba model rules and restatement to provide elaboration.
at oral argument,gowlings counsel asserted that michigan standards of professional conduct do not apply to this case.he claimed that,because this was a civil action and not a disciplinary matter,the michigan rules of professional conduct have no bearing on the question of whether the district court correctly granted summary judgment.gowlings counsel is correct that a violation of michigan rules of professional conduct does not by itself give rise to an actionable claim.the michigan rules state 
failure to comply with an obligation or prohibition imposed by a rule is a basis for invoking the disciplinary process.the rules do not,however,give rise to a cause of action for enforcement of a rule or for damages caused by failure to comply with an obligation or prohibition imposed by a rule.
prof l conduct b emphasis added centra,however,does not assert that gowlings alleged violations of the michigan rules of professional conduct are themselves actionable instead,centra asserts claims of breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duties,and legal malpractice.
although rule b makes it clear that a plaintiff can not seek damages for a violation of the michigan rules of professional conduct,a violation of the rules may be probative in establishing an independent cause of action.for instance,the michigan court of appeals considered the michigan rules of professional conduct in a civil contract action that determined that a fee agreement was unenforceable.evans luptak,plc lizza.the court in evans luptak stated that although t he rules do not give rise to a cause of action for enforcement of a rule or for damages caused by failure to comply with an obligation or prohibition imposed by a rule,the rules are still admissible and relevant under the michigan rules of evidence and other provisions of law.id.at.subsequent michigan court of appeals cases have embraced this position and have approved of the use of the rules of professional conduct when the plaintiffs do not rely solely on the rules to establish their claim,but instead refer to the rules only as evidence of the standard of care,recker malson,wl,at,unpublished,and have allowed juries to be instructed as to those rules in such cases,deluca jehle,wl,at,unpublished.we believe that it is clear that the rules are probative and instructive for the instant case,particularly as they relate to centra malpractice and claims 
centra claims rely upon michigan rules of professional conduct as evidence of the appropriate standard of care,not as causes of action themselves.centra first alleges a breach of contract.although one michigan appellate panel has suggested that violations of the michigan rules of professional conduct can not normally constitute a breach of contract,biedul jay siefman,wl,at,unpublished,centra claim is not that narrow.centra not only alleges that gowlings conflict of interest breached its contract to represent centra zealously without reference to michigan rules,at first am.compl,but also alleges that gowlings use of confidential information violated the parties agreements,at first am.compl.although it would seem to us that a claim,even if factually premised upon a conflict of interest,does not rely upon the michigan rules of professional conduct as a cause of action,we need not determine the full reach of biedul holding because the latter allegation regarding the use of confidential information is certainly not dependent upon a violation the michigan rules of professional conduct.similarly,centra claim of breach of fiduciary duties made no mention of gowlings obligations under michigan rules of professional conduct.lastly,centra claim was grounded in gowlings alleged failure to act as a reasonable attorney would have acted,at first am.compl.centra raised michigan rules of professional conduct only in response to gowlings motion for summary judgment,which had asserted that centra waived the conflict of interest.see at pls.br.in opp.to defs.mot.for summ.at.
centra complaint asserts claims of breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duties,and legal malpractice.these claims are not dependent upon a violation of the michigan rules of professional conduct tort law and contract law provide the legal basis for the claims,not rules of professional ethics.see lazy seven coal sales,at.the rules assist in evaluating centra claims,but they do not provide the underlying elements of the claims themselves.thus,centra appropriately uses michigan rules of professional conduct as support for its claims,not the basis of the claims,and we will proceed to evaluate the district court grant of summary judgment.
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.ctr.for reform,city of springboro,cir.the federal rules of civil procedure state that summary judgment should be granted if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed civ.c.we have observed that 
the burden is generally on the moving party to show that no genuine issue of material fact exists,but that burden may be discharged by is,pointing out to the district there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party case.celotex catrett,d internal quotation marks omitted.in reviewing a summary judgment motion,credibility judgments and weighing of the evidence are prohibited.rather,the evidence should be viewed in the light most favorable to the party.anderson liberty lobby,d.thus,the facts and any inferences that can be drawn from those facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.
bennett city of eastpointe,cir.it is an error for the district court to resolve credibility issues against the nonmovant in effect,any direct evidence offered by the plaintiff in response to a summary judgment motion must be accepted as true.the district court errs by granting summary judgment for the defendant where issues of credibility are determinative of the case.ctr.for reform,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
there are some conflicts of interest to which a client may not consent.thus,the district court was only partially correct when it stated that a client may impliedly waive its consent to an attorney conflict of interest,at order at,because it ignored the question of whether gowlings simultaneous and adverse representation of centra and windsor was in fact a conflict to which centra could consent.we hold that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether gowlings conflict of interest with regards to the bridge plan was one to which centra could consent 
the michigan rules of professional conduct state that a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to another client,unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client and each client consents after consultation.prof l conduct a this rule has particular salience when the attorney is representing both sides in the same conflict i t is a ethical principle that an attorney owes undivided allegiance to a client and usually may not represent parties on both sides of a dispute.evans luptak,at internal quotation marks omitted finding a conflict nonconsentable under michigan rule of professional conduct a when an attorney advocated the filing of a lawsuit against one client on behalf of another.
that centra and windsor are not directly adverse parties in a lawsuit is not determinative.without a doubt,the ethical concerns would be greater if gowlings were representing both sides in the same lawsuit.see restatement cmt.g iii illus.when clients are aligned directly against each other in the same litigation,the institutional interest in vigorous development of each client position renders the conflict nonconsentable.however,according to the restatement,representing both sides of a matter that is not in litigation can make a conflict of interest nonconsentable if the differences between the wrangling parties are large enough.see restatement illus.the aba takes a similar approach in its model rules whether a conflict is nonconsentable depends on the circumstances.for example,a lawyer may not represent multiple parties to a negotiation whose interests are fundamentally antagonistic to each other aba model rules,rule cmt.
the district court broadly stated that a client may consent to a conflict of interest however,it is not true that all conflicts are consentable.whether a conflict is consentable depends upon the facts of the case.according to the commentary to michigan rule,a conflict is nonconsentable when a disinterested lawyer would conclude that the client should not agree to the representation under the circumstances.prof l conduct cmt.given the evidence presented at the stage of this case,we hold that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether gowlings reasonably believed that the conflict would not adversely affect its relationship with its clients,and whether a disinterested lawyer would conclude that centra should agree to the representation.centra submitted to the district court a declaration from an expert who stated that i simply do not see how a law firm can offer sound professional service simultaneously to a client it is helping to build a bridge and to a client it is helping to block or delay construction of the bridge.this is not even a close question.at,bruce hay decl.thus,centra presented a genuine issue of material fact as to whether this conflict was one to which it was capable of giving consent,and the district court grant of summary judgment was erroneous.
informed consent 
even if we agreed with the district court that there was no question as to whether a client could consent to a conflict when one law firm represents both the party trying to build a bridge and the party trying to oppose it,we also believe that the district court erred in concluding that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether centra consented to the conflict.michigan allows a client to consent to a conflict only if the consent is informed,and here there is a triable factual question as to whether centra was informed sufficiently of the conflict to provide consent.
according to michigan rules of professional conduct 
a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to another client,unless 
the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client and 
each client consents after consultation.
prof l conduct a.while michigan language is not identical to the restatement or the aba model rules,the two national models bear significant similarity to michigan rules and give context to michigan standards.the restatement advises 
a lawyer may represent a client notwithstanding a conflict of interest prohibited by if each affected client or former client gives informed consent to the lawyer representation.informed consent requires that the client or former client have reasonably adequate information about the material risks of such representation to that client or the former client.
notwithstanding the informed consent of each affected client or former client,a lawyer may not represent a client if 
a the representation is prohibited by law 
b one client will assert a claim against the other in the same litigation or 
c in the circumstances it is not reasonably likely that the lawyer will be able to provide adequate representation to one or more of the clients.
restatement.the aba model rules also provide similar guidance for attorneys 
notwithstanding the existence of a concurrent conflict of interest under paragraph a,a lawyer may represent a client if 
the lawyer reasonably believes that the lawyer will be able to provide competent and diligent representation to each affected client 
the representation is not prohibited by law 
the representation does not involve the assertion of a claim by one client against another client represented by the lawyer in the same litigation or other proceeding before a tribunal and 
each affected client gives informed consent,confirmed in writing.
aba model rules,rule b.although the three systems have some semantic variations,they are all similar in one important respect michigan requires consent after consultation,and the aba model rules and the restatement require informed consent.although the aba sets the bar even higher by requiring that consent be written,the common denominator for all three is the idea of consultation informing before consent.
this similarity between informed consent and consent after consultation is important because we could find little that elaborates upon what satisfies consent after consultation under michigan law.in contrast,the restatement and the aba model rules provide more guidance.the restatement requires that attorneys inform their clients of the nature of the conflict so that the clients are aware of the material respects in which the representation could have adverse effects on the interests of that client.restatement cmt.c i.according to the restatement,what is material may change with the circumstances.for instance,a client already represented by a disinterested attorney may require less information from the conflicted attorney,but the client nevertheless may have need of information adequate to reveal the conflict scope and severity.id.under the aba model rules,a conflicted attorney does not need to disclose facts or implications already known to the client or other person nevertheless,a lawyer who does not personally inform the client or other person assumes the risk that the client or other person is inadequately informed and the consent is invalid.aba model rules,rule cmt.thus,providing to the client anything less than full information runs the risk that the client is inadequately informed,thereby making any consent invalid.
in the case at bar,gowlings argues that the lengthy history of its partner estrin opposition to centra,including estrin work on behalf of the buffalo and fort erie public bridge authority and for windsor on the site plan,was sufficient to inform centra of a general,ongoing conflict of interest between gowlings other clients and centra.according to gowlings,because centra had notice of a general conflict,centra continued retention of gowlings as its counsel served as implicit consent to future conflicts of interest that would include gowlings work on behalf of windsor to oppose the bridge plan while simultaneously assisting centra in arranging for funding for the bridge plan.
we conclude that centra knowledge of estrin prior work representing parties adverse to centra in different matters is not enough,as a matter of law,to inform centra adequately of the scope of gowlings conflict of interest regarding the bridge plan.courts interpreting the aba and restatement rules have made it clear that it is not sufficient to leave the client to infer the full nature of a conflict from only bits and pieces of actual or constructive knowledge.the ninth circuit held that simply possessing knowledge of the existence of a conflict does not mean that the client is fully informed as to the conflict implications 
to satisfy the requirement of full disclosure by a lawyer before undertaking to represent two conflicting interests,it is not sufficient that both parties be informed of the fact that the lawyer is undertaking to represent both of them,but he must explain to them the nature of the conflict of interest in such detail so that they can understand the reasons why it may be desirable for each to have independent counsel,with undivided loyalty to the interests of each of them.
unified sewerage agency jelco,cir internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.similarly,the second circuit rejected the argument that it was enough that the client knew generally of the conflicted attorneys adverse work this assertion is without merit.clause c of dr of the aba model code specifically imposes upon an attorney the burden of affirmatively providing disclosure and obtaining consent.clearly,full and effective disclosure of all the relevant facts must be made and brought home to the prospective client.int l bus.machs.levin,cir upholding disqualification of a law firm in an antitrust lawsuit after determining that the law firm failed to make an adequate disclosure when it was representing the plaintiff in the antitrust suit against ibm while also representing ibm in unrelated labor matters.to put it another way,i t is doubtful that passing conversations at cocktail parties and in hallways is what the drafters of the aba model code had in mind when they stated in dr c that full disclosure is required.ransburg champion spark plug,disqualifying a law firm from a lawsuit after the law firm filed a lawsuit on behalf of one client against another client it was simultaneously representing on unrelated matters.
gowlings repeatedly claims that the district court correctly focused on whether centra was aware of a general conflict rather than asking whether centra was aware of gowlings opposition to the bridge plan per se.see,appellee br.at.in other words,gowlings contends that knowledge of earlier conflicts can constitute knowledge sufficient to consent to a different,subsequent conflict.we disagree the informed part of informed consent is tied to knowledge of the conflict in question,not different conflicts effective client consent to one conflict is not necessarily effective with respect to other conflicts or other matters.restatement cmt.c i illus.aba model rules,rule cmt.requiring consent to be determined on a basis.when a law firm represents two clients who are adversaries in various legal matters,but the firm represents the clients only in matters where the clients are not opposing each other,knowledge of the general nature and scope of the work being performed for each client normally suffices to inform the clients of the conflict.restatement cmt.c i.the case at hand is not a case where the firm was working on only unrelated matters instead,while trying to help one client,centra,procure funding for the bridge plan,gowlings was working for another client,windsor,to oppose the bridge plan.gowlings was working for two adverse parties on the same matter,and for that conflict,centra general knowledge that gowlings has previously represented parties with adverse interests to centra is not enough to inform centra adequately with regards to the direct conflict of interest in gowlings representation of two adverse clients on the bridge plan.
if the vague and general information that centra possessed regarding prior,different conflicts was enough,then the client would bear the burden of identifying and understanding the full scope of any conflict of interest.it is not the client,however,to whom the various codes of conduct have given this responsibility t he affirmative duty here rests not with the clients but with the law firm and its attorneys.ransburg.at see also dunton county of suffolk,cir vacating a judgment against a client police officer in a civil rights action on the basis that he was prejudiced by his counsel conflict of interest the court stated that the client police officer presumably knew little or nothing about the law of attorney conflicts and could not be expected to discern the nature of the conflict.he would naturally rely on his attorney to protect him.one court has placed more of a burden on the client.see alexander primerica holdings,holding that it was sufficient that the client had the knowledge necessary to discern these conflict of interest issues emphasis added.however,we could find no other courts that have adopted this standard,which is contradictory to the standard used in one of the most frequently cited cases in this field w e think it would be questionable conduct for an attorney to participate in any lawsuit against his own client without the knowledge and consent of all concerned.cinema,cinerama,cir upholding disqualification of a law firm that was representing the plaintiff in an antitrust matter but had a partner who was representing the defendant in separate but somewhat similar litigation,id.at.
a client knowledge that his law firm has,on previous occasions,represented parties that opposed the client in different matters does not provide an adequate foundation for informed consent with respect to a current simultaneous representation of two adverse clients with opposing interests in a specific dispute.gowlings does not claim that it provided to centra more specific information regarding the current conflict on which informed consent could have been based,because gowlings itself admits that it was not aware until of the conflict with respect to the bridge plan.it is,therefore,apparent that centra has at least established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether gowlings fulfilled its obligation to inform centra of the full nature of the conflict arising from gowlings simultaneous and adverse representation of centra and windsor with regard to the bridge plan.
implied consent 
gowlings asserts that centra continued retention of gowlings after learning of prior,different conflicts served as implied consent to the later conflict of interest with regard to the bridge plan.however,as we have already noted,consent must be determined on a basis.centra continued retention of gowlings between and may have served as consent to those earlier conflicts,but it certainly could not serve as consent to a conflict that had not yet occurred and of which centra was not informed.in addition,under michigan law,in order to prove implied consent,the attorney must convincingly establish the client knowledge as to the specific conflict,something gowlings has not done.thus,summary judgment was improperly granted to gowlings.
gowlings is correct that generally a client may impliedly consent to an attorney conflict of interest.however,centra has established a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether it did impliedly consent.michigan law permits implied consent in certain circumstances.disposal serv,d at stating that a client may expressly or impliedly waive his objection and consent to the adverse representation,but finding that a prospective contractual waiver did not waive the conflict of interest when counsel for a defendant in an earlier environmental civil suit now represented plaintiffs suing the former client in a related environmental civil suit.for elaboration of the michigan rule,it is helpful to look at the restatement 
the requirement of consent generally requires an affirmative response by each client in general,a lawyer may not assume consent from a client silent acquiescence.however,consent may be inferred from active participation in a representation by a client who has reasonably adequate information about the material risks of the representation after a lawyer request for consent.
restatement cmt.c i emphasis added.according to the restatement,there must be both reasonably adequate information and a lawyer request for consent,but in the instant case gowlings has established neither.
in the cases that have found implied consent,the reviewing court has found it clear that the impliedly consenting party was fully aware of the conflict and,armed with that knowledge,that party still took actions that are consistent only with consent.for example,in a ninth circuit case,the court declared it well settled that a former client who is entitled to object to an attorney representing an opposing party on the ground of conflict of interest but who knowingly refrains from asserting it promptly is deemed to have waived that right.trust of piper aircraft,cir.in that case,however,there was no question that the conflicted firm provided to the former client and the former client new firm its entire file on the former client so that the former client could evaluate the depth of the conflict,yet the former client said nothing about the conflict for over years.id.at.similarly,the district court for the northern district of ohio said that i t is axiomatic that the client right to object to an attorney allegedly adverse representation may be waived.city of cleveland cleveland illuminating,aff,cir unpublished.in that case,however,there was no question that cleveland had been well aware of the conflict for which it was now trying to disqualify the opposing counsel.prior to the antitrust case in question,the city sought the firm assistance on a bond matter.the firm expressed reluctance to accept work from cleveland because it was concerned about a potential conflict of interest with one of its clients,the cleveland electric illuminating company cei.the city of cleveland was very aware of the firm work for cei,but the city importuned the law firm to assist the city,and the firm obtained written assent from the city.id.at.these cases make it clear that a court may infer a client consent only when it is clear that the client was fully aware of the conflict of interest before acquiescing to further representation.
implied consent requires an informed client.a court can say that a client actions can support solely the conclusion that the client has consented,but only in the limited circumstance that it is indisputably clear that the client was aware of the conflict.in this case,stamper asserted that he was not aware of the conflict of interest as to the bridge plan until.the district court found stamper statement to be not credible because he had attended meetings where gowlings affiliation with windsor was apparent as to other matters.as we have noted,gowlings prior work for the buffalo and fort erie public bridge authority and for windsor on the site that were different from the bridge not serve to inform centra of gowlings conflict of interest with regard to the bridge plan.furthermore,in a motion for summary judgment,the district court can not make credibility determinations against the nonmovant,and stamper statement deserved the benefit of the doubt as long as it was not totally implausible.street bradford,cir.thus,there is clearly a genuine issue of material fact as to whether centra retention of gowlings after learning of gowlings work for parties adverse to centra on other matters served as implicit consent to gowlings simultaneous and adverse work on the bridge plan for both centra and windsor.
taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,we are compelled to conclude that the district court improperly granted summary judgment in favor of gowlings.centra has established genuine issues of material fact as to whether the conflict was consentable,whether centra was properly informed of the conflict,and whether centra actions indicated implied consent.therefore,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
centra rule f motion for discovery 
after gowlings filed a motion for summary judgment,centra asked the district court for the opportunity to conduct discovery.under the federal rules of civil procedure,a nonmovant may request additional discovery prior to the granting of summary judgment 
if a party opposing the motion shows by affidavit that,for specified reasons,it can not present facts essential to justify its opposition,the court may 
deny the motion 
order a continuance to enable affidavits to be obtained,depositions to be taken,or other discovery to be undertaken or 
issue any other just order.
f.the district court denied centra motion,and we review the decision for abuse of discretion.vance ex rel.hammons united states,cir the bears the obligation to inform the district court of his need for discovery,however.this court reviews for abuse of discretion a claim that summary judgment was prematurely entered because additional discovery was needed,and the argument is not preserved for appeal unless it is first advanced in the district court.
in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion,a number of different factors are applicable to such claims,such as when the appellant learned of the issue that is the subject of the desired discovery whether the desired discovery would have changed the ruling below how long the discovery period had lasted whether the appellant was dilatory in its discovery efforts and whether the appellee was responsive to discovery requests.plott motors,cir citations omitted,cert.denied,d.because centra was given no opportunity to conduct the discovery that would be necessary for centra to oppose gowlings summary judgment motion,we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in denying centra rule f motion.
typically,when the parties have no opportunity for discovery,denying the rule f motion and ruling on a summary judgment motion is likely to be an abuse of discretion.ball union carbide,cir it is that the plaintiff must receive a full opportunity to conduct discovery to be able to successfully defeat a motion for summary judgment.vance,at most significant to the conclusion we reach is the fact that no discovery was conducted before the motion for summary judgment was filed and decided.white landing fisheries,buchholzer,cir yet we nevertheless conclude that summary judgment should not have been awarded until the plaintiffs were allowed some opportunity for discovery in the instant case,we find that the grant of summary judgment,absent any opportunity for discovery,is such a misuse.however,as a general matter we have upheld the denial of rule f motions when the court deems as too vague the affidavits submitted in support of the motion.see ball,at it is not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny the discovery request when the party makes only general and conclusory statements in its affidavit regarding the need for more discovery and does not show how an extension of time would have allowed information related to the truth or falsity of the document to be discovered.quoting ironside simi valley,cir alterations in original cacevic city of hazel park,cir nowhere in the unsworn document did the cacevics indicate to the district court what material facts they hope d to uncover and why they ha d not previously discovered the information.alterations in original internal quotation marks omitted.we have applied this rule and upheld the denial of rule f motions on vagueness grounds even when the parties were given no opportunity for discovery.see emmons mclaughlin,cir.similarly,we have affirmed the denial of rule f motions when the parties were given insufficient time for discovery if further discovery would not have changed the legal and factual deficiencies.maki laakko,cir,cert.denied,d.thus,it is generally an abuse of discretion to deny a rule f motion in the absence of any opportunity for discovery,but we have noted some limited exceptions to that rule.those exceptions,however,do not apply in this case,and we conclude the district court abused its discretion in denying centra rule f motion.
in requesting time for discovery before determination of the summary judgment motion,centra filed an affidavit outlining the evidence that it would seek in discovery.we conclude that centra affidavit is not too vague and identifies information sought by centra essential to justify its opposition to summary judgment.f.there are several issues for which the opportunity for discovery would have been important.for instance,centra asserts it would have sought discovery as to gowlings procedures and how those procedures were or were not applied during the course of events leading up to this case.this information would shed light on what estrin knew or should have known at particular times with regard to gowlings work for centra and could create a genuine issue of material fact regarding gowlings and estrin failure to catch and alert centra to the conflict.and one specific area where discovery would have been particularly helpful involves centra allegations about gowlings use of confidential information.
centra questions whether estrin used centra goodman legal memorandum in preparing estrin letter on behalf of windsor to the coast guard in opposition to centra bridge plan.in his letter estrin wrote that gowlings has commissioned extensive historical and archival research with respect to the statutory and executive approvals granted by the congress of the united states and the parliament of canada to the ambassador bridge,as well as in respect of the specific plans,drawings and approved by officials of the federal government in the united states and canada for the current ambassador bridge.at letter from estrin to robert bloom,bridge program manager,office of commander,ninth coast guard district,at.estrin description sounds similar to the description of the memorandum contents given by one of the memorandum authors.see docket,at,emilio binavince decl.describing the goodman legal memorandum as containing notes of the factual and legislative history of the statutes and executive actions governing the construction of the ambassador bridge in canada and the united states,particularly the canadian statute incorporating the canadian transit company.the author went on to state that the documents that estrin referred to in his letter would by necessity be included in the documents and materials that gowlings had obtained from centra during its representation of centra.binavince decl.a declarant for centra who was familiar with both estrin letter and the goodman legal memorandum stated that estrin description of his research is an accurate de
