this is a legal malpractice case arising from leonard pivnick purchase of a thoroughbred horse from company ftc at an auction.because pivnick never paid for the horse,ftc eventually repossessed and sold the animal at a private sale.pivnick argued that the notices he received from ftc regarding his default and the subsequent resale of the horse were not commercially reasonable and thus violated kentucky version of the uniform commercial code.he hired the law firm of white,getgey meyer,lpa wgm to represent him in a suit against ftc,but wgm failed to prosecute the case that it had filed in state court.this caused the case to be dismissed.
pivnick then sued wgm for legal malpractice in federal court.wgm stipulated to its legal malpractice,but defended on the ground that pivnick would not have succeeded on the merits in the underlying suit against ftc even if the case had gone forward.the jury returned a verdict in wgm favor.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
factual background 
pivnick purchased a thoroughbred horse for at an ftc auction in saratoga springs,new york in august.although he repeatedly promised ftc that payment was imminent,pivnick never paid for the horse.at trial,pivnick admitted that he did not have sufficient funds to make the payment until january.
the purchase of the horse was subject to a document titled conditions of sale,which provided in relevant part as follows 
and delivery title passes to buyer at fall of the hammer buyer shall immediately present himself to make settlement upon fall of the hammer 
and settlement buyer grants to auctioneer a security interest in each horse purchased,to secure payment of the amount of unpaid purchase price,sales tax,and other indebtedness owed by buyer to auctioneer or auctioneer affiliates buyer agrees that auctioneer shall have all rights and remedies of a secured party pursuant to the conditions of sale and the uniform commercial code or other applicable law.
should buyer fail to comply in any respect with conditions ninth and tenth above,the auctioneer may,in its absolute discretion,pursue any remedy available against the defaulting buyer,including,but not limited to,taking possession of the horse,resale of the horse at public auction or by private treaty for account of defaulter.in any case,buyer shall be liable for any deficiency after charging to buyer account all costs of maintenance and resale,including,but not limited to,service charges,attorney fees,costs of litigation,and damages available to auctioneer by law.
pivnick acknowledged and agreed to the conditions of sale in an acknowledgment of purchase form that he signed on august.
on september,pivnick received a letter from boyd browning,ftc executive vice president,advising him that he was in default and that ftc required payment of the purchase price within seven days.in a conversation on the same day,pivnick orally promised browning that he would pay for the horse in one or two weeks.browning sent pivnick a letter the following day,stating that if payment was not received by ftc on or before september,ftc reserved all its rights available per the conditions of sale,including taking possession of the horse for the purpose of resale,either at public auction or by private treaty the horse was subsequently resold at a private sale on november,for.browning informed pivnick of the sale in a letter dated the same day.after being broken and trained for racing,the horse was then sold for in late february at a public sale.
procedural history 
pivnick brought suit in state court against ftc in march,seeking consequential damages for the sale of the horse.ftc counterclaimed for the difference between the price that pivnick had agreed to pay and the price that ftc obtained in the private sale.in june,pivnick hired wgm as successor counsel in the case.wgm failed to prosecute pivnick claims,which resulted in the dismissal of the case by the state court in september.ftc counterclaim was likewise dismissed.
in september,pivnick filed suit in federal court against wgm for legal malpractice.wgm stipulated to its legal malpractice,but defended on the ground that pivnick would not have succeeded in the underlying case against ftc.the trial was originally set for september,but the district court moved the start date to september,due to a scheduling conflict.one of wgm witnesses,browning,was available to testify only on september,the first day of trial.over pivnick objections,the court permitted browning to testify out of turn and before pivnick presented his case.after browning testified,pivnick moved for a mistrial.the record does not show that the court has ever formally ruled on the motion.
pivnick then presented his case.at the close of his proof,he moved for judgment as a matter of law.the district court denied the motion.pivnick did not renew his motion at the close of all the evidence.the jury subsequently returned a verdict in wgm favor.pivnick then moved to set aside the jury verdict and again for judgment as a matter of law.these motions were denied by the court.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
sufficiency of the.standard of review 
in a diversity case such as this,we look to state law for the standard with which to review a denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law.nationwide mut.fire ins.may,cir citation omitted.under kentucky law,the jury verdict must be upheld if,draw ing all fair and rational inferences from the evidence in favor of the party opposing the motion,the evidence is sufficient to sustain the verdict.spivey sheeler,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.kentucky courts thus recognize that it is the jury province to weigh the evidence.perry ernest hamilton assocs,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.nonetheless,the courts are to take a case away from the jury if the evidence does not present a true issue of fact to the jury.wadkins adm x chesapeake ohio ry.
kentucky law applies in this case.although the sale of the horse took place in new york and wgm raises the argument in its brief that new york law should provide the framework for analysis of the dispute,the issue as to choice of law has been waived because the parties never disputed that kentucky law should apply in both the underlying case against ftc and in the present case against wgm.the district court relied upon kentucky law and quoted kentucky revised statutes annotated at length in reaching its decision to deny pivnick motion for judgment as a matter of law.at no time during the lower court proceedings did wgm argue that new york law should apply or object to the district court reliance upon kentucky law.
this suit arose under old article of kentucky version of the uniform commercial code.old article was in effect prior to july,on which date kentucky adopted the current revised article.the relevant part of the statute provides as follows 
disposition of the collateral may be by public or private proceedings and may be made by way of one or more contracts.sale or other disposition may be as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the disposition including the method,manner,time,place and terms must be commercially reasonable.unless collateral is perishable or threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market,reasonable notification of the time and place of any public sale or reasonable notification of the time after which any private sale or other intended disposition is to be made shall be sent by the secured party to the debtor 
kentucky law is clear that whether a notice from a creditor to a debtor with respect to the disposition of the collateral is commercially reasonable is a question of fact,not a question of law.mccoy am.fid.bank trust,internal quotation marks omitted.the kentucky supreme court explained in mccoy that 
the purpose of notice is to permit the debtor to bid at the sale or to protect himself from an inadequate sale price by notifying purchasers of the sale.in addition,proper notice allows the debtor to exercise the right of redemption before sale.exercise of
