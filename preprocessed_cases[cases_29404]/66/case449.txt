plaintiff seeks to impose liability on attorneys who produced a class action recovery of some million,claiming they were negligent because they failed to obtain a still larger recovery.while we may share the attorneys dismay that their efforts have been rewarded with this lawsuit rather than with the kudos they no doubt expected,and perhaps deserve,we are nonetheless constrained to hold that plaintiff claim can not be rejected out of hand.while it may well be that the attorneys did not breach their duty of care in failing to proceed under an alternative theory that would have produced a greater recovery,we can not say,as did the trial court,that there simply was no duty for the attorneys to breach.
plaintiff stanley janik brought this purported class action for legal malpractice against defendants steven zieff and the law firm of rudy,exelrod zieff,llp collectively defendants or the attorneys,alleging that the attorneys mishandled a prior class action against farmers insurance exchange farmers.while having secured recovery for a large class of claims representatives who were not paid overtime compensation on the ground that they were administrators to whom the applicable regulations under the labor code assertedly did not apply,the attorneys are faulted for not having sought recovery under the unfair competition law,business and professions code section ucl.under the ucl,the statute of limitations would have permitted recovery for overtime wages earned but unpaid during the period preceding the filing of the complaint,rather than for only the period available under the labor code.the trial court sustained defendants demurrer without leave to amend on the ground that the attorneys had no duty to class members with respect to claims that were not specified in the order certifying a class.although there is little precedent to guide us,we do not believe that the obligations of class counsel can be so narrowly circumscribed.while the scope of the duty of class counsel must be determined with reference to the certification order,we conclude that the attorneys obligations may extend beyond the claims as certified to related claims arising out of the same facts that class members reasonably would expect to be asserted in conjunction with the certified claims.accordingly,we must reverse the judgment and require the attorneys to establish that they did not breach the applicable standard of care before they may be exonerated.
factual and procedural background 
in october,defendants filed an action against farmers on behalf of approximately of its claims representatives to recover for the nonpayment of overtime compensation.bell farmers insurance exchange super.alameda county,wl bell.the complaint alleged a single cause of action for violation of overtime rights under labor code section and related labor code provisions.in may,the trial court certified the following class of plaintiffs all current and former employees of defendant farmers insurance exchange who have worked in the state of california from october,to the date of trial the class period who have been assigned to handle property,auto physical damage apd and liability claims in farmers insurance exchange personal lines division with respect to the foregoing claims.the order created separate subclasses for apd claims representatives,property claims representatives and liability claims representatives.
after notice and an opportunity to opt out of the class had been given to class members,the class plaintiffs moved for summary adjudication to establish that the claims representatives were not administrators exempt from the overtime regulations of the industrial welfare commission and,therefore,that they were entitled to overtime pay.in april,the court granted the plaintiffs motion,holding that none of the three subclasses of claims representatives was employed in an administrative capacity and therefore that all class members were entitled to statutory overtime premiums under labor code section,subdivision a.the trial court order was affirmed in an appeal that farmers successfully took from an interim order awarding attorney fees based on the summary adjudication.bell farmers ins.exchange th,d.the remaining issue of damages then went to trial before a jury,resulting in a verdict for the plaintiff class for approximately million in unpaid overtime wages.judgment was entered in the bell case in september,and this judgment recently has been upheld on appeal with only minor modifications.bell farmers insurance exchange th,d.
the present action was filed in october and alleges two causes of action,for legal malpractice and for breach of fiduciary duty,both arising out of the handling of the bell action.the complaint alleges that d efendants could have amended the bell complaint as late as the time of trial to allege the claim under the ucl either as a class action,or at least a representative action.had defendants used proper skill and care in the handling of the bell action they would have done so.from the date the bell action was filed,and even before then,it was well established that any conduct that violated the labor code would also necessarily violate the ucl.moreover,there was authority in the to time frame that unpaid wages could be recovered as an item of restitution in a ucl action.on june,in cortez purolator air filtration products cal th,d,cortez,the california supreme court confirmed prior authority that unlawfully withheld wages may be recovered as a restitutionary remedy in a ucl action and that the ucl limitations period governs a ucl action based on failure to pay wages as a proximate result of the negligence of defendants,plaintiff and class members lost their opportunity to recover millions of dollars of restitution for unpaid wages earned during the extra year.the second cause of action incorporated these allegations and added that d efendants breached their fiduciary duty to plaintiff and the class members by failing to seek all available relief to which they were entitled.
defendants demurred to the complaint on the ground that plaintiff failed to allege a duty of care on the part of the attorneys to protect the alleged interests of plaintiff or of the class he purports to represent.the complaint rests,the attorneys argued,on the insupportable notion that unnamed class members,with whom class counsel have no retainer agreements,have a legal right to demand that class counsel represent them with respect to claims other than those that the superior court specifically approves as class claims pursuant to its supervisory powers over class actions and through the class certification order.underscoring in original.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the complaint.plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
the principal issue raised on appeal is whether defendants,as attorneys for the plaintiff class in the bell action,owed class members a duty of care to consider and protect their interests with respect to any claims they might have beyond those specified in the class certification order.the question of the existence of a legal duty of care in a given factual situation presents a question of law which is to be determined by the courts alone.nichols keller th,d.we review the trial court ruling on the demurrer de novo.id.at,d.
defendants owed class members a duty to consider and assert as appropriate all related claims arising out of the same facts as the claims included in the certification order that class members would reasonably expect to be considered.
generally,the relationship imposes upon the lawyer the obligation to represent his client with such skill,prudence,and diligence as lawyers of ordinary skill and capacity commonly possess and exercise in the performance of the tasks which they undertake.kirsch duryea cal d.it is well settled in california that an attorney is subject to liability for malpractice when his or her negligent investigation,advice,or conduct of the client affairs results in loss of a meritorious claim.citation.when rendering advice to a client,a n attorney assumes an obligation to his client to undertake reasonable research in an effort to ascertain relevant legal principles and to make an informed decision as to a course of conduct based upon an intelligent assessment of the problem.citation.this includes a duty to discover those additional rules of law which,although not commonly known,may readily be found by standard research techniques.stanley richmond th,d.
defendants do not dispute that,once the class was certified in bell,they assumed a duty to all representative and absent class members to competently represent their interests in pursuing the claims as to which the class was certified.see owners for fair franchising southland th,d cal pak delivery,united parcel service,th,d kleiner first nat.bank of atlanta,vacated in part by kleiner first nat.bank of atlanta cir.reported decisions in cases addressing other issues assume the right of class members to hold class counsel responsible for negligence in the handling of claims certified for class treatment,ferguson lieff,cabraser,heimann bernstein cal th,d,gordon law offices of aguirre meyer th,d zimmer paper products,berger montague,cir.defendants assert,however,that the duty they owed to class members was limited to the competent handling of those claims for the prosecution of which the class was certified,and that they had no duty to expand the complaint to allege additional claims or to provide any advice or services of any kind with respect to other potential claims.because the bell class was certified for the purpose of asserting only a cause of action under the labor code for unpaid overtime wages earned during the period preceding the filing of the complaint,defendants contend they had no obligation to consider whether class members had any other or greater claims against farmers arising out of the practice on which the certified claim was based.defendants argue that the certification order is the analogue of an retainer agreement,which defines the scope of the representation that the attorney undertakes and for which the attorney may be held responsible.similarly,defendants argue,the scope of class counsel duty to class members is defined by the court certification order.
plaintiff places principal support for a broader understanding of the obligations of class counsel on the california supreme court decision in city of san jose superior court cal d.in city of san jose,the court held that the trial court abused its discretion in certifying a class in part because the named plaintiffs failed to adequately represent the members of the class.there,property owners situated in the flight pattern of the san jose municipal airport were asserting nuisance and inverse condemnation claims against the city of san jose,but sought to recover only damages for diminution in the market value of their property.in order to eliminate issues that might defeat class certification,the plaintiffs did not seek additional damages for annoyance,inconvenience,or actual physical injury to which some property owners may have been entitled.the court concluded that the named plaintiffs representation was inadequate and a class should not have been certified because a cause of action may not be split,and the named plaintiffs fail to raise claims reasonably expected to be raised by the members of the class and thus pursue a course which,even should the litigation be resolved in favor of the class,would deprive class members of many elements of damage.id.at.the court reiterated that representative plaintiffs owe absent class members a fiduciary duty,and concluded that because the members of the class would reasonably be expected to seek recovery of damages beyond those pled in the complaint,by certifying this class,the trial court sanctioned a clear violation of plaintiffs fiduciary duty.ibid.while city of san jose involved the duty of a representative plaintiff,the duty of class counsel is no less.amchem products,windsor,fn,d state homeside lending.the city of san jose decision thus implies that those who assume the responsibility of pursuing claims on behalf of a class assume the duty to protect all claims that class members would reasonably expect to be asserted in the litigation that will be lost if not then asserted.
the more recent court of appeal decision in hicks kaufman broad home th,d supports the same view.in that case,the trial court refused to certify a class of homeowners suing the developer and general contractor for defects in the concrete foundations under their homes.the developer contended that the named plaintiffs had violated their fiduciary duty to the class by limiting the recovery they demanded on behalf of the class to the cost of repairing or replacing the foundations.in doing so,the court of appeal observed,plaintiffs are effectively waiving on behalf of thousands of class members any possibility of recovery for property damage to their homes because a judgment on the breach of implied and express warranty causes of action would bar recovery in a second suit on the same legal theories.id.at,d.in reversing the order denying class certification as to those claims,the court of appeal did not suggest that the class representatives owe no duty to absent class members to ensure that their related claims for property damages are preserved,but held that there were several approaches by which the trial court could certify a class and still ensure that class members retained any claims they might have for additional damages.id.at,d.
defendants cite no case,and we have found none,that stands for the proposition that class counsel have no duty to class members extending beyond the prosecution of class members claims as they are literally described in the class certification order.rather,they rely on a misreading and selective quotation from several cases that hold no such thing.for example,as just noted,while hicks kaufman broad home,supra,may have rejected the contention that the class representatives and their counsel had breached their duty to the class by choosing not to raise a particular legal theory th at,d,it did not reject the premise that these parties owed a duty to the class to protect its interests with respect to additional related claims.similarly,kleiner first nat.bank of atlanta,supra,at page,vacated in part,supra,does not stand for the proposition that class counsel only assumes responsibility to class members for diligent,competent prosecution of the certified claims.italics added.in kleiner,the court held that unauthorized communication with class members by the defendant attorneys was a violation of the rules of professional conduct.at.in discussing whether an relationship had been formed between the plaintiff attorney and absent class members at the time of the communication,the kleiner court noted,once a class has been certified,some but not all aspects of the relationship are present.a lawyer who represents the named plaintiff in a class which has been certified immediately assumes responsibility to class members for the diligent,competent prosecution of the certified claims.however,it can not truly be said that he fully represents prospective class members until it is determined that they are going to participate in the class action.ibid.the court there was focusing on the point in time at which the relationship arises,not the scope of that relationship.clearly the court did not hold,as defendants suggest,that class counsel obligation to absent class members does not extend beyond the diligent prosecution of class members claims as they are literally described in the class certification order.
there is merit in defendants suggestion that the obligations of class counsel under a class certification order should be analogized to the obligations that an attorney assumes under a retainer agreement.the analogy,however,does not support defendants position.we find no support for defendants broad assertion that an attorney can not be sued in malpractice for failing to raise claims beyond the scope of a retainer agreement.true,the extent of an attorney duty to act necessarily depends on the scope of the relationship mallen smith,legal malpractice ed,and the scope of this relationship may be limited by the agreement between the attorney and the client vapnek et,cal.practice guide professional responsibility the rutter group.but an attorney who undertakes one matter on behalf of a client owes that client the duty to at least consider and advise the client if there are apparent related matters that the client is overlooking and that should be pursued to avoid prejudicing the client interests.e ven when a retention is expressly limited,the attorney may still have a duty to alert the client to legal problems which are reasonably apparent,even though they fall outside the scope of the retention.nichols keller,supra,th at,d see piscitelli friedenberg th,d see also vapek et,cal.practice guide professional responsibility,supra,to.
the situation in nichols keller provides a good illustration.there,the client retained counsel to prosecute a workers compensation claim,which was handled properly,but brought an action against the attorneys for having failed to advise him that he had potential claims against third parties.the trial court granted the attorneys motion for summary judgment on the ground that the attorneys had limited their representation to the workers compensation claim and therefore had no duty to inform him of or initiate a third party action on his behalf.the court of appeal reversed,pointing out that o ne of an attorney basic functions is to advise.liability can exist because the attorney failed to provide advice.not only should an attorney furnish advice when requested,but he or she should also volunteer opinions when necessary to further the client objectives.the attorney need not advise and caution of every possible alternative,but only of those that may result in adverse consequences if not considered.th at,d.the court stated that t he attorney need not represent the client on such matters.nevertheless,the attorney should inform the client of the limitations of the attorney representation and of the possible need for other counsel.id.at,d.
the court rationale in nichols keller bears emphasis.the rationale is that,as between the lay client and the attorney,the latter is more qualified to recognize and analyze the client legal needs.th at,d.in the context of personal injury consultations between lawyer and layperson,it is reasonably foreseeable the latter will offer a selective or incomplete recitation of the facts underlying the claim request legal assistance by employing such everyday terms as workers compensation,disability,and unemployment and rely upon the consulting lawyer to describe the array of legal remedies available,alert the layperson to any apparent legal problems,and,if appropriate,indicate limitations on the retention of counsel and the need for other counsel.in the event the lawyer fails to so advise the layperson,it is also reasonably foreseeable the layperson will fail to ask relevant questions regarding the existence of other remedies and be deprived of relief through a combination of ignorance and lack or failure of understanding.and,if counsel elects to limit or prescribe his representation of the client,to a workers compensation claim only without reference or regard to any third party or collateral claims which the client might pursue if adequately advised,then counsel must make such limitations in representation very clear to his client.thus,a lawyer who signs an application for adjudication of a workers compensation claim and a lawyer who accepts a referral to prosecute the claim owe the claimant a duty of care to advise on available remedies,including third party actions.id.at,d.
the reasoning that precludes limiting an attorneys duty to the literal terms of the retention agreement applies as well in the context of a class action.in the former situation,the client reasonably expects the attorney at least to call attention to alternative or additional avenues of relief that might be pursued to obtain full redress for the circumstances giving rise to the retention.the attorney has the duty to use such skill,prudence and diligence as other members of the profession commonly possess and exercise in identifying and bringing to the clients attention other courses of action that warrant consideration.see nichols keller,supra,th at,d.if prudence dictates that a claim beyond the scope of the retention agreement be pursued,the client can then consider whether to expand the retention or pursue the additional claim in some other manner.in the context of a class action,both the representative plaintiffs and the absent class members similarly are entitled to assume that their attorneys will consider and bring to the attention of at least the class representatives additional or greater claims that may exist arising out of the circumstances underlying the certified claims that class members will be unable to raise if not asserted in the pending action.the class members are entitled to assume that their attorneys are attempting to maximize their recovery for the conduct they are challenging and that they are not,without good reason,failing to assert those claims that will do so.
this is not to say that there may not be good reasons for failing to assert a particular claim or make a particular motion or argument,even if doing so would have the potential of increasing recovery.davis damrell d.see also newberg on class actions ed,one also must consider whether to join additional claims for different theories of liability leading to approximately the same relief.often this joinder may be advantageous when the precise theory of liability that may be applicable is subject to uncertainty or when the class possesses several related claims.on the other hand,sometimes the more prolix the complaint,the more difficult it is to sustain the class action.a longer complaint may afford additional opportunities for challenge by the defendants concerning the impropriety of certifying a class action and may also give rise to feelings by the court of management difficulties.thus,it would appear that a straightforward,more limited complaint would enjoy a greater likelihood of success for class certification than a prolix complaint.defendants argue that there were good reasons for initially having failed to assert a cause of action under the ucl,and for not moving to amend the complaint when cortez,supra,cal th,d,was they had already obtained a favorable ruling on the summary adjudication motion and were scheduled to try the issue of damages.defendants may well be right,but these contentions do not relate to the existence of a duty on the part of the attorneys.they go to whether the attorneys breached or fulfilled their duty.piscitelli friedenberg,supra,th at,d.
here,a cause of action under the ucl would have been based on precisely the same practice,and subject to much the same legal analysis,as the certified cause of action under the labor code.as explained in cortez,supra,cal th at page,d,the ucl permits restitution of unpaid wages upon a showing that the employer failure to pay the wages was an unfair business practice under labor code section.a ny business act or practice that violates the labor code through failure to pay wages is,by definition bus,an unfair business practice.it follows that an action to recover wages that might be barred if brought pursuant to labor code section still may be pursued as a ucl action seeking restitution pursuant to business and professions code section if the failure to pay constitutes a business practice.cortez,supra,at,d.if not included as part of the bell action,the claim for an additional year of recovery was lost.see mccaffrey wiley d,kidd hillman d,feinstein firestone tire and rubber,fn.thompson american tobacco.class counsel therefore were obliged to consider the advantages and disadvantages to the class of seeking to add a ucl cause of action to their complaint,to bring these considerations to the attention of the class representatives,and to take or recommend such action including of course the possibility of doing nothing with respect to such an additional claim as would an attorney using the skill,prudence and diligence commonly exercised by attorneys handling su
