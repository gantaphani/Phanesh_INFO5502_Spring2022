in this appeal we review the contention that the statute of limitations is tolled when a complaint is filed so that a plaintiff may dismiss the complaint and refile the same action long after the statute of limitations has expired.we affirm the trial court rejection of this preposterous proposition.
to determine the merits of a demurrer,the material facts alleged in the complaint are deemed admitted.serrano priest cal d.there is,however,an exception to this rule.the exception allows a court to take judicial notice of relevant documents in related judicial proceedings.code civ,subd.a.this exception is applicable here because it is necessary to take judicial notice of the complaint first filed by appellant in and voluntarily dismissed months later,a dismissal which was immediately followed on that very day by the filing of the second complaint embodying the same cause of action.
on february,appellant miles thomas discovered that he sustained injuries as a result of medical treatment provided by respondent vincent gilliland,on may,thomas timely filed a medical malpractice action against gilliland in the los angeles superior court,case no.on february,thomas voluntarily dismissed his complaint without prejudice.on the same date,february,he filed a second complaint in the los angeles superior court,case no.the allegations of the second complaint mirror the complaint,case no.it was not served on gilliland until august.
gilliland filed a demurrer to the second complaint on the ground that it was time barred by section.thomas opposed the demurrer arguing that because he filed his first complaint in less than one year from the alleged discovery of his claim,he had preserved for future use the unexpired part of the limitation to file a medical malpractice action pursuant to section.in other words,he asserts that because the first complaint was filed in may,within the first three months of the discovery of his claim,he had the remaining nine months within which to file the same action again.his premise is that the remaining nine months were tolled during the pendency of the first complaint and did not commence to run until he dismissed the first action.the trial court disagreed with thomas and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
thomas relies on inapplicable authorities to shore up the proposition he proffers to salvage his claim.he first relies on jeffers cook cal,wl,where the plaintiff filed an action to foreclose on a mortgage,naming only the mortgagor as a party defendant.after the commencement of the foreclosure action and the rendition of judgment in his favor,the plaintiff discovered the mortgagor debtor had conveyed the property to third persons before the foreclosure action had been filed.the interest of the third parties was,therefore,unaffected by the foreclosure.to remedy this problem,the plaintiff filed a supplemental complaint naming the third parties as defendants.they filed a demurrer asserting the statute of limitations.the demurrer was sustained without leave to amend and the plaintiff appealed.the supreme court affirmed,with the following observation but it is contended that the cause of action was not barred,because the original complaint in the action having been filed against the mortgagor in statutory time,stopped the running of the statute of limitations.citation.that as a legal proposition is true as to the mortgagor who was made the sole party defendant to the action at the time of filing the complaint.and it would,also,have been true as to those who were subsequently made parties defendants by the supplemental complaint,if they had been made parties before the statute had run in their favor.but they were not made parties until the statute had run.the filing of the original complaint,therefore,stopped the running of the statute of limitations only as to him who was the party defendant at the time it was filed it did not stop the running of the statute in favor of those who were not made defendants in the action at that time the statute continued to run in their favor.id.at.except for the statement that the filing of the complaint stopped the running of the statute of limitations as to the first named defendant,jeffers does not support the proposition that an action voluntarily dismissed may be resurrected within an unexpired period of the applicable statute of limitations.thomas simply contorts the holding of jeffers to extrapolate a wholly nonsensical proposition that a party plaintiff may freeze any unused part of the statute of limitations to be thawed out when needed.
jellinek superior court d.is the only other case on which thomas relies as authority to support his contention that the filing of a complaint tolls the statute of limitations allowing another action to be filed if the first is voluntarily dismissed without regard to the passage of time between the filing and dismissal of the first complaint.in jellinek,the plaintiff filed an action in small claims court.after months,the plaintiff filed a motion to transfer the small claims matter to the superior court and submitted a proposed complaint against the same defendant for filing in the superior court.the motion was erroneously granted even though there is no provision for a claim in the small claims court to be transferred to the superior court.the court of appeal issued a peremptory writ of mandate quashing the service of summons and remanding the matter to the small claims court.in passing,the court of appeal commented also,statutes of limitations are normally tolled by the filing and service of a complaint because that event should cause a prudent defendant to consult a lawyer or to take other protective action.id.at.that observation does not even address thomas contention that the statute of limitations may be stretched beyond its statutory term and allow a refiling of the same action after it is voluntarily dismissed.the jellinek court did not hold that a statute of limitations may be avoided by excluding the time between the first filing and dismissal of the action to determine whether a second filing on an identical claim is time barred.jellinek is simply inapplicable.
gilliland eloquently addresses thomas argument as follows giving thomas his due,it is true that the filing of a complaint normally tolls the statute of limitations during the pendency of the action.citation.it is also true that the filing of an amended complaint alleging the same facts,relates back to the date the original was filed.citation.these rules,however,when applied to the facts of this case,do not launch the conclusion thomas would have this court reach.the critical element that thomas shies away from is the in which he voluntary dismissal of the original action.when thomas did that,the original action ceased as if it had never been filed.
an argument substantially similar to that advanced by appellant was made in wood elling cal d.there a complex proceeding involved several parties.the corporate defendants had been dismissed from the action because they had not been timely served.the dismissal was compelled by a writ of mandate.elling superior court d.the plaintiff filed a second action naming the same defendants,including the corporate defendants seeking the same relief as in the original action.the corporate defendants demurred on the ground that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations.the demurrer was sustained and plaintiff appealed,contending that the statute of limitations was tolled from the date of the filing of the first action until four years later when the corporate defendants were dismissed from the action.
the plaintiff argued that the statute of limitations was tolled.he relied on the following passage from the prior opinion in which the writ of mandate had issued b y naming a party defendant in an original complaint,the plaintiff stops the running of the statute of limitations but if the summons is not served and returned within three years,the unserved defendant is entitled to a dismissal.the dismissal is not an adjudication on the merits,and if plaintiff wishes to renew his suit against that defendant he may do so by a new pleading in the
