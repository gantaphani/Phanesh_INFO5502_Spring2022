appellants carlos garcía pérez and gisela baerga torres,together with their infant daughter carla isabel collectively,the garcías,challenge the district court determination that they were domiciled in puerto rico when they filed a medical malpractice claim against appellees iván terón méndez and ashford presbyterian community hospital.the garcías contend that they were domiciled in florida at the time of the filing,thus establishing complete diversity between the plaintiffs and the defendants and conferring subject matter jurisdiction on the district court under a.after deliberating upon this well briefed and argued case,we conclude that errors of both law and fact require recognition of florida as the state of domicile.we therefore reverse.
background 
the underlying medical malpractice claim arose out of the may,birth of quadruplets to carlos and gisela.at the time,the garcías were living in gurabo,puerto rico.the babies were premature and only one.she suffered from a variety of complications requiring ongoing and intensive medical care.in june,having already lost three of the quadruplets while they were in the care of ashford presbyterian,the garcías decided to move carla isabel to miami children hospital.
on may,the medical malpractice claim was filed.discovery on the merits continued until march,when appellee terón méndez filed a motion to dismiss under.b,alleging that the garcías were domiciled in puerto rico,and the court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction.ashford presbyterian joined this motion.
a magistrate judge report and recommendation,issued february,concluded that the garcías were domiciled in florida at the time the suit was filed and recommended that the motion to dismiss be denied.reviewing the contested portions of the report and recommendation de novo,see b,the district court reached a contrary determination.the court noted a series of remaining contacts between the garcías and puerto rico,supporting each example with a citation to a particular page and line number of carlos deposition,taken on august.at that time,however,the deposition transcript had not been submitted to the court.the only portions of the transcript before the court were five pages submitted with appellants opposition to the motion to dismiss,but these did not include several portions of the deposition cited by appellees.the district court relied on the appellees citations.in total,the district court listed eleven factors favoring a puerto rico domicile,relying not only on the citations,but also on the phrasing of appellees objections to the magistrate judge report 
following the court order of dismissal,appellants moved for reconsideration.they pointed out discrepancies between the facts as described by the district court and the actual deposition transcript.appellants also argued that the court made a legal error in giving significant weight to carlos statement that he would like to return to puerto rico at some undetermined point in the future.
sensing the precarious nature of the court reliance on their paraphrasing,appellees submitted the entire deposition transcript with their opposition to the motion for reconsideration.the court accepted the invitation and carefully read the deposition testimony provided.it found nothing to change its conclusion and denied the motion.this appeal ensued.

iv.analysis 
we turn first to two errors of law affecting the baseline of the district court analysis.
first,the court erred when it gave considerable weight to carlos more than three years after the case was he thought just about every other day of returning to puerto rico.in hawes,we determined that a floating intention to return to a former domicile at some unspecified future date does not prevent a party from acquiring a new domicile.at.carlos vague and noncommittal language is precisely within the contours of what we consider a floating intention.see valentín,at characterizing a floating intention as a n amorphous desire to relocate from one place to another at an indeterminate future date and noting that such an indefinite and ambulatory future intention is of no real significance citing hardin mcavoy,cir.as we said in hawes,an individual is entitled to keep his options open,at.carlos statement should not have been a significant element of the court analysis.
second,the court erred in enunciating the burden of proving domicile once challenged the correct burden of proof is preponderance of the evidence.bank one,at.the district court opinion is at best confusing on this issue.in initially setting out the burden,the court correctly stated that plaintiffs bore the burden of proving domicile by a preponderance of the evidence,citing bank one.two paragraphs later,it stated the burden as that of proving domicile by clear and convincing evidence.it cited valentín,which,however,says nothing about the nature of the burden.shortly thereafter,the court repeated the clear and convincing evidence standard,erroneously citing bank one.finally,the court concluded that plaintiffs have failed to rebut this evidence of puerto rico domicile with clear and convincing proof,immediately following this language with an invocation of preponderance of evidence,citing francis goodman,cir.appellants did not raise the issue below but it is settled in this circuit that an appellate court has discretion,in exceptional cases,to relieve a party of forfeiture.see united states la guardia,cir.this is such a case.not only should the proper burden govern our review,but both courts and lawyers should be aware of the importance of clarity as to the applicable burden of proof.to the extent that the court evaluated the appellants evidence under a clear and convincing standard,plain error occurred.
we now move on to our factual analysis.the district court marshaled a string of factors favoring domicile in puerto rico,which we now review as context for our analysis of factual error.
in concluding that carlos lacked the intent to change his domicile to florida,the district court focused on the couple remaining contacts in puerto rico,which include the fact that at the time the suit was filed,carlos was employed by goldman antonetti a law firm based in puerto rico and traveled to puerto rico for business,that the garcías rented rather than sold their gurabo house,and that the family left open two puerto rico bank accounts and made regular use of an atm card associated with one of those accounts.the district court also made much of the family interest in a taco maker franchise,from which they derived about of their annual reported income for.carlos was president of the franchise corporation and gisela held a contract that paid her approximately fourteen hundred to fifteen hundred dollars a month in exchange for services and advice regarding the operation of the taco maker.the district court also pointed to the couple filing of income tax returns in puerto rico reporting the franchise income.
as we noted earlier,the district court adopted the appellees version of the facts,including citations to portions of carlos deposition transcript that were not submitted to the court.appellants argue that the district court failed to conduct an independent review of the record,misconstrued carlos testimony and relied on irrelevant factors,entirely disregarding their contrary evidence.we now consider these contentions.
a review of the record,including the deposition transcript,reveals that carlos and gisela created substantial personal,professional and civic ties to florida that significantly outweighed their residual ties with puerto rico.
first,carlos and gisela established that florida was their personal and financial base.by the time the lawsuit was filed,they had each registered to vote in florida,acquired florida drivers licenses,sold their car in puerto rico,and purchased two cars in florida.in addition,the garcías rented out their puerto rico house,unfurnished,on an annual basis they opened a miami bank account,which became the primary account for the family expenses.the couple did retain a puerto rican bank account,but the district court reference to regular use of the puerto rican atm card is unsupported by the record.no plausible construction of the cited testimony supports calling the use regular,and no reasonable inference from that portion of the testimony supports a puerto rico domicile.this was a clearly erroneous conclusion.
in evaluating the family financial contacts,the district court further erred in concluding that the garcías puerto rico tax returns implied a puerto rico domicile.gisela and carlos used their miami address on their return.the act of filing the return is not by itself evidence of domicile.as appellants note,any individual deriving income from puerto rico is required to file a tax return,regardless of citizenship.furthermore,the tax return provides no evidence that puerto rico was the appellants financial base the reported income derived from puerto rico was approximately of the family annual income.
second,the court conclusion that carlos residual professional ties supported a puerto rico domicile is not substantiated by the evidence.by may,carlos had built a professional foundation for himself in miami,including studying for and passing the florida bar exam,working out of an office in his home,and spearheading the opening of a branch office for goldman antonetti.he had,by february,not only explored job opportunities in miami but had begun discussions with the head of his firm litigation department regarding the branch office.although formal approval was not given until shortly after the complaint was filed,it is clear that carlos had by that time the settled intent to practice law in florida,with reasonable expectation of an association in florida with his firm carlos testified that he traveled to puerto rico for business,in service to some puerto rico clients,on only an on and off basis.
third,the evidence demonstrates that the garcías role in the taco maker corporation involved minimal contacts with puerto rico that were more indicative of an investment interest than a substantial tie.carlos testified that gisela never traveled to puerto rico to render services to the taco maker.neither carlos nor gisela was involved in operations carlos related travel was in his capacity as president of the corporation,an office which neither requires nor suggests that he was domiciled in puerto rico.the district court seemed to think it notable that carlos filed the corporation puerto rico income tax returns,but this simply demonstrates that he fulfilled what were reasonably his duties as an officer of a corporation.there is little support for a puerto rico domicile by virtue of these corporate contacts.
of course,not all factors weigh heavily in favor of a florida domicile.but our review indicates to us that,although on the surface there are ties to puerto rico,in every area those ties appear more tenuous as the evidence is more fully revealed.financial ties were sharply confined to a limited purpose.business relations were similarly restricted to infrequent oversight.meanwhile,the ordinary arrangements for settling into a community were becoming stronger in florida,by registering to vote,purchasing cars,and contracting to rent an apartment.but most important was the evidence of an intent to remain in florida and earn a livelihood there studying for the bar,exploring job opportunities,planning and receiving encouragement for opening a branch office for his firm.
we see the scales in this case as weighted,on the puerto rico side,by formal and attenuated connections,while,on the florida side,by deliberate investment of time and energy in preparing for living and working indefinitely in florida.
appellees offer no arguments that undermine this conclusion.their attempt to characterize the relocation as forced,and therefore unable to effect a change in domicile,is contrary to precedent.although the garcías moved because of a medical emergency,motive does not defeat a bona fide change in domicile.see hawes,at plaintiffs were not prevented from acquiring new domicile simply because relocation was motivated by urgent need to seek medical care.furthermore,rather than take steps to move back to puerto rico following the baby release from the hospital in october,the garcías strengthened their ties with florida,including carlos commitment a month later to take the florida bar exam.see hawes,at noting that if hawes had intended to return to puerto rico,the time to do so was when her husband left for mexico after being discharged from a rehabilitation center.
as far as we can see,the cases relied on by appellees actually support the garcías claim.involved a student who lived with relatives and did not pay for rent,utilities or phone he retained his puerto rico driver license and held only a job that did indicate steps toward a permanent residence.see,d at.this case is quite inapposite,relating primarily to the established principle that college students are not domiciliaries of the state in which they go to school.id.
likewise,we are somewhat perplexed by appellees reliance on leon,in which the court found that superficial ties such as bank accounts,voter registration and drivers licenses did their a change of domicile.leon.at.however,studying for and taking the florida bar exam is just the sort of complicated and skilled undertaking that the leon court would have found more convincing evidence of a change of domicile.id.furthermore,the leon court observed that 
it is more significant to examine,however,the bridges back to puerto rico that she failed to burn.she resigned from her job,but her employer expected her to return it was her puerto rican checking account that was routinely as reflected by the activity in the check register used.although she rented out a small apartment,she lef
