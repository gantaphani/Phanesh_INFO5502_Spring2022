in this case,we determine whether the medical board of california hereafter,the board violated patients informational privacy rights in their controlled substances prescription records when the board obtained that data from the controlled substance utilization review and evaluation system cures health,during a disciplinary investigation of their physician.alwin carl lewis,contends the cures statute violates his patients informational privacy rights,as the statute permits the board to access data before obtaining a warrant or administrative subpoena demonstrating good cause.
california constitution grants an express right to privacy art.i,thus our focus is on california case law rather than federal law or the federal constitution.the board statutory authority to access cures during the course of an investigation into lewis alleged unprofessional conduct requires balancing his patients right to privacy in their controlled substances prescription records against the state interest in protecting the public health by regulating the abuse and diversion of controlled substances,and in protecting the public against incompetent,impaired,or negligent physicians.we conclude on balance,the cures statute does not amount to an impermissible invasion of lewis patients state constitutional right to privacy,as there are sufficient safeguards to prevent unwarranted public disclosure and unauthorized access to cures data.thus,we deny the petition 
factual and procedural background 
the board,through its division of medical quality,has statutory authority to investigate,and to take and commence disciplinary action against a physician guilty of unprofessional conduct.bus,subd.a,subd.c arnett dal cielo cal th,see also stiger flippin th.the board enforces the medical practice act bus,et,and several statutory provisions address prescribing controlled substances by.bus,violation of state or federal statute regulating dangerous drugs or controlled substances,furnishing drugs to addicts,prescribing,dispensing,or administering to a person under his or her treatment for medical condition,dangerous drugs or prescription controlled substances for treatment of pain,furnishing dangerous drugs without examination.to assist regulatory agencies,such as the board,in their efforts to control the diversion and resultant abuse of controlled substances,cures electronically monitors the prescribing and dispensing of these prescription drugs.health,former subd.c.
access to cures during investigation and disciplinary proceedings 
the board began its investigation after one of lewis patients complained about the quality of care and treatment that she received during her initial consultation in may.the patient complaint focused on lewis recommendation that she lose weight and start a diet that the patient considered to be unhealthful.
during the course of the investigation,the board investigator obtained cures reports for lewis prescribing practices from november,through november,and from december,through december.the investigator testified that it was a common practice during the course of an investigation to run a cures report on the physician.
based upon a review of these cures reports,the board sent releases to six of lewis patients to obtain their medical records.the board received signed releases from three patients,and the board obtained the other two patients records after an administrative subpoena was issued and notice was sent to the patients that their medical records were being subpoenaed 
the operative second amended accusation accusation filed by the board against lewis alleged,as to the initial patient,gross negligence in her care and treatment by failing to focus on her chief complaints,repeated negligent acts in her care and treatment,failure to maintain medical records,and general unprofessional conduct.with respect to the additional patients,the accusation alleged prescribing without an appropriate prior examination,excessive prescribing,failure to maintain medical records,general unprofessional conduct,and violation of drug statutes.
at the conclusion of the administrative hearing,the administrative law judge alj submitted a proposed decision.as to the initial patient,the alj concluded that lewis engaged in unprofessional conduct by failing to maintain adequate records.with respect to the additional patients,the alj found that two of lewis patients had been controlled substances during a short period of time.the alj,however,concluded it had not been established that lewis engaged in repeated acts of excessive prescribing of dangerous drugs or furnished dangerous drugs without appropriate prior examinations.lewis was disciplined for failing to maintain accurate prescription records.the alj recommended revoking lewis license,but the revocation was stayed.lewis was placed on probation for three years with certain conditions.the board adopted the alj proposed decision.
mandamus proceeding in superior court,petition for writ of mandate 
lewis filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus in the trial court seeking to set aside the board decision.lewis did not challenge the board factual findings and legal conclusions as to the initial patient,but challenged the factual findings and legal conclusions with respect to the additional patients.lewis argued the board violated his patients informational privacy rights under article i,section of the california constitution by accessing cures during the course of an investigation unrelated to improper prescription practices,and also violated their rights not to be subjected to unwarranted searches and seizures.
the trial court denied the petition,concluding cures permitted the board to access the data without an administrative subpoena or other showing of good cause.in the extensive written order,the court further stated that lewis provide d no authority suggesting that an authorized government body review of the cures system data violate d a right to privacy.the trial court noted that even if the constitutional right to privacy were implicated,the right to privacy is not absolute and must be weighed against the compelling public interest in controlling potentially dangerous pharmaceuticals to prevent their abuse.in weighing these competing interests,t he public health and safety concern s served by the monitoring and regulation of the prescription of controlled substances serves a compelling public interest that justifie d disclosure of prescription records without notification or consent.judgment was entered denying the petition for writ of administrative mandamus.
lewis filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court to set aside the judgment.a writ petition is the only authorized mode of appellate review.bus,leone medical board cal th.we issued an order to show cause.for the reasons stated,we discharge the order to show cause and deny lewis petition.
constitutional issue 
lewis presents the following issue for review w hether the medical board of california is permitted to conduct searches,without any showing of any kind whether good cause,reasonable suspicion,or some other similar standard and without warrant or subpoena of the controlled substances prescription records of patients throughout the state,via the state computerized controlled substance utilization review and evaluation system.as stated,the challenge to cures appears to be based upon the protections of the fourth amendment but lewis makes clear that he is asserting his patients right to informational privacy in their controlled substances prescription records.lewis has standing to assert his patients right to privacy under article i,section of the california constitution.wood superior court d.as presented,the issue also appears to be a facial attack to the constitutional validity of cures.a facial challenge to the constitutional validity of a statute or ordinance considers only the text of the measure itself,not its application to the particular circumstances of an individual.tobe city of santa ana cal th.the relief typically sought is total invalidation of the law.therefore,cases hold that the challenger must demonstrate a present total and fatal conflict with applicable constitutional prohibitions,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in contrast,an as applied challenge to a statute or ordinance involves an otherwise facially valid measure that has been applied in a constitutionally impermissible manner.ibid.this type of challenge contemplates analysis of the facts of a particular case or cases to determine the circumstances in which the statute or ordinance has been applied and to consider whether in those particular circumstances the application deprived the individual to whom it was applied of a protected right.ibid.
lewis clarifies that his constitutional challenge does not seek to invalidate the cures statute.he does not challenge the cures statute insofar as the state requires the collection of his patients controlled substances prescription records in a centralized database.nor does he contend here that a warrant or showing of good cause is required in all cures searches.rather,he contends that such a requirement applies when the purpose of the cures search is the investigation of physicians rather than pharmacies.emphasis in original.this distinction is based on the relationship.as it applies to him,lewis constitutional attack is narrowly focused on the board access to his patients cures data during an investigation unrelated to improper prescription practices without patient consent or prior judicial approval upon a showing of good cause 
accordingly,lewis presents an as applied challenge to the cures statute,in which we analyze the facts of his case to determine the circumstances in which cures has been applied and consider whether the application deprived lewis patients of a protected privacy right.see tobe city of santa ana,supra,cal th at.whether a statute is challenged facially or as applied,when the facts are not disputed,the determination of its constitutionality is a question of law that we review de novo.alviso sonoma county sheriff th.
discussion 
the constitutional issue presented here implicates the informational privacy rights of patients in the highly regulated area of controlled substances.we present a brief overview of these statutes before addressing the privacy issues.
regulation of controlled substances 
the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances in california is regulated by the california uniform controlled substances act the act.health,et the act classifies controlled substances into five schedules.health.for example,codeine,hydrocodone,morphine,and methadone are examples of schedule ii drugs.health,subds.b g,i,l c.with the exception of a hour supply for a patient,or an order for use by a hospital patient,no controlled substance classified in schedule ii shall be dispensed without a prescription.health,subds.a,b.except when ordered for use by a hospital patient,or when dispensed directly to an ultimate user by a practitioner,other than a pharmacist or pharmacy,no controlled substance classified in schedule iii,iv,or v may be dispensed without a prescription.health,subd.a.
prescriptions for schedule ii through v drugs must be made on an official form,but schedule iii through v drugs may be dispensed upon an oral or electronically transmitted prescription.health,subds.a,b.if orally or electronically transmitted,a hard copy must be produced and signed and dated by the pharmacist filling the prescription or other authorized person.health,subd.b.these prescription forms must contain the address for whom the controlled substance is prescribed.health,subd.a.if the prescription is orally or electronically transmitted,the hard copy need not include the address if that information is readily retrievable in the pharmacy.health,subd.b.
every practitioner,other than a pharmacist,who prescribes a controlled substance classified in schedule ii through iv has a duty to keep records of controlled substances dispensed.health,subds.a c.each prescriber that dispenses controlled substances shall provide the department of justice the information required by this subdivision on a weekly basis in a format set by the department of justice pursuant to regulation.health,subd.c a.certain exceptions to the reporting requirements apply to schedule ii,iii,and iv controlled substances but are not at issue here.health,subds.e,f.
health and safety code section cures 
the department of justice maintains cures to electronically monitor the prescribing and dispensing of schedule ii through iv controlled substances by all practitioners authorized to prescribe or dispense these controlled substances.health,subd.a.although the legislature has since amended subdivision a of health and safety code section,at the time of these administrative proceedings,the statute stated in pertinent part to assist law enforcement and regulatory agencies in their efforts to control the diversion and resultant abuse of schedule ii,schedule iii,and schedule iv controlled substances,and for statistical analysis,education,and research,the department of justice shall maintain the controlled substance utilization review and evaluation system cures for the electronic monitoring of,and internet access to information regarding,the prescribing and dispensing of schedule ii,schedule iii,and schedule iv controlled substances by all practitioners authorized to prescribe or dispense these controlled substances.
the department of justice receives weekly reports from dispensing pharmacies for schedule ii through iv controlled substances prescriptions.health,subd.d.these reports include the name,address,and telephone number of the ultimate user,the prescriber license number,the pharmacy prescription number,the national drug code ndc of the controlled substance dispensed,the quantity of the controlled substance dispensed,and the number of refills ordered.health,subd.d.
the department of justice provides cures reports to the board without use of a subpoena.health,former subd.c.data obtained from cures shall only be provided to appropriate state,local,and federal persons or public agencies for disciplinary,civil,or criminal purposes and to other agencies or entities,as determined by the department of justice,for the purpose of educating practitioners and others in lieu of disciplinary,civil,or criminal actions.health,former subd.c.former subdivision c of health and safety code section was renumbered as subdivision c without substantive changes to the quoted provision the cures statute prohibits the disclosure,sale,or transfer of data to any third party.health,former subd.c.
at the time of these proceedings,the statute provided that cures shall operate under existing provisions of law to safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of patients.health,former subd.c.subdivision c of health and safety code section now states the operation of cures shall comply with all applicable federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations.
the information practices act of,et places strict limits on the dissemination of personal information to protect an individual right to privacy.subdivision e of civil code section,permits disclosure t o a person,or to another agency where the transfer is necessary for the transferee agency to perform its constitutional or statutory duties,and the use is compatible with a purpose for which the information was collected and the use or transfer is accounted for in accordance with section.a use is compatible if the use of the information requested is needed in an investigation of unlawful activity under the jurisdiction of the requesting agency or for licensing,certification,or regulatory purposes by that agency,subd.e.the board qualifies for authorization under cures to access and review controlled substances prescription records.
the state constitutional right to privacy 
the california constitution contains an explicit guarantee of the right of privacy.art.i,american academy of pediatrics lungren cal th,plur.opn.of george.the constitutional provision states all people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights.among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty,acquiring,possessing,and protecting property,and pursuing and obtaining safety,happiness,and privacy.cal,art.i.the privacy protected by the california constitution is no broader in the area of search and seizure than the privacy protected by the fourth amendment or by article i,section of the california constitution.hill national collegiate athletic cal th,fn.hill.the privacy right at issue here is lewis patients interest in preventing the disclosure or misuse of their controlled substances prescription records,which falls into the category of informational privacy.
the supreme court in whalen roe,assumed a right to informational privacy existed under the federal constitution in controlled substances prescription records.see national aero.and space admin.nelson,fn.people gonzales cal th.i n many contexts,the scope and application of the state constitutional right of privacy is broader and more protective of privacy than the federal constitutional right of privacy as interpreted by the federal courts.citations.american academy of pediatrics lungren,supra,cal th at.the state constitutional right of privacy,and the privacy right protected by the federal constitution are not absolute.rather,the right to privacy is a conditional right that may be infringed upon by balancing the intrusion with a showing of the proper governmental interest.whalen roe,supra,at tucson woman clinic eden cir,hill,supra,cal th at.as previously stated,our analysis focuses on the express guarantee of the right to privacy under the california constitution.
the board did not violate lewis patients right to informational privacy 
article i,section of the california constitution creates a legal and enforceable right of privacy for every californian.white davis cal d.the party claiming a violation of the constitutional right of privacy established in article i,section of the california constitution must establish a legally protected privacy interest,a reasonable expectation of privacy under the circumstances,and a serious invasion of the privacy interest.international federation of professional technical engineers,local,afl cio superior court cal th,citing hill,supra,cal th at.these threshold elements screen out claims that otherwise do not implicate significant intrusions on a privacy interest protected by the state constitutional privacy provision.american academy of pediatrics lungren,supra,cal th at.once these elements are established,the court must then weigh and balance the justification for the conduct in question against the severity of the intrusion on privacy.id.at.
if these threshold elements are proved,the hill decision sets the standard in which a proffered justification for alleged interferences with the right to privacy will be measured.where the case involves an obvious invasion of an interest fundamental to personal autonomy,freedom from involuntary sterilization or the freedom to pursue consensual familial relationships,a compelling interest must be present to overcome the vital privacy interest.if,in contrast,the privacy interest is less central,or in bona fide dispute,general balancing tests are employed.hill,supra,cal th at.
whether a legally recognized privacy interest is present in a given case is a question of law to be decided by the court.citations.whether plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the circumstances and whether defendant conduct constitutes a serious invasion of privacy are mixed questions of law and fact.hill,supra,cal th at.
legally protected privacy right 
the right to privacy extends to medical records.john superior court cal th,board of medical quality assurance gherardini d.the state of a person tract is as much entitled to privacy from unauthorized public or bureaucratic snooping as is that person bank account,the contents of his library or his membership in the naacp.board of medical quality assurance gherardini,supra,at.
like medical records,prescription records contain identifying information and sensitive information related to drugs used to treat a person medical condition and also reveal medical decisions concerning the course of treatment.what medication a person takes to treat a condition also is entitled to privacy from unauthorized public and bureaucratic snooping.
by statute,there also is a legally protected privacy interest in controlled substances prescription records stored in cures.health and safety code section,which permits a treating physician or pharmacist to access cures data,specifically states that this information is considered medical information subject to the provisions of the confidentiality of medical information act,et health,subd.d.moreover,the cures statute prohibits unauthorized public disclosure and operates under existing law to safeguard privacy and confidentiality.health,former subd.c,subd.e.thus,a patient who has obtained a prescription for a controlled substance has a legally protected privacy interest in unwarranted public disclosure and unauthorized access to information contained in those records.
reasonable expectation of privacy 
even when a legally cognizable privacy interest is present,other factors may affect a person reasonable expectation of privacy.hill,supra,cal th at.citing whalen roe,supra,at page,the hill court noted that customs,practices,and physical settings may create or inhibit reasonable expectations of privacy.hill,supra,at.
in whalen roe,supra,the supreme court upheld a new york statute that required reporting schedule ii prescription records to the state department of health.the information included the name of the prescribing physician,the dispensing pharmacy,the drug and dosage,and the name,address,and age of the patient.id.at.this data was recorded into a centralized computer system.ibid.the collection of this data,as part of the state oversight of controlled substances,was not an unwarranted disclosure of private information in violation of federal constitutionally protected privacy rights.id.at.the whalen court concluded collecting this centralized data was supported by established law and not meaningfully distinguishable from a host of other unpleasant invasions of privacy that are associated with many facets of health care.id.at.thus,the new york statute did not violate any right or liberty protected by the fourteenth amendment.id.at.
addressing the threat of public disclosure,the whalen court noted there was a possibility that the data may be offered in a judicial proceeding if a doctor or patient is accused of a violation of the law.whalen roe,supra,at.the court reasoned,however,that the remote possibility judicial supervision of the evidentiary use of this data would provide inadequate privacy protection was insufficient to hold the new york statute facially unconstitutional.id.at.
we recognize the privacy issue in whalen roewas limited to collecting centralized data by the state,and thus the court did not address the issue presented here,that is,a patient right to informational privacy when these centralized controlled substances prescription records are accessed by a state,local,or federal agency for disciplinary,civil,or criminal purposes nevertheless,we find whalen roe to be persuasive,as did the california supreme court in hill,to illustrate what constitutes a reasonable expectation of privacy.
there is a diminished expectation of privacy in controlled substances prescription records maintained in cures.contrary to lewis contention,it does not follow that a patient expectation of privacy in his or her controlled substances prescription records is the same as the expectation of privacy in medical records.unlike medical records,prescriptions of controlled substances are subject to regular scrutiny by law enforcement and regulatory agencies as part of the pervasive regulation of controlled substances.a reasonable patient filling a prescription for a controlled substance knows or should know that the state,which prohibits the distribution and use of such drugs without a prescription,will monitor the flow of these drugs from pharmacies to patients.pharmacies are required to maintain records of prescriptions filled for controlled substances and present them to authorized officers of the law without a warrant.people doss th,see also bus,subd.a,subd.a.a pharmacist also has a statutory obligation to provide data of controlled substances prescriptions to the department of justice on a weekly basis for electronic monitoring in cures.health,subd.d.this and regulatory history significantly diminishes any reasonable expectation of privacy against the release of controlled substances prescription records to state,local,or federal agencies for purposes of criminal,civil,or disciplinary investigations 
both federal and state courts also have recognized that closely regulated businesses have a reduced expectation of privacy whether analyzed as creating an unreasonable expectation of privacy or a reasonable expectation of privacy justified by a competing state interest,new york burger,people doss,supra,th at.while the reasonable expectation of privacy is diminished here,it is not de minimus.a patient has a reasonable expectation that sufficient statutory safeguards in cures prevent unwarranted public disclosure and unauthorized access to their controlled substances prescription records.
seriousness of invasion 
not every intrusion of privacy gives rise to a cause of action for invasion of privacy.hill,supra,cal th at.actionable invasions of privacy must be sufficiently serious in their nature,scope,and actual or potential impact to constitute an egregious breach of the social norms underlying the privacy right.ibid.lewis contends that when the board accessed cures,a serious invasion of his patients privacy rights occurred because there are no criminal or civil sanctions in the cures statute to safeguard against unwarranted public disclosure,and there is no statutory requirement of a showing of good cause or other judicial determination before the board accessed his patients cures data 
unwarranted public disclosure 
the fear,not present here,that the board will publicly disclose cures data obtained during the course of a investigation does not constitute a serious invasion of privacy.the board has statutory and regulatory duties to protect against the public release of a patient cures data.as noted,the board may lawfully obtain cures data as authorized by statute for disciplinary purposes.health,former subd.c.data disclosed to any individual agency can not be sold or transferred to a third party.ibid.the board also must secure cures data against unauthorized disclosure and has an independent statutory duty to protect the privacy and confidentiality of any information it obtains in the discharge of its duties.bus.civil code section,subdivision e further requires the board to protect cures data from unwarranted public disclosure.here,there is no contention that the board publicly disclosed lewis patients information to third parties or failed to protect the confidentiality of the cures data it received during the course of its investigation.
lewis relies on tucson woman clinic eden,supra,in which the ninth circuit concluded that the informational privacy rights of patients were violated by arizona regulations that required disclosure of unredacted medical records to the arizona department of health services dhs,and ultrasound pictures with patient identifying information to a private contractor for review.id.at.the ninth circuit employed a balancing test to weigh the privacy interest against the state intrusion,noting the safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure of unredacted medical records and ultrasound pictures to members of the public were inadequate.id.at.citing whalen roe,supra,at pages through,the ninth circuit reasoned that,unlike the arizona regulations,the new york statute imposed criminal penalties for such unauthorized disclosures.tucson woman clinic eden,supra,at.additionally,there were no safeguards in the arizona regulations to limit access to these records,which on balance constituted a violation of the patients informational privacy rights.id.at.
the ninth circuit analysis,however,was decidedly different concerning the regulation that required to release information,including the name of a patient,to a professional licensing board if an incident arose with the patient.tucson woman clinic eden,supra,at.the court recognized that although a professional licensing board was not covered by the statutory scheme prohibitions on information disclosure,other established safeguards prohibited release of patient information to the public when any incident was reported to the arizona medical board or the board of osteopathic examiners in medicine and surgery.id.at.the requested information was limited,and the state had a strong interest in the licensing board investigating serious patient incidents.employing the balancing test,the ninth circuit concluded there was no violation of patients informational privacy rights ibid.
here,although there are no penalties in cures for unwarranted public disclosure,other safeguards prohibit release of patient information to the public.thus,we conclude the release of cures data to the board during an investigation of a is not a serious invasion of privacy because sufficient safeguards are in place.
access to cures data without a warrant or subpoena 
lewis next contends the board access to cures during an investigation of a is a serious invasion of his patients privacy rights because there is a reasonable societal expectation that to conduct such a search there must be a showing of good cause or other reasonableness standard to obtain an administrative subpoena or warrant.lewis argues the board must make this showing before accessing cures.
lewis argument is a challenge to the board authority to access cures to compile the facts necessary to obtain administrative subpoenas for his patients medical records.to support his argument,lewis principally relies on state skinner so d,which held that a warrantless search of a criminal defendant pharmacy records during a criminal investigation violated the defendant fourth amendment privacy interests and the state constitutional right to privacy id.at.the court addressed whether louisiana citizens have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their pharmaceutical prescriptions and medical records such that a warrant is required for a search of those records in a criminal investigation.id.at.analyzing federal jurisprudence under the fourth amendment privacy interest and the state heightened privacy interest,the skinner court concluded the right to privacy in one medical and prescription records is an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable.id.at.thus,a warrant was required.
absent from lewis discussion of skinner is a distinction critical here,that is,a balancing test was inapplicable to the court fourth amendment analysis of the intrusion into individual privacy during the course of a criminal investigation.state skinner,supra,so d at.in whalen roe,supra,the united states supreme court dismissed the claims raised pursuant to the fourth amendment,noting that the cases cited in support of that argument involved affirmative,unannounced,narrowly focused intrusions into individual privacy during the course of criminal investigations.id.at,fn.the whalen court declined to extend the fourth amendment protections to the informational privacy interest at stake in that case.ibid.
like the informational privacy rights under the federal constitution at issue in whalen roe and tucson woman clinic eden,under this state constitutional right to privacy art.i,we must balance the justification against the intrusion when a case involves a genuine,nontrivial invasion of a privacy interest thus,skinner,which is authority,is not persuasive.
focusing on the fourth amendment privacy interest,lewis further argues that access to cures without an administrative subpoena or warrant is a serious invasion of privacy that can not be justified under the closely regulated business exception to the warrant requirement.the rationale for this exception is the owner or operator of a closely regulated business has a reduced expectation of privacy.
a warrantless search of a closely regulated business is deemed reasonable if certain criteria are met.new york burger,supra,at de la cruz quackenbush,supra
