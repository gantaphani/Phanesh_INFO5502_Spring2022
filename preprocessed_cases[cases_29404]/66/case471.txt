park medical operates a pharmacy in the mercy medical building.
in september,park medical filed a complaint against the medical group,alleging that the medical group was dispensing drugs in violation of the business and professions code and were unlawfully operating a retail pharmacy because the medical group was dispensing drugs on a basis.park medical alleged its retail prescription sales to the medical group patients had declined after the medical group began dispensing drugs directly to its patients.park medical also alleged that as a result of dispensing drugs to its patients,the medical group had significantly interfered with park medical ability to conduct a viable,business by diverting patients away from their pharmacy.park medical included causes of action for violations of sections authorizing physician dispensing and unfair business practices and intentional or negligent interference with prospective economic advantage.park medical sought declaratory and injunctive relief.
the medical group brought a motion for summary judgment contending that,as a matter of law,the medical group was not violating the business and professions code because the code allowed physicians to dispense drugs directly to their patients on a basis the court framed the issue as whether the act of dispensing medications by the medical group to its patients for profit constitutes keeping a pharmacy within the meaning of subdivision of section.the court granted summary judgment,concluding that dispensing drugs on a basis did not mean the medical group was keeping a pharmacy.
discussion 
park medical contends the medical group,by dispensing drugs to its patients on a basis,has violated section,subdivision a,which prohibits physicians from keeping a pharmacy for the retailing of dangerous drugs.we are thus presented with an issue of statutory interpretation.

the business and professions code contains a comprehensive scheme,the pharmacy law,that regulates the dispensing of dangerous drugs,prescription medications.et article of the pharmacy law addresses when a physician may dispense drugs.section,which is at issue in this case,sets out conditions imposed on a physician a prescriber who dispenses drugs to his or patients 
a no prescriber shall dispense drugs or dangerous devices to patients in his or her office or place of practice unless all of the following conditions are met 
the dangerous drugs or dangerous devices are dispensed to the prescriber own patient,and the drugs or dangerous devices are not furnished by a nurse or physician attendant.
the dangerous drugs or dangerous devices are necessary in the treatment of the condition for which the prescriber is attending the patient.
the prescriber does not keep a pharmacy,open shop,or drugstore,advertised or otherwise,for the retailing of dangerous drugs,dangerous devices,or poisons.
the prescriber fulfills all of the labeling requirements,all of the recordkeeping requirements of this chapter,and all of the packaging requirements of good pharmaceutical practice,including the use of childproof containers.
the prescriber does not use a dispensing device unless he or she personally owns the device and the contents of the device,and personally dispenses the dangerous drugs or dangerous devices to the patient packaged,labeled,and recorded in accordance with paragraph.
the prescriber,prior to dispensing,offers to give a written prescription to the patient that the patient may elect to have filled by the prescriber or by any pharmacy.
the prescriber provides the patient with written disclosure that the patient has a choice between obtaining the prescription from the dispensing prescriber or obtaining the prescription at a pharmacy of the patient choice.
a certified who functions pursuant to a standardized procedure or protocol described in section,a nurse practitioner who functions pursuant to a standardized procedure described in section,or protocol,or a physician assistant who functions pursuant to section,may hand to a patient of the supervising physician and surgeon a properly labeled prescription drug prepackaged by a physician and surgeon,a manufacturer as defined in this chapter,or a pharmacist.
b the medical board of california,the state board of optometry,the dental board of california,the osteopathic medical board of california,the board of registered nursing,and the physician assistant committee shall have authority with the california state board of pharmacy to ensure compliance with this section,and those boards are specifically charged with the enforcement of this chapter with respect to their respective licensees.
c prescriber,as used in this section,means a person,who holds a physician and surgeon certificate,a license to practice optometry,a license to practice dentistry,or a certificate to practice podiatry,and who is duly registered as such by the medical board of california,the state board of optometry,the dental board of california,or the board of osteopathic examiners of this state.italics added.
the legislature has required that physicians who dispense drugs pursuant to section must have a secure area to store the drugs.the legislature has also stated that section does not prohibit a physician from dispensing a limited quantity of a manufacturer drug samples to his or her patients so long as the samples are in the original packaging,the physician makes a record in the patient chart,and does not charge the patient for the drug,subd.a.
park medical argues that the legislature intent not to allow physicians to dispense drugs to their patients on a basis is reflected in section,subdivision a,which conditions a physician authorization to dispense drugs on the physician not keeping a pharmacy,open shop,or drugstore,advertised or otherwise,for the retailing of dangerous drugs,dangerous devices,or poisons.park medical asserts that the medical group physicians are keeping a pharmacy because they have a separate room the physician dispensing unit where dangerous drugs are stored,possessed,furnished,sold,and dispensed at retail.park medical argues this room falls within section definition of pharmacy,which park medical asserts includes any area,place,or premises wherein controlled substances,dangerous drugs,or dangerous devices are furnished,sold,or dispensed at retail.
initially,we note the legislature could not have intended that the mere existence of a separate area within a medical office to store,prepare and dispense drugs would constitute keeping a pharmacy since the legislature has specifically required,as a condition of dispensing drugs to patients,that the physician have a separate,secure area to store the drugs he or she dispenses.
additionally,while section contains a definition of pharmacy,the provision relating to dispensing physicians keeping a pharmacy predates the definition contained in section and represents language essentially unchanged since when the legislature first regulated the dispensing of drugs.stats,ch.in,the legislature in addressing the ability of licensed pharmacists to dispense drugs,required e very store or shop where drugs,medicines or chemicals are dispensed or sold at retail,or displayed for sale at retail and that displayed certain signs such as apothecary or pharmacy to have a licensed pharmacist,but provided the act did not apply and was not to interfere with any practitioner of medicine with supplying his own patients,as their physician,and by them employed as such,with such remedies as he may desire,and who does not keep a pharmacy,open shop,or,advertised or otherwise,for the retailing of medicines or poisons.at that time,there was no statutory definition of the word pharmacy.in other words,the word pharmacy as used in section,subdivision a reflected the common usage of the word rather than any technical statutory definition.
the common definitions of the word pharmacy include not only a place where drugs are compounded and dispensed,but are also synonymous with the word drugstore.a as commonly understood means a pharmacy or chemist shop,often also dealing extensively or mainly in other articles,as toilet requisites,stationery,magazines and newspapers,light refreshments,oxford english,supra,as of.under common usage,the words pharmacy and drugstore connote a place where drugs are sold to the general public pursuant to a physician prescription as well as a place where other items are sold to the general public.
when viewed in context,it is apparent the legislature concern in prohibiting physicians from keeping a pharmacy was not to prohibit physicians from selling particular unregulated items such as toothpaste and soap.rather,the legislature intent in stating that physicians could not keep a pharmacy,open shop,or drugstore,subd.a was to prohibit physicians from having a store,shop or similar place where they sold drugs to the general public,and to limit physicians to dispensing drugs to their own patients for the condition for which the patient was seeking treatment this conclusion is also consistent with the legislature early use of the word pharmacy,which was defined in terms of a retail drug store,a pharmacy or drug department stats,ch,or as a store or shop where drugs,medicines or medicinal poisons are dispensed or sold at retail,or displayed for sale at retail and that displayed certain signs such as druggist,pharmacy,or drug store.stats,ch,stats,ch,stats,ch,former bus.pursuant to these definitions,it is apparent that the legislature intent in prohibiting physicians from keeping a pharmacy was to prohibit physicians from dispensing drugs to the general public,from operating a store or shop where drugs were sold to the general public.nothing in the language of the statute indicates the legislature prohibition on physicians,keeping a pharmacy was intended to address or to limit the profits a physician could make from dispensing drugs to his or her patients.
park medical also argues that an intent to prohibit physicians from dispensing drugs on a basis is demonstrated by the fact that section,subdivision a prohibits physicians from the retailing of dangerous drugs,dangerous devices,or poisons.italics added.park medical argues profit is inherent in the term retail,as evidenced by the definition of wholesale price which is defined as the price paid by the retailer in expectation of obtaining a higher price by way of profit from the resale of the product to the ultimate consumer.black law dict.ed at.profit is the excess of revenues over the expenses of the transaction,at.park medical also relies on the definition of sale at retail in revenue and taxation code section 
a retail sale or sale at retail means a sale for any purpose other than resale in the regular course of business in the form of tangible personal property.
when tangible personal property is delivered by an owner or former owner thereof,or by a factor or agent of that owner,former owner,or factor to a consumer or to a person for redelivery to a consumer,pursuant to a retail sale made by a retailer not engaged in business in this state,the person making the delivery shall be deemed the retailer of that property.he or she shall include the retail selling price of the property in his or her gross receipts or sales price.
while,obviously,retailers typically hope to make a profit,the term retailing does not necessarily require the making of a profit.the term retailing,as commonly understood,means merely to sell in small lots to the ultimate consumer.see black law dict.ed,oxford english,supra,as of.retailing is distinguished from wholesaling,which is selling in large lots for resale to consumers.black law,supra,wholesale the sale of goods or commodities usu ally for resale by a retailer,as opposed to a sale to the ultimate consumer.
the pharmacy law does not contain a definition of retail or retailing,but does contain a number of sections distinguishing between retailers and wholesalers on the basis of whether the sale is to the ultimate consumer or for resale.see defining veterinary drug retailer defining wholesaler,subd.a regulating who may purchase drugs or dangerous devices at wholesale.it appears to us that retailing as used by the legislature in section,subdivision a reflects the common meaning of selling to the ultimate consumer rather than a reference to profit.
further,when the legislature began using the word retail in connection with the operation of a pharmacy,it was in the context of a store or shop where drugs are dispensed or sold at retail,or displayed for sale at retail.stats,ch,former bus.we find nothing in the language of section,subdivision a,the statutory scheme,or the legislative history that supports a conclusion that the legislature ever intended nor now intends the term at retail to mean a sale for a profit rather than a sale to the general public.
more basically,we find park medical argument unpersuasive because it fails to explain why,if the legislature had intended to mean by retailing that a physician could not dispense drugs on a basis,the legislature did not say that.if the legislature had intended to prohibit dispensing fees,it easily could have so stated,as it did in other statutes.see,subd.a prohibiting physician from charging a patient a fee for a manufacturer drug sample prohibiting a nonprofit or free clinic from charging any professional dispensing fee that may be authorized under the program prohibiting a surgical clinic from charging a professional dispensing fee that may be authorized under the program,offering drugs for sale or charging or billing for professional services for the dispensing or administering of drugs restricting the resale of drugs acquired at preferentially low prices under the federal nonprofit institutions act restricting the amount a pharmacy participating in the program may charge for prescription medications.we believe park medi
