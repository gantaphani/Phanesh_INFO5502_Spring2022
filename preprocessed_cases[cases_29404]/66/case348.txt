this legal malpractice case tenders the doctrine of judicial estoppel,which precludes a party from taking inconsistent positions in separate proceedings where the position in the first proceeding was adopted by the court or accepted by it as true.jackson county of los angeles th,d jackson.judicial estoppel differs from collateral estoppel or equitable estoppel in that it is focused on the relationship between the litigant and the judicial system and not on the relationship of the parties.id.at,d.
the issue arises in a malpractice action initiated by plaintiffs,the swahn group,roger swahn and pamela swahn collectively,the swahns in which the trial court sustained the demurrer of defendants malcolm segal,james kirby,and segal kirby collectively,s k.s k had represented the plaintiffs as their attorneys in an action against gary tharaldson and his various business enterprises for breach of a contract to develop hotels.on the advice of s k the breach of contract action was settled.the plaintiffs changed attorneys and brought an action to rescind the settlement agreement.the rescission action resulted in a second settlement agreement which was not incorporated in a judgment.this action was then filed claiming that s k committed malpractice in the initial breach of contract action.the defendants filed a demurrer,which the trial court sustained and dismissed the malpractice action.
the primary basis for the trial court ruling was that plaintiffs were judicially estopped to pursue this action because positions critical to their malpractice claims were totally inconsistent with positions taken by them in the rescission action.the trial court found that the swahns could not claim that their attorneys were negligent in advising a settlement of the initial action and also claim to have been fraudulently induced to settle by tharaldson.
the rescission action resulted in a settlement agreement between plaintiffs and tharaldson and his business enterprises.the only evidence of the terms of the settlement is the swahns allegation in the malpractice complaint against s k that s k ultimately resolved all disputes with tharaldson by way of a settlement which involved payments to members of the plaintiffs family and the granting of a petition to approve the compromise of the claim of trevor swahn,a minor.the order granting the petition is not in the record and the summary of the case submitted to the trial court for a minor compromise does not mention the swahns allegations of fraud and concealment against tharaldson,et,but states only that tharaldson refused to perform under the terms of the purported settlement and refused to execute formal settlement documentation 
we shall conclude that the requirements for judicial estoppel were not met since the trial court did not adopt the claims advanced by the plaintiffs in the settlement of the rescission action that conflict with claims advanced in this action.
we shall reverse the judgment of dismissal.
factual and procedural background 
this appeal arises after the trial court sustained s k demurrer to the legal malpractice complaint.accordingly,the facts we review are those alleged in the malpractice complaint together with the materials it incorporates,the materials noticed by the trial court,and the actions taken by the trial court 
underlying both this action and the rescission action was a development contract dispute between the swahns and one of tharaldson companies.s k acted as the swahns attorney in the dispute,which resulted in an arbitration proceeding.one of the grounds for the rescission action was that tharaldson fraudulently induced the swahns to sign the settlement agreement by misrepresenting the terms of the agreement.the swahns also alleged that tharaldson,or certain of his corporations,made material misrepresentations that led the swahns to pursue an unnecessary arbitration.
a.the development contract 
the legal malpractice complaint alleges that in,the swahns entered into a contract with c g development,c g,a corporation owned and operated by tharaldson.under the terms of the contract,the swahns agreed to assist in the construction of hotels over a period,in exchange for a payment of per hotel plus a nine and percent ownership interest in each hotel.the swahns percentage interest in each hotel was to be percent vested on the date the hotel opened for business,and percent vested on the date all hotels were completed.the contract contained a binding arbitration provision.
after the swahns and c g entered into the development contract,separate corporations were created to own and operate each hotel.these corporations were not signatories to the development contract.we shall refer to them as the hotel corporations.
without the swahns knowledge,c g filed articles of dissolution in.in,tharaldson attempted to terminate the development contract on the ground the time period set forth in the contract for the construction of hotels had expired.
development contract litigation 
the swahns hired s k to advise them regarding the contract dispute with tharaldson.s k,on the swahns behalf,filed a complaint for breach of the development contract against c g and other entities,including the hotel corporations.s k objected to tharaldson demand for arbitration,but the trial court ordered c g and the swahns,but not the hotel corporations,to arbitration.
the arbitration was divided into two and damages.in phase one of the arbitration the arbitration panel ruled in the swahns favor against c g.the arbitration panel deferred the issue of the culpability of any defendants other than c g to the second phase of the arbitration.
settlement of development contract litigation 
phase two of the arbitration proceeding was never held because the parties entered into mediation,which resulted in a settlement agreement.a handwritten settlement agreement gave the swahns a to percent interest in of the hotel corporations,in cash,and a loan in an amount totaling nearly two million dollars.the agreement was signed by tharaldson in his individual capacity,as well as his capacity as president of c g,president of tharaldson development company,and president of the hotel corporations in which the swahns were to have an ownership interest.the settlement agreement contained a provision that any dispute concerning the documentation of the agreement would be resolved by the mediator.
action to rescind settlement agreement 
the swahns then changed attorneys.approximately six months after substitution of counsel,the swahns sent tharaldson a notice of rescission of the settlement agreement.the notice asserted that the dispute concerned the swahns understanding that loan repayments would be made from dividends,as opposed to tharaldson view that both distributions and dividends would be security for the loans.the grounds stated for rescission were mutual mistake of fact and fraud in the inducement.the swahns claimed that tharaldson interpretation of the settlement agreement was concealed from swahn counsel s k and the mediator by tharaldson and their counsel.the swahns contended that these representations and concealments by tharaldson to the mediator and to their counsel were fraudulent.
thereafter,the swahns,represented by current counsel,filed a complaint for rescission and damages against tharaldson,various corporations,and the hotel corporations.the action sought to rescind the handwritten settlement agreement.
the rescission complaint alleged that the defendants who were not parties to the development contract stated in writing to the arbitrators during the arbitration and before the phase i interim award that they were voluntarily appearing in the arbitration.it also alleged that as a part of a continuing plan and scheme on the part of tharaldson and the other defendants to defraud the swahns,defendants who were not signatories to the hotel development contract the hotel corporations intended to walk a legal tight rope by leading plaintiffs to believe that they were appearing in the arbitration but,if the arbitration award was against them,planned to recant and renege on their voluntary appearance claiming that they were not bound by the arbitration decision.and in fact,after the plaintiffs resounding victory in the phase i liability decision,some of the defendants suddenly claimed that they had not appeared and were not bound by the decision against them.
the rescission complaint also alleged there was a lack of the meeting of the minds regarding the source of the repayment of the settlement loans.plaintiffs insisted that the settlement loans would be repaid from corporate dividends only tharaldson contends that the handwritten purported agreement provides that the settlement loans may be repaid from hotel sales proceeds as well as dividends.the rescission complaint alleged there was an inconsistency in the repayment terms of the loan because one paragraph stated that the swahns would assign all to tharaldson financial as security for the loans and another paragraph stated that the loan will be repaid only out of any dividends declared by the hotels 
the trial court ordered the dispute over the settlement agreement back to the mediator,pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement.the case was subsequently settled for a payment to the swahns of approximately six million dollars.prior to the settlement,the initial breach of contract action on the development agreement was dismissed by the court for failure to prosecute.
malpractice litigation 
the legal malpractice complaint states causes of action in professional negligence,breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and fraud 
in particular the malpractice complaint alleges s k was negligent when it failed to ascertain c g true corporate standing prior to filing the development contract complaint,told the swahns they could not pursue their claims against the hotel corporations because the court had ordered them to arbitration,failed to secure an agreement that the hotel corporations or tharaldson would appear at the arbitration voluntarily and be bound by any award,failed to seek reconsideration to clarify that the hotel corporations had voluntarily agreed to appear in the arbitration,disclosed the swahns financial arrangements with s k to tharaldson,and abandoned the swahns.
s k demurred to the complaint and took judicial notice of a petition to compromise a minor claim involving the allocation of payments made pursuant to the settlement,a matter we discuss in detail later.s k argued the doctrine of judicial estoppel prevented the swahns from taking the position in this action that the arbitration was unnecessary and meaningless,when in the prior rescission action they claimed to have won a resounding victory.s k argued that the swahns could not argue that s k negligently advised them to settle when it claimed in the rescission action that its attorneys were the victims of tharaldson fraud.s k also demurred for failure to allege causation and for uncertainty.
the trial court sustained the demurrer to the entire complaint on the ground of judicial estoppel.the trial court explained its ruling as follows 
the swahns complaint for professional negligence,breach of fiduciary duty and fraud is based on the allegation that segal kirby prosecution of the arbitration against c g was negligent because it was unnecessary and meaningless because segal kirby failed to pursue the hotel corporations 
judicial estoppel focuses on the relationship between the litigant and the judicial system.the doctrine should apply when the same party has taken two positions the positions were taken in judicial or administrative proceedings the party was successful in asserting the first position,the tribunal adopted the position or accepted it as true the two positions are totally inconsistent and the first position was not taken as a result of ignorance,fraud,or mistake.citation.
a settlement in some instances may be equivalent to winning a judgment for purposes of applying judicial estoppel.the pivotal issue is whether it can be established that the party succeeded in the first position or that the position was a basis or important to the settlement.citation.
in this malpractice action,the swahns assert that segal kirby pursued an unnecessary and meaningless arbitration in the liability phase,and then negligently or fraudulently induced plaintiffs to enter into a mediated settlement agreement,resulting in an inadequate recovery to their clients.in the prior rescission action the swahns alleged that they obtained a resounding victory in the arbitration phase liability decision 
in this action,plaintiffs allege that segal kirby pressured and cajoled plaintiffs into settling.in the prior action,where the notice of rescission is incorporated by reference,plaintiffs assert that the fraud was perpetrated against both the swahns counsel segal kirby and the mediator 
in the mediation,segal kirby can not be both fraudulently deceived,and negligent in advising the swahns to settle.the two positions are inconsistent,are both taken in judicial proceedings by the same party,and are irreconcilable 
the trial court also sustained the demurrer on the grounds of failure to allege causation and uncertainty.
discussion 
ijudicial estoppel 
the doctrine of judicial estoppel precludes a party from taking inconsistent positions in separate judicial proceedings.jackson,supra,th at,d.it is invoked to prevent a party from changing its position over the course of judicial proceedings when such positional changes have an adverse impact on the judicial process the policies underlying preclusion of inconsistent positions are general consideration s of the orderly administration of justice and regard for the dignity of judicial proceedings.judicial estoppel is intended to protect against a litigant playing fast and loose with the courts.citation.it seems patently wrong to allow a person to abuse the judicial process by first advocating one position,and later,if it becomes beneficial,to assert the opposite.comment,the judiciary says,you ca have it both ways judicial doctrine precluding inconsistent positions loyola,hereafter you ca have it both ways.ibid.
judicial estoppel differs from equitable estoppel in that equitable estoppel is focused on the relationship between the parties,whereas judicial estoppel is focused on the relationship between the litigant and the judicial system.jackson,supra,th at,d.e quitable estoppel requires privity,reliance,and prejudice because the doctrine concentrates on the relationship between the parties to a specific case.conversely,none of these elements is or should be required under the judicial estoppel doctrine the gravamen of judicial estoppel is not privity,reliance,or prejudice.rather,it is the intentional assertion of an inconsistent position that perverts the judicial machinery.citations.ibid.
judicial estoppel differs from collateral estoppel in that judicial estoppel does not require a final judgment.jackson,supra,th at,d.the doctrines also differ in that collateral estoppel deprives a party of the right to relitigate an issue,whereas judicial estoppel deprives a party of the right to assert a particular position.ibid.the purposes of the two doctrines differ in that collateral estoppel is designed to conserve judicial resources by preventing repetitive litigation,while judicial estoppel maintain s the purity and integrity of the judicial process by preventing inconsistent positions from being asserted.ibid.
in jackson,supra,th at page,d,the court set forth the following five requirements for the application of judicial estoppel the same party has taken two positions the positions were taken in judicial or administrative proceedings the party was successful in asserting the first position,the tribunal adopted the position or accepted it as true the two positions are totally inconsistent and the first position was not taken as a result of ignorance,fraud,or mistake.see also aguilar lerner cal th,d.
application of judicial estoppel on demurrer 
the swahns first argue that the doctrine of judicial estoppel may be applied only at a stage because the court must evaluate the facts before it can exercise its discretion to apply the doctrine.thus,they argue,the trial court erred in applying the doctrine at the demurrer stage.
the swahns find some support for this position in cloud northrop grumman th,d.in that case a terminated employee filed for chapter bankruptcy protection.she later brought a wrongful termination and sexual harassment action against her former employer,but had not disclosed any such claim in her bankruptcy action.id.at,d.the trial court granted the defendants motion for judgment on the pleadings in part on the ground that the employee was judicially estopped from pursuing her claim.id.at,d.in reversing the trial court,the court of appeal stated a defense of judicial estoppel raises factual issues.see,ryan operations lumber cir.these factual issues could not be decided solely by reviewing plaintiff complaint and matters that could be judicially noticed,and hence could not be decided on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.id.at,d.
in particular,the court held that nondisclosure in bankruptcy filings,standing alone,was insufficient to support a finding of bad faith intent,which was necessary in that context to satisfy the fifth element of judicial of ignorance,fraud,or mistake.id.at,d.accordingly,the court concluded that there was evidence which could negate the findings necessary to support the application of judicial estoppel,the debtor could have made a mistake born of misunderstanding,ignorance of legal procedures,lack of adequate legal advice,or some other innocent cause,rather than engaged in a deliberate scheme to mislead and gain unfair advantage.id.at,d.thus,the trial court should not have decided the issue on a motion for judgment on the pleadings.ibid.
however,the application of judicial estoppel tenders a question of fact only if a determination of fact is necessary to make a ruling on the claim.kelsey waste management of alameda county th,d.if the facts material to a determination of judicial estoppel are undisputed,a question of law is presented.international engine parts,feddersen th,d drain betz laboratories,th,fn,d.since we must accept as true facts that are properly pleaded,and must consider those facts of which judicial notice may be taken schifando city of los angeles cal th,d,these facts are undisputed.we may decide the issue of judicial estoppel if such facts indicate the doctrine should be applied on demurrer.
thus we are not prevented,as the swahns argue,from affirming a finding of judicial estoppel at the pleading stage.rather,we must examine the elements of the doctrine and the or facts to determine whether there was a basis for the trial court application of the doctrine.
in a carefully worded assertion,the swahns claim that after exhaustive research they have been unable to locate a single published decision in which an appellate court has upheld the application of judicial estoppel at the demurrer stage.italics added.while technically correct,this statement is somewhat misleading.
in furia helm th,d,the appellate court did not uphold an application of judicial estoppel in the trial court because the trial court did not rely on that ground in sustaining the demurrer.id.at,d.rather,the court of appeal on its own relied on judicial estoppel in concluding the demurrer was properly sustained without leave to amend.id.at,d.
also,in new hampshire maine d,the united states supreme court granted a motion to dismiss on the ground of judicial estoppel.a motion to dismiss in federal court is the equivalent of a demurrer in california.bach county of butte d.
accordingly,the trial court may sustain a demurrer on the ground of judicial estoppel where the facts pleaded and judicially noticed indicate as a matter of law the doctrine should be applied,that a court has adopted or accepted as true the inconsistent position 
as we will show,the only such fact that is a candidate for judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position is the fact that a minor compromise may have been granted by the trial court incident to the settlement agreement in the rescission action.however,no order approving the compromise of the minor claim appears in the record.moreover,the summary of the case pursuant to which the compromise was granted,if it was granted,does not clearly show a position inconsistent with that asserted in this case.
earlier position was not successfully asserted 
the swahns argue that the positions they took in the two litigations were not inconsistent,and that they made claims in the malpractice action that were not raised in the rescission action.
it can not be denied that the swahns made inconsistent factual allegations in the two actions.in this action,for example,the swahns allege that on august,pamela swahn told s k that c g was dissolved.presumably,this should have put s k on notice that any action against c g would be worthless,as any award would be unrecoverable.in the rescission action,the swahns asserted that they did not become aware until the arbitration was over in that c g had been dissolved.the swahns also alleged that they reasonably believe d that c g was still in existence until after the first phase of the arbitration concluded.
the swahns allege in this action that s k cajoled them into settling the contract litigation on whatever terms tharaldson would agree to,and that they were forced to settle because they had exhausted their financial resources.the swahns allege s k was negligent in failing to secure a settlement agreement containing the terms the swahns desired,particularly the terms protecting the swahns cash distributions.
by contrast,in the rescission action the swahns specifically alleged that tharaldson and the other defendants fraudulently induced them into executing the settlement agreement through false promises,misrepresentations and concealments.
we need not determine whether these factual inconsistencies amount to different positions,whether such different positions are totally inconsistent,or whether the first position in the rescission action was taken without ignorance,fraud,or mistake,because we conclude that the swahns were not successful in asserting the first position,since the court did not adopt or approve the first position 
the third jackson factor requires that the party claiming judicial estoppel was successful in asserting the first position.jackson,supra,th at,d.this means not just that the party prevailed in the earlier action,but that the tribunal adopted the position or accepted it as true.ibid.there is no evidence in the record before us that the tribunal adopted plaintiffs earlier position.first,while there is a petition to approve the compromise of the claim of a minor,there is no order approving the compromise.second,even if such an order were in the record,there is no evidence the order was based on an acceptance of the truth of the plaintiffs earlier position.
s k argues that the swahns took two inconsistent positions in the rescission action.first,they claimed in the rescission action that s k obtained a resounding victory in the arbitration action,but claim here that the arbitration was unnecessary and meaningless because they lost their ability to pursue tharaldson and the hotel corporations.second,they claimed in the rescission action that tharaldson had an ongoing scheme to defraud them and fraudulently induced them and s k into settlement.here,by contrast,they claim s k pressured and cajoled them into entering into the settlement agreement.
the summary of the case submitted to the trial court with the petition to compromise the minor claim states merely that the swahns prevailed in phase i,the phase of the arbitration that adjudicated the issue of liability,and makes no mention of the swahns allegations of fraud and concealment against tharaldson.these allegations are the basis of s k claim of judicial estoppel,and it is difficult to imagine how the court could have accepted the truth of the allegations when it was not apprised of them.
the united states supreme court has explained the significance of the success factor in the defense of judicial estoppel in the federal courts absent success in a prior proceeding,a party later inconsistent position introduces no risk of inconsistent court determinations,citation,and thus poses little threat to judicial integrity.new h
