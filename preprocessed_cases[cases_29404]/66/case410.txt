convicted criminal defendant john brooks appeals from the judgment entered in favor of his former attorney,joseph shemaria,on brooks complaint for breach of contract and professional negligence.the trial court granted summary judgment on the ground that,in order to prevail,brooks had to prove he was actually innocent of the crime of which he was convicted.we conclude that the actual innocence requirement does not apply to brooks claims,because his contract claim is merely a fee dispute,and his professional negligence claim relates only to proceedings concerning the return of seized property.we therefore reverse.
background 
this appeal arises from brooks civil lawsuit against his privately retained criminal defense counsel,shemaria.the record before us does not indicate all of the charges and special allegations against brooks,but it does show that on june,brooks pleaded no contest to a single charge of manufacture of a controlled substance,in violation of health and safety code section,subdivision a,and admitted a single special allegation of transportation,sale,or distribution of a controlled substance,in violation of health and safety code section,subdivision a.on that basis,the court sentenced brooks to years in prison.the conviction and sentence have not been reversed or vacated.
brooks first met with shemaria on april.in that meeting,shemaria told brooks that he would require a retainer of,which would cover both the cost of representing brooks through trial and the cost of seeking the return of brooks seized property.shemaria further advised brooks that any unused portion of the retainer would be returned.
brooks met with shemaria again on april,but their meeting was cut short by an emergency at the jail.as the meeting came suddenly to an end,shemaria took a retainer agreement out of his briefcase and asked brooks to sign it.brooks was reluctant to do so because he had not read it.shemaria encouraged him to sign it anyway,saying that it could easily be modified later,and brooks complied.when brooks read the agreement later he found that it did not reflect all of the provisions he had discussed with shemaria on april.brooks subsequently spoke with shemaria,and they orally modified the written agreement to include all of the provisions that shemaria had described on april,including that any unused portion of the retainer would be returned.
the record contains no written retainer agreement executed by brooks.the record does contain a retainer agreement that purports to be between shemaria and brooks,but the agreement is executed by shemaria alone.that agreement does not provide for the return of unused fees,but it also does not prohibit oral modification of the agreement.
on june,brooks entered his no contest plea and was sentenced.on july,the superior court heard brooks motion for the return of his personal property that had been seized by the authorities.the court ordered that all paperwork,except the instructions for making methamphetamine,is to be returned to brooks.the court also ordered the destruction of all seized firearms except for one that belonged to linda jean brooks,whose relation to brooks was not specified.on july,the court modified the order concerning disposition of the firearms by also exempting from destruction a firearm belonging to brooks sister,susan livingston.the court further stated that it would reconsider the order to destroy the remainder of the firearms on september.on september,the matter was continued to september.shemaria appeared on behalf of brooks at the july and september hearings.
but on september,no attorneys appeared,including shemaria.the court consequently took the motion for reconsideration of its order concerning destruction of the firearms off calendar.and at a subsequent hearing on october,shemaria again failed to appear on behalf of brooks.again,because no attorneys appeared,brooks motion for reconsideration was taken off calendar.moreover,because no one ever picked up the property that had been ordered returned,all of the seized property was destroyed.
also,on august,the ventura county sheriff wrote to brooks at his last known address to inform him that he could retrieve certain items of seized property,including various financial records,a computer and electronic storage media,a cell phone,and a pager.there is no indication that any of this property overlaps with the paperwork that the superior court had previously ordered returned to brooks the court order was expressly directed only to the los angeles police department,not the ventura county sheriff.the sheriff letter was returned because,unbeknownst to the sheriff,brooks was no longer at that address,as a result of his incarceration.when the letter was returned,the sheriff disposed of the property.
on december,brooks filed suit in propria persona against shemaria,alleging claims for breach of contract,rescission,and professional negligence.brooks alleged that shemaria breached the retainer agreement by refusing to refund unused portions of the retainer and also failed to exercise reasonable diligence and competence in seeking the return of brooks seized property.
shemaria moved for summary judgment on the grounds that brooks could not prevail on his claims unless he proved both that his conviction had been reversed or vacated and that he was actually innocent,and it was undisputed that brooks could not prove either of those elements.the trial court agreed,granted the motion,and entered judgment in favor of shemaria.brooks timely appealed.
standard of review 
because plaintiffs appealed from the trial court order granting defendants summary judgment,we independently examine the record in order to determine whether triable issues of fact exist to reinstate the action.wiener southcoast childcare centers,cal th,d.
discussion 
i.the actual innocence requirement does not apply to brooks contract claim for the return of unused fees.
brooks argues that the actual innocence requirement does not apply to his claim for the refund of unused portions of the retainer,so the trial court erred when it granted shemaria motion for summary judgment as to that claim.we agree.
in order to carry his initial burden on his motion for summary judgment,shemaria was required to show that one or more elements of brooks claims could not be established,or that there was a complete defense to those claims.code civ,subd.p.shemaria sole argument was that actual innocence was an element of all of brooks claims,and that it was undisputed that brooks could not establish actual innocence.we conclude that shemaria did not carry his initial burden with respect to brooks claim for the refund of unused portions of the retainer,because actual innocence is not an element of that claim.bird,marella,boxer wolpert superior court th,d hereafter bird.
