linda cook appeals from an order of disbarment entered against her by the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.cook disbarment by the district court follows on the heels of her ohio state disbarment.on appeal,cook raises two fundamental claims that the ohio courts denied her due process during her state disbarment proceedings and that these due process violations in her state disbarment proceedings tainted the district court proceedings.
as to cook first claim,this court lacks jurisdiction to consider directly whether cook state disbarment proceedings violated her due process rights.moreover,even if we could consider the issue,cook claim fails on the merits.as to the second issue,we find nothing in the record to support cook claim.therefore,we affirm the district court order permanently disbarring cook from the practice of law before the united states district court for the northern district of ohio.
the supreme court of ohio disbarred cook on july.on december,the district court followed suit.the supreme court of ohio and the district court disbarred cook based on the same set of facts.
prior to her disbarment,cook was an attorney engaged primarily in estate and medicaid planning in ohio and michigan.sometime in,cook was engaged to prepare several estate documents for an elderly client,esther benfer,including a revocable living trust agreement a last will and testament a comprehensive durable power of attorney a durable special power of attorney an assignment of tangible personal property and a deed for a parcel of property owned by benfer the benfer farm.the documents prepared by cook contained the following features the revocable living trust agreement named cook as along with benfer the last will and testament named cook as the personal representative of the will the comprehensive durable power of attorney named cook as the responsible agent the durable special power of attorney named cook as and the assignment of tangible personal property assigned benfer property to the esther benfer living trust and named cook as the trustee.despite these features,cook did not advise benfer that she should secure independent and disinterested advice from other counsel before signing any of these documents.other than the deed,all of these documents were dated june.
as to the deed,the story is more complicated.although the deed prepared by cook was dated may,it was recorded in the fulton county recorder office on july.the deed transferred the benfer farm to cook as trustee.shortly after the deed was recorded,cook altered the deed by crossing out the word trustee and inserting the word married.the altered deed was recorded on september.around this time,cook also prepared another deed transferring cook personal title to the benfer farm to the metamora united methodist church.although this third deed was dated december,it was not recorded until december.
cook acknowledges that the may,date on the original deed was inaccurate,but argues that the backdating was unintentional.according to cook,she directed someone on her staff to prepare the deed and other documents.once the documents were prepared,cook claims that she reviewed them for errors and made notations regarding necessary revisions for her staff to make.cook then scheduled an appointment to have benfer come into cook office to review and sign the documents.before the scheduled appointment,however,cook claims that benfer telephoned cook to ask if benfer could come into cook office on an earlier date to sign the deed.although cook was not going to be in the office that day,she informed benfer that someone on her staff would present the necessary documents for signing.cook surmise s that,when benfer came into the office,cook staff must have been unable to locate the deed,and,in an attempt to cover up the mistake,someone on her staff used a deed previously prepared for another client as a template to create a new deed for benfer.according to cook,her staff must have overlooked the date,and also mistakenly listed cook as a trustee.
cook claims that she corrected the allegedly clerical error listing her as a trustee as soon as she became aware of it,but insists that she did not notice at that time that the date on the deed also was mistaken.in fact,cook asserts that she first learned of the dating error when she received notice of the toledo bar association disciplinary complaint against her in april of.
the record casts serious doubt on cook story.most notably,the significance of backdating the deed to may,raises serious questions regarding the credibility of cook assertion that the error resulted from a simple and unintentional clerical oversight by her staff.when benfer first engaged cook services,benfer expressed her desire to leave her farm as a gift to the united methodist church.cook was concerned,however,that transferring the property to the church would jeopardize benfer eligibility for medicaid benefits because the value of the property would be included in benfer medicaid eligibility determination should she need to move to an assisted living facility.see c providing that the transfer of assets,such as an applicant home,for less than fair market value within the required period renders the applicant ineligible for assistance.medicaid eligibility determinations require a period for assets transferred to a trust,but only a period for assets transferred to an individual.id.at c b i.consequently,because the benfer trust was established on june,any assets not divested to an individual before at least june,potentially would count against benfer medicaid eligibility.in this context,if the backdating was an honest mistake,it seems a remarkable coincidence that the may,date,when taken together with the fact that the altered deed transferred the benfer farm to cook as an individual rather than a trustee,effectively removed the value of the property from benfer medicaid eligibility determination.
furthermore,because cook ultimately transferred her personal title to the benfer farm to the united methodist church,cook became eligible for significant income tax deductions based on her donation of the property to a qualified charitable organization see b a i.taking full advantage of that benefit,cook took a deduction on her income tax return indeed,all told,cook took nearly in income tax deductions from to,all based ostensibly on her donation of the benfer farm to the church 
the record also reveals several other inconsistencies with cook account.first,at least one person on cook staff testified at cook august state disbarment hearing that she remembered cook discussing the dating error with the staff at a meeting in.second,cook income tax return stated that she received title to the benfer farm in.third,in an attempt to protect her decision to avail herself of the available tax deduction,cook prepared a typewritten note signed by benfer and dated august,that states i,esther benfer,give linda cook permission to write off on her income tax return the gift of real property that i gave her in and she gave to the metamora united methodist church on december.fourth,in a sworn letter responding to the initial disciplinary inquiry letter from the toledo bar association,cook maintained that the date on the original deed was correct.taken together,these inconsistencies cast grave doubt on the credibility of cook story.
cook subsequent actions also played a role in her disbarment.nearly three years after cook transferred title to the benfer farm to the church,attorney jeffrey robinson wrote a letter to cook advising her that he now represented benfer.the letter directed cook to refrain from communicating with benfer,and included a letter signed by benfer revoking cook power of attorney.the letter also inquired as to the status of benfer tangible personal property,alleging that cook improperly had taken benfer belongings,and notifying cook that benfer wanted her personal property returned.the letter was hand delivered to cook on april.
disregarding the letter from robinson,cook drafted that same day a petition for appointment of guardian of incapacitated individual.the petition requested that cook be appointed benfer guardian,and stated that cook was acting as benfer attorney and power of attorney.in support of her request,cook stated in the petition that benfer lack ed sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate informed decisions due to physical illness or disability.
apparently unconcerned by the fact that she had just filed a petition stating that benfer lacked sufficient capacity to make informed decisions,the next day,cook drafted and had benfer sign a durable general power of attorney.once again,cook failed to advise benfer that she should secure independent and disinterested advice from other counsel before singing this document.
in,after receiving a letter of grievance from robinson regarding cook conduct,the toledo bar association initiated an inquiry into the matter by sending cook an inquiry letter asking her to explain her conduct.in response to that letter,cook maintained that she had not engaged in any misconduct,and claimed that she in fact had received title to the benfer farm in.
unsatisfied with cook explanations,the toledo bar association initiated disbarment proceedings against cook by filing a complaint with the supreme court of ohio board of commissioners on grievances and discipline on april.an amended complaint was filed on september.the amended complaint included two counts of alleged violations of the ohio bar association disciplinary rules,and detailed the factual basis for those allegations.
on august and,a panel of the board of commissioners on grievances and discipline hearing panel held a hearing regarding the allegations contained in the complaint.during that proceeding,the hearing panel heard testimony and accepted evidence relevant to the complaint.at all times during the hearing,cook was represented by counsel.counsel for cook witnesses,moved documents into evidence,and made objections throughout the hearing.the hearing panel also permitted cook to present witnesses and evidence in her defense,as well as to testify at length on her own behalf.
upon conclusion of that proceeding,the hearing panel made findings and recommendations that ultimately were adopted by the full board.the board then recommended to the supreme court of ohio that cook be permanently disbarred from the practice of law before the courts of the state of ohio.by order dated july,the supreme court of ohio adopted the findings and conclusions of the board,and ordered that cook be permanently disbarred.
on july,the district court issued a letter to cook to show cause by august,why disbarment was not warranted.on november,cook appeared before the district court committee on complaints and policy compliance.the record of that proceeding confirms that cook was represented by counsel,and that cook counsel offered argument and responded to questions posed by the committee.cook also responded directly to questions from the committee.after the hearing,and upon consideration of the record developed in cook state court proceedings,the district court ordered that cook be permanently disbarred from the practice of law before the northern district of ohio.in re cook,at.this appeal followed.
on appeal,cook devotes a substantial portion of her argument to challenging the sufficiency of the due process protections she was afforded in her state disbarment proceedings,seemingly challenging the validity of the supreme court of ohio disbarment order.however,this court is precluded by the doctrine from reviewing any claims that challenge the sufficiency of the proceedings afforded cook by the state of ohio,as opposed to the process afforded cook in her federal disbarment proceedings.
the doctrine embodies the notion that appellate review of state court decisions and the validity of state judicial proceedings is limited to the supreme court under,and thus that federal district courts lack jurisdiction to review such matters.see exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d t his court appellate jurisdiction over judgments precludes a united states district court from exercising jurisdiction.lawrence welch,cir the is based on the negative inference that,if appellate court review of such state judgments is vested in the supreme court,then it follows that such review may not be had in the lower federal courts.the doctrine applies in those circumstances where a party initiates an action in federal district court complaining of an injury caused by the judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.exxon mobil,at.emphasis added.the pertinent question in determining whether a federal district court is precluded under the doctrine from exercising jurisdiction over a claim is whether the source of the injury upon which plaintiff bases his federal claim is the state court judgment.lawrence,at quoting mccormick braverman,cir.this is true regardless of whether the party challenges the validity of the state court judgment on constitutional grounds.see lawrence,at.
in light of the nature of many of cook claims,the doctrine applies here and precludes review of any claims arising directly out of cook state disbarment proceedings or the ohio supreme court disbarment order.see saier state bar of michigan,cir federal courts do not sit in review of state bar disciplinary proceedings.the proper forum in which to raise such claims was on direct appeal to the supreme court of the united states.see.cook can not seek collateral review of her state disbarment proceedings in federal court.
although we are precluded from reviewing directly ohio decision to disbar cook,because the district court relied on the record developed by the state courts,this court must consider whether alleged defects in those proceedings so infected the federal proceeding that justice requires reversal of the federal determination.in re ruffalo,d white,concurring.see lawrence,at.
attorney disciplinary proceedings are not civil actions and not criminal prosecutions.nevertheless,disbarment involves adversary proceedings of a nature.ruffalo,at.an attorney facing disbarment thus is entitled to procedural due process,which includes fair notice of the charge.id.at.in addition,courts must provide ample opportunity to show cause why an accused practitioner should not be disbarred.theard united states,d.
because the requirements for admission and continued practice in federal and states courts are distinct,federal courts are not conclusively bound by state disbarment orders.theard,at.d isbarment by federal courts does not automatically flow from disbarment by state courts.in re crow,d douglas,dissenting state proceedings of disbarment,though presumptively correct,are not binding.citing selling,at.this is true even though admission to practice before a federal court is conditioned upon admission to practice before a state court.ruffalo,at.though admission to practice before a federal court is derivative from membership in a state bar,disbarment by the state does not result in automatic disbarment by the federal court.though that state action is entitled to respect,it is not conclusively binding on the federal courts.theard,at.while a lawyer is admitted into a federal court by way of a state court,he is not automatically sent out of the federal court by the same route.saier,at same.
nevertheless,a disbarment order handed down by a state court is entitled to due respect.theard,at.state court disbarment determinations are entitled to high respect in re selling.disbarment of an attorney by a state court found to absolutely destroy the condition of fair private and professional character,without the possession of which there could be no possible right to continue to be a member of this bar.federal courts also have noted that there are sound practical reasons for deferring to state judgments in this context,explaining that state bars are much larger than federal bars,and with size has come the development of the means to investigate charges of misconduct and resolve factual disputes.in re cook,cir.moreover,the state bar has the superior perspective of the attorney history of conduct and professionalism.id.
in view of the respect and practical deference afforded to state court judgments,federal courts may initiate a disciplinary inquiry and even disbarment proceedings based solely on an attorney disbarment by a state court.see fed.b a.see also theard,at.noting that the federal disbarment proceedings may be initiated where the accusation rests solely on disbarment by a state court.indeed,the supreme court held in selling that federal courts should proceed on the presumption that federal courts should recognize the condition created by the judgment of the state court unless certain factors are present,including 
that the state procedure from want of notice or opportunity to be heard was wanting in due process,that there was such an infirmity of proof as to facts found to have established the want of fair private and professional character as to give rise to a clear conviction on our part that we could not consistently with our duty accept as final the conclusion on that subject or,that some other grave reason existed which should convince us that to allow the natural consequences of the judgment to have their effect would conflict with the duty which rests upon us not to disbar except upon the conviction that,under the principles of right and justice,we were constrained so to do.
at.thus,federal courts may give considerable weight to the findings and conclusion of the state courts in such disciplinary matters,but it is ultimately the responsibility of the federal courts to determine whether a member of the federal bar is fit to practice in federal court.
with this framework in mind,we conclude that the record does not support cook claim that any alleged shortcomings in her state proceedings somehow undermined the legitimacy or fairness of her federal proceedings.put another way,none of the factors identified in selling that would preclude the district court from relying on the findings of the state courts is present here.
due process 
first,cook fails to show that her state proceedings deprived her of due process.cook initially was apprised of this matter in when she received an inquiry letter from the toledo bar association.in responding to that letter,cook was afforded her first opportunity to explain her version of events and to justify her conduct.cook availed herself of that opportunity.unsatisfied with her response,the toledo bar association filed a complaint with ohio board of commissioners on grievances and discipline.that complaint set forth fully the charges against cook,identified the conduct at issue,and specified the ohio disciplinary rules on which the charges rested.during a hearing,cook was afforded an opportunity to respond to the allegations set forth in the complaint,testify at length in her own defense,and present other witnesses and evidence to support her version of events.cook also was able to make objections to the hearing panel findings and recommendations.at each step,cook was fully aware of the charges against her and the basis on which those charges were made,and she was afforded ample opportunity to respond to those allegations.
despite this clear record,cook alleges three specific defects with her state proceedings that the ohio courts required her to express remorse prior to any consideration of the merits of the charges,which cook claims put her in an impossible position because she maintains that she did nothing wrong that there was no testimonial evidence to support the hearing panel conclusions and that the supreme court of ohio decision not to hold a hearing on her objections to the board recommendations deprived her of due process.we conclude that all of cook contentions are without merit.
cook asserts that the state disbarment proceedings deprived her of due process because the hearing panel and the supreme court of ohio required that she express remorse prior to any consideration of the merits of the charges.cook argues that the ohio courts should have bifurcated the disbarment proceedings,and considered the merits of the misconduct charges and the issues separately.
as an initial matter,there is nothing to suggest that cook lack of the weight given that fact by the ohio any role in the district court decision to disbar cook.that is to say that whatever weight was given to cook lack of remorse by the ohio courts did not so infect cook federal proceedings as to render them fundamentally unfair.see ruffalo,at.white,concurring.
in any event,contrary to cook assertion,the record plainly shows that cook lack of remorse was considered by the ohio courts only in terms of determining the appropriate punishment.in a section of findings expressly titled mitigation,the hearing panel concludes that cook failed or refused to acknowledge any wrongful conduct on her part.similarly,the supreme court of ohio noted cook lack of remorse only in concluding that no mitigating evidence warrants our lenience.in other words,the hearing panel and the supreme court of ohio considered cook lack of remorse only after consideration of the merits of the charges against her,and only as a potentially mitigating or aggravating factor.
due process is not implicated by the consideration of a defendant lack of remorse as an aggravating factor.it is well established that a defendant lack an appropriate consideration in meting out punishment.see united states conatser,cir approving district court consideration of defendant remorse during sentencing united states baker,cir approving consideration of defendant stated remorse in imposing reduced sentence.indeed,the supreme court has specifically recognized that remorse is relevant in attorney disciplinary proceedings.mckune lile,d noting that whether an attorney has expressed contrition is often given dispositive weight by this court itself on routine motions for reinstatement.because the state proceedings took notice of cook lack of remorse only as a potentially aggravating factor,cook due process claim in this regard has no merit.
lack of supporting testimony 
cook also asserts that the hearing panel and the ohio supreme court lacked a proper basis for drawing inferences concerning her allegedly improper motives for backdating and making subsequent alterations to the deed because she was the only one to testify as to that issue.cook asserts that there was no other testimonial evidence to support the conclusion that the documents in question were intentionally backdated.in other words,cook challenges whether it was proper for the hearing panel to make negative inferences regarding cook motives where there was no testimonial evidence to support such inferences.cook argues that this raises constitutional due process concerns because,absent any testimonial evidence on this point,the ohio courts improperly shifted the burden to her to prove that she was innocent of the charged misconduct.
as an initial matter,this is precisely the type of issue that extends well beyond the scope of review permitted under ruffalo,and thus runs afoul of the doctrine.as a result,we can not consider the argument as presented.as explained,we can only consider whether cook federal proceedings were tainted by any alleged shortcomings in her state proceedings.recast in that light,we conclude that cook argument fails for several reasons.
initially,there is no support for the notion that the alleged,even if true,raises due process concerns.cook wrongly assumes that the toledo bar association,as the moving party,should bear the burden of proof in disbarment proceedings.because disbarment proceedings are only in nature,courts have found no problem with an inquiry process that places the burden of proof on the responding attorney.see ruffalo,at.indeed,it is precisely this assumption that underlies the supreme court approval of the show cause process employed by federal courts in these circumstances,not to mention the supreme court explicit holdings that federal courts should defer to the state court disbarment decision.selling,at.in other words,because disbarment proceedings are only,there is no basis for assuming that the allocation of the ultimate burden must lie with the state.cook has identified no case law to the contrary.in fact,as in the case sub judice,because there is not a moving or complaining party,the
