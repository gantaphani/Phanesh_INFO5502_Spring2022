these cases are before the court for review of the decisions of the first and fifth district courts of appeal in notami hospital of florida,bowen,so d dca,and florida hospital waterman,buster,so d dca.both decisions address the scope of article x,section of the florida constitution,a ballot initiative passed by the voters in november and known as amendment,the patients right to know about adverse medical incidents the fifth district in buster certified three questions of great public importance to this court,and the first district in notami hospital held a statute unconstitutional and certified conflict with buster.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b,b.const.
for the reasons expressed below,we approve in part the decision of the fifth district holding amendment to be and we affirm the first district holdings that the amendment is and retroactive and its provisions apply to records existing prior to its passage.we also conclude that several subsections of section,florida statutes,conflict with amendment and are therefore unconstitutional,but we sever those provisions and hold that the remainder of the statute is valid.
facts and procedural history 
each of these cases addresses amendment,approved by the voters on november,and codified as article x,section of the florida constitution.the amendment provides 
section.patients right to know about adverse medical incidents.
a in addition to any other similar rights provided herein or by general law,patients have a right to have access to any records made or received in the course of business by a health care facility or provider relating to any adverse medical incident.
b in providing such access,the identity of patients involved in the incidents shall not be disclosed,and any privacy restrictions imposed by federal law shall be maintained.
c for purposes of this section,the following terms have the following meanings 
the phrases health care facility and health care provider have the meaning given in general law related to a patient rights and responsibilities.
the term patient means an individual who has sought,is seeking,is undergoing,or has undergone care or treatment in a health care facility or by a health care provider.
the phrase adverse medical incident means medical negligence,intentional misconduct,and any other act,neglect,or default of a health care facility or health care provider that caused or could have caused injury to or death of a patient,including,but not limited to,those incidents that are required by state or federal law to be reported to any governmental agency or body,and incidents that are reported to or reviewed by any health care facility peer review,risk management,quality assurance,credentials,or similar committee,or any representative of any such committees.
the phrase have access to any records means,in addition to any other procedure for producing such records provided by general law,making the records available for inspection and copying upon formal or informal request by the patient or a representative of the patient,provided that current records which have been made publicly available by publication or on the internet may be provided by reference to the location at which the records are publicly available.
art.x.const.the effective date and severability provision provides that t his amendment shall be effective on the date it is approved by the electorate.advisory opinion to the att y re patients right to know about adverse med.incidents,so d,patients right to know the ballot title for the proposed amendment was patients right to know about adverse medical incidents,and the ballot summary accompanying the proposed amendment read as follows 
current florida law restricts information available to patients related to investigations of adverse medical incidents,such as medical malpractice.this amendment would give patients the right to review,upon request,records of health care facilities or providers adverse medical incidents,including those which could cause injury or death.provides that patients identitie sic should not be disclosed.
after the passage of the amendment,the legislature enacted chapter,laws of florida,effective june,dealing with the same subject as amendment this is now codified at section in the florida statutes.
buster and notami hospital 
in each of the cases before us,medical malpractice actions were instituted against the defendant hospitals.during discovery,the plaintiffs sought production of documents in buster relating to the investigation of the adverse medical incident at issue,and in notami hospital,relating to the selection,retention,or termination of robert pendrak,each hospital objected,claiming the information sought was confidential pursuant to various statutory privileges existing prior to the passage of amendment.in both cases,the trial court rejected these objections and held that amendment was and applied to existing documents and that any conflicting legislation was subordinate to the constitutional amendment.
the hospitals each sought review by certiorari in the district court,arguing that the trial court rulings departed from the essential requirements of law.in buster,the fifth district agreed with the trial court that amendment was and allowed for discovery,but disagreed that it could be applied to existing records.so d at.the first district held in notami hospital that amendment was,that it could be retroactively applied to existing records,and that section was unconstitutional.so d at.the court certified conflict with buster on the question of retroactivity.id.the fourth district subsequently cited and adopted the reasoning of notami hospital in north broward hospital district kroll,so d dca,finding amendment to be and retroactive as well as finding section to be unconstitutional.id.at.the kroll court likewise certified conflict with buster.id.at.
ii.this appeal 
the primary areas of overlap between the two decisions on review involve whether amendment is and whether it can be applied retroactively,and whether the provisions of section,florida statutes,are constitutional.accordingly,we address only those issues.
iii.governing law and analysis 
since all of the issues we consider are ones of constitutional or statutory interpretation,this court review is de novo.see zingale powell,so d,although we take into consideration the district court analysis on the issue,constitutional interpretation,like statutory interpretation,is performed de novo.in zingale,while recognizing the fundamental nature of a constitutional edict,we emphasized that the principles governing constitutional interpretation largely parallel those of statutory interpretation.id.at citing coastal.police benev.ass williams,so d.
both the first and the fifth districts below agreed that amendment is.the fifth district in buster cited the definitions provided in the amendment,its relatively narrow purpose to override existing statutory law,and an expressed intent gleaned from its provisions that existing law was sufficient to implement the provisions of the amendment and that no further legislation was necessary.so d at.the court also concluded that a contrary decision,finding that the amendment was not,would frustrate the will of the people,especially since the amendment states it was to be effective upon passage,leaving no time for the enactment of implementing legislation.id.the first district reasoning in notami hospital largely mirrors that of the fifth district.the first district cited a presumption that constitutional provisions are and noted that the amendment defines,in detail,what records are discoverable,who is entitled to discovery,and states it is effective on the date it is approved by the voters.notami,so d at.we agree with both district courts that amendment is.
this court explained the appropriate standard for determining whether constitutional provisions are in gray bryant,so d 
the basic guide,or test,in determining whether a constitutional provision should be construed to be,or not,is whether or not the provision lays down a sufficient rule by means of which the right or purpose which it gives or is intended to accomplish may be determined,enjoyed,or protected without the aid of legislative enactment.state ex rel.city of fulton smith.if the provision lays down a sufficient rule,it speaks for the entire people and is.city of shawnee williamson,okl.the fact that the right granted by the provision may be supplemented by legislation,further protecting the right or making it available,does not of itself prevent the provision from being.people carroll.
id.at.in gray,the court found a constitutional provision providing a formula to determine the number of judges in the judicial circuits,noting the provision laid down a sufficient rule by which the number of circuit judges which the people have dictated shall be furnished to them may be readily determined without enabling action of the legislature.id.in reaching this conclusion,we emphasized 
the will of the people is paramount in determining whether a constitutional provision is and the modern doctrine favors the presumption that constitutional provisions are intended to be.this is so because in the absence of such presumption the legislature would have the power to nullify the will of the people expressed in their constitution,the most sacrosanct of all expressions of the people.
id.the importance of ascertaining and abiding by the intent of the framers was emphasized,so that a provision must never be construed in such manner as to make it possible for the will of the people to be frustrated or denied.id.at.consistent with our precedent in gray,we hold that amendment is and its terms enforceable as of the date of its passage.
we agree with the district courts that the amendment provides a sufficient rule by which patients can gain access to records of a health care provider adverse medical incidents.for example,all key terms are defined within the amendment,including health care facility,health care provider,patient,adverse medical incident,and have access to any records.see art.x.const.in addition,the definition provided for the term have access to any records indicates that it is to encompass current document production procedures as provided by general law.id.further,as noted above and as emphasized by both district courts,the amendment expressly declares that it is to be effective on passage,indicating that its effectiveness in overriding prior statutory law was not to be dependent upon the enactment of implementing legislation.
the amendment language makes evident that it was intended to effect an immediate change in the law governing access to medical records without the need for legislative action.while the hospitals contend that a number of relevant and unanswered questions remain regarding the reach of the amendment,we emphasized in gray that simply because the right conferred by the amendment could be supplemented by legislation does not prevent the provision from being.so d at.
application to existing records 
the question presented here is whether the amendment mandates access to medical records that were in existence at the time the amendment became effective but were previously inaccessible due to restrictive legislative provisions,or whether the prior legislative restrictions continue to bar access to records created prior to the passage of the amendment.although we will analyze this issue within a retroactivity framework,the use of the word retroactive may be somewhat confusing in the context herein since a patient who may have benefited from the right of access now granted obviously can not go back in time and inform a past decision made about medical care then contemplated the issue now is whether the amendment permits disclosure of existing records and,if so,whether there is any superseding legal barrier to that disclosure.
in considering this issue,both the first and fifth districts cited to campus communications,earnhardt,so d,dca,which in turn relied on metropolitan dade county chase federal housing,so d.in chase federal,this court explained 
two interrelated inquiries arise when determining whether statutes should be retroactively applied.the first inquiry is one of statutory construction whether there is clear evidence of legislative intent to apply the statute retrospectively.see landgraf usi film,d hassen state farm mut.auto,so d.if the legislation clearly expresses an intent that it apply retroactively,then the second inquiry is whether retroactive application is constitutionally permissible.see state farm mut.auto.ins.laforet,so d,state dep t of transp.knowles,so d,see also arrow air,walsh,so d.
chase federal,so d at.accordingly,a retroactivity analysis is,asking first if the relevant provision provides for retroactive application,and second if such application is constitutionally permissible.
the first district concluded that the text of the amendment,as well as its accompanying ballot summary and the overall purpose behind the amendment,support the notion that the amendment was intended to provide immediate access to existing records 
here,the plain language of the amendment permits patients to access any record relating to any adverse medical incident,and defines patient to include individuals who had previously undergone treatment.the use of the word any to define the scope of discoverable records relating to adverse medical incidents,and the broad definition of patient to include those who previously received treatment expresses a clear intent that the records subject to disclosure include those created prior to the effective date of the amendment.the effective date merely sets forth the date patients obtained the right to receive the records requested.because the plain language of the amendment expresses a clear intent that it be applied to include records created prior to its effective date,doing so is not an unconstitutional retroactive application.
notami,so d at.we agree with the district court succinct analysis of the terms of the amendment as well as its conclusion that the use of these terms indicates the amendment was intended to apply to existing records.further,based on a plain reading of the ballot summary and the text of the amendment,we agree with the first district that the florida electorate would have logically assumed this amendment would give patients an immediate right of access to existing medical records.
in chase federal,this court emphasized,in order to determine legislative intent as to retroactivity,both the terms of the statute and the purpose of the enactment must be considered.so d at emphasis added citing state ex rel.hill cone,so.in that case,this court looked to the purpose of the dry cleaning contamination cleanup act,in addition to the act language,to conclude that immunity provisions could be applied retroactively.id.at.
likewise,in the instant case,the purpose of amendment plainly contemplates that its application would provide access to existing records by overriding and supplanting existing statutory provisions that limited access.this court quoted the amendment statement and purpose in our opinion approving amendment for the ballot 
statement and purpose 
the legislature has enacted provisions relating to a patients bill of rights and responsibilities,including provisions relating to information about practitioners qualifications,treatment and financial aspects of patient care.the legislature has,however,restricted public access to information concerning a particular health care provider or facility investigations,incidents or history of acts,neglects,or defaults that have injured patients or had the potential to injure patients.this information may be important to a patient.the purpose of this amendment is to create a constitutional right for a patient or potential patient to know and have access to records of a health care facility or provider adverse medical incidents,including medical malpractice and other acts which have caused or have the potential to cause injury or death.this right to know is to be balanced against an individual patient rights to privacy and dignity,so that the information available relates to the practitioner or facility as opposed to individuals who may have been or are patients.
patient right to know,so d at.this language and parallel language in other parts of the amendment and ballot summary make it abundantly clear that the chief purpose of amendment was to do away with the legislative restrictions on a florida patient access to a medical provider history of acts,neglects,or defaults because such history may be important to a patient.id.in other words,while this history was not previously accessible,it became accessible when the electorate approved a constitutional override of the prior statutory restrictions.the central focus of the amendment was to provide access to records that existed but were not accessible due to statutory restrictions.the language of the amendment could hardly have been more specific or articulate in expressing the intent that what was not accessible before would be accessible with the passage of the amendment.
similarly,the ballot summary for the amendment reflects that the amendment clear purpose was to do away with existing restrictions on a patient right to access a medical provider history of adverse medical incidents and to provide a clear path to access those records.as noted above,the ballot summary for amendment provided 
current florida law restricts information available to patients related to investigations of adverse medical incidents,such as medical malpractice.this amendment would give patients the right to review,upon request,records of health care facilities or providers adverse medical incidents,including those which could cause injury or death.provides that patients identitie sic should not be disclosed.
id.at.the ballot summary,like the text of the amendment itself,clearly expressed an intent to do away with then current florida law restricting access to this information and would lead voters to the conclusion that all records,including existing records,would henceforth be subject to patient review.the summary indicates that,with the passage of the amendment,there would no longer be any legal barrier to obtaining this information and that a patient,the day after this amendment passed,would have access to this important information of a provider past record.because the statutory restrictions constituted the only barrier to production of this information,doing away with the restrictions by constitutional amendment effectively removed the lone obstacle to access.indeed,in our opinion approving placement of the amendment of the ballot we concluded that it creates a broader right to know about adverse medical incidents than currently exists.id.at.accordingly,based on the express language of the ballot summary and the amendment,we find that the plain language of amendment provides for its application to existing records.
we also conclude that the hospital interpretation of the language and purpose of the amendment would require a strained,if not conflicting,reading of the amendment language and purpose.the suggestion that a patient seeking information about a medical provider past record of adverse medical incidents would be limited only to those records made after passage of amendment directly conflicts with the amendment stated purpose of providing immediate access to such information such an interpretation would also effectively leave in force legislative restrictions on access many years after such restrictions were eliminated by the amendment.in effect,this strained reading would postpone any benefits provided by the amendment to a time in the distant future and would leave a permanent gap in the disclosure granted,consisting of the medical provider history prior to the amendment passage.hence,a patient would never actually gain the access plainly promised by the amendment.we reject this strained reading.
the second prong of the retroactivity analysis requires us to examine whether the application of amendment to existing records impacts a substantive,vested right and therefore violates the due process rights of medical providers whose conduct may have been the focus of many of the records to which the legislature provided only restricted access.see state farm mut.auto.ins.laforet,so d.
in city of sanford mcclelland,so,this court articulated the nature of a vested,substantive right.in explaining that the and florida constitutions protect against the impairment of such vested rights,the court stated,a vested right has been defined as an immediate,fixed right of present or future enjoyment and also as an immediate right of present enjoyment,or a present,fixed right of future enjoyment.id.at quoting pearsall great northern ry.
we conclude that such a vested right was not created by the scope of the statutory guarantee of confidentiality previously afforded the reports of adverse medical incidents created by and for peer review committees at issue here.instead,we agree with the first district that the principles set out in clausell hobart,so d,provide the appropriate analysis.in clausell,this court concluded that a plaintiff did not have a vested right in his ability to bring a cause of action for products liability.id.at.in so holding,we relied upon lamb volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft,which in turn quoted the first district decision in division of workers compensation brevda,so d dca t o be vested,a right must be more than a mere expectation based on an anticipation of the continuance of an existing law it must have become a title,legal or equitable,to the present or future enforcement of a demand brevda,so d at quoting aetna ins.richardelle.we agree with the first district that the hospitals claim rests on a mere expectation of the continuance of the legislative policy of limited access to the proceedings of peer review committees.
importantly,the statutes in question do not actually create a statutory privilege.the statutes do not deem relevant materials to be either confidential or privileged.rather,they provide that the investigations,proceedings,and records of the respective medical committees or organizations are not subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in any action against a health care provider arising out of the matters which are the subject of the committee or organization inquiry.see.stat.stat.patient safety data shall not be subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in any civil or administrative action.these statutes also provide that if information,documents,or records are otherwise available from the original sources,they are not shielded from discovery or use in any such civil or administrative action and a witness who testifies before such committee or organization may not be prevented from testifying as to matters within his or her knowledge about the medical incident in question.see.stat.in reality,the restrictions are limited to the discovery or introduction of the proceedings into evidence in some but not all judicial or administrative actions.they have no application to dissemination or use of the information within the medical institution involved or within the wider medical community.
hence,medical providers have never been granted a substantive vested right in the secrecy of the information contained in the limited medical records in question.rather,at most,medical providers received an expectancy that legislative policy favored only limited access and use of the records of certain investigations into reported instances of questionable medical conduct by peer review bodies.indeed,the actual information regarding the adverse medical incident itself has never been cloaked in confidentiality rather,it is the particular form in which the information was contained,such as a peer review report,that was given limited protection.however,the participants in a peer review proceeding have always been on notice that the information they possessed,as witnesses to an adverse medical incident for example,was never considered confidential and continued to be subject to disclosure,even in judicial and administrative proceedings.the nature of the expectancy of the continuation of this restrictive legislative policy,therefore,has never risen to the level of a settled,vested substantive right.
it is also a fact of legislative that the legislative scheme restricting access or use of these adverse incident records has remained fluid and subject to the discretion of the legislature,which at any time could modify or repeal the governing statutes on access.further,there have always been exceptions to the rule.for example,as we recently noted in brandon regional hospital murray,so d,the state administrative agency charged with regulating health care in florida has always had access to this information,meaning,of course,that it has never been wholly confidential.see id.at unlike the parties seeking access to documents submitted to,reviewed by,or created by the peer review committees in the other cases discussed,ahca has been granted explicit statutory authority to inspect most records at licensed healthcare facilities.in addition,any disciplinary action against a medical provider by a hospital must be reported to the state,and notice of any such action serious enough to constitute grounds for expulsion must be sent to every hospital and health maintenance organization in the state.a b.stat.the medical provider,of course,can not prevent that broad disclosure within the medical community.in addition,the federal courts have repeatedly held that even the limited statutory exemptions at issue may not be invoked to prevent disclosure or admission of the proceedings in federal cases.see feminist women health,mohammad,cir noting that the peer review privilege will not bar evidence in federal cause of action see also adkins christie,cir same,cert.denied,d.hence,any expectations of continued limited access or use have been neither settled nor vested,but rest more upon an anticipation of the continuance of an existing law as explained in brevda.
where rights have been subject to modification or elimination at any time by the legislature,courts have found them to be neither fixed nor vested.for example,in earnhardt,the court upheld the retroactive application of a recently passed exemption to the public records act.so d at.earnhardt held that the prior right to inspect autopsy photographs was not vested or fixed because it was a right subject to divestment by enactment of statutory exemptions by the legislature.id.at.other florida courts have reached the same conclusion regarding statutory exemptions to the public records act.see baker county press,baker county med,so d,dca publ g kaune,so d,dca.other jurisdictions have reached similar conclusions.see,evans belth,explaining that there is no vested right in a statutory privilege that may be taken away by legislative amendment stott stott realty,it is a general rule of constitutional law that a citizen has no vested right in statutory privileges and exemptions doe sundquist,holding that natural parents have no vested right in statutory privilege barring disclosure of their identities.applying this principle,it is clear that the rights claimed here are also neither fixed nor vested because they were also subject to modification or elimination at any time by the legislature.in fact,the patient parties point out that the statutes at issue have been subject to numerous legislative modifications through the years.
for all these reasons,we conclude these statutes do not create a vested right as contemplated by our case law and we concur with the first district in its conclusion that the hospital does not have a vested right in maintaining the confidentiality of adverse medical incidents.the hospital right is no more than an expectation that previously existing statutory law would not change.notami,so d at.
because we find that the text of the amendment and the accompanying ballot summary clearly encompass access to existing adverse medical incident records,and furthermore that the medical providers interest in the continuing confidentiality of these materials does not constitute a substantive right,we hold that amendment provides access to existing histories of adverse medical incidents.
section,florida statutes 
even though amendment is and does not require legislative enactment,the legislature is still free to give force and effect to its provisions so long as it does not run afoul of the rights granted in the constitution.see gray,so d at noting that rights granted by constitutional provisions may be supplemented by legislation,further protecting the right or making it available.however,as noted by the first district below,in its efforts to implement amendment,it appears the legislature has substantially limited the right of access granted pursuant to the amendment.
the first district detailed four conflicts between amendment and section,finding that the statute drastically limits or eliminates discovery of records the amendment expressly states are discoverable,and limits the patients qualified to access those records.notami,so d at.specifically,the court noted the statute only allows for final reports to be discoverable,while the amendment provides that any records relating to adverse medical incidents are subject to the amendment the statute only provides for disclosure of final reports relating to the same or a substantially similar condition,treatment,or diagnosis with that of the patient requesting access the statute limits production to only those records generated after november,and the statute states that it will have no effect on existing privilege statutes.see also j,a.stat.accordingly,the first district concluded that in these respects,the statute impermissibly restricts rights expressly granted under the constitution.notami,so d at.
we agree that the four provisions cited by the notami hospital court contravene the broad rights of access to adverse medical incident records granted by amendment.in addition to those limitations noted by the first district,we also note that the statute provides that patients can only access the records of the facility or provider of which they themselves are a patient,a restriction not contained within the amendment.a.stat.t he adverse medical incident records to which a patient is granted access are those of the facility or provider of which he or she is a patient.furthermore,we observe that in addition to the limitation contained in subsection,the statute also provides that all existing laws concerning the discoverability or admissibility into evidence of records of an adverse medical incident in any judicial or administrative proceeding remain in full force and effect.stat.because these restrictions and those identified by the district court conflict with the provisions of amendment,these statutory restrictions can not stand.
however,while we concur with the first district in finding that section contains provisions that curtail rights granted by amendment,we do not agree that this requires the invalidation of the entire statute.although section does not contain a severability clause,this does not affect our ability to sever the unconstitutional portions of the statute.see ray mortham,so d,severability is a judicial doctrine recognizing the obligation of the judiciary to uphold the constitutionality of legislative enactments where it is possible to strike only the unconstitutional portions.citing state calhoun county,so.
the following questions guide this court severability analysis whether the legislative purpose expressed in the valid provisions can be accomplished independently of those which are void if the good and bad features are not inseparable and if the legislature would have passed one without the other and whether an act complete in itself remains after the invalid provisions are stricken.see moreau lewis,so d,quoting presbyterian homes wood,so d.we conclude that section easily satisfies this analysis.
according to its purpose section,the purpose of section is to implement,art.x of the state constitution.see.stat.we find that,minus any offending or conflicting provisions such as those outlined above,the statute appears to fulfill the purpose of implementing amendment.for example,the statute provides definitions of important terms,dictates that patient privacy restrictions be upheld,and identifies pursuant to other statutes the party responsible for identifying records of adverse medical incidents,b.stat.section also provides that fees for the production of records can not exceed the reasonable cost of complying with the request and that requests for production must be processed in a timely manner.c.stat.clearly the unconstitutional provisions are separable from the remainder of the statute and it remains complete in itself without the unconstitutional sections.we conclude that these unconstitutional subsections may be eliminated without the need to strike down section,florida statutes,in its entirety.the offending subsections can be separated without any adverse effect on its remaining portions,leaving intact a workable and helpful statute.accordingly,we find that the legislative purpose of section can be accomplished if the unconstitutional sections discussed above are severed.
iv.conclusion 
based upon the circumstances presented by the two decisions below regarding the scope of amendment,we find that the amendment is.we also hold that the right of access granted pursuant to the amendment is retroactive and therefore applies to adverse medical incident records existing prior to its effective date of november.finally,although we find several subsections of to unconstitutionally impinge upon the rights granted pursuant to amendment,we sever those unconstitutional sections from the statute and allow the remainder to stand.
while we have differed in some respects with the opinion of the fifth district in buster,we can not improve upon judge sawaya concluding comments 
we believe that amendment heralds a change in the public policy of this state to lift the shroud of privilege and confidentiality in order to foster disclosure of information that will allow patients to better determine from whom they should seek health care,evaluate the quality and fitness of health care providers currently rendering service to them,and allow them access to information gathered through the processes during the discovery period of litigation filed by injured patients or the estates of deceased patients against their health care providers.we have come to this conclusion because we are obliged to interpret and apply amendment in accord with the intention of the people of this state who enacted it,and we have done so.it is not for us to judge the wisdom of the constitutional amendments enacted or the change in public policy pronounced through those amendments,even in instances where the change involves abrogation of legislation that establishes and promotes an equally or arguably more compelling public policy.see sebring airport auth.mcintyre,so d.
hence,what the legislature has given through its enactments and the courts have enforced through their decisions,the people can take away through the amendment process to our state constitution.moreover,what the people provide in their constitution,the legislature and the courts may not take away through subsequent legislation or decision.
buster,so d at.we affirm the first district decision in notami hospital we approve in part and quash in part the decision of the fifth district in buster and remand for further proceedings in accord herewith.
it is so ordered.
i concur that the amendment is.i dissent from the majority decision that the amendment is to be applied retroactively.i join judge ervin dissent in the first district court of appeal case of notami hospital of florida,bowen,so d dca,and in the unanimous opinion of the fifth district court of appeal in florida hospital waterman,buster,so d dca.i conclude that the majority decision is contrary to the law and fundamental fairness.i specifically reject the majority and the first district conclusion that the statute,which for over twenty years has protected hospitals statutorily mandated peer review as part of medical quality assurance,did not establish vested rights that the investigations,proceedings,and records of peer review panels were not subject to discovery and could not be introduced into evidence in civil actions.stat.furthermore,to allow discovery of peer review records containing statements by those who had a right to rely upon the statute promise that the records would not be discovered or introduced in a civil action is not only legally unsupportable but is fundamentally unfair and puts into jeopardy all statements made based upon the promise of any statutory privilege.
rule of law in determining retroactivity 
the majority states that the use of the word retroactive may be somewhat confusing in the context herein.majority op.at.i do not agree.the taking away of a right to not have information and records which were developed when a statute guaranteed that the information and records could not be discovered or introduced in a civil action by eliminating the guarantee after the information and records have been developed is quintessential retroactivity.as set out in footnote,the history of the statutory right was that it was a substantive part of the legislative scheme to reform health care.in cruger love,so d,this court made clear that the guarantee of confidentiality of peer review was an integral part of the legislature plan to control the escalating cost of health care 
the florida legislature enacted these peer review statutes in an effort to control the escalating cost of health care by encouraging by the medical profession through peer review and evaluation.holly auld,so d,interpreting former section,florida statutes,the predecessor to section.in order to make meaningful peer review possible,the legislature provided a guarantee of confidentiality for the peer review process.holly,so d at.
in fact,this court plainly stated that the right to keep the statements and information confidential was a substantive part of the legislative mandate 
the privilege afforded to peer review committees is intended to prohibit the chilling effect of the potential public disclosure of statements made to or information prepared for and used by the committee in carrying out its peer review function.
id.at.we expressly acknowledged the precedent of cruger on this issue as recently as may in brandon regional hospital murray,so d.thus,there can actually be no serious question that the rules of retroactivity apply.
in smiley state,so d,this court recently set forth the appropriate analysis to undertake when determining the retroactive application of a change in law.one of the first key considerations is to determine whether the change constitutes a change or is a substantive change in the law.smiley,so d at.generally,courts retroactively apply only remedial statutes,which do not create new rights or take away vested rights but operate only in furtherance of the remedy already existing.see id.if the law constitutes a substantive change,either by creating new rights or taking away vested rights,there is a presumption against the retroactive application of the change in law unless the legislature has expressly stated to the contrary.see also arrow air,walsh,so d.even if there is a clear legislative intent for retroactive application,however,courts must determine whether this is constitutionally permissible.although this case involves a change which was adopted by constitutional amendment,as opposed to a statutory amendment,the principles governing a change in statutory law apply equally to the current scenario.see state lavazzoli,so d,applying the same test to determine whether a constitutional amendment can be applied retroactively.
as addressed above,the first consideration is to determine whether the provision is remedial or substantive.despite the recent holding in smiley,the majority fails to discuss the distinction and the prior case law which recognizes this as a key consideration.a review of prior cases explains the underlying purpose as to why t he presumption against retroactive application of a law that affects substantive rights,liabilities,or duties is a well established rule of statutory construction.arrow air,so d at.as this court has explained 
because it accords with widely held intuitions about how statutes ordinarily operate,a presumption against retroactivity will generally coincide with legislative and public expectations.requiring clear intent assures that the legislature itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.such a requirement allocates to the legislature responsibility for fundamental policy judgments concerning the proper temporal reach of statutes,and has the additional virtue of giving legislators a predictable background rule against which to legislate.
id.quoting landgraf usi film products,d.in bates state,so d,this court noted that one of the reasons retroactive application of laws is disfavored is because it is contrary to the general principle that legislation by which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated ought to deal with future acts,and ought not to change the character of past transactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing law.id.quoting herbert broom,legal maxims ed.this court reaffirmed these principles in in re advisory opinion to the of county court judges,so d 
unless specifically stated in the text or in the statement placed on the ballot,constitutional amendments are generally given prospective effect only.see state lavazzoli,so d,nowhere in either article i,section as amended or in the statement placed on the november ballot is there manifested any intent that the amendment be applied retroactively.therefore,the amendment must be given prospective effect only.we find no reason to deviate from this general rule in the present case.in fact,while the voters were put on notice of the possibility that amendment might apply to judges appearing on the november ballot,there was no indication that amendment would apply to judges already in office.applying amendment to those judges who began their terms on january,would undermine the settled expectations of both the officeholders and the people of this state,who believed that the term of office was four years.therefore,because amendment should not be applied retroactively,the answer to your second question is that those county court judges whose terms began on january,should not be recommissioned for terms of office to expire on january.
id.at.accordingly,if a constitutional amendment does not clearly express an intent for retroactive application,this court has repeatedly refused to construe the amendment to affect detrimentally the substantive rights of persons arising under the prior law.lavazzoli,so d at relying upon its decisions in myers hawkins,so d state ex rel.judicial qualifications comm rose,so d and state ex rel.reynolds roan,so d.this court emphasized that this rule of construction applies with particular force to those instances where retrospective operation of the law would impair or destroy existing rights.lavazzoli,so d at emphasis added see also alamo,mancusi,so d,a substantive statute is presumed to operate prospectively rather than retrospectively unless the legislature clearly expresses its intent that the statute is to operate retrospectively.this is especially true when retrospective operation of a law would impair or destroy existing rights.citations omitted.
this court will generally not apply a statute retroactively if the statute impairs vested rights,creates new obligations,or imposes new penalties.state farm mut.auto.ins.laforet,so d,finding that even though the legislature expressly stated that section,was remedial and was to be applied retroactively,it was substantive and could not be applied retroactively because it significantly altered the language used to determine fines imposed on a violator see also mccord smith,so d,holding that a retrospective provision of a legislative act is invalid only in those cases wherein vested rights are adversely affected or destroyed or when a new obligation or duty is created or imposed,or an additional disability is established,on connection with transactions or considerations previously had or expiated daimlerchrysler hurst,so d,dca generally,due process considerations prevent the state from retroactively abolishing vested rights.thus,retroactive abolition of substantive vested rights is prohibited by constitutional due process considerations,review denied,so d basel mcfarland sons,so d,dca even when the legislature expressly states that a statute is to have retroactive application,courts will refuse to apply the statute retroactively if the statute impairs vested rights,creates new obligations,or imposes new penalties.the majority simply casts aside all of this precedent to reach its result.
whether there is clear intent for retroactive application 
in respect to amendment,while the statements of purpose and the amendment stated that,if enacted,it would change the current law that protected these statements and reports,neither the amendment,its declared purpose,nor the summary explicitly addressed retroactivity.the legislature reviewed the constitutional provision,including the lack of any specific provisions or words addressing retroactivity,and determined that the revision was not retroactive.see.stat.since there is no contrary intent set forth in the amendment,in accord with abundant precedent,this court should presume that the legislature acted constitutionally in adopting this statute.see,state giorgetti,so d,quoting this court prior case of gray central.lumber,so,for its holding that o n its face every act of the legislature is presumed to be constitutional and every doubt as to its constitutionality must be resolved in its favor.women health counseling,state,so d,i n the absence of an impingement upon constitutional rights an act of the legislature is presumed to be constitutional.quoting state bussey,so d,bunnell state,so d,stating in review of single subject challenge that legislative acts are presumed to be constitutional and that courts should resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of constitutionality.this presumption affords proper deference to the legislative branch of our government.
as the fifth district points out,the amendment stated that it was to become effective on the date it was approved,which clearly states a present effectiveness,not a retroactive effectiveness.see.hosp.waterman,so d at.the majority reaches the contrary conclusion that the constitutional amendment was intended to apply retroactively,asserting that the purpose of amendment plainly contemplates that its application would provide access to existing records by overriding and supplanting existing statutory provisions.however,this court has explicitly rejected the theory that simply because applying a statute retroactively would vindicate its purpose more fully is a sufficient reason to rebut the presumption against retroactivity.see arrow air,so d at metropolitan dade county chase fed.housing,so d see also landgraf,at.holding that the rationale that retroactive application of a new statute would vindicate its purpose more fully is not a sufficient justification to rebut the presumption against retroactivity.
the first district and the majority define the word patient as one who had previously undergone treatment and then treat this phrase as an expression of a clear intent that the records subject to disclosure include those created prior to the effective date of the amendment.notami hospital,so d at majority op.at.i do not agree.it is important to point out that the word previously is not found anywhere in the text of the amendment or the ballot summary.this language comes from the first district opinion in notami,which the majority then adopted.likewise,the majority relies on the term any,but this term is also not in the ballot summary that was before the voters.the ballot summary and ballot title use only the present tense or future tense in describing the impact of the initiative 
because this constitutional amendment was passed by initiative,in determining the intent behind the constitutional amendment,this court must look to the information before the voters and whether the voters of the constitutional amendment meant for this amendment to apply retroactively.however,the only information immediately available to the voters when casting their ballots is the ballot title or summary.advisory op.to the att y re additional homestead tax exemption,so d,voters deciding whether to approve a proposed amendment to our constitution never see the actual text of the proposed amendment.they vote based only on the ballot title and the summary.this becomes very important when viewed in light of this court precedent,which emphasizes that whether a drafter intended a certain effect does not matter nearly as much as the probable intent of the voters as evidenced by the materials they had available.see myers hawkins,so d,we have already held that the intent of the framer of a constitutional provision adopted by initiative petition will be given less weight in discerning the meaning of an ambiguous constitutional term that sic the probable intent of the people who reviewed the literature and the proposal submitted for their consideration.williams smith,so d,in analyzing a constitutional amendment adopted by initiative rather than by legislative or constitution revision commission vote,the intent of the framers should be accorded less significance than the intent of the voters as evidenced by materials they had available as predicate for their collective decision.in applying those principles to this case,this court must recognize that the ballot summary and ballot title have none of the ambiguous terms which allegedly show an intent for retroactive,these materials show a clear intent that the constitutional provision will only apply prospectively.
in looking to the amendment itself,the amendment provides that a patient is an individual who,in the present or in the past,has sought or undergone treatment and by this amendment the patient is provided a right to records made by a health care facility or provider relating to any adverse medical incident.as this court held in advisory opinion to attorney general re patients right to know,so d,and as set forth in the majority opinion at page,the purpose of the amendment was to create a constitutional right to access the records.it logically follows that the past treatment to which the amendment extends is to the date of the creation of the right,which is the effective date of the amendment.
the majority in its footnote cites to state ex rel.beacon journal publishing university of akron,ohio.the majority,however,omits the part of the ohio decision that is essential in analyzing the question of retroactivity here.that part states 
any interests in confidentiality that may have been affected by reliance upon prior law in compiling these reports by the university are adequately safeguarded by itself.these interests are dealt with extensively in a and which define confidential law enforcement investigatory records and trial preparation records which are exempted from public availability.
id.at emphasis added.this part of the decision from the ohio supreme court demonstrates another reason why the present amendment can not be properly applied retroactively because the amendment,unlike the ohio provision,does not have a provision that the records made upon the reliance of the existing statutory privilege are safeguarded so that the state promise of nonavailability is kept.similarly,state of organization of police officers society of professional journalists,affects only an agency prospective duty of disclosure and impairs no existing rights.
vested substantive right 
the majority states at page importantly,the statutes in question do not actually create a statutory privilege.the statutes do not deem relevant materials confidential or privileged.this statement is in direct conflict with what this court held in cruger in dealing with these precise statutory sections where the court said 
we have previously held that t he discovery privilege was clearly designed to provide that degree of confidentiality necessary for the full,frank medical peer evaluation which the legislature sought to encourage.holly auld,so d at.without the privilege,information necessary to the peer review process could not be obtained.feldman glucroft,so d.while we recognized in holly that the discovery privilege would impinge upon the rights of litigants to obtain information helpful or even essential to their cases,we assumed that the legislature balanced that against the benefits offered by effective by the medical community.holly,so d at.
we hold that the privilege provided by sections and,florida statutes,protects any document considered by the committee or board as part of its process.the policy of encouraging full candor in peer review proceedings is advanced only if all documents considered by the committee or board during the peer review or credentialing process are protected.committee members and those providing information to the committee must be able to operate without fear of reprisal.similarly,it is essential that doctors seeking hospital privileges disclose all pertinent information to the committee.physicians who fear that information provided in an application might someday be used against them by a third party will be reluctant to fully detail matters that the committee should consider.accordingly,we find that a physician application for staff privileges is a record of the committee or board for purposes of the statutory privilege.
the policy behind the confidentiality privilege mandates this interpretation.see byrd,so d,a court obligation is to honor the obvious legislative intent and policy behind an enactment,even where that intent requires an interpretation that exceeds the literal language of the statute.the privilege afforded to peer review committees is intended to prohibit the chilling effect of the potential public disclosure of statements made to or information prepared for and used by the committee in carrying out its peer review function.see dworkin francis.this chilling effect is attributable to several factors.as one commentator has noted 
d octors seem to be reluctant to engage in strict peer review due to a number of apprehensions loss of referrals,respect,and friends,possible retaliations,vulnerability to torts,and fear of malpractice actions in which the records of the peer review proceedings might be used.it is this ambivalence that lawmakers seek to avert and eliminate by shielding peer review deliberations from legal attacks.
gregory gosfield,medical peer review protection in the health care industry,temp,footnote omitted.these fears are alleviated only by interpreting the statute as we do today.
a different interpretation of this provision would completely eviscerate the protection the legislature sought to provide.ultimately,all peer review committee records would be discoverable.what would not be discoverable in one action because of the nature of the lawsuit would be discoverable in another action.the confidential nature of the peer review proceedings would be obliterated.see sanderson frank bryan,interpreting the confidentiality provision of pennsylvania peer review protection act,appeal denied.
cruger,so d at.thus,pursuant to this court express opinion in cruger and as acknowledged in brandon regional hospital,so d at,the statutes in question do actually create a statutory privilege the majority here is plainly in error.
furthermore,it is not germane to what this court held was the intent of this privilege that these statutes do not protect the information in federal court cases involving the application of federal causes of actions as in feminist women health center,mohammad,cir,or adkins christie,cir,or in disciplinary actions pursuant to section a b,florida statutes again,in cruger,this court specifically recognized that the purpose of the privilege was to protect against vulnerability to tort claims and fear of malpractice actions,which are civil actions expressly referred to in the statutes.we reiterated and enforced this holding in brandon regional hospital,so d at.
as noted earlier,the majority and the first district concluded the hospitals had no vested right in the statutory privilege upon which they relied and that in order to be vested,a right must be more than a mere expectation based on an anticipation of the continuance of an existing law.majority op.at quoting div.of workers comp.brevda,so d,dca.according to the majority,when a statutory privilege is repealed,then all communication made during the period when the privilege did exist are unclothed of their privilege.however,the majority provides no authority from florida courts for this extraordinary and troubling holding.the cases to which the majority cites,campus communications,earnhardt,so d,dca baker county press,baker county medical services,so d,dca publishing kaune,so d,dca,are inapposite.these cases involve situations in which the exemption from disclosure of records was enacted after the creation of the record.the records were not required to be disclosed.the legislative enactments were expressly remedial.there was no reliance upon the record not being disclosed as there is when records are created and information conveyed in reliance upon a privilege against their use.see,salt lake child family therapy clinic,frederick,utah holding that a new statute which modified a mental health therapist privilege could not be applied retroactively and that the relevant time period was when the privileged communications took place,not the time period when the interested person is seeking to gain access to the privileged information it is particularly troubling because the majority decision in respect to this statutory privilege puts all communications made in reliance upon other privileges at risk making the privilege guarding the conversations contingent upon the continuing existence of the statutory privilege.numerous privileges are creatures of statute these privileges have historically been honored because the privileges promote candor necessary and beneficial to the relationships which gave rise to the communication.privileged communications will have a whole new character now that the communications are exposed to future disclosure.
the straightforward fact is that the state made a promise by statute that if health care providers were open and frank about problems in care and treatment,their openness and frankness would be protected from disclosure.clearly,since this was a statutory right to confidentiality,it was subject to being changed prospectively.but those who complied with this statutory right clearly had an equal right to rely on the state promise that records made while the confidentiality applied would remain confidential.now,by this decision,the state promise is broken.for the above reasons,i dissent from the majority holding that the law should be applied retroactively.
