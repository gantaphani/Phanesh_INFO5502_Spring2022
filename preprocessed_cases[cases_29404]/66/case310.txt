discussion 
standard of review 
the standard of review for an order granting or denying a motion for summary judgment or adjudication is de novo.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,aguilar.the trial court stated reasons for granting summary relief are not binding on the reviewing court,which reviews the trial court ruling,not its rationale.kids universe th.
a party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.a defendant bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto.citation.ibid.
generally,the party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.citation.aguilar,supra,cal th at,fn.omitted.
ii.elements of legal malpractice cause of action 
in a legal malpractice action arising from a civil proceeding,the elements are the duty of the attorney to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as members of his or her profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the attorney negligence.citations.coscia mckenna cuneo cal th.significantly,i f the allegedly negligent conduct does not cause damage,it generates no cause of action in tort.citation.citation.baltins james th.
in the present matter,appellant argues that respondents representation that there was a percent chance that the family court would find her to be the putative spouse of ng caused her to decline ng settlement offers of and.appellant asserts that she was damaged when the family law matter was dismissed and she recovered nothing.
iii.respondents burden the nonexistence of a triable issue of material fact 
in their motion for summary judgment,respondents argued that there was no triable issue of material fact as to proximate causation.t he question of proximate cause becomes one of law where the facts are uncontroverted and only one deduction or inference may reasonably be drawn therefrom.citations.whinery southern pac.d.
respondents point out that they recommended to appellant that she settle the case,advised her that there was significant risk in trying her case,and warned her that she could walk away with nothing if she lost the putative spouse issue.respondents negotiated a stipulated judgment providing that ng would pay appellant,which ng signed.respondents urged appellant to accept the settlement.shortly thereafter,appellant retained new counsel,who also recommended that appellant accept the offer.in spite of both counsels recommendations,appellant rejected the settlement.based on these undisputed facts,respondents take the position that it was appellant own actions,in rejecting her attorneys advice,which was the direct cause of her damage.
in addition,respondents argue that appellant retention of subsequent counsel stolar,who independently advised appellant about ng offer of,broke the causal chain between respondents and appellant.in support of this argument,respondents cite several cases.the first,steketee lintz,williams rothberg cal d steketee,involved a plaintiff who claimed that the defendant law firm and two of its members negligently failed to file an action for medical malpractice on plaintiff behalf within the limitations period.id.at.however,the relationship between plaintiff and defendants was terminated in january,and the plaintiff cause of action for medical malpractice did not expire until september.id.at.the supreme court concluded,an attorney can not be held liable for failing to file an action prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations if he ceased to represent the client and was replaced by other counsel before the statute ran on the client action.citations.see also stuart superior court th,attorney entitled to summary judgment because he was not the attorney of record for plaintiff at the time his former client is alleged to have lost the right to pursue the personal injury action.similarly,respondents argue,an attorney can not be held liable for a client failure to accept a settlement when the attorney ceases to represent the client and is replaced by other counsel while the settlement offer is still open.
respondents also rely upon filbin fitzgerald th filbin.filbin is a settle and sue case,which involves a former client suing after litigation has been settled.depending on whether the disgruntled client was the plaintiff or the defendant in the antecedent lawsuit,the basis of the claim is that the settlement was less than it should have been,or more than it had to be,by reason of the negligence of the party attorney.id.at.in filbin,the trial court awarded former clients more than half a million dollars for malpractice by their former attorney.the court of appeal reversed,concluding that as a matter of law there was no causal connection between the attorney assertedly negligent acts and omissions and the amount the clients received when they settled.ibid.
the matter involved an eminent domain proceeding initiated by san luis obispo county against the filbins.an appraiser hired by fitzgerald,the filbins attorney,appraised the property at.however,filbin,a former real estate broker,believed the property was worth between million and million.filbin,supra,th at.fitzgerald advised the filbins that they were required to make a final settlement offer under the mandatory settlement provisions found in code of civil procedure section.he also informed them that the law generally requires that the property owner make a settlement demand in a figure less than the appraisal opinion.id.at.this statement was incorrect,as no authority requires such a reduced demand.id.at.
however,the court of appeal pointed out that attorney breaches of the standard of care are not per se actionable.citations.filbin,supra,th at.the court concluded that nothing fitzgerald did,or did not do,up to the time he departed as the filbins counsel caused the filbins to do anything to their detriment.indeed,the trial court noted,the filbins refused to follow his advice and refused to lower their demand to the amount stated by the appraiser.ibid.thereafter,they acquired new counsel,and it was with that new attorney impartial advice that they proceeded.the court concluded,their decision to settle was theirs and theirs alone,made with the assistance of new counsel,with no input from fitzgerald.the consequences of that decision are likewise theirs alone.id.at.
similarly,respondents argue,appellant refused to follow their advice and accept ng settlement offer.thereafter,appellant acquired new counsel,and it was with her new counsel impartial advice that she proceeded.appellant ultimate decision not to settle,in spite of her attorneys advice that she do so,was hers alone,and the consequences of that decision are likewise hers alone 
we find that the cases cited by respondents support their position that there is no triable issue of material fact as to causation.appellant disregarded respondents advice to accept the initial settlement offer from ng.appellant retained new counsel while ng offer of was still pending.appellant new counsel also strongly encouraged her to accept the settlement.it was her own decision,against the advice of her attorneys,to decline.no causal connection exists between any alleged malpractice and appellant loss as a matter of law.
iv.appellant has failed to show the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to proximate cause 
because respondents have met their burden of production,there is a shift,and appellant is subjected to a burden of production of her own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact as to the element of causation.aguilar,supra,cal th at.as set forth below,we find that appellant has failed to meet this burden.
appellant states that,in reliance on respondents negligent representation that there was a percent chance the family court would find her to be ng putative spouse and award her to million,she declined to accept ng settlement offers.appellant insists that if respondents had advised her that there was less than a percent chance that she would be declared ng putative spouse,she would have accepted ng settlement offers.in other words,appellant claims,but for respondents negligence,she would have obtained a greater reward 
appellant argues that the trial court failed to credit her declaration,which states in reliance on respondents representation that there was a percent chance that the family court would find me to be ng putative spouse and award me to million,i declined to sign the attachment to judgment family law that ng signed on may,that provided for a payment of to me.appellant argues that it is axiomatic that a trial court may not weigh the evidence on summary judgment,thus it was improper for the trial court to reject this evidence in her declaration.
appellant insistence that she relied on respondents representation that she had a percent chance of winning is insufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to legal causation.a n issue of fact is not raised by cryptic,broadly phrased,and conclusory assertions.citation.sinai memorial chapel dudler d.a percent chance is just that you might win,you might lose.respondents did not encourage appellant to gamble on this chance.on the contrary,the undisputed facts show that respondents strongly encouraged appellant to accept ng settlement offer.appellant does not deny that respondents encouraged her to accept the settlement.the undisputed evidence shows that she simply ignored this advice.appellant was not relying on her attorneys advice in rejecting the settlement,as her attorneys advice was to accept the settlement.appellant conclusory assertion to the contrary does not create a triable issue of fact 
appellant also disputes respondents position that her replacement of respondents with new counsel broke the chain of causation,based on language in cline watkins d cline.cli
