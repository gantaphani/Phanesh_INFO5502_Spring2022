in this medical negligence case,the parties appealed portions of the trial court judgment following a jury trial.the jury found the defendant spohn health system corporation spohn hospital liable and awarded damages to the plaintiffs,karen mayer and sandra hilbrich,individually and as representatives of the estate of their deceased father,raymond hilbrich.spohn argued on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding interest such that the damages award exceeded the limits of the statutory cap and in ordering as discovery sanctions that certain facts be taken as true at trial.mayer and hilbrich asserted on appeal that the stowers doctrine made the statutory cap limiting the damages award in medical negligence cases inapplicable.the court of appeals did not reach plaintiffs statutory cap argument,reversed the award of interest,and affirmed the judgment as modified.all parties petitioned for review.
we decide only the discovery issues in this opinion and hold that the sanctions imposed by the trial court do not comport with the standards we established in transamerican natural gas corporation powell.we further conclude that the trial court abuse of discretion in ordering these sanctions probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and remand the case to the trial court.
plaintiffs mayer and hilbrich alleged that the negligence of spohn staff resulted in the death of their father.hilbrich was admitted to spohn on august.he was years old,suffering from heart problems,and experiencing confusion and disorientation.on august,a nurse observed hilbrich attempting to get out of his hospital bed for the third time.in response,spohn moved him to the telemetry floor of the hospital in a room that was near the nurses station.on the telemetry floor,he was able to call for a nurse by pressing a button that activated a call light at the nurses station,and he was fitted with a medical monitoring device that relayed his vital signs to a monitoring station near the nurses station.a telemetry technician at the monitoring station kept track of the patient vital signs and was to notify the medical staff of any noteworthy changes in these signs.as a further precaution,hilbrich was restrained with a posey vest,which is a cloth device designed to limit a patient ability to get out of bed.
gary schmidt,the telemetry technician on duty at the hospital the night of august,noted in his witness statement that hilbrich made four calls after requesting a nurse assistance.schmidt further indicated that the nursing staff did not respond to the calls.the evidence established that at approximately,hilbrich telemetry monitor indicated that he was suffering from ventricular fibrillation.a nurse ran to hilbrich room and found him beside his bed with the posey vest caught on the bed and wrapped around his neck.the nurse removed the vest to free hilbrich,but,despite resuscitation efforts,he was pronounced dead a short time later.
mayer and hilbrich sued spohn on august.while preparing for trial,spohn interviewed and took written statements from schmidt,aurora silva,and some of the other nurses who had been on duty while hilbrich was in the hospital.in april,the plaintiffs propounded requests for disclosure on spohn,including a request for disclosure of witness statements,as provided in texas rules of civil procedure h.a party may obtain discovery of the statement of any person with knowledge of relevant witness statement regardless of when the statement was made.in june,spohn responded to the request for witness statements by producing the statements of two nurses.spohn did not produce the statements of schmidt,aurora silva,a nurse on duty the night hilbrich died,or two other nurses,but stated in its response that documents were being withheld based on the attorney doctrine.mayer and hilbrich threatened to file a motion to compel,but never did.on december,days before trial,spohn voluntarily produced the statements of schmidt,silva,and the two other nurses.at that time,spohn stated that it had withheld the statements believing them to be exempt from discovery but that recent case law had convinced spohn that the statements were now discoverable.
mayer and hilbrich moved for sanctions,arguing that schmidt and silva written statements had a direct bearing on the issue of breach of the standard of care and that spohn late production of the statements prejudiced the plaintiffs case.
schmidt witness statement indicated that immediately prior to hilbrich death,hilbrich called for a nurse four times.schmidt stated that he either informed the nurses of each call,or had a nurse aide inform them,but the nurses ignored the calls.plaintiffs called schmidt as a witness at the sanctions hearing,and his testimony was generally consistent with his written statement.
silva witness statement concerned her actions the night of hilbrich death.when these events occurred,she was acting as the charge nurse,or the supervisor,of the to shift.she gave the instructions to move hilbrich to a room near the nurses station and place him in the posey vest.in her statement she says that it never occurred to her that she had not written the physicians order regarding the posey vest restraint in hilbrich medical charts.her statement did not say that hilbrich was placed in the restraint without a physician order.silva testified at trial,but schmidt did not.
the trial court granted the plaintiffs motion for sanctions and ordered that facts in schmidt and silva written statements be taken as established,pursuant to rule b the court instructed the jury,pursuant to its order of january,that 
t he following facts are to be taken as established in this case number one,that immediately prior to midnight on the date of his death,raymond hilbrich made four requests for assistance using the nurse call button,spaced five minutes apart,each of which was noted and each of which was ignored by the nursing staff and,two,raymond hilbrich was placed in the posey vest,a physical restraint,without physician order,either written or telephonic.
at trial,in response to questioning by the plaintiffs,spohn nurses acknowledged that a failure to answer four calls from a patient would violate the standard of care.spohn filed two bills of exceptions containing testimony from two other nurses on duty the night of hilbrich death.the two nurses would have testified that schmidt never called them,contrary to his statement and to the court instruction.spohn contends that the nurses could not have appeared at trial to contradict the statements because the jury was required to take schmidt testimony as true.
there was also evidence presented at trial from a representative of the posey vest manufacturer and from a legend on the package for the vest indicating that federal law requires a physician order to use a posey vest.although the trial court instructed the jury that hilbrich was restrained with a posey vest without a physician order,hilbrich treating physician testified at trial that he approved the decision to place hilbrich in the restraint.
the jury returned a verdict for mayer and hilbrich and awarded damages,which,after the application of the cap on medical malpractice awards pursuant to the medical liability and insurance improvement act totaled.of that amount,the jury awarded to karen mayer,to sandra hilbrich,and to hilbrich estate.the trial court added interest and rendered judgment on the jury verdict.the court of appeals affirmed,but modified the judgment to exclude the award of interest.at.
we consider whether the trial court abused its discretion in ordering the sanctions under rule b against spohn.
the rule states,in relevant part 
b if a party fails to comply with proper discovery requests the court in which the action is pending may,after notice and hearing,make such orders in regard to the failure as are just,and among others the following 
an order that the matters regarding which the order was made or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the order
