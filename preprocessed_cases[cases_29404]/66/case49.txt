frederick feddersen brought this malpractice action against the defendants,a lawyer and law firm that represented him during divorce proceedings.the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on statute of limitations grounds.feddersen appealed.we affirm.
we review the record submitted for summary judgment in the light most favorable to feddersen.cloutier costco wholesale,cir.in,feddersen,having retained the defendants to represent him,filed for divorce from his,shelly cannon feddersen cannon.although feddersen and cannon had entered into a prenuptial agreement before their marriage,their divorce proceedings were lengthy and complex.under the terms of the prenuptial agreement,cannon was entitled to percent of the net book value of fmt corporation a corporation that was feddersen principal asset calculated as of the end of the fiscal year immediately preceding the filing of the libel for divorce.in the matter of feddersen and feddersen,slip.the parties efforts to determine the net book value of fmt constituted both a major issue in the divorce and the basis of this case.
during the pendency of the divorce,fmt was prosecuting two patent infringement claims,both related to technology used in plastic bottles manufacturing.by,the first claim,against a company known as nessei,had resulted in a judgment in favor of fmt for million,which had been confirmed on appeal.the second claim,against a company called constar,was at an earlier stage of litigation.feddersen,through the defendants,informed cannon of the net value of the nessei settlement and of the existence of the constar litigation.in december,as discussions on the divorce neared completion,feddersen offered cannon the chance to share in any proceeds of the constar lawsuit in exchange for her contribution to fmt legal fees in the case.cannon declined feddersen offer and stipulated that she would waive any interest in the constar case in exchange for a lump sum property settlement.subsequently,cannon and feddersen stipulated to a property settlement of.because fmt assets had been depleted by the two patent litigations,the parties agreed that their stipulation would be filed in escrow with the court until the money from the nessei case was received,at which time cannon would be paid and the case would proceed to a final hearing.
by early,the constar case had been referred to a special master,who,in february,found in favor of fmt and recommended a judgment of million.feddersen and counsel for fmt expected a lengthy and costly appeal,but constar settled for million in april.fmt received its first payment of million from constar in may,well before any payment was received from nessei 
neither feddersen nor the defendants informed cannon or her lawyers of the developments in the constar case.instead,on june,the defendants sent the new hampshire court and cannon lawyers a letter stating that the awaited contingency,meaning the receipt of funds sufficient to satisfy the property settlement in the divorce stipulation,had occurred.cannon and her lawyers assumed that the money from nessei had been delivered.
for a final hearing,the defendants prepared for feddersen an affidavit of his current financial standing,which was submitted to the court in accordance with former new hampshire superior court rule in the affidavit,feddersen certified that the value of his interest in fmt corporation was b ased on book value,and that his income was per year.a final divorce decree,incorporating the property settlement,entered on july.
in late,cannon petitioned for additional child support payments from feddersen.trial was scheduled for march,and discovery commenced.in reviewing feddersen tax returns,cannon lawyer,patricia murphy,learned that feddersen income for had been nearly million,not the he had sworn to in the affidavit prepared by the defendants.murphy and cannon soon learned about the constar settlement.by this time,feddersen had retained a new lawyer,steven grill.murphy told grill that she was thinking about moving to set aside the property settlement on the grounds of fraud 
grill explored murphy theory and determined that feddersen had a problem because of the discrepancy between his financial affidavit and his actual income and assets.he told feddersen as much in a march,letter and status report,going so far as to warn his client that if cannon pursues a fraud claim,you may be very hard pressed to prove that she actually had all the details regarding the constar case at the time the permanent stipulation was negotiated and agreed to,and that there is a strong possibility that the affidavit would not be considered a current affidavit as required by new hampshire law.grill strongly recommend ed to feddersen that he try to settle cannon claims and avoid litigation of a complicated and potentially very dangerous issue.
in the same letter,grill reacted angrily to news that feddersen had put charles douglas of the defendant law firm on notice of cannon potential fraud claim.my main concern,grill wrote,is that having been alerted to the potential problem douglas may attempt to protect himself against any potential malpractice claim.
shortly after receiving the march letter,feddersen terminated his relationship with grill who later noted that he and feddersen had not been seeing on a number of strategic and judgmental matters.feddersen retained,as new counsel,matthew cairns and garry lane.feddersen initial april,meeting with cairns and lane was recorded at feddersen request.at that meeting,feddersen revealed to cairns and lane that he had called carolyn garvey,a named defendant in this case along with douglas and their law firm.according to feddersen,garvey had denied that anything about the settlement was improper.feddersen also told cairns and lane that,according to grill,garvey and her partners would be fixing all the documents up now to cover their ass for malpractice.
citing the shafmaster case,see supra,cannon moved,on may,to set aside the property settlement.at the recommendation of the marital master handling the case,settlement negotiations commenced.through cairns and lane,feddersen sought to resolve cannon claims by offering her a substantial share in the potential proceeds of a third patent infringement case,then ongoing,with a company called aoki.ultimately,negotiations were unsuccessful,and the matter proceeded to a hearing.on september,the marital master set aside the property settlement.his decision was affirmed by the new hampshire supreme court on march.in the matter of feddersen and feddersen.feddersen then paid million to settle all remaining issues with cannon.
invoking,feddersen filed the current suit in the district court on july.the defendants moved for summary judgment on the grounds that feddersen had exceeded the three year statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions provided by.ann.the district court granted the defendants motion,and this appeal followed.
