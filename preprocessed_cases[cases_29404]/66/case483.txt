in what appears to be a case of first impression in california,we are called upon to address the question whether the plaintiff,in serving the notice of intent to commence an action against a medical practitioner code civ,must allege the specific factual basis of each cause of action in the lawsuit to be filed.we hold the notice requirement of section is not jurisdictional the total failure to comply with the statute does not invalidate an action against the medical practitioner and a failure to allege the specific factual basis of each cause of action does not prevent the plaintiff from alleging the cause in the lawsuit or from obtaining leave to amend the complaint to add any cause of action omitted from the section notice.
factual and procedural background 
the surgeries and the section notice.
after defendant gregory kirianoff performed outpatient reconstructive surgery on the breasts and nose of plaintiff shari edwards,she developed an infection in her breast which was diagnosed as coli infection.plaintiff also was required to undergo additional surgery on her nose to correct problems allegedly caused by the removal of too much nasal cartilage.
on may,plaintiff filed a timely notice of intent to file suit.the section notice letter informed defendant that plaintiff intends to file suit against you for damages resulting from medical negligence which resulted when plaintiff consulted you for plastic surgery and contracted e coli in her breast as a result of the surgery you performed.plaintiff contends that as a direct and proximate result of your failure to properly use clean instruments during a surgical procedure or to use sterile equipment or to operate in a sterile environment,and your failure to diagnose,treat,and recognize in a timely manner the e coli,plaintiff experienced infection in her breast resulting in the need for additional surgery the section notice made no mention of the nasal surgery.
the initial complaint.
on august,plaintiff filed this personal injury and medical negligence action,alleging defendant was negligent in performing the surgeries and used surgical instruments that had not been properly sterilized defendant,undertook employment to provide plaintiff with certain plastic and reconstructive surgeries to various portions of plaintiff body.defendant,lacked or failed to exercise the necessary knowledge and skill to properly perform the plastic and reconstructive surgeries on plaintiff,was negligent and unskillful in performing those surgical services,and used surgical instruments during those procedures which had not been properly sterilized.the negligent treatment of plaintiff by defendant resulted in plaintiff developing an bacteria infection in one of the areas on which defendant performed plastic and reconstructive surgery,resulting in severe and permanent damages to plaintiff body and health.as a direct and proximate cause of defendant negligence,plaintiff has suffered permanent and temporary damage to her body and health and has required and will continue to require medical care and treatment.
motion to amend.
on march,plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint to allege the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.plaintiff alleged,in the proposed first amended complaint,that coli infection does not occur in the absence of contamination and was most likely caused by the use of improperly sterilized surgical instruments.
the proposed amended complaint also alleged in more specific terms the injuries arising from the nasal surgery at said time and place,defendant also negligently performed reconstructive surgery on plaintiff nose,in that defendant did remove too much cartilage sic from the nose so that additional corrective surgery had to be performed in order to repair the damage done 
in responding to the motion to amend the complaint,defendant objected to the allegations specifying the damages arising from the nasal surgery but did not mention the res ipsa loquitur issue.
the trial court decision is interesting in several respects.the court noted the complaint is alleged in general terms and refers to surgeries.the court questioned defendant counsel about whether discovery had included information about the nasal surgery.defendant counsel replied that discovery had included references to the nasal surgery.the discovery conducted prior to the hearing on the motion to amend the complaint included deposition testimony and interrogatories relating to problems with both the breast surgery and the nasal surgery.
the transcript of the hearing shows the trial court indicated the nasal surgery was included in the general allegations in the original complaint and admonished plaintiff counsel you do have a need to amend.it already there in the complaint.plaintiff counsel responded that the primary reason for the motion to amend was to add the res ipsa loquitur allegation,and the other amendments were merely for clarification.
even though defendant did not mention section either in the answer to the complaint or the original opposition to the motion to amend,the trial court sua sponte raised the issue,commenting the section notice indicated generally a surgical procedure but did not give notice of a problem with the nasal surgery.the court informed the parties the section notice contained nothing even remotely related to the nose.however,the court noted neither counsel was prepared to address the section notice and took the matter under submission with directions to both counsel to file supplemental briefing on the section issue.
in plaintiff supplemental brief,counsel argued the section notice was sufficient to give notice of the intent to file suit and noted no court has ever interpreted section as requiring notice of all possible injuries or details of those injuries.plaintiff counsel further noted the original complaint repeatedly referred to surgeries in the plural and pointed out that discovery had included information about the nasal surgery and the subsequent surgery to repair the damage.
defendant counsel argued the section notice must include specifics of the injuries suffered.
on april,the trial court entered the following minute order motion to file an amended complaint is denied,except that plaintiff is not barred and is permitted to advance the theory of res ipsa loquitur at trial as to the e coli infection of the breast.
the petition.
plaintiff filed this petition,seeking a writ of mandate allowing amendment of the complaint.on august,we issued a notice palma industrial fasteners,cal d,lewis superior court cal th,d,to the parties of our preliminary conclusion that section is not jurisdictional and a plaintiff failure to describe all her injuries in the notice does not bar her from amending the complaint to add those injuries if the injuries are not otherwise barred by the statute of limitations.
thereafter we received additional briefs from both parties.
contentions of the parties 
plaintiff contends the notice requirements of section are not jurisdictional and can not be used to bar claims.further,plaintiff argues the trial court should allow amendment of pleadings and in determining whether to allow amendments of pleadings,the statutory language of section should be liberally construed so that cases can be decided on their merits.
defendant argues that any claims regarding injury to the nose are because petitioner failed to specifically mention them in the original complaint or the notice of intent to sue.in essence,defendant argues that section is jurisdictional and therefore,having failed to mention injury to the nose in the notice,plaintiff is barred from amending the complaint to now so allege.
discussion 
statutory provisions.
subdivision b of section does not require a particular form of notice but the notice must notify the defendant with specificity of the nature of the injuries suffered.section is part of the medical injury compensation reform act micra.the legislative purpose of requiring plaintiffs to give notice of intent to sue before bringing an action based upon professional negligence was to decrease the number of such actions by establishing a procedure to encourage the partie
