nihad alshafie,on his own behalf and as guardian ad litem for his daughter heba alshafie,appeals from the judgment entered after his legal malpractice action was dismissed because nihad who lives out of state,failed to post an undertaking to secure an award of costs.because the trial court failed to follow a procedure that ensured nihad received a full and fair hearing on the question whether he could afford to post a bond,we reverse and remand for a new determination of nihad financial condition.
factual and procedural background 
the first medical malpractice action 
nihad wife sana had given birth to a child in by caesarian section.pregnant again in,sana elected to have a vaginal delivery of her child after being informed of the risks of doing so,including the risk of a uterine rupture,following an earlier caesarian delivery.
sana,who had received prenatal care at daniel freeman maternity center,an entity affiliated with ucla and the regents of the university of california regents,went to daniel freeman hospital on june,for a scheduled induction of labor.on june,more than hours after she had first been given medication to induce labor,sana had not yet given birth.at it was noted,among other things,the baby heart rate was slow and sana was experiencing vaginal bleeding.the medication was discontinued,and sana was prepared for an emergency caesarian section.after the surgery began at,the doctors discovered sana had a uterine rupture and heba was floating in the peritoneum.heba was born with severe brain damage.
on june,richard garrigues filed a medical malpractice action on behalf of the alshafies against daniel freeman hospital and the delivering physician,rodney wright.in june or july garrigues retained pamela boyer,board certified in obstetrics and gynecology,to review the medical records in the matter.boyer concluded the care and treatment provided by the hospital employees to sana and heba did not fall below the standard of care or cause heba brain damage.consequently,garrigues made a tactical decision not to oppose the hospital august motion for summary judgment.garrigues,however,appeared at the hearing on the motion to ensure judgment was entered only in favor of the hospital,so the action could proceed against wright.in january the alshafies discharged garrigues and retained new counsel,lawrence lallande.on may,lallande dismissed the medical malpractice action without prejudice.
the second medical malpractice action 
in june lallande introduced the alshafies to gerald agnew,who associated as counsel to assist with a second medical malpractice action.the new malpractice lawsuit was filed on august,against wright and the prenatal care physicians.agnew consulted with michael friedman,a board certified obstetrician and gynecologist,who advised agnew he believed the treatment provided by the hospital,its nurses and wright did not fall below the standard of care or cause heba injuries.agnew also consulted with jeffrey greenspoon,a board certified obstetrician and gynecologist,as well as a maternal fetal medicine specialist who agnew anticipated would be the alshafies expert witness.greenspoon also concluded there was no negligence by anyone involved in the care given to sana and heba.
agnew and lallande advised sana and nihad they believed there was no merit to the lawsuit.in a letter dated february,lallande reiterated his concerns about the case and sought authorization to settle the matter for any sum obtainable or to negotiate a dismissal for a waiver of costs.sana and nihad signed the authorization on march.subsequently,agnew was able to obtain an offer from the regents,which had stipulated all of the doctors involved in sana prenatal care and the delivery of heba were its agents or employees,to settle the case for.nihad,however,refused to accept the settlement.
in september the cochran law firm replaced lallande and agnew as counsel.work done by that firm suggested heba had been the victim of nursing malpractice contrary to the conclusion of the prior experts the purported failure of the nursing staff to appreciate the significance of readings from the fetal monitor strips and the consequent delay in notifying the treating obstetrician of any problems.when the regents moved for summary judgment on november,nihad filed a stating,the expert evaluation of this case concluded that the negligence that resulted in heba injuries was done by the nursing staff at daniel freeman hospital,maternity clinic.as stated in the moving papers,on august,the defendant daniel freeman filed a motion for summary judgment.for some unknown reason,no opposition was filed by plaintiff.on september,the order grant ed the motion with no opposition or appearance by plaintiff.that order held that the healthcare providers at daniel freeman,which would include the nursing staff,had met their burden of proof for the granting of the motion.plaintiff concedes that no further action exists against the regents of the university of california or the university of california los angeles medical center.judgment was entered in favor of the regents on february.
the legal malpractice action 
on august,nihad filed a legal malpractice action against his former and his firm,perona,langer,beck lallande the lallande defendants agnew and his firm,agnew brusavich the agnew defendants and garrigues and his partner,michael sisson,and their firm garrigues sisson the garrigues defendants.on june,nihad filed a third amended complaint asserting claims for negligence,breach of fiduciary duty and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
the third amended complaint alleged the garrigues defendants failed to learn the basis of the medical malpractice underlying heba injuries,failed to conduct any discovery and failed to oppose the hospital motion for summary judgment.with respect to the lallande defendants and the agnew defendants,the third amended complaint alleged they knew,but failed to advise the alshafies,of the basis for a legal malpractice action against the garrigues defendants they knew,but failed to inform the alshafies,the defendants in the second medical malpractice action could not be found liable due to the collateral estoppel or res judicata effect of the first action and they failed to take steps to set aside the grant of summary judgment in the first action,instead prosecuting the case knowing it was futile.
the trial court order granting the motions for imposition of an undertaking 
because the alshafies had moved to virginia,in september the agnew defendants and lallande defendants filed motions,joined by the garrigues defendants,for imposition of an undertaking to secure an award of costs pursuant to code of civil procedure section after receiving two continuances nihad filed an opposition on november,and belatedly filed three days before the hearing a declaration asserting he could not afford to post an undertaking.nihad stated his family,which now included three children,lived in a rented apartment he was a tow truck dispatch manager sana did not work outside of their home because she took care of the children he could not afford any additional expenses beyond their current living expenses and the extraordinary expenses required for heba,who could not speak,walk,feed herself,or in any manner care for herself he had no tangible assets on which to secure an undertaking bond and a ny requirement to pay money to post a bond for costs in this case would pose an unbearable and impossible financial hardship and preclude further litigation of this case.
the trial court granted the motions in the aggregate amount of for the lallande defendants anticipated costs,for garrigues anticipated costs and for sisson and garrigues sisson anticipated costs.the agnew defendants had been voluntarily dismissed from the action by this time the remaining defendants will be referred to collectively as the attorney defendants.with respect to nihad declaration,the court stated,counsel for plaintiffs also refers to plaintiff own declaration regarding indigency pursuant to baltayan estate of getemyan th,d but no such declaration was timely submitted.on three days before the hearing,plaintiffs filed a declaration of nihad alshafie without explanation for the delay.the plaintiff declaration is conclusory regarding indigency as there are no facts to support the indigency statement such as tax returns,receipts or other substantive documentation.in plaintiff cited case of baltayan estate of getemyan,the appellate court found that the trial court did not act arbitrarily or capriciously when it ordered a bond despite the fact that plaintiff therein provided tax returns,holding that the tax returns were incomplete.
dismissal of the legal malpractice action 
after nihad failed to file the required undertaking,the lallande defendants moved to dismiss the action the garrigues defendants joined the motion.in opposition nihad filed a new declaration providing more specific information to support his claim of indigency.i am financially unable to pay bond the undertaking costs in this matter.my annual income is approximately.in addition heba receives per month for social security disability income.my wife and mother,ashraf year old son,heba year old disabled daughter,noor year old daughter,and myself live in a rented town home for per month.i have in savings account and in a checking account.i do not have any retirement accounts.we own three ford explorer ashraf car,mercury moutaineer my wife sana car,and pontiac bonneville my car.i do not have any friends relatives that are in a financial position to pay or bond the undertaking costs in this matter.we are unable to move back to california because of access to health care.heba treating physicians and local hospital are walking distance from our home.
the trial court dismissed the action,finding,plaintiffs arguments and contentions simply reargue the merits of the court order granting the motion requiring the undertaking.the court further stated,t he declaration of plaintiff alshafie regarding his alleged indigency can not be properly considered since it does not properly comply with the requirements of section.nonetheless,the court also appeared to evaluate the merits of the declaration,stating,plaintiff declaration reflects that his monthly rent is higher than his reported income on which he supports his five member family and three vehicles.the court notes that alshafie declarations remain conclusory and lacking in the required facts to establish the alleged indigency.
discussion 
the law governing undertakings by plaintiffs 
plaintiffs who reside outside of california may be required to post an undertaking to ensure payment of costs to a prevailing defendant.section,subdivision a,provides,when the plaintiff in an action or special proceeding resides out of the state,or is a foreign corporation,the defendant may at any time apply to the court by noticed motion for an order requiring the plaintiff to file an undertaking to secure an award of costs and attorney fees which may be awarded in the action or special proceeding.the plaintiff,however,will not be required to file an undertaking unless there is a reasonable possibility that the moving defendant will obtain judgment in the action or special proceeding,subd.b.if the plaintiff fails to file an undertaking after the court determines the grounds for the motion have been established,the plaintiff action or special proceeding shall be dismissed as to the defendant in whose favor the order requiring the undertaking was made,subds.c d.
the purpose of the statute is to enable a california resident sued by an resident to secure costs in light of the difficulty of enforcing a judgment for costs against a person who is not within the court jurisdiction.citation.the statute therefore acts to prevent residents from filing frivolous lawsuits against california residents.yao superior court th,d.although a previous version of section was found unconstitutional because it failed to provide a meaningful pretaking hearing gonzales fox,d supp,the revised statute,which provides for a hearing violates neither federal nor state due process guarantees because the statutory hearing procedure is the one usually prescribed for pretrial motions,that is,the opportunity to present declarations and other documentary evidence,the opportunity for both counsel to be present,and the opportunity to be heard.yao,at,d.
even if the defendant establishes the grounds for an undertaking,the trial court may waive the requirement if the plaintiff establishes indigency.section,which codifie d the common law authority of the courts cal.law revision com,west civ.proc.supp.foll,provides,the court may,in its discretion,waive a provision for a bond in an action or proceeding and make such orders as may be appropriate as if the bond were given,if the court determines that the principal is unable to give the bond because the principal is indigent and is unable to obtain sufficient sureties,whether personal or admitted surety insurers.in exercising its discretion the court shall take into consideration all factors it deems relevant,including but not limited to the character of the action or proceeding,the nature of the beneficiary,whether public or private,and the potential harm to the beneficiary if the provision for the bond is waived.see also baltayan getemyan,supra,th at,d baltayan w here the plaintiff establishes indigency,a trial court has discretion to waive the posting of security under.
the public policy underlying an indigent entitlement to a waiver of security costs is essentially access trumps comfort.baltayan,supra,th at,d conc.opn.of johnson.in ruling indigents are entitled to a waiver of security for costs,the state is saying one party economic interest in receiving its costs of litigation should it win can not be used to deny an indigent his fundamental right of access to the courts.see cruz superior court th,d cruz r estricting an indigent access to the courts because of his poverty contravenes the fundamental notions of equality and fairness which since the earliest days of the common law have found expression in the right to proceed in forma pauperis.
this court decision in baltayan 
this court decision in baltayan,supra,th,d,in which we reversed the dismissal of an action for failure to post an undertaking,is the necessary starting point for evaluating the trial court orders in this case.the plaintiff,gagik baltayan,was an injured in an automobile accident.the defendants moved for an undertaking pursuant to section.the trial court initially continued the motion because the parties were engaged in an arbitration.following an award for the defendants,baltayan filed a timely request for a trial de novo and the defendants renewed their motion for an undertaking.baltayan did not oppose the motion on its merits,arguing only that the trial court had agreed to hear the motion at the trial setting and status conference scheduled about three weeks after the noticed hearing date.neither baltayan nor his attorney appeared at the hearing.the court granted the motion and ordered baltayan to post a undertaking in days.id.at,d.
before the days had expired,baltayan filed a motion for relief on the grounds,among others,he was indigent,requiring him to post the undertaking would violate his right to equal protection and days was an insufficient amount of time.baltayan,supra,th at,d.to support his claim of indigency,baltayan filed a declaration stating he had no savings,neither he nor his wife owned real property and his family income was the same as that reflected on the attached copies of the two prior years federal income tax returns and.however,t he attached tax return copies were incomplete because they indicated business income requiring completion of schedule c,but did not include a copy of that schedule.id.at,d.
the trial court granted baltayan an additional days to post the undertaking,but otherwise denied any relief.baltayan failed to post the undertaking within the extended time.thereafter,the defendants moved to dismiss the action.baltayan opposed the dismissal,noting he had recently obtained an order relieving him of the obligation to pay court fees and costs and arguing that,because he was now in forma pauperis,the court was required to waive the undertaking.the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss.baltayan,supra,th at,d.
reviewing the trial court decision whether to waive the requirement an plaintiff post an undertaking under an standard,this court upheld the trial court initial order denying baltayan relief,in large part because of suspicions raised by the documentation baltayan had submitted baltayan relied primarily upon the copies of his tax returns to show low income,but apparently deliberately omitted from each return schedule c.the schedule would have revealed the actual business gross receipts of the business and the amount claimed as deductible business expenses.in addition,baltayan declaration did not address whether his wife had any savings,nor did it deny ownership of assets other than real property,jewelry,artwork,equipment or cars that might be used as collateral to secure the bond.baltayan likewise did not address whether he or his wife had a friend or relative who would be willing to either post a cash bond or pay the premium on a surety bond.citation.nor did baltayan or his attorney show that they had made any unsuccessful effort to obtain an undertaking.counsel declaration merely stated that he had inquired of several bond companies as to the procedure for obtaining the required undertaking,but did not show any actual attempt to obtain it.moreover,baltayan arbitration brief,which he attached to his motion for relief,showed a spending level that reasonably cast doubt upon appellant indigency claim.baltayan,supra,th at,d.nevertheless,we reversed the trial court dismissal of the action after baltayan had obtained in forma pauperis status,holding,g iven the finding of indigency necessarily underlying the in forma pauperis order,the trial court acted arbitrarily and capriciously in refusing to either vacate or reduce the amount of the undertaking.id.at,d.
justice johnson,in a thoughtful concurring opinion tracing the history of in forma pauperis rights from their fifteenth century english origins,argued the issue was not one of discretion at all baltayan had an absolute right to a waiver,as a matter of law,once he had obtained in forma pauperis status.baltayan,supra,th at,d conc.opn.of johnson,the trial court lacks discretion to impose a code of civil procedure section security deposit requirement once the judge determines the plaintiff is financially qualified for that in forma pauperis status and possesses a nonfrivolous claim.although justice johnson grounded his conclusion in settled principles of california in forma pauperis law and,accordingly,found it unnecessary to present an exhaustive treatment of the constitutional issue,he nonetheless suggested dismissal of baltayan action would be unconstitutional under the equal protection clauses of the united states and california applied to an resident who was poor enough to qualify for in forma pauperis rights in california courts.baltayan,supra,th at,d conc.opn.of johnson.
the trial court abused its discretion in granting the motions for an undertaking without providing an adequate hearing on nihad financial ability to satisfy the bond requirement 
because nihad has not sought or obtained in forma pauperis status,permitting him to proceed in this litigation without payment of court fees and costs,the trial court ultimate decision to grant or deny a waiver of the section security deposit requirement is reviewed under an standard.baltayan,supra,th at,d.nonetheless,a court discretion must be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice.citations.elston city of turlock cal d.moreover,we carefully examine a trial court order finally resolving a lawsuit without permitting the case to proceed to a trial on the merits.rappleyea campbell cal th,d,see generally people ault cal th,d,appellate review of trial court orders granting nonsuits,directed verdicts,or judgments notwithstanding the that finally terminate claims or quite strict.all inferences and presumptions are against such orders.parkview villas,state farm fire casualty th,d.
in the first instance the party seeking relief from the requirement of posting a bond or undertaking has the burden of proof to show entitlement to such relief.williams freedomcard,th,d see baltayan,supra,th at,d the plaintiff should make a prima facie showing that he has unsuccessfully attempted to obtain the required undertaking or that he is unable to furnish it.it is by no means certain,however,what the nature of that showing must be.on one end of the spectrum,a sworn statement of hardship that includes some financial information but no supporting documentation may be sufficient.for example,in hood superior court th,d,division one of this court a slightly different context,but,like here,with the potential of barring a litigant from the litigant sworn declaration an order obligating him to pay discovery referee fees would be a financial hardship and a statement of his income and expenses are sufficient to justify a fee waiver,absent something in the declaration giving the court reason to doubt its veracity.id.at,d.the court reversed the trial court order requiring the litigant to provide documentation of his income,whether by tax records or other documents.id.at,d mcdonald superior court th,d plaintiff personal declaration under penalty of perjury as to her financial condition and its impact on her ability to proceed with the litigation was competent evidence.the court abused its discretion by its apparent failure to consider it in determining how discovery disputes should be handled.
on the other end of the spectrum,a party formally seeking in forma pauperis status to be relieved of paying specified court fees and costs,which we believe could include a section undertaking as an additional court fee or cost see cal.rules of court,rule must complete a mandatory judicial council form currently designated form and provide the specified financial information rule a see cruz,supra,th at,d discussing prior version of mandatory form.an applicant who is not receiving government benefits from certain public assistance and supplemental income programs or whose monthly income exceeds percent of the current monthly federal poverty guidelines may nevertheless qualify to proceed in forma pauperis if his or her income is not sufficient to pay for court fees and costs as well as the common necessaries of life for the applicant and the applicant family.cruz,at,d,subd.a.in such a case,the applicant must complete the section of form requiring disclosure of detailed financial information,including all sources of income for the applicant and any family members living in the home who depend in whole or part on the applicant for support interests in property such as cash,checking and savings accounts,vehicles and real estate and monthly expenses such as rent,food,household supplies,clothing,medical,child care and transportation.see cruz,at,d.
