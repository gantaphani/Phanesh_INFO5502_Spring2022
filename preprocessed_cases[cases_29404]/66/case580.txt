background 
in september,defendant,robert eichmann,a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology,performed abdominal surgery on plaintiff,janet sullivan.sullivan experienced complications following surgery,including a perforated bowel.in september,sullivan filed a medical malpractice complaint against eichmann,and alleged that eichmann negligent conduct caused her medical complications.a letter attached to the complaint,signed by harrith hasson,provided that eichmann deviated from the standard of care during his treatment of sullivan.see ilcs west.at the time of filing her complaint,sullivan was represented by trial counsel gregory barrett.
subsequently,the parties conducted discovery.several times during discovery,court orders were amended to extend the time to disclose and depose fact and expert witnesses.the trial court repeatedly ordered sullivan to formally disclose the name of her expert and the expert opinions,and to make the expert available to be deposed.on february,during a routine status hearing,barrett informed the court that hasson was withdrawing as an expert and was not willing to testify that eichmann was negligent.barrett requested additional time to seek a new expert.the court granted the request,and ordered sullivan to disclose an expert and answer all interrogatories by march.sullivan did not comply with the trial court order.on april,eichmann filed his combined motions to dismiss for summary judgment.pursuant to supreme court rule,eichmann sought the dismissal of sullivan complaint due to sullivan failure to comply with the trial court discovery orders.see c.alternatively,eichmann sought summary judgment as a matter of law because sullivan failed to identify or provide the opinion of an expert witness who would state that eichmann deviated from the standard of care.see ilcs west.eichmann argued that without an expert sullivan was not able to establish a prima facie case of medical negligence.
on may,the motion for summary judgment was heard by the trial court.a court reporter was not present during the hearing and,therefore,the record does not contain a transcript.however,sullivan motion to reconsider and petition for leave to appeal to this court,together with eichmann brief to this court and the transcript from the hearing on sullivan motion to reconsider,provide a sketch of what transpired on may.the transcript discloses that sullivan new counsel,michael holoka,provided an oral account of what occurred in court on may.eichmann did not contest the facts as orally detailed by sullivan attorney.further,eichmann did not contest the facts as outlined by sullivan in her petition for leave to appeal to this court or during oral argument before this court.it is evident,therefore,that the following occurred on may.
sullivan original trial counsel,barrett,appeared at the summary judgment hearing.sullivan herself was not personally present.additionally,a new attorney,michael holoka,of the law firm of kralovec,jambios schwartz,appeared at the hearing.prior to the arguments,holoka tendered to the court a document entitled substitution of attorneys,which appears in the record.the document,signed by sullivan and a member of holoka law firm,designated the firm of kralovec,jambois schwartz as sullivan new attorneys.the document was also signed by barrett and purported to withdraw barrett law firm from the matter.holoka informed the court that he did not have an expert affidavit available with him in court,but that he had retained an expert who would testify that eichmann deviated from the standard of care in his treatment of sullivan.holoka provided the name of the expert to both defense counsel and the court.holoka explained that because he was only retained in,and the expert was also newly retained,he was not able to obtain the new expert opinion in writing prior to the hearing.defense counsel objected to the substitution and argued that,absent an expert counteraffidavit,substitution should be denied.the trial court denied sullivan substitution request,and proceeded to hear the motion for summary judgment.defense counsel presented the motion,barrett informed the court that he had no response to the motion,and the court entered summary judgment in favor of eichmann.the order provided in part 
there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that defendant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.by reason of the granting of defendant motion for summary judgment,defendant motion to dismiss,with prejudice,pursuant to section of the illinois code of civil procedure and scr c is moot.
substitution of counsel should not be allowed to delay the entry of an order allowing defendant dispositive motion but defendant has no objection to the substitution with respect to any proceedings.
this same order allowed holoka substitution for purposes of any postjudgment proceedings.on may,sullivan filed a motion for reconsideration.the motion explained that a personal tragedy impaired barrett ability to represent her in the matter.sullivan attached to the motion her own affidavit providing that barrett first informed her on april,that he did not have enough time to retain an expert to oppose summary judgment and that she immediately sought other counsel to represent her.sullivan also attached to the motion an amended answer to eichmann supreme court rule interrogatories,as well as a report,affidavit,and curriculum vitae of her new expert witness,howard topel.topel affidavit stated that he received materials regarding sullivan medical condition on april,reviewed the materials,and orally communicated his opinion to sullivan attorney on may,topel opinion was that eichmann did not meet the standard of care required in the pertinent medical field.the motion informed defense counsel and the court that topel was prepared to proceed with his deposition,and dates were tendered for the taking of his deposition.
the court denied the motion to reconsider and entered the following written memorandum of decision 
i have considered at great length the arguments of counsel and tried very hard to weigh the equities involved.i will first say that i disagree with the procedural history as recited by holoka.i did not do so on the record because i did not see the value in doing so in the limited time available.
however,my recollection of the history of this case is that the plaintiff counsel who preceded holoka on the file appeared at or near the discovery cut off and indicated that his expert now declined to testify.the clear implication was not that it was now inconvenient due to delays as suggested by holoka,but that he now declined to swear that there was negligence.it was further suggested that counsel felt finding an expert would be difficult but that he would like the discovery date extended in order to try to find someone who would be willing to testify on her behalf.again,the implication was that he doubted that anyone would be found for that purpose.the time to disclose came and went without an expert having been found.the summary judgment motion was thirty days later and there was no sworn attestation to the availability of an expert.the motion to reconsider is denied.
the appellate court affirmed the trial court.unpublished order under supreme court rule.the appellate court noted that leave is not required when an attorney seeks to enter an appearance.the appellate court declined,however,to consider whether the trial court erred in denying the motion for substitution because the record on appeal was inadequate to d
