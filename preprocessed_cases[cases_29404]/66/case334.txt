background filing of action 
for purposes of analyzing the demurrer rulings,we take the facts properly pleaded to assess whether they may state their causes of action,as matters of law.blank kirwan cal d.appellant alleges essentially the following sequence of events.from september through september,he was the ceo,president,and director of the company.respondents are qualified accounting professionals that were engaged by the company in,and again in,to audit its financial statements for the previous year and also to review its interim financial statements.in their engagement agreements with the company,respondents agreed to inform it of any errors,fraud,illegal acts,or reportable conditions that came to their attention unless clearly inconsequential respondents created and delivered audit reports and reviews to the company and to appellant in his official capacity.the reports did not identify any outstanding tax liabilities.
a third party creditor brought enforcement proceedings against the company in,resulting in the discovery of its large outstanding tax liabilities.appellant participated in an internal investigation and in august,he learned from the company cfo that since,the cfo had been diverting company funds intended for tax payments,so the company had failed to pay large sums of payroll withholding taxes.the company went under and appellant lost his job.
originally,the state of california held appellant personally liable for the unpaid payroll taxes,but after an investigation,it released him from liability,concluding he had no knowledge of the cfo misdeeds until august and he had not willfully withheld monies due.
in october,the internal revenue service irs assessed appellant personally for the company unpaid payroll taxes and penalties.appellant responded on june,by filing a federal civil complaint for a refund of the penalties collected from him for the unpaid payroll taxes the federal proceedings.the united states counterclaimed against appellant for the outstanding payroll tax assessments.in that context,in june,the prosecution subpoenaed respondents accounting records from its engagements with the company.respondents produced the records and appellant counsel obtained a copy in september.in march,appellant settled the matter by stipulating to a judgment for back taxes and penalties,and incurred attorney fees.
in march,appellant filed this state court complaint on theories of professional negligence,breach of contract and implied covenants,as well as negligent misrepresentation and constructive fraud.after a demurrer was sustained with leave to amend,he filed the fac,expanding his discovery allegations.appellant alleges that he had standing to sue as an express or intended third party beneficiary of the company engagement agreements,due in part to his exposure to personal liability for the company tax defaults.
in the fac,appellant alleges he was unable to discover his claims until september,because he did not have access to respondents auditing work papers until the government subpoenaed them in the federal proceedings.appellant contended that since the cfo had successfully concealed his actions until august,there was no reason to suspect that respondents were aware of the misconduct at the time failure to pay the payroll withholding taxes.when appellant investigated in,one of respondents employees told him that any significant information would have been included in footnotes in financial statements.the reports did not include tax liability information.
appellant therefore argued that it was not until september,when his attorney obtained the subpoenaed accounting records in connection with the federal proceedings,that he became able to discover any basis to make a claim against respondents,to recover damages attributable to his assessed personal liability for the unpaid taxes.specifically,appellant claims that respondents and auditing work papers,provided in the federal discovery,showed there were payroll taxes payable,tax liability balances were increasing,and tax arrearages,although respondents considered the matter to be minor,because the cfo told them he had recorded accruals for such a possibility.according to appellant,these auditing work papers reflect respondents understanding and acknowledgment of lack of segregation of duties under the cfo,presenting a heightened risk of fraud or irregularity,which triggered their duty to disclose under the applicable accounting standards.respondents allegedly breached their duties to report such a known condition or illegal act,the company failure to pay its taxes,and caused harm to appellant.
thus,respondents omission from their reports of any references to unpaid taxes was alleged to demonstrate they had contemporaneous knowledge of the company failure to make the appropriate tax payments,but actively concealed this until the subpoena production was made in.
demurrer to fac ruling 
respondents filed their demurrer and motion to strike the fac,first challenging the standing of appellant to sue for professional negligence,on the grounds that the engagement letter was executed by the company,without specifying appellant as a party.respondents further argued that the face of the pleading showed that the statute of limitations started to run when appellant received the confession from the cfo in august that the company taxes had intentionally not been paid.alternatively,respondents claimed the action was obviously time barred,as shown by appellant knowledge that he was being held personally liable for the unpaid taxes and penalties throughout the proceedings.however,his complaint was not filed until march.in support of their arguments,respondents provided copies of the pleadings in the federal tax proceedings for judicial notice.
in opposition,appellant contended he was an intended beneficiary of the engagement letters,but acknowledged that an audit was not guaranteed to detect fraud or illegal activity.he claimed the auditing materials were intended for the use of the company board of directors and management,including appellant.
appellant sought a ruling he was excusably delayed in discovering respondents potential liability,so the action did not accrue until because of respondents alleged fraudulent concealment of their knowledge about the cfo wrongdoing,when it came to their attention.in support,he provided additional material for judicial notice,consisting of the standardized accounting principles that respondents had allegedly violated,and a copy of the redlined fac,showing the amendments recently made.
the trial court took judicial notice of the documents submitted,and agreed with respondents that the facts pled on the face of the fac disclosed that the action was untimely filed.further,the court ruled that appellant lacked sufficient standing to sue the company auditor for alleged professional negligence.the demurrers were sustained without leave to amend,the motion to strike was deemed moot,and a judgment of dismissal was entered.this appeal followed.
applicable standards approach to standing issues 
we apply rules of review.a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint.citation.therefore,we review the complaint de novo to determine whether it contains sufficient facts to state a cause of action.citation.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.the trial court exercises its discretion in declining to grant leave to amend.citation.if it is reasonably possible the pleading can be cured by amendment,the trial court abuses its discretion by not granting leave to amend.citation.the plaintiff has the burden of proving the possibility of cure by amendment.grinzi san diego hospice th,d grinzi blank kirwan,supra,cal d.
on demurrer,a court must accept properly pleaded facts as true,but a demurrer does not admit the plaintiff contentions nor conclusions of law or fact.people ex rel lungren superior court cal th,d.it is appropriate to consider judicially noticed matters.e fab,accountants.services th,d e fab.because the trial court determination is made as a matter of law,we review the ruling de novo.ibid.
in their demurrer and motion to strike,respondents raised not only a limitations bar to the action,but also a lack of standing to sue.the trial court issued a ruling in favor of respondents on the standing claim regarding the professional negligence cause of action without reaching the contractual theories.
the fac alleges that the engagement letters were entered into between respondents and the company,and appellant was,ex officio,an express or intended third party beneficiary of it and of respondents professional obligations,and thus the equivalent of a client for certain purposes.admittedly,the issue of standing presents difficult analytical questions here,based on the following language in bily,supra,cal th,footnote,d,
in theory,there is an additional class of persons who may be the practical and legal equivalent of clients.it is possible the audit engagement contract might expressly identify a particular third party or parties so as to make them express third party beneficiaries of the contract.third party beneficiaries may under appropriate circumstances possess the rights of parties to the contract.citations.however,this case presents no third party beneficiary issue w e have no occasion to decide whether and under what circumstances express third party beneficiaries of audit engagement contracts may recover as clients under our holding.
we need not express any substantive position on the standing issues,since the limitations issues are dispositive under these circumstances.we assume arguendo that appellant can sufficiently assert standing to sue the company auditors for alleged professional negligence and the related causes of action,and now turn to the discovery rule arguments.
rules regarding discovery of facts constituting the causes of actiona.applicable legal principles 
where a demurrer raises the bar of the applicable statute of limitations,the courts assess whether the complaint shows on its face that the statute bars the action.e fab,supra,th,d.such a defect must clearly and affirmatively appear on the face of the complaint it is not enough that the complaint shows merely that the action may be barred.citations.id.at,d.
the parties do not dispute that the limitations period of section,subdivision applies to each of the causes of action in the fac,since they are all intertwined with the professional malpractice allegations negligent misrepresentation,constructive fraud,breach of contract and implied covenants.curtis kellog anderson th,d curtis.generally,the bar of the statute of limitations is raised as an affirmative defense,subject to proof by the defendant.samuels mix cal th,d.
however,when a plaintiff relies on the discovery rule or allegations of fraudulent concealment,as excuses for an apparently belated filing of a complaint,the burden of pleading and proving belated discovery of a cause of action falls on the plaintiff.investors equity life holding schmidt th,d april enterprises,kttv d.it is plaintiff burden to establish facts showing that he was not negligent in failing to make the discovery sooner and that he had no actual or presumptive knowledge of facts sufficient to put him on inquiry.
more specifically,to overcome an apparent limitations bar,the plaintiff claiming delayed discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action has the burden of setting forth pleaded facts to show the time and manner of discovery and the inability to have made earlier discovery despite reasonable diligence.the burden is on the plaintiff to show diligence,and conclusory allegations will not withstand demurrer.e fab,supra,th,d.
in evaluating the reasonableness of a plaintiff reliance on alleged misrepresentations,the courts will consider what is apparent from the pleadings about the plaintiff knowledge and experience.generally,a plaintiff will be denied recovery only if his conduct is manifestly unreasonable in the light of his own intelligence or information.broberg v.the guardian life ins.of america th,d broberg.
two types of injury 
appellant claims that the injury he suffered had two concurrent causes,not only the misconduct of the cfo in not paying the taxes,but also respondents misfeasance and concealment of facts in their auditing reports about the unpaid taxes,thus allegedly causing either the same or further harm to the company and appellant.he argues for justifiably delayed accrual of these claims against respondents,because a limitations period should not start to run until the plaintiff is on notice of the facts constituting the separate injury.fox ethicon endo surgery,cal th,d,fox.
in the context of professional negligence cases that assert negligent misrepresentations,the reasonableness of the plaintiff alleged reliance on the representations may be treated as a question of fact.nevertheless,if the undisputed facts do not leave any room for reasonable differences of opinion,the question of when a plaintiff reasonably should have discovered facts for purposes of the accrual of a case of action or application of the delayed discovery rule should be decided as a matter of law,by evaluating the allegations in light of matters that are properly subject to judicial notice.broberg,supra,th,d see rita roman catholic archbishop d.fraudulent concealment allegations ineffective where plaintiff is otherwise on notice of potential claim.
face of fac and appellant arguments 
in light of the above principles,we evaluate the sequence of events alleged in the fac,and take into account the proposed amendment suggested in the reply brief,added allegations about respondents silence during the company internal investigations.blank kirwan,supra,cal d,subd.a.in any case,the gist of appellant liability theory has consistently been that respondents reports showed the company had no significant payroll tax liabilities,although in meetings and communications,respondents had learned something about such liabilities,but nevertheless they stood by silently in violation of their professional duties to disclose that knowledge.
appellant has several theories why his fac successfully alleges delayed discovery,in that he could not discover his
