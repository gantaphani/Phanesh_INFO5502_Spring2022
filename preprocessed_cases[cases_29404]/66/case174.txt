after a contested union election,the losers sued the winners under a variety of theories,including racketeering.all aspects of the suit eventually were resolved in defendants favor,because the plaintiffs could not prove what the complaint alleged.during discovery it became evident that many of the allegations were fanciful.one plaintiff,for example,contended that the successful candidate for president of the local union had intentionally inflicted emotional distress by threatening to fire her if he won.the evidence showed that,whatever she may have heard through the grapevine,he had not made such a threat after the election he kept her on with a raise.as a matter of state law,a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress also requires proof of some severe reaction,and this plaintiff offered none other than an asthma attack more than a year after the she had suffered from occasional asthma attacks for years.other claims were as weak,or worse.
as discovery continued and it became ever more evident that the complaint lacked a basis in fact,counsel for the defendants began to send letters demanding that particular claims be deleted from the complaint and withdrawn from the litigation.james gordon banks,who represented the plaintiffs,did not reply to any of these requests.when the case was over,defendants sought sanctions under on the theory that banks had vexatiously multiplied the proceedings,and under.on the theory that banks had failed to make a reasonable investigation before filing suit and had advocated the complaint long after it became clear that the allegations were unfounded.the district judge granted defendants motion for sanctions,see wl,dist.lexis,and asked defendants to delineate the attorneys fees incurred to defeat the suit.defendants collectively asked for some,but the judge thought this excessive and concluded that reasonable fees had been approximately,which he ordered banks to pay.wl,dist.lexis.
banks asked the judge to reduce this award,representing that his only assets are in cash,his watch,his clothing,and his wedding band.he does not carry malpractice insurance,because he has no significant assets to insure.defendants replied that banks has a legal education and thus a potential to earn enough to,the defendants observed,the reason banks does not own much is that the family home,cars,and savings all are in his wife name.with the odor of a fraudulent conveyance in the air,the district judge denied banks motion to reduce the award.
defendants contend that banks appeal is untimely.the decision sought to be reviewed was entered on august,and the notice of appeal was not filed until september,more than days later.but on august banks had filed a motion to reconsider,which the district court denied on august.the appeal was filed days later and is timely,if the motion suspends the decision finality under fed.a.the motion was filed within business days weekends are excluded from the count,see fed.a,so it was timely if it is on the list in rule a a.and that list includes both a motion to amend the judgment under.and a motion for relief under,if filed within ten business days.
what defendants say is that banks motion does not count,despite its caption it invoked both rule and rule,because it did not present a good argument.but rule a refers to types of motions effectively,to kinds of relief sought,not to whether the motion is well taken.see urso united states,cir.if a party had to present a good argument for relief,the rule might as well be rewritten to say that the time for appeal runs from the district court original decision,unless that decision is actually amended in response to a later motion.the actual rule,however,provides that the existence of a motion,and not the motion merit,is what suspends the time for appeal.no other approach is feasible.jurisdictional time limits must be ascertained mechanically.budinich becton dickinson,d.litigants,and a court of appeals,can ascertain in a mechanical fashion whether,and when,a particular motion has been filed.making appellate jurisdiction turn on the motion substance would introduce a quagmire into appellate practice.banks made a kind of motion that resets the clock for an appeal,and he filed the notice of appeal within days of the motion denial.the appeal is proper.
banks principal argument is that rule is not a pure statute,so ability to pay should be taken into account.this is true as far as it goes.a sanction imposed under this rule must be limited to what suffices to deter repetition of the conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated.c.the poorer the lawyer,the lower the sanction can be and still deter repetition by the lawyer or anyone similarly situated.leister dovetail,cir zazú designs,cir.a district judge therefore should take the sanctioned party resources into account when setting the amount of a rule sanction.see johnson chesterton,cir.but the district judge imposed sanctions under,a real law,as well as rule.an award under depends as an award under rule does not on a finding of bad faith.it is awfully hard to see why a lawyer who acted in bad faith should be let off lightly.banks brief essentially ignores,but that does not make it go away.
a violation of is a form of intentional tort.and there is no principle in tort law that damages depend on a tortfeasor assets.quite the contrary.damages depend on the victim loss,not the wrongdoer resources.a physician who injures a patient by an act of medical malpractice will be ordered to pay whatever injury the malpractice causes.the physician whether he holds his property in a relative not play any role in determining the amount of damages.so too if banks had walked up to dominic romanazzi,the principal defendant he beat shales in the election for president of local,and punched romanazzi in the mouth.the damages for battery would depend on romanazzi injury,not on banks wealth.likewise if banks has slandered romanazzi.instead of hitting romanazzi with a fist or an insult,banks hit him with a lawsuit.again damages depend on injury,once the judge concludes that the litigation was tortious.we speak here of compensatory rather than punitive damages in tort litigation the award under is compensatory,not punitive.
a physician only four years out of medical school does not get a discount on his malpractice judgments banks observation that he was only four years out of law school when he took this case does not give him a license to injure others by making unsupported assertions and clinging to them long after their falsity has been revealed.this would be plain enough if banks had injured his own client by malpractice the proposition is no different when he injures his client adversary.we therefore agree with hamilton boise cascade express,cir,that a lawyer ability to pay does not affect the appropriate award for a violation of.several cases in this circuit,of which fox valley construction workers pride of the fox masonry expert restorations,cir,is an example,assume that district judges may consider the lawyer wealth but hold that it is never necessary to do so.these decisions lump together analysis under rule and,apparently because the parties did the same.for reasons we have given,it is necessary to distinguish these two sources of authority.no case we could find in this circuit holds that consideration of the wrongdoer wealth is necessary under such a position would be outré if taken in a tort suit.
if banks can not meet all of his financial obligations,he may have them written down in bankruptcy.what banks effectively wants us to do is to give him some debt relief in a proceeding,but without the forms of that that would include the opportunity for assets to be brought into the estate in a action.instead of trying to administer debt relief one debt at a time,creating an odd and set of priorities,district judges should let the bankruptcy proceeding handle all debts and all creditors at one go,according to the bankruptcy governs not only which claims are paid first but also how much a debtor with a given level of income must pay to creditors in the aggregate,and over how much time.all a district court could do
