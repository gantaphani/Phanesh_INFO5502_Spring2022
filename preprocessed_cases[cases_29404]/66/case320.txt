discussion 
pending motions 
before discussing the merits of this appeal,we address two pending motions.the board has requested we strike pages through of the clerk transcript.cassidy has requested we take judicial notice of six documents attached to his request.
board pending motion to strike portions of the clerk transcript 
pages through of the clerk transcript appear to have been inserted as an attachment to cassidy designation of the record on appeal.cassidy identified these documents as aiot related entities tax returns,and aiot books records.he represented in his designation that these documents were exhibits that were admitted in evidence,refused,or lodged in the superior court,but had not been admitted into evidence.italics added.the board motion to strike is supported by the declaration of counsel stating that pages through were never admitted into evidence or otherwise considered by the administrative judge or the superior court in this matter.the board memorandum acknowledges that pages and of the clerk transcript appear in the administrative record at pages and.pages and of the clerk transcript are identical to pages and of the clerk transcript.no contrary evidence has been submitted.accordingly,the motion to strike is granted as to clerk transcript pages through.
in addition,it appears that pages through of the stricken portion of the clerk transcript comprise tax returns and financial information of aiot and its affiliates.the board motion includes an objection by aiot to these documents being placed in the public record,and stating that cassidy did not have permission to place them in the public record.we treat aiot objection as a motion to seal pages through and grant the motion.we make the following findings pursuant to california rules of court,rule d there exists an overriding interest that overcomes the right of public access to these documents in that these documents were not the subject of any adjudication in this case,were placed in the public record without aiot consent,and thus there is no right to public access to these private documents the overriding interest of aiot right of privacy and confidentiality to its tax and financial records supports sealing this portion of the record aiot right of privacy and confidentiality to its tax and financial records will be prejudiced if these documents are not sealed because confidentiality has been invaded by the disclosure of wholly irrelevant confidential information without aiot consent this sealing order is narrowly tailored in that this order seals no more than is necessary to protect aiot privacy and there is no less restrictive means to protect aiot confidential records.
cassidy motion for judicial notice 
cassidy has requested we take judicial notice of documents related to the board allegation that cassidy failed to comply with continuing education requirements and had misrepresented his compliance documents related to the board enforcement process documents related to the board budget documents related to an internal revenue service complaint against cassidy trial balance reports from aiot and aiot loan agreement with a bank.
the documents related to continuing education requirements are not relevant to this appeal because the administrative law judge found the board second and third causes of discipline regarding the alleged continuing education violations not to be true.thus,these allegations were not the subject of the writ of administrative mandamus in the trial court.the documents related to the board enforcement process and budget are irrelevant to the issues on appeal.we likewise perceive no relevance to the issues on appeal of the internal revenue service complaint.finally,the aiot documents are similarly irrelevant to any issue we must decide.cassidy has not demonstrated that these documents were presented or considered at the administrative hearing or in the superior court.accordingly,cassidy motion for judicial notice is denied.
scope and standard of appellate review of trial court denial of cassidy petition 
when considering a petition for a writ of administrative mandamus,a court whether a trial court in the first instance or an appellate court on appeal from the trial court decision considers the administrative agency findings and decision to determine whether they are supported by the evidence and may also consider whether the agency abused its discretion in imposing its penalty.cal.administrative hearing practice ed.

on appeal,cassidy in many respects misapprehends the scope of our review.in addition to the limitations discussed above,we do not consider matters raised for the first time on appeal,such as cassidy claims that the board disregarded public policy,violated his due process and free speech rights,and maliciously prosecuted him outside its subject matter jurisdiction,or that exhibits were improperly numbered.franz board of medical quality assurance cal d,to allow the issue to be raised here,when not presented before the trial court,would undermine orderly procedure on administrative mandamus.it has long been the general rule and understanding that an appeal reviews the correctness of a judgment as of the time of its rendition,upon a record of matters which were before the trial court for its consideration.in re th.the appellate court is confined in its review to the proceedings which took place in the court below and are brought up for review in a properly prepared record on appeal.citation.statements of alleged fact in the briefs on appeal which are not contained in the record and were never called to the attention of the trial court will be disregarded by this court on appeal.kendall barker d.we disregard assertions and arguments that lack record references duarte chino community hospital th,or lack citations to legal authority mccomber wells th.although cassidy is acting in propria persona,he must be treated like any other party and is entitled to the same,but no greater consideration than other litigants and attorneys.barton new united motor manufacturing,th.
admissibility of board certified history of cassidy cpa licensure 
at both the administrative and trial court proceedings,cassidy objected on hearsay grounds to the admission into evidence of the board certification of his cpa license history.the document,dated august,was certified by rafael ixta,chief of the board enforcement division,department of consumer affairs.ixta certified he shared in maintaining control and custody of files and records dealing with and pertaining to the duties and responsibilities of the board.ixta further certified that on august,he made or caused to be made a diligent search of the files and records concerning cassidy certification and license history.ixta further certified he determined that the official records prepared by board employees,acting within the scope of their duties,showed the dates and time periods listed on the certified license history for the issuance,expiration,periods of invalidity,and renewals of cassidy certificate of public accountancy.

substantial evidence supports the trial court findings 
although cassidy opening brief is not a model of clarity,we assume he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the trial court factual findings underlying the first and the fourth through eighth causes for discipline,particularly because the board addresses those issues in its respondent brief.
first and sixth causes for discipline 
in the first cause for discipline,the board alleged cassidy engaged in unprofessional conduct by practicing and holding himself out as a cpa without a valid license around september and of,october,and february.in the sixth cause for discipline,the board alleged cassidy engaged in unprofessional conduct,from at least september,by misrepresenting his status as a cpa to clients and misrepresenting to aiot that its federal tax return had been filed.
the board certified history of cassidy cpa licensure shows his license was expired,inter alia,during the period from august,to january,and from august,to at least august,the date of the certified history.therefore,his license was expired on and around september and of,october,and february.
