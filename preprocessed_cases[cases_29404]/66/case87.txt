earl vanterpool was prosecuted and convicted under ann.tit,section for obsessive phone calls and faxes to his,jacqueline webster.on appeal,we are asked to consider three issues whether section is unconstitutional under the first amendment whether vanterpool has shown that his trial counsel performance amounted to an ineffective assistance of counsel under the sixth amendment and whether there was sufficient evidence in the record to support vanterpool multiple convictions.
while we find that the first amendment challenge would have been viable had it been raised during trial,the plain error standard that we are obligated to apply in this case precludes any grant of the relief sought.by virtue of trial counsel failure to preserve the first amendment challenge,however,the prejudice prong of the strickland test is satisfied.because the record is insufficiently developed for us regarding whether trial counsel performance fell below professional norms,we shall remand and order that an evidentiary hearing be held to determine whether the performance of vanterpool trial counsel did indeed fall below the strickland standard.
facts and procedural history 
in may,jacqueline webster expressed a desire to end her relationship with earl vanterpool because vanterpool had become possessive and called her frequently.despite this issue,the two continued to be in contact with each other and did not officially end their relationship until november.
after the end of the relationship,vanterpool continued to make numerous calls to webster phone,and started sending her faxes.vanterpool would,at times,call webster as often as six or seven times an hour.app.webster informed vanterpool that she wanted him to stop communicating with her,to no avail.
following her unsuccessful attempts to stop vanterpool communications,webster went to the police station to file a report.at the police station,webster was assisted by sergeant boynes of the virgin islands police department.while webster was speaking with boynes at the station,vanterpool called her multiple times.during one such call,webster handed the phone to sergeant boynes,who informed vanterpool that he was not supposed to be calling webster and that if he continued to call her,he would be arrested.vanterpool continued to contact webster through both phone and fax.
as a result of his behavior,the government of the virgin islands government brought four charges against vanterpool one count of harassment by telephone occurring on or about january,in violation of ann.tit,and ann.tit,b one count of harassment by telephone occurring on or about december,in violation of ann.tit,and ann.tit,b one count of harassment by written communication occurring on or about january,in violation of ann.tit,and ann.tit,b and one count of harassment by written communication on or about december,in violation of ann.tit,and ann.tit,b.
vanterpool and webster both testified at the ensuing bench trial presided over by judge brenda heller of the superior court of the virgin islands.the superior court found vanterpool guilty on all four counts thereafter,vanterpool filed a timely appeal.the appellate division of the district court of the virgin islands district court,in a per curiam opinion,affirmed vanterpool convictions.vanterpool filed this timely appeal.
ii.jurisdiction 
the district court had jurisdiction under ann.tit,and this court has jurisdiction under and.c.
iii.analysis 
first amendment challenge 
vanterpool argues that section is unconstitutional under the first amendment of the constitution of the united states.section,in relevant parts,criminalizes the actions of anyone who with intent to harass or alarm another person communicates with a person,anonymously or otherwise,by telephone,or by telegraph,mail or any other form of written communication,in a manner likely to harass or alarm.ann.tit.it is uncontested that this constitutional challenge was not raised in the proceedings below,and therefore,the standard of review is plain error.see united states marcus.because this standard substantially limits the type of scrutiny that we may apply to vanterpool first amendment challenge,we now review the plain error standard in detail.
federal rule of criminal procedure b provides a court of appeals with a limited power to correct errors that were forfeited because they were not timely raised in district court.b plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.under this standard,an appellate court may,in its discretion,correct an error not raised at trial only where the appellant demonstrates that there is an error the error is clear or obvious,rather than subject to reasonable dispute the error affected the appellant substantial rights,which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings and the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states marcus,at.
the supreme court has elaborated upon the clear or obvious standard in the seminal case of united states olano.there,the court clarified that a court of appeals can not correct an error pursuant to rule b unless the error is clear under current law.id.at.applied to the present case,if the statute was unconstitutional,then the district court would have committed error when it applied the statute but even so,we could reverse only if the error were plain under current law.
while this court has not expressly commented on this issue,our sister circuits have denied relief when an appellant has raised a constitutional challenge to a statute for the first time on appeal.see,united states dedman,cir t he district court did not commit plain error in applying the arkansas marriage statute even assuming that the statute is unconstitutional.united states gore,cir e rror is plain if it is clear or obvious under current law or so egregious and obvious as to make the trial judge and prosecutor derelict in permitting it,despite the defendant failure to object.internal quotation marks omitted united states wright,cir it is fair to say that the facial unconstitutionality of the wiretap statute does not leap from the pages of the united states reports.the question is at least sufficiently close to take it out of the realm of plain error.we find these cases to be persuasive 
here,even if the virgin islands statute is unconstitutional,it was far from being clear under current law.see olano,at.from a review of reported cases,it appears that section had never been challenged before,let alone construed by a court at the time of vanterpool trial therefore,the plain error review standard does not permit us to reach the constitutional challenge 
ineffective assistance of counsel claim 
vanterpool argues that his trial lawyer performance fell below the standard of effective assistance in violation of the sixth amendment of the constitution of the united states.
we first discuss whether we will review the ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal,given that this court,in general,does not entertain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal.see,united states givan,cir.among the reasons that such a claim is not usually cognizable on direct appeal is the very important fact that there will not,in the typical case,exist a record developed enough to assess the efficacy of defense counsel.see united states jake,cir.
although we this court general practice,we find that the unique circumstances here warrant review on direct appeal.specifically,vanterpool is unlikely to meet the in custody requirement to bring a collateral habeas petition pursuant to a u.claim the supreme court has interpreted the statutory language under as requiring that the habeas petitioner be in custody under the conviction or sentence under attack at the time his petition is filed.maleng cook,emphasis added.here,vanterpool is no longer in custody within the meaning of the habeas statute.vanterpool was never incarcerated,as his sentence was suspended,and he presumably completed probation in.moreover,his restraining order was fully discharged when vanterpool completed his probation.the controlling virgin islands code provides that t he defendant liability for any fine or other punishment imposed as to which probation is granted,shall be fully discharged by the fulfillment of the terms and conditions of probation.ann.tit,a emphasis added.even if we construe an undated trial court restraining order as a permanent restraining order,such a punishment imposed as to which probation is granted was fully discharged when vanterpool completed his probation 
this leaves remand as the prudential route.it is worth noting here that our general aversion to entertaining a claim for ineffective assistance on direct appeal is to benefit from the trial court fact finding and protect the defendant from prematurely bringing the claim,thereby sparing him from having res judicata attach to the ineffective assistance claim.see united states cooke,cir this court reluctance to consider ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal stems,of course,from the fact that such claims are very unlikely to find any factual support in the trial record and an adverse determination on direct appeal will be res judicata in any subsequent collateral attack.
here,neither rationales apply a trial court fact finding is only available on direct appeal,and there is no risk of res judicata applying since collateral relief is unavailable.indeed,while this court has not spoken much on this subject,other circuits have recognized that restrictions on the defendant ability to seek habeas relief constitute grounds to review ineffectiveness claims on direct appeal.see,united states doe,cir aedpa restrictions on a prisoner ability to seek more than one federal habeas petition presented a significant reason not to dismiss ineffective assistance claims raised on direct review in favor of collateral attack under section.the inability of vanterpool to challenge his conviction on collateral attack is a matter of critical importance here.if an ineffective assistance claim is unavailable both on direct appeal and collateral attack,we are essentially eviscerating a constitutional right by a way of tolerating instances where an individual would get convicted under a presumably unconstitutional state statute,leaving him with no recourse.
we emphasize that we are not abandoning our typical practice of eschewing consideration of ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal.however,where,as here,a district court most probably would not have the opportunity to factfind on collateral attack,there is no principled reason to follow a discretionary procedure that we developed to ensure that factual records are developed before we review ineffective assistance claims.united states rashad,w e reject the government premise that our remand practice on direct appeal should be curtailed in order to give effect to the statutory restriction upon a defendant ability to launch a second collateral challenge to his conviction.united states leone,cir w e choose to exercise our discretion to remand to the district court for further rather than to dismiss the appeal and force the appellant to use up his only habeas petition.
therefore,we proceed to review the merits of vanterpool ineffective assistance of counsel claim.
right to counsel overview 
the sixth amendment recognizes the right to the assistance of counsel because it envisions counsel playing a role that is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results.see strickland washington.the supreme court has set forth a test for evaluating the claim that he was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.first,the defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.id.at see also hill lockhart.this inquiry is necessarily linked to the practice and expectations of the legal community.padilla kentucky.but a fair assessment of attorney performance requires us to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.strickland,at.
second,a defendant must prove prejudice.the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland,at.a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.that requires a substantial,not just conceivable,likelihood of a different result.see cullen pinholster,internal quotation marks omitted.this standard is not a stringent one.jermyn.horn,cir quoting baker barbo,cir.we examine the prejudice prong first,followed by the reasonableness prong 
of various theories offered by vanterpool,the theory that ineffective assistance resulted from his counsel failure to challenge the constitutionality of section deserves our scrutiny see appellant br.
the first amendment,applicable to the virgin islands through the organic act states that congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech const.amend.although the rights guaranteed by the first amendment are not absolute,as a general matter,the government may not limit or prohibit speech.see ashcroft free speech coalition,as a general principle,the first amendment bars the government from dictating what we see or read or speak or hear.
vanterpool makes three constitutional challenges to section under the first amendment.first,vanterpool argues that the statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to him.second,vanterpool argues that the statute was unconstitutionally vague on its face.finally,he argues that the statute was unconstitutionally overbroad.of these challenges,we only need to analyze the overbreadth challenge to show that there would have been a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different.
the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech forbid the states to punish the use of words or language not within narrowly limited classes of speech chaplinsky new hampshire.even as to such a class,however,because the line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated,suppressed,or punished is finely drawn,speiser randall,i n every case the power to regulate must be so exercised as not,in attaining a permissible end,unduly to infringe the protected freedom,cantwell connecticut.in other words,the statute must be carefully drawn or be authoritatively construed to punish only unprotected speech and not be susceptible to application to protected expression.because first amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive,government may regulate in the area only with narrow specificity.ass for advancement of colored people button.to prevail upon such a challenge,especially in a case involving conduct as well as speech,the overbreadth of the statute must not only be real,but substantial,in relation to the legitimate coverage of the statute.broadrick oklahoma.
the government points to our precedent in united states lampley to uphold the constitutionality of section.lampley,which involved a person charged under the federal telephone harassment statute,involved a bizarre tale of a romantic obsession involving a breakup and a launch of a telephonic assault unleashing a barrage of incessant and subsequently abusive telephone calls.united states lampley,cir.lampley asserted that the statute violated the first amendment because it failed to specify that the requisite ensuing conversation must contain harassing language.this court rejected such a claim,reasoning that the statute specific intent requirement rendered unconvincing lampley claim,since it has long been true that w here the punishment imposed is only for an act knowingly done with the purpose of doing that which the statute prohibits,the accused can not be said to suffer from lack of warning or knowledge that the act which he does is a violation of law.id.at quoting screws united states.
a close examination of the statutory language of section,along with the actual charges brought against vanterpool reveals,however,that lampley is distinguishable from this case.importantly,unlike the federal telephone harassment statute,the virgin islands statute seeks to regulate not only conduct associated w
