this case requires us to explore the parameters of the doctrine of immunity.the underlying litigation is a will contest turned conspiracy case.the plaintiff prevailed in probate court,but only after two and a half years of pretrial discovery and legal wrangling.all the while,the estate assets waned and the legal fees waxed.
in the end,the plaintiff,although found to be the sole lawful heir of the decedent,had little to show for his victory.seeking retribution,he sued a bevy of persons involved in the will contest.the central theme of his suit was the allegation of a conspiracy.
in a preliminary ruling,the district court found two of the defendants a lawyer who had served as a discovery master and the lawyer firm immune from suit by reason of immunity.the court certified this ruling as a partial final judgment.see.b.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
because this case was decided below on a motion to dismiss,we rehearse the facts as revealed by the complaint and the documents annexed thereto.katz pershing,llc,cir.
this imbroglio began with the death of evan nystedt in may of.soon thereafter,the decedent attorney and friend,earl munroe,offered a purported will for probate.the probate court provisionally appointed munroe as executor.see.laws ch,repealed.munroe neglected to provide the statutorily required notice to heirs,see id,and used his position as temporary executor to squander estate resources.
the decedent closest living relative was douglas nystedt,who eventually learned of the probate proceedings.he asserted his rights as heir at law and,in august of,initiated a will contest.
on december,the probate court appointed eugene nigro,a practicing lawyer,as a special master to monitor the discovery process and ensure full compl iance with reasonable discovery requests on a timely basis.the court authorized the special master to charge the parties,equally,his usual and customary hourly rates.see.civ.c.dom.rel.j.
the plaintiff alleges that the special master performance left much to be desired.he asserts that the special master failed to respond to several letters imploring him to schedule a discovery conference and compel munroe to honor discovery requests.he also asserts that the special master engaged in ex parte communications with munroe counsel,george lordan.he laments that,after eighteen months of service,the special master had only two depositions and one hundred pages of generally irrelevant documents to show for his efforts.
in may of,the plaintiff sought to oust the special master.the probate court rejected this entreaty.discovery continued until february of,when trial commenced.following the trial,the probate court,noting that munroe was both the preparer of the will and the person who stood to inherit from it,disallowed the will.the rejection of the will left the plaintiff as the decedent administrator and the sole beneficiary of the estate.laws ch,repealed.on appeal,the probate court decision was affirmed.see munroe nystedt,p,wl.
the plaintiff success was bittersweet.by the time that he prevailed and took control of the assets,the value of the estate had been greatly diminished.to make matters worse,he had spent over in waging the will contest.
having been left holding a nearly empty bag,the plaintiff,individually and in his capacity as administrator of the decedent estate,sued a phalanx of participants.these defendants included the special master and the law firm in which he was a partner,nigro,pettepit lucas,llp the firm.for ease in exposition,we refer to these two defendants,collectively,as the nigro defendants.
after his suit was docketed in the federal district court,the plaintiff twice amended his complaint.the operative pleading for present purposes the second amended complaint contains counts against nine defendants.
the claims against the nigro defendants are narrowly focused.the complaint posits that the special master delinquent performance of his duties prolonged the will contest and,thus,caused the value of the estate to plummet.the plaintiff frames this plaint as both a racketeering conspiracy charge under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,and a civil conspiracy charge under common law.in essence,he avers that the special master misdeeds furthered a conspiracy crafted by munroe and others.viewed from that coign of vantage,the dispatch of each of the invoices sent by the nigro defendants was intended to reap illicit benefits from the conspiracy.these mailings ostensibly amounted to instances of mail fraud,which served as predicate acts for the racketeering charge.see.the invoices and ex parte communications also allegedly abetted munroe unlawful conversion of estate assets.
the nigro defendants moved to dismiss the claims against them on the basis of immunity.b.the district court granted this motion by means of a docket entry because,in its view,all of the nigro defendants actions relate d to nigro work as a discovery master.the district court then certified its order of dismissal as a final judgment.see nystedt munroe,wl,citing.b.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
before us,the plaintiff challenges both the certification order and the order of dismissal.without the certification,we would lack jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.see see also feinstein resolution trust,cir.accordingly,we begin with the certification order and then mull the dismissal order.
a.the certification order.
when an action presents more than one claim for relief or when multiple parties are involved,the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more,but fewer than all,claims or parties.b.this procedure,though sometimes useful,is in obvious tension with the and prudential policy against the scattershot disposition of litigation.spiegel trs.of tufts,cir.it follows,then,that entry of judgment under the rule should not be indulged as a matter of routine or as a magnanimous accommodation to lawyers or litigants.id.rather,rule b should be applied sparingly and only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.b.
when contemplating rule b certification,a trial court first must ensure that the ruling underlying the proposed judgment is final.spiegel,at.such a determination embodies a judgment about a matter of law and,thus,engenders de novo review.gonz√°lez figueroa penney,cir.to qualify as final,a ruling must dispose completely either of all claims against a given defendant or of some discrete substantive claim or set of claims against the defendants generally.maldonado denis castillo rodriguez,cir.this requirement is plainly satisfied here the order granting the nigro defendants rule b motion to dismiss terminated all of the plaintiff claims against them.
the plaintiff attempts to parry this thrust.he argues that the dismissed claims against the nigro defendants were part of counts in which other defendants were also named.with this in mind,he insists that the district court order could not be final as the counts at issue remained in the case.
this argument exalts form over substance.a single count in a complaint may contain multiple claims and implicate multiple defendants.by its terms,rule b permits the entry of a final judgment as to one or more parties,without reference to the fact that the pleader may have organized such claim or claims within counts containing claims against other parties.see feinstein,at upholding rule b certification of an order dismissing claims against some,but not all,defendants named in a single rico count.
in addition to finality,rule b requires the trial court to make an express determination that there is no just reason for delay.we examine the district court evaluation of the equities inherent in this determination with a deferential eye.see spiegel,at.
in the case at hand,the district court focused on the importance of protecting the nigro defendants reputation in the legal community.nystedt,wl,at.the court noted that pending rico and conspiracy charges might well dissuade potential clients from using their services.id.to cinch matters,the court found nothing to suggest that the immediate entry of a partial final judgment would prejudice the rights of any party.id.
we discern no error.we think that the district court assessment of the equities is reasonable,and that rule b certification is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.we note,moreover,that the policy of the law favors the resolution of immunity defenses as early in a lawsuit as may be practicable.see,aqueduct sewer auth.metcalf eddy,d mitchell forsyth,d.this factor,too,counsels in favor of immediate appellate review.
b.the dismissal order.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that nigro,as a discovery master,was entitled to absolute immunity.we review this decision de novo.nisselson lernout,cir.in conducting that review,we accept as true all facts alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the pleader favor.santiago puerto rico,cir.
there is a wrinkle here that potentially affects our review.the plaintiff complaint contains both federal and state claims.where,as here,a federal court proceeds to adjudicate claims under supplemental jurisdiction,it is obliged to apply state substantive law to those claims.perry blum,cir.as a result,we must apply federal law to some claims and state law to others.here,however,this dichotomy is more apparent than real.there are only minute distinctions between the two bodies of immunity law,and no such distinction is implicated in this case.consequently,we rely interchangeably on federal and state precedents with respect to the scope of immunity.
the doctrine of immunity provides absolute immunity for those who perform tasks that are inextricably intertwined with the judicial function.cleavinger saxner,d coggeshall.bd.of regis.of psychologists,cir lalonde eissner.this doctrine is rooted in the wise idea that those who perform adjudicative functions require a full exemption from liability.butz economou,d.
discovery masters plainly perform judicial functions.under accepted massachusetts practice,they control the extent of discovery,including the scheduling and oversight of depositions and the time for completion of discovery,and they resolve any discovery disputes which may arise during the course of the litigation.dom.rel.j.during his performance of these duties,a master is functionally indistinguishable from a trial judge.accusoft palo,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.it follows inexorably,as night follows day,that discovery masters,acting in that capacity,share a judge immunity from suit.brown newberger,cir discussing acts of evaluators kermit constr.banco credito y ahorro ponceno,cir discussing acts of receiver.this immunity makes perfect sense in its absence,discovery masters would become lightning rod s for harassing litigation aimed at judicial orders.kermit,at.
the plaintiff acknowledges the general proposition that a discovery master may be entitled to immunity.to avoid this dead end,however,he tries to invoke two recognized exceptions to the general proposition.the first of these exceptions relates to acts,see,antoine byers anderson,d cok cosentino,cir the second relates to acts,which,though judicial in nature,are taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction,mireles waco,d.we examine these claims separately.
the plaintiff argues that the nigro defendants transmittal of invoices and the special master ex parte communications with lordan are acts sufficient to trigger the first exception.this argument rests on a misapprehension of the exception.
judicial acts are those that are intimately associated with the judicial function.burns reed,d internal quotation marks omitted.for this purpose,the judicial function has been defined as the adjudication of disputes between parties.antoine,at.nigro performance of his duties as a discovery master falls comfortably within this sphere.this includes the sending of invoices for services rendered and the alleged ex parte communications acts that were intimately associated with the adjudication of discovery disputes.
as to the invoices,they were sent in furtherance of the probate court direction about how the special master should be paid and were an unremarkable vehicle for securing that compensation.as to the communications,the plaintiff has not alleged nor does the record in any way suggest that they pertain to anything other than nigro work as a discovery master.indeed,the probate court denied the motion to remove the special master,which was based on the same allegations of ex parte communications.there is no reason to look behind that ruling.in any event,a mere claim of ex parte contact,alleged to be in violation of.sup.jud,canon b,does not,without more,establish that the nature of the communication was not inextricably intertwined with the judicial function.the fact that a discovery master performs a judicial function in an imperfect or even unethical way does not,by itself,dissolve his immunity.see cok,at holding that allegations of malice,bad faith,or conspiracy will not circumvent absolute immunity.
as a fallback position,the plaintiff avers that sending an invoice is an administrative,rather than a judicial act.this averment suggests a false dichotomy.the administrative character of an act might make a difference if the act was not intimately associated with the performance of core judicial functions.see,forrester white,d holding discriminatory dismissal of court employee to be a act.here,however,the administrative act of sending invoices was integrally related to nigro work as a discovery master and,therefore,the immunity attaches to the act.new eng.cleaning,am.arbit.ass n,cir holding that administrative tasks associated with processing a party demand are arbitral acts for purposes of arbitral immunity.
the plaintiff attempt to invoke the second exception for actions taken in the absence of all jurisdiction is equally unavailing.he bases this argument on a number of perceived procedural glitches,including the fact that the record does not indicate any special reasons sufficient to justify the appointment of a discovery master pursuant to former.prob.amended the fact that nigro neither lived nor maintained an office in the county in which the probate court sat,as required by that rule the fact that the special master billings were in excess of the billings permitted by that rule the fact that the appointment was not temporally limited,as required by former.prob.amended and the fact that the special master ex parte communications with lordan were unethical.
we need not address these allegations item by item.even if procedural irregularities of this sort existed,they would not strip nigro of his jurisdiction to act as a discovery master the supreme court has squarely held that absolute judicial immunity is ineffaceable even in the presence of grave procedural errors.stump sparkman,d see also bradley fisher,wall.distinguishing the validity of the act from the question of whether judicial immunity attaches new eng.cleaning,at similar.the errors here if errors at all were not grave and,in all events,fall within the prophylaxis afforded by stump.
if more were needed and we doubt that it is there is an even more basic defect in the plaintiff absence of jurisdiction argument.his claims amount to nothing more than claims of error that could,and should,have been addressed in the will contest itself.after all,w ere collateral and retrospective attacks on technical defects of court appointments permitted,the court work in an already difficult litigation field would often be undone,with consequent uncertainty,delay,and frustration.brown,at.the plaintiff could,for example,have brought the alleged procedural flaws to the attention of the probate court and,if that court denied relief,could have raised the points on appeal.after all,one of the primary purposes of judicial immunity is to establish appellate procedures as the standard system for correcting judicial error.forrester,at.
here,too,the plaintiff has a fallback position.he strives to persuade us that the special master acted in the complete absence of jurisdiction because his failure to respond to the plaintiff letters anent discovery orders constituted an abandonment of his office and
