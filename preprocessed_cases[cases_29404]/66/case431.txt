in an underlying criminal matter,david malcolm,a former member of the board of commissioners board of the san diego unified port district port district,pleaded guilty to violating section while on the board.we hold here that as a matter of public policy,malcolm may not maintain this legal malpractice action against the port district under a respondeat superior theory,and its former counsel,david chapman,based on chapman advice to malcolm that allegedly caused malcolm damages arising from the criminal matter.as there is no triable issue of material fact requiring trial,the port district and chapman are entitled to summary judgment.accordingly,we grant the petition.
factual and procedural background 
in january malcolm was appointed to the board.
in november the port district,san diego gas and electric sdg e and duke energy power services duke entered into a memorandum of understanding mou under which the port district would purchase sdg e south bay power plant,located in chula vista on property under the port district jurisdiction,for million.further,under the mou duke would lease and operate the plant for years at a rent of at least million and pay the costs of decommissioning the plant at the end of the lease term.in december the board authorized the port district acquisition of the south bay power plant by approving several agreements with sdg e and duke.
chapman was the port district legal counsel at the relevant time.after execution of the mou,malcolm told chapman he thought the south bay power plant deal could be replicated around the country,and he planned to enter into a personal business relationship with duke.malcolm also told chapman he wanted to retain jeffrey heintz,an attorney who assisted the port district in acquiring the south bay power plant.chapman advised malcolm he had no problem with malcolm use of heintz,and when malcolm made a deal with duke he must abstain from voting on any port district issue involving duke and disclose any income from duke on his conflict of interest forms.chapman did not tell malcolm about section,that he was not providing malcolm with legal advice,that malcolm should consult another attorney,or that chapman needed any further information or to see any contract malcolm entered into with duke.
in january,after speaking with chapman,malcolm formed a company called public benefit power pbp with the purpose of entering into transactions with duke and communities that wanted to decommission aging power plants.malcolm,who was one of pbp three owners,sought to acquire the land on which power plants were situated and make a profit by selling or developing the land after the plants were decommissioned.
in april malcolm told chapman he and duke had entered into a written contract to attempt to acquire a power plant.thereafter,malcolm recused himself from any port district votes concerning duke.
in may,however,the arrangement changed from one of looking for business opportunities with duke to one of consulting.duke and pbp entered into a written contract requiring duke to pay pbp per month for malcolm services concerning modernization plans for the south bay power plant and similar generating facilities throughout the country,and a bonus of percent on any funding malcolm secured on duke behalf for the construction of a modernized plant in the south bay.
the contract noted malcolm has substantial experience and knowledge with respect to political and local issues relevant to duke electric generating facility known as the south bay plant,and to similar generating facilities throughout the united states.additionally,the contract contained a conflict of interest clause that prohibited malcolm from advising,counseling or otherwise assisting any competitor or potential competitor of duke,including the port district.
malcolm informed chapman about the new arrangement with duke and that he would be earning a number.chapman again told malcolm he was required to divulge payments from duke and abstain from voting on any port district matter involving duke.
beginning in july,malcolm advised duke it could benefit from the expansion of an existing enterprise zone to include the south bay power plant malcolm wrote to duke that w ith soaring utility costs in san diego,the environment to construct new facilities has never been better.everyone is saying the only way to lower the utility bills is to build new facilities.with the present outrage over utility bills,it seems duke would be well served to bring additional focus to the south bay plant.malcolm also solicited political support for this endeavor from officials in san diego and chula vista.
in a november,memorandum from the port district executive director,dennis bouey,to the board,he advised that the city of chula vista and bf goodrich have asked the port district to financially support their efforts to expand the san mesa enterprise zone including acres of port district tidelands.this enterprise zone expires in january,unless the legislature amends the current law.the issue is whether the port district should contribute over the next years when development of the former bf goodrich and pond port district tenants properties may not occur soon enough to take full advantage of the enterprise zone tax benefits.bouey noted the south bay power plant would be in the expanded enterprise zone,and businesses within it are eligible for substantial tax credits and benefits that directly affect a business tax liability.the city of chula vista sought the to share in the cost of hiring one additional employee to manage the expanded area of the enterprise zone.
a proposed mou with the city of chula vista regarding the port district provision of funds for the expansion of the enterprise zone was on the agenda for the board december,meeting.the board approved an mou,and the minutes note malcolm was excused from the vote.
on december,chapman wrote a memorandum to the board regarding the contract between duke and pbp,which had been revealed to some commissioners in conjunction with a third party lawsuit against malcolm.the memorandum was marked privileged and confidential as an communication.chapman wrote i have previously advised you that i was aware of no facts which suggested that commissioner malcolm business arrangement with duke violated any law,specifically including any conflict of interest law governing the conduct of port district commissioners.having now seen the consulting agreement,that remains my view.the law does not prohibit conflicts of interest rather,the law requires that certain interests be disclosed and that a public official not participate in matters where he or she may have a conflict of interest.without question,the consulting agreement gives rise to a conflict of interest for commissioner malcolm in matters involving the port district and duke.to the best of my knowledge,in recognition of that conflict of interest,commissioner malcolm has met his legal obligation to abstain from any port district matters involving or affecting duke.
the san diego obtained a copy of chapman memorandum,and in a december,article it revealed the contract between duke and pbp.the article stated that a t the height of the energy crisis,port commissioner david malcolm was being paid a month by duke under a contract that required him to put the power company interests ahead of all others,including those of the port district,and c ritics say malcolm breached the public trust and should resign from the port commission.the following month,malcolm resigned from the board.
in the spring of malcolm learned the san diego county district attorney district attorney was contemplating multiple charges against him,including attempted perjury,two section violations and misappropriation of funds,and that a grand jury investigation was underway.malcolm negotiated a deal with the district attorney in which he would plead guilty to one count of violating section,a felony,in exchange for its agreement to not pursue other charges.
on april,the district attorney charged malcolm with violating section by becoming financially interested in the contract between the port district and city of chula vista to expand the enterprise zone.the same date,malcolm pleaded guilty to the charge and the parties stipulated the plea would resolve all pending district attorney investigations.malcolm plea states on may,i became a party to a consulting contract with duke thereafter,on december,an item expanding the enterprise zone,that could benefit duke,came before the commission.although i did not vote on the project,under government code section i had a financial interest and therefore abstention was not enough and i should have resigned my position as a port commissioner.the court sentenced malcolm to three years of probation and days of work furlough,imposed a fine under government code section and a fine under penal code section,subdivision b and ordered him to pay the district attorney in restitution.
in september malcolm sued chapman and the port district for legal malpractice the complaint alleges chapman wrongfully failed to advise malcolm of section and that his arrangement with duke required him to resign from the board rather than merely disclose income from duke and abstain from voting on port district matters involving duke.malcolm seeks to recover damages resulting from his criminal prosecution,such as lost business opportunities,attorney fees and emotional distress damages.
the port district and chapman moved for summary judgment,arguing chapman had no relationship with malcolm as a matter of law,and in any event,maintenance of the cause of action violates public policy,as section is intended to protect public agencies from officeholders.in a tentative ruling the court denied the motion,explaining the cases addressing the issue of whether an relationship is created between a public entity officer and the public entity attorney,when advice is sought and given,are confusing and difficult to reconcile.the court found underlying triable issues of fact regarding whether chapman and malcolm had an relationship.the court rejected the public policy argument,finding the public should be able to trust that its public attorney would provide proper legal advice so as to avoid the scandal as well as the expense of a criminal prosecution.these are issues of fact and may be more appropriate as argument at trial.defendants have not cited any authority that holds that this public policy bars plaintiff claim as a matter of law.after oral argument,the court affirmed its tentative ruling.
discussion 
istandard of review 
a party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.a defendant satisfies this burden by showing one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.ibid.if the defendant meets his or her initial burden,the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his or her own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.ibid.
de novo review is used to determine whether,as a matter of law,summary judgment was appropriately granted.camarillo vaage th,d.we strictly construe the moving party affidavits and liberally construe the opposing party affidavits.fraizer velkura th,d.we accept as undisputed facts only those portions of the moving party evidence that are not contradicted by the opposing party evidence in other words,the facts alleged in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment and the reasonable inferences therefrom must be accepted as true.citation.ibid.
malcolm demurs to the petition on the ground it does not sufficiently set forth the undisputed facts supporting summary judgment in favor of the port district and chapman.code civ,cal.rules of court,rule h.a proceeding in mandamus is generally subject to the general rules of pleading applicable to civil actions.gong city of fremont d,citing code civ.therefore,it is necessary for the petition to allege specific facts showing entitlement to relief if such facts are not alleged,the petition is subject to general demurrer citation or the court is justified in denying the petition out of hand.gong city of fremont,supra,at.
the port district and chapman concede the absence of a traditional statement of facts in the petition.they contend the petition incorporation of the parties separate statements of undisputed facts and hundreds of pages of accompanying exhibits satisfied their obligation.that is,of course,incorrect.the reviewing court is not required to make an independent,unassisted study of the record in search of error or grounds to support the judgment.it is entitled to the assistance of counsel.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.
we nonetheless overrule the demurrer.in their first reply to malcolm response to the petition,the port district and chapman set forth the specific facts of the case,and despite an inadequate rendition of undisputed facts in the petition malcolm was able to file two briefs fully addressing the issues.
relationship 
the port district and chapman contend that as a matter of law a public agency counsel and an agency board member can not have an relationship.they rely on ward superior court d,in which the court held there was no relationship between counsel for the county of los angeles and the county assessor,and thus counsel was not disqualified from representing a county board member and county employees in litigation against them by the assessor.the court found the undisputed evidence showed that any legal advice counsel gave the assessor arose from his obligation to advise county officers in matters pertaining to their duties,and counsel only client was the county.id.at.see also civil service com.superior court d.this court noted the general proposition that a public attorney advising of a constituent public agency does not give rise to an relationship separate and distinct from the attorney relationship to the overall governmental entity of which the agency is a part.
malcolm counters that there are underlying factual issues regarding the existence of an relationship.the determination of an existence of an relationship is one of law.however where there is a conflict in the evidence the factual basis for the determination must first be determined,and it is for the trial court to evaluate the evidence.citation.citation.ward superior court,supra,d at.
malcolm relies on chapman deposition testimony that the port district expected him to be available to individual commissioners to give them assistance in addressing,among other things,conflict of interest issues.further,malcolm presented evidence that chapman encouraged commissioners to come to him with any conflict of interest questions.in a july,memorandum,chapman provided commissioners with copies of the political reform act for insertion in the conflict of interest binders i provided to you some time ago.chapman stated that w hile the act may be a helpful resource,i encourage you to contact me with any specific questions you may have.chapman also wrote,s ituations involving conflicts of interest will arise from time to time,and each commission member should feel free to consult this memorandum and should also contact the port attorney office for a thorough analysis of any given situation.in a december,memorandum,chapman briefly discussed section and asked commissioners to contact him with any specific questions on that statute.
in a declaration,malcolm stated he approached chapman numerous times with various conflict of interest issues,and chapman regularly provided advice to him.when malcolm asked chapman about the duke situation,chapman told him that once a relationship was formed he mu
