the narrow question we must decide is whether texas law recognizes a claim by parents for either battery or negligence because their premature infant,born alive but in distress at only weeks of gestation,was provided resuscitative medical treatment by physicians at a hospital without parental consent.the court of appeals,with one justice dissenting,held that neither claim could be maintained as a matter of law because parents have no right to refuse medical treatment for their child unless the child condition is certifiably terminal under the natural death act now the advance directives act and here it is undisputed that the millers infant was not certifiably terminal.
although we agree with the court of appeals judgment,our reasoning differs somewhat.first,there is no dispute in the evidence that the millers premature infant could not be fully evaluated for medical treatment until birth.as a result,any decisions concerning treatment for the millers child would not be fully informed decisions until birth.second,the evidence further established that once the infant was born,the physician attending the birth was faced with emergent,the child might survive with treatment but would likely die if treatment was not provided before either parental consent or a court order overriding the withholding of such consent could be obtained.
we hold that circumstances like these provide an exception to the general rule imposing liability on a physician for treating a child without consent.that exception eliminates the millers claim for battery.we further conclude that the millers negligence not on any physician negligence in treating the infant but on the hospital policies,or lack thereof,permitting a physician to treat their infant without parental as a matter of law for the same reasons.we accordingly affirm the court of appeals judgment.
the unfortunate circumstances of this case began in august,when approximately four months before her due date,karla miller was admitted to woman hospital of texas the hospital in premature labor.an ultrasound revealed that karla fetus weighed about grams or pounds and had a gestational age of approximately weeks.because of the fetus prematurity,karla physicians began administering a drug designed to stop labor.
karla physicians subsequently discovered that karla had an infection that could endanger her life and require them to induce delivery.mark jacobs,karla obstetrician,and donald kelley,a neonatologist at the hospital,informed karla and her husband,mark miller,that if they had to induce delivery,the infant had little chance of being born alive.the physicians also informed the millers that if the infant was born alive,it would most probably suffer severe impairments,including cerebral palsy,brain hemorrhaging,blindness,lung disease,pulmonary infections,and mental retardation.mark testified at trial that the physicians told him they had never had such a premature infant live and that anything they did to sustain the infant life would be guesswork.
after their discussion,jacobs and kelley asked the millers to decide whether physicians should treat the infant upon birth if they were forced to induce delivery.at approximately noon that day,the millers informed jacob and kelley that they wanted no heroic measures performed on the infant and they wanted nature to take its course.mark testified that he understood heroic measures to mean performing resuscitation,chest massage,and using life support machines.kelley recorded the millers request in karla medical notes,and jacobs informed the medical staff at the hospital that no neonatologist would be needed at delivery.mark then left the hospital to make funeral arrangements for the infant.
in the meantime,the nursing staff informed other hospital personnel of jacobs instruction that no neonatologist would be present in the delivery room when the millers infant was born.an afternoon of meetings involving hospital administrators and physicians followed.between approximately and that day,anna summerfield,the director of the hospital neonatal intensive care unit,and several physicians,including jacobs,met with mark upon his return to the hospital to further discuss the situation.mark testified that summerfield announced at the meeting that the hospital had a policy requiring resuscitation of any baby who was born weighing over grams.although summerfield agreed that she said that,the only written hospital policy produced described the natural death act and did not mention resuscitating infants over grams.
moreover,the physicians at the meeting testified that they and hospital administrators agreed only that a neonatologist would be present to evaluate the millers infant at birth and decide whether to resuscitate based on the infant condition at that time.as jacobs testified 
w hat we finally decided that everyone wanted to do was to not make the call prior to the time we actually saw the baby.deliver the baby,because you see there was this question is the baby really weeks,or is the baby further along,how big is the baby,what are we dealing with.we decided to let the neonatologist make the call by looking directly at the baby at birth.
another physician who attended the meeting agreed,testifying that to deny any attempts at resuscitation without seeing the infant condition would be inappropriate and below the standard of care.
although eduardo otero,the neonatologist present in the delivery room when sidney was born,did not attend that meeting,he confirmed that he needed to actually see sidney before deciding what treatment,if any,would be appropriate 
can you tell us from a worst case scenario to a best case scenario,what type of possibilities you seen in your own personal practice 
well,the worst case scenario is the baby comes out and it dead,it has no heart rate or you have babies that actually go through a rocky start then cruise through the rest and go home.and they may have small handicaps or they may have some problems disabilities or something like that,but in general,all babies are normal children or fairly normal children.
and is there any way that you could have made a prediction,at the time of sidney birth,where she would fall in that range of different options 
is there any way that you can make that decision,as to whether the newborn infant will be viable or not in a case such as sidney,before the time of delivery,an assessment at the time of delivery 
mark testified that,after the meeting,hospital administrators asked him to sign a consent form allowing resuscitation according to the hospital plan,but he refused.mark further testified that when he asked how he could prevent resuscitation,hospital administrators told him that he could do so by removing karla from the hospital,which was not a viable option given her condition.jacobs then noted in karla medical charts that a plan for evaluating the infant upon her birth was discussed at that afternoon meeting.
that evening,karla condition worsened and her amniotic sac broke.jacobs determined that he would have to augment labor so that the infant would be delivered before further complications to karla health developed.jacobs accordingly stopped administering the drug to karla that was designed to stop labor,substituting instead a drug designed to augment labor.at that night,karla delivered a premature female infant weighing grams,which the millers named sidney.sidney actual gestational age was and weeks.and she was born alive.
otero noted that sidney had a heart beat,albeit at a rate below that normally found in babies.he further noted that sidney,although blue in color and limp,gasped for air,spontaneously cried,and grimaced.otero also noted that sidney displayed no dysmorphic features other than being premature.he immediately bagged and intubated sidney to oxygenate her blood he then placed her on ventilation.he explained why 
because this baby is alive and this is a baby that has a reasonable chance of living.and again,this is a baby that is not necessarily going to have problems later on.there are babies that survive at this gestational age this birth weight,that later on go on and do well.
neither karla nor mark objected at the time to the treatment provided.
sidney initially responded well to the treatment,as reflected by her apgar scores.an apgar score records five different components of a infant respiratory effort,heart rate,reflex activity,color,and muscle tone each component gets a score of zero,one,or two,with a score of two representing the best condition sidney total apgar score improved from a three at one minute after birth to a six at five minutes after birth.but at some point during the first few days after birth,sidney suffered a brain complication not uncommon in infants born so prematurely.
there was conflicting testimony about whether sidney hemorrhage occurred because of the treatment provided or in spite of it.regardless of the cause,as predicted by karla physicians,the hemorrhage caused sidney to suffer severe physical and mental impairments.at the time of trial,sidney was seven years old and could not walk,talk,feed herself,or sit up on her own.the evidence demonstrated that sidney was legally blind,suffered from severe mental retardation,cerebral palsy,seizures,and spastic quadriparesis in her limbs.she could not be and required a shunt in her brain to drain fluids that accumulate there and needed care hours a day.the evidence further demonstrated that her circumstances will not change.
the millers sued hca,corporation of america,hospital corporation of america,and healthcare corporation collectively,hca,and the hospital,a subsidiary of hca.they did not sue any physicians,including otero,the physician that actually treated sidney.instead,the millers asserted battery and negligence claims only against hca and the hospital.
the millers claims stemmed from their allegations that despite their instructions to the contrary,the hospital not only resuscitated sidney but performed experimental procedures and administered experimental drugs,without which,in all reasonable medical probability,sidney would not have survived.the millers also alleged that the hospital acts omissions were performed with hca full knowledge and consent.although the millers did not sue otero,they alleged that he and other hospital personnel were the hospital apparent or ostensible agents.
the millers alleged that the hospital,hca,and hospital corporation of america were alter egos of or business conduits created and maintained for impermissible purposes by corporation of america.the millers further alleged that the hospital,hca,and hospital corporation of america integrated their resources to achieve a common business enterprise.thus,the millers asserted that the hca defendants were jointly and severally liable.the trial court granted hca motion for a separate trial from the hospital and then,at the millers request,tried the millers claims against hca first.
though the hospital was not a party at the trial against hca,the trial court submitted questions to the jury about the hospital conduct.the jury found that the hospital,without the consent of karla or mark miller,performed resuscitative treatment on sidney.the jury also found that the hospital and hca negligence proximately caused the occurrence in question.the jury concluded that hca and the hospital were grossly negligent and that the hospital acted with malice.the jury also determined that otero acted as the hospital agent in resuscitating sidney and that hca was responsible for the hospital conduct under alter ego and single business enterprise theories.the trial court rendered judgment jointly and severally against the hca defendants on the jury verdict of in actual damages for medical expenses,in prejudgment interest,and in exemplary damages.
hca appealed.the court of appeals,with one justice dissenting,reversed and rendered judgment that the millers take nothing.the court concluded that the texas legislature allowed parents to withhold medical treatment,urgently needed or not,for a child whose medical condition is certifiably terminal under the natural death act but the court held that the legislature had not extended that right to parents of children with impairments,deformities,or disabilities,regardless of their severity 
the court acknowledged that the natural death act did not impair or supersede any legal right a person may have to withhold or withdraw treatment in a lawful manner.but the court noted that the parties had not cited,and the court did not find,any authority allowing a parent to withhold medical treatment from a ill child.thus,the court concluded that,to the extent an infant condition is not certified as terminal,a health care provider is under no duty to follow a parent instruction to withhold medical treatment 
the court noted that when or medical treatment is proposed for a child,a court order is needed to override a parent refusal to consent to the treatment because a determination of such issues as the child safety,welfare,and best interest can vary under differing circumstances and alternatives but the court held that when the need for medical treatment is or becomes urgent while a ill child is under a health care provider care,and when the child parents refuse consent to treatment,a court order is unnecessary to override that refusal according to the court,no legal or factual issue exists to decide about providing such treatment because a court can not decide between impaired life versus no life at all 
given this backdrop,the court concluded that the millers had no right to deny the medical treatment given to sidney and that no court order was necessary to overcome their refusal to consent thus,the court sustained hca contentions that it did not owe the millers a tort duty to a refrain from resuscitating sidney b have no policy requiring resuscitation of patients like sidney without consent and c have policies prohibiting resuscitation of patients like sidney without consent 
the dissenting justice disagreed that no court order was necessary to override the millers refusal to consent according to the dissent,a court must decide the most important issue what is in the best interest of the child the dissent concluded that a court decision in favor of resuscitation would afford the physician and the hospital the consent necessary to treat sidney the dissent further concluded that the natural death act was not mandatory and the millers were not required to seek a directive under the act the dissent would have affirmed the trial court judgment 
we granted the millers petition for review to consider this important and difficult matter.in addition to briefing from the parties,we received several amici briefs,some supporting the millers position and some supporting hca position.
ii.analysis 
this case requires us to determine the respective roles that parents and healthcare providers play in deciding whether to treat an infant who is born alive but in distress and is so premature that,despite advancements in neonatal intensive care,has a largely uncertain prognosis.although the parties have cited numerous constitutional provisions,statutes,and cases,we conclude that neither the texas legislature nor our case law has addressed this specific situation.we accordingly begin our analysis by focusing on what the existing case law and statutes do address.
generally speaking,the custody,care,and nurture of an infant resides in the first instance with the parents as the united states supreme court has acknowledged,parents are presumed to be the appropriate for their infants 
our jurisprudence historically has reflected western civilization concepts of the family as a unit with broad parental authority over minor children.our cases have consistently followed that course our constitutional system long ago rejected any notion that a child is the mere creature of the state and,on the contrary,asserted that parents generally have the right,coupled with the high duty,to recognize and prepare their children for additional obligations.surely,this includes a high duty to recognize symptoms of illness and to seek and follow medical advice.the law concept of the family rests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity,experience,and capacity for judgment required for making life difficult decisions.more important,historically it has recognized that natural bonds of affection lead parents to act in the best interests of their children 
the texas legislature has likewise recognized that parents are presumed to be appropriate,giving parents the right to consent to their infant medical care and surgical treatment a logical corollary of that right,as the court of appeals here recognized,is that parents have the right not to consent to certain medical care for their infant,parents have the right to refuse certain medical care 
of course,this broad grant of parental authority is not without limits.the state role as parens patriae permits it to intercede in parental under certain circumstances.as the united states supreme court has noted 
a s persons unable to protect themselves,infants fall under the parens patriae power of the state.in the exercise of this authority,the state not only punishes parents whose conduct has amounted to abuse or neglect of their children but may also supervene parental decisions before they become operative to ensure that the choices made are not so detrimental to a child interests as to amount to neglect and abuse 
but the supreme court has also pointed out 
a s long as parents choose from professionally accepted treatment options the choice is rarely reviewed in court and even less frequently supervened.the courts have exercised their authority to appoint a guardian for a child when the parents are not capable of participating in the decisionmaking or when they have made decisions that evidence substantial lack of concern for the child interests 
the texas legislature has acknowledged the limitations on parental.for example,the legislature has provided in the family code that the rights and duties of parents are subject to modification by court order and texas courts have recognized their authority to enter orders,under appropriate circumstances,appointing a temporary managing conservator who may consent to medical treatment refused by a child parents 
with respect to consent,the requirement that permission be obtained before providing medical treatment is based on the patient right to receive information adequate for him or her to exercise an informed decision to accept or refuse the treatment thus,the general rule in texas is that a physician who provides treatment without consent commits a battery but there are exceptions.for example,in gravis physicians surgeons hospital,this court acknowledged that consent will be implied where the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to give express consent and an immediate operation is necessary to preserve life or health.
in moss rishworth,the court held that a physician commits a legal wrong by operating on a minor without parental consent when there is an absolute necessity for a prompt operation,but not emergent in the sense that death would likely result immediately upon the failure to perform it.but the court in moss expressly noted that it was not contended there that any real danger would have resulted to the child had time been taken to consult the parent with reference to the operation.moss therefore implicitly acknowledges that a physician does not commit a legal wrong by operating on a minor without consent when the operation is performed under emergent,when death is likely to result immediately upon the failure to perform it 
moss guides us here.we hold that a physician,who is confronted with emergent circumstances and provides treatment to a minor child,is not liable for not first obtaining consent from the parents.the millers cite to texas family code section texas health safety code section and texas revised civil statutes article,section a as illustrating that implied consent does not arise from an emergency context when a healthcare provider has actual notice of lack of consent.because these statutes apply when a parent is not present to consent,the millers suggest that this must mean that emergency services can not be provided when the parents refuse consent.but that is not so.
providing treatment to a child under emergent circumstances does not imply consent to treatment despite actual notice of refusal to consent.rather,it is an exception to the general rule that a physician commits a battery by providing medical treatment without consent.as such,the exception is narrowly circumscribed and arises only in emergent circumstances when there is no time to consult the parents or seek court intervention if the parents withhold consent before death is likely to result to the child.though in situations of this character,the physician should attempt to secure parental consent if possible,the physician will not be liable under a battery or negligence theory solely for proceeding with the treatment absent consent 
we recognize that the restatement second of torts provides that an individual is not liable for providing emergency treatment without consent if that individual has no reason to believe that the other,if he or she had the opportunity to consent,would decline but that requirement is inapplicable here because,as we have discussed,the emergent circumstances exception does not imply consent.
further,the emergent circumstances exception acknowledges that the harm from failing to treat outweighs any harm threatened by the proposed treatment because the harm from failing to provide treatment under emergent circumstances is death.and as we acknowledged in nelson krusen,albeit in the different context of a wrongful life claim,it is impossible for the courts to calculate the relative benefits of an impaired life versus no life at all 
following these guiding principles,we now determine whether the millers can maintain their battery and negligence claims against hca.the jury found that the hospital,through otero,treated sidney without the millers consent.the parties do not challenge that finding.thus,we only address whether the hospital was required to seek court intervention to overturn the lack of parental it undisputedly did not otero could treat sidney without committing a battery.
the millers acknowledge that numerous physicians at trial agreed that,absent an emergency situation,the proper course of action is court intervention when health care providers disagree with parents refusal to consent to a child treatment.and the millers contend that,as a matter of law,no emergency existed that would excuse the hospital treatment of sidney without their consent or a court order overriding their refusal to consent.the millers point out that before sidney birth,jacobs and kelley discussed with them the possibility that sidney might suffer from the numerous physical and mental infirmities that did,in fact,afflict her.and some eleven hours before sidney birth,the millers indicated that they did not want any heroic measures performed on sidney.the millers note that these factors prompted the dissenting justice in the court of appeals to conclude that a nytime a group of doctors and a hospital administration ha ve the luxury of multiple meetings to change the original doctors medical opinions,without taking a more obvious course of action,there is no medical emergency.
we agree that a physician can not create emergent circumstances from his or her own delay or inaction and escape liability for proceeding without consent.but the millers reasoning fails to recognize that,in this case,the evidence established that sidney could only be properly evaluated when she was born.any decision the millers made before sidney birth concerning her treatment at or after her birth would necessarily be based on speculation.therefore,we reject the millers argument that a decision could adequately be made that denying all resuscitative treatment would be in sidney best interest.such a decision could not control whether the circumstances facing otero were emergent because it would not have been a fully informed one according to the evidence in this case.
the millers point out that physicians routinely ask parents to make treatment choices for their infants including whether to accept or refuse in utero medical treatment and to continue or terminate a
