this lawsuit arises from separate incidents of sexual assault allegedly committed by scott dodd anderson,anderson,against two patients,paula moe and edelmira moe paula and edelmira,along with their husbands robert and richard,respectively,sued anderson and two corporations alleged to be his employer,healthworks,and healthworks medical group,healthworks,for medical malpractice,battery,sexual battery,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and loss of consortium.defendants demurred,arguing that plaintiffs were improperly joined under code of civil procedure section the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend and dismissed the lawsuit.plaintiffs appeal.
as we explain,the trial court was correct with respect to plaintiffs claims against anderson.two separate and distinct sets of plaintiffs,paula and robert,and edelmira and richard sued anderson for separate and distinct sexual assaults during separate and distinct time periods.because their claims do not arise out of the same transaction,occurrence,or related series of transactions or occurrences,joinder was improper under section.and because plaintiffs have not demonstrated a possibility of correcting the defect through amendment,the trial court properly sustained anderson demurrer without leave to amend.however,the same is not true with respect to healthworks.plaintiffs claims against healthworks are predicated upon the direct negligence of healthworks in hiring and supervising anderson.because these claims arise out of the same series of transactions or occurrences,the hiring and supervision of anderson,joinder was proper under section.accordingly,we shall affirm the judgment dismissing plaintiffs lawsuit against anderson and reverse the judgment dismissing plaintiffs lawsuit against healthworks.
background 
in accordance with the standard of review,we recite the facts as they are alleged in the complaint.see department of corporations superior court th,fn.standard of review for a ruling on a demurrer requires that we assume that the complaint properly pleaded material allegations are true.
in,paula and edelmira were treated by anderson in connection with separate workers compensation claims.during paula visits,in may,anderson made suggestive and sexual advances toward her without her consent and against her will,including touching her breasts and vagina.during edelmira visits,between july and september,anderson made suggestive and sexual advances toward her without her consent and against her will,including touching her breasts,vagina,and buttocks.anderson also penetrated edelmira vagina with a foreign object and engaged in oral copulation,sexual intercourse,and sodomy with her,all without her consent and against her will,and by means of force,violence,duress,menace and fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury.
on july,paula and edelmira sued anderson and healthworks for medical malpractice,battery,sexual battery,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.with respect to healthworks,plaintiffs alleged that anderson tortious conduct was committed within the scope of his employment,and that healthworks either knew or should have known that anderson was the subject of allegations charging him with sexual assault and battery upon former patients at the time anderson was hired.thus,healthworks was negligent,careless,reckless and unlawful in the manner in which they selected,hired,trained,supervised,employed and counseled anderson so as to proximately cause each of plaintiffs injuries and damages.moreover,healthworks was given express notice of anderson medical malpractice and sexual battery upon paula prior to entering into a relationship with edelmira.
on september,paula and edelmira filed an amended complaint joining their husbands,robert and richard,respectively,as plaintiffs.this complaint asserted the four causes of action mentioned above and a fifth cause of action brought by robert and richard for loss of consortium.
on october,anderson filed a demurrer to the amended complaint,arguing that plaintiffs were improperly joined.relying on coleman twin coast newspaper,d coleman,anderson argued that because he was alleged to have assaulted paula and edelmira in different ways and on different occasions,the causes of action brought on behalf of paula and robert are distinct from and based on different conduct and different transactions than the causes of action brought on behalf of edelmira and richard.therefore,the two sets of plaintiffs do not share a common interest in the subject matter of the action or a right to relief arising out of the same transaction or series of transactions.healthworks joined in anderson demurrer.
on april,plaintiffs filed an opposition to the demurrer,arguing that paula and edelmira did share a common interest in the subject matter of the action and asserted a right to relief arising out of the same series of transactions.specifically,plaintiffs noted that paula and edelmira were referred by their employer to the same medical facility in connection with injuries and saw anderson on several occasions.anderson gradually won their trust,but then began to make sexual advances,ultimately assaulting each of them.plaintiffs also noted that healthworks was being sued for negligent hiring and supervision of anderson,which allowed him to sexually assault female patients,culminating in the actual rape of edelmira.relying on anaya superior court d anaya,plaintiffs argued that because paula and edelmira were subjected to the same harmful conditions at one location,i,the predatory conduct of anderson,they shared a common interest in the subject matter of the action and asserted a right to relief arising out of the same series of transactions.
on may,the trial court held a hearing on the demurrer.addressing a tentative ruling issued by the trial court in which the court explained that joinder was improper because anderson assaults on paula and edelmira were separate and distinct occurrences,plaintiffs argued that joinder was proper because they sued healthworks in addition to anderson.however,plaintiffs also stated that if anderson was the only defendant,they would agree with the trial court that joinder was not proper.anderson countered that simply naming the employer does not change the determination that these two occurrences are entirely distinct events.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.citing coleman,supra,d at page,the trial court stated the assaults were not the same and did not occur at the same time.although the conduct of defendant was similar,these were not the same events.joinder is proper when the right to relief arises out of the same transaction or occurrence.the conduct alleged here does not arise out of the same transaction or occurrence.the causes of action alleged by each plaintiff are separate and distinct from the other.the trial court further stated it is obvious from the face of the complaint that the defect can not be cured.therefore,the demurrer is sustained without leave to amend.this ruling is without prejudice to plaintiffs to file new and separate complaints.
on may,plaintiffs sought to overturn the trial court ruling by way of writ petition,which was summarily denied.on june,judgment was entered in favor of anderson.judgment was entered in favor of healthworks on july.plaintiffs appeal from both judgments.
