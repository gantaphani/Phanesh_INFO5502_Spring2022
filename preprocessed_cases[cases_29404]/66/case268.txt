in this action,floyd wesley owens,a deputy sheriff and lawyer,appeals the district court denial of qualified immunity in connection with the search of keith and kim eidsons real property.we conclude that while owens obtained the eidsons consent to search their property in violation of the fourth amendment,the illegality was not clearly established.we also conclude that owens did not extract a confession from kim eidson in violation of the fifth amendment.owens is,therefore,entitled to qualified immunity.accordingly,we reverse and remand with instructions for the district court to enter summary judgment in owens favor on the eidsons constitutional claims.we also conclude that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court denial of summary judgment on the eidsons legal malpractice claim.therefore,we dismiss this appeal insofar as it involves that claim.
background 
at the times relevant to this appeal,owens was a practicing attorney and a deputy sheriff in wagoner county,oklahoma.in april,owens drafted the eidsons will.months later,on august,owens participated in a search of the eidsons farm.the following is the eidsons account of the day events leading up to the search and of the search itself.
kim eidson saw owens wife at an auction and told her about an altercation she kim had just had with the mother of her son girlfriend.owens wife relayed the information to owens,who put on his uniform and went to the eidsons farm in a marked vehicle to check on kim.there,owens met kim at a closed gate to the driveway,about yards away from the house,and asked if she was okay.aplt.app.at.
four other deputies soon arrived.one of those deputies,mark krenek,took owens aside and told him that he had received information that the eidsons were growing marijuana on their farm.kim overheard owens being told that her son jordan had informed the authorities that marijuana was growing on the property.id.at.in fact,krenek had received that information from the mother and grandmother of jordan girlfriend.krenek directed owens to seek kim consent for a search of the farm.owens returned to kim and said,d o lie to me,kim.jordan has turned you in.id.at.kim confessed that she ha d some plants back there.id.at some point,keith eidson arrived on the scene and was told that jordan had turned them in.id.at.he asked owens what would happen if they did not consent.id.at.owens responded,if it takes three days,we hold you here for three days while the other deputies obtain a warrant.id.at.owens also stated,i f you make them get a warrant the judge would go harder on you in court and you would be considered uncooperative.id.at see also id.at.keith and kim each signed a consent form.
the eidsons led the deputies down the driveway to their house and a search began.deputies discovered marijuana plants growing in the eidsons flower garden,bags of marijuana inside the eidsons house,and drug paraphernalia located throughout the house and the eidsons vehicles.deputy krenek kim on the back porch of the eidsons residence,and she responded,i f you have any questions,ask owens,he my lawyer.id.at.afterward,owens transported the eidsons to the jail and told them that he could not be their lawyer.
the eidsons were charged in state court with unlawfully cultivating marijuana,possessing marijuana with intent to distribute,and possessing drug paraphernalia.ultimately,the evidence against the eidsons was suppressed and the criminal case dismissed.
in,the eidsons filed in federal district court a suit against owens and wagoner county.the eidsons alleged violations of the fourth,fifth,sixth,and fourteenth amendments to the united states constitution,and they advanced claims of legal malpractice,infliction of emotional distress,and false arrest.the only claims that survived summary judgment were their fourth and fifth amendment claims against owens and their malpractice claim against owens.in withholding summary judgment on the constitutional claims,the district court stated that it could not decide whether owens had qualified immunity because there was a factual dispute as to when owens told the eidsons he was not their lawyer.specifically,owens maintained that during the search of the eidsons property he repeatedly told them he was not their lawyer,whereas the eidsons maintained that owens did not disavow his lawyer status until they were being driven to the jail.the district court denied summary judgment on the malpractice claim for the same disputed factual issues remained as to when owens said he was not the eidsons lawyer.
owens appeals.the eidsons have not filed an appellees brief,but they have filed a brief on the issue of appellate jurisdiction,arguing that this appeal can not proceed because there are disputed factual issues.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
we first address our jurisdiction to consider this appeal.an order denying summary judgment is ordinarily not appealable.see powell mikulecky,cir.but under the collateral order doctrine,a district court denial of a claim of qualified immunity,to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,is an appealable final decision within the meaning of notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.mitchell forsyth,d.this jurisdiction is limited,though,to appeals challenging not which facts the parties might be able to prove,but,rather,whether or not certain given facts showed a violation of clearly established law.johnson jones,d quotation omitted.
while the district court found that it could not render a ruling because of a factual dispute,that finding is not jurisdictionally dispositive on appeal given that owens argues that immunity applies even under the eidsons version of the facts.see farmer perrill,cir noting that appellate jurisdiction exists if the defendant does not dispute the plaintiff facts or if the defendant is willing to concede the most favorable view of the facts to the plaintiff for purposes of the appeal quotation omitted.consequently,we have jurisdiction to consider whether owens has qualified immunity from the eidsons fourth and fifth amendment claims.
qualified immunity does not,however,apply to the eidsons malpractice claim.see jenkins city of new york,cir stating that qualified immunity protects an official from liability under federal causes of action but is not generally understood to protect officials from claims based on state law.owens requests that this claim be considered on appeal under the doctrine of pendent appellate jurisdiction.this doctrine is generally disfavored,applying only when the otherwise nonappealable decision is inextricably intertwined with the appealable decision or when review of the nonappealable decision is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the appealable one.kirkland vrain valley sch,cir quotation omitted.we conclude that neither situation applies here.whether owens breached a duty to the eidsons of loyalty and confidentiality,thereby committing malpractice,aplt.app.at amended complaint,is independent of the constitutional claims and is an issue better suited for resolution in the district court.accordingly,we dismiss this appeal insofar as it challenges the district court denial of summary judgment in regard to the eidsons malpractice claim.
ii.qualified immunity 
the doctrine of qualified immunity shields government officials performing discretionary functions from liability for damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.boles neet,cir quotation omitted.we review de novo a district court decision to deny a motion that asserts qualified immunity.id.summary judgment is warranted if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
our review is sequential.first,we must consider whether the plaintiff factual allegations show that the official conduct violated a constitutional right.if the assumed facts do not establish a constitutional violation,the defendant is entitled to summ
