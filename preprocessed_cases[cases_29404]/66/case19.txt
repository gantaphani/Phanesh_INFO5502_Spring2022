this is an appeal by marisol and her husband josé rafael from a decision granting summary judgment to javier and his insurer seguros,in a medical malpractice action brought under article of the puerto rico civil code,laws ann.tit.we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs as the parties.statchen palmer,cir.
in early,a woman then resident in puerto rico with a personal and family history of thyroid cancer,felt a lesion in her left parotid gland,which is one of the salivary glands.her treating physician,josé arsuaga,referred her to hato rey pathology associates hrpa to undergo a fine needle aspiration biopsy of her left parotid gland.rodríguez,a physician at hrpa,performed the biopsy on march and issued a cytology report on march.
rodríguez report provided a pathologic diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma,which is a benign tumor of the salivary glands.that rodríguez failure to conduct a differential diagnosis is the basis of this suit.differential diagnosis is a standard technique for the determination of which of two or more diseases with similar symptoms is the one from which the patient is suffering,by a systematic comparison and contrasting of the clinical findings.stedman medical dictionary ed see also baker dalkon shield claimants trust,cir.
arsuaga told of rodríguez diagnosis on march,and recommended surgical removal of the standard treatment for pleomorphic said that there was no urgency.later scheduled a consultation with thomas shellenberger,a head and neck surgical oncologist at the anderson cancer center in orlando,florida,and requested her biopsy slides from hrpa to take to shellenberger.under hrpa policy,this request required a review of the slides by another hrpa physician.
víctor,one of rodríguez colleagues at hrpa,reviewed slides and diagnosis.carlo conducted a differential diagnosis,included mucoepidermoid malignant one of the possibilities,and therefore conducted a mucicarmine stain which rodríguez had not done to check for mucin,indicating mucoepidermoid carcinoma.carlo produced an amended cytology report that changed pathologic diagnosis from pleomorphic adenoma to low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
on july,picked up the slides and carlo amended cytology report with the revised diagnosis of a malignant tumor.she alleges that when she read carlo report,realized rodríguez report was not correct,and learned she had cancer,she and her husband were shocked and their lives fell apart.now mistrusting puerto rico physicians,they resorted at great expense to health care in the continental united states,which their health insurer refused to cover.
on august,shellenberger successfully operated on,surgically removing the malignant tumor.the attendant pathology confirmed the revised diagnosis of a malignant tumor.within the year,on august,and her husband brought this malpractice action in federal district court in puerto rico against rodríguez and his medical insurer.having become residents of florida,they premised jurisdiction on diversity.their claim was that rodríguez had been negligent in failing to conduct a differential diagnosis.
during discovery,rodríguez stated that he had not conducted a differential diagnosis because the evidence that he discerned in studying the biopsy slide and described in his report specifically,myxoid stroma,epithelioid cells,and plasmacytoid cells persuaded him that suffered from a benign tumor,making unnecessary any differential diagnosis.the defendants thereafter moved for summary judgment.their supporting evidence went considerably beyond rodríguez explanation.
the defense offered by expert witness report and deposition testimony that the treatment for pleomorphic can become low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma are the same that had received the appropriate treatment in sufficient time that an orlando specialist had in july reviewed the same slides and made no diagnosis of malignancy and that no definitive diagnosis could be made until surgery.
in opposition,offered no expert testimony on the standard of care.she relied primarily on the failure of rodríguez to conduct a differential diagnosis and thus to consider low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma as an alternative to pleomorphic adenoma on carlo use of the technique and the mucicarmine stain test in an attempt to exclude this alternative and on carlo correct diagnosis and its confirmation after surgery.made no claim of physical harm from the delay in surgery but did claim emotional distress and increased expenses due to her concern about medical care in puerto rico.
on september,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment,ruling that the plaintiffs could not establish a prima facie claim of medical malpractice under article because they had not offered expert evidence establishing the relevant standard of care.the plaintiffs now appeal.our review is de novo.great clips,hair cuttery of greater,cir.
this being a diversity suit,the substantive law of puerto rico governs.erie tompkins.under puerto rico law,the applicable rule of decision in a medical malpractice action is,quality health servs.of,cir article provides in pertinent part that a person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.laws ann.tit.
to show medical malpractice,a plaintiff must establish that the care afforded did not meet the professional requirements generally acknowledged by the medical profession.santiago otero méndez,see also,cir listing the elements.this,in turn,a lmost invariably requires the plaintiff to introduce expert testimony.mennonite,cir.under puerto rico law,to make out a prima facie case of physician negligence 
plaintiff must establish,through expert evidence,the degree of care and scientific knowledge required by the profession in the treatment of a specific type of patient.

despite such broad statements,the jury own common sense could occasionally close the gap and establish that the care afforded did not meet minimal standards.see municipality of san juan,cir offering examples of possible exceptions keeton et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts,at ed same.and the expert evidence,if required,might come not from the plaintiff expert but rather from,say,the defense expert or admissions by the defendant doctor.see chizmadia smiley point clinic,cir.the present case,however,fits neither of these possible exceptions.
differential diagnosis is a standard tool,but as to what symptoms and in what conditions a differential diagnosis is required for proper medical care,no lay jury would be likely to know on its own,at.the fact that carlo conducted a differential diagnosis in this case,and that its application led to the correct diagnosis,does not show that failing to use it was negligent.there is no indication that carlo or another physician testifying as an expert was prepared to say otherwise.
in the present case,counsel for was asked at oral argument why no expert was presented for the plaintiffs he answered,quite plausibly,that he made every effort to find one but was unsuccessful.this hardly disproves the plaintiffs claim doctors,especially in tightknit communities,may be hesitant to accuse each other pathology is a specialized field which could further narrow the supply of experts and although experts can usually be found somewhere at some price,the lack of physical injury here likely limited what the plaintiffs could promise to pay.
plaintiffs counsel made an admirable effort to do his own medical research.he cited both in the district court and on this appeal a study in a medical periodical for the proposition that low grade carcinoma is one of the differential diagnoses of pleomorphic adenoma yet he has not argued directly that this article,standing by itself,would allow the jury to conclude that every pleomorphic adenoma requires for proper medical treatment a differential diagnosis or the mucicarmine stain test.
we think that the implicit concession is warranted.the article is highly to understand much of the terminology would require a medical dictionary and probably some
