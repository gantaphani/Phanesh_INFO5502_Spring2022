madlyn liebsack suffered from a schizoaffective disorder that was treated,in part,with lithium.in,she had a heart attack due to an elevated level of lithium in her bloodstream and was left in a permanent vegetative state.her guardian,edward liebsack,sued the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca,asserting that federal healthcare providers negligently failed to monitor madlyn lithium levels.the government primary defense at the ensuing bench trial was that the fault lay with another,nonfederal healthcare provider.specifically,the government argued that the fault lay with cindy jones,an advanced nurse practitioner who was responsible for liebsack psychiatric care.the district court found that nurse jones was at fault for liebsack injuries,that the united states was at fault,and that liebsack home was at fault.the court then awarded liebsack of her past and future medical expenses.
liebsack appeals both the liability and damages rulings,and the government on damages.liebsack central argument on liability is that none of the government evidence about nurse jones conformed with an alaska statute requiring specialized expert testimony in medical malpractice actions.because we conclude that this evidence should not have been admitted,we reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial.we address the on damages in a separate memorandum disposition filed concurrently with this opinion and,on those issues,affirm the district court.
in the period leading up to the heart attack,liebsack was living at the lakeview assisted living facility.nurse jones,her treating psychiatric provider,worked at the anchorage community mental health center acmhc,a facility.on october,lakeview staff took liebsack to acmhc after noticing and jerky movements.nurse jones saw liebsack and considered a variety of potential causes for the symptoms,one of which was an elevated level of lithium.nurse jones ordered several blood tests,including one for lithium.she also referred liebsack to her treating physician,madeleine grant,t o see if there was any other metabolic issues or neurological issues going on at the time.the referral to grant was not for the purpose of assessing lithium toxicity because that was nurse jones area of expertise.grant worked at the anchorage neighborhood health center,a healthcare provider the government health center.
liebsack had her blood drawn at the government health center on october.for disputed reasons,the government lab did not run the lithium test.liebsack then saw grant on october.grant was unsure why liebsack was scheduled for a visit and liebsack was unable to tell her.grant surmised that the visit may have been a to a recent visit for respiratory illness and eye complaints.grant confirmed that these issues had been resolved,and also reviewed the results from the recent lab work which did not include a lithium test.grant had not received a written referral or phone call from nurse jones,though liebsack did tell grant that jones wanted to talk to her.grant did not think she needed to call nurse jones because she did not consider liebsack to be a reliable source of information in light of her mental illness.grant and other witnesses also testified that efforts to learn liebsack medical history beyond the records available at the government clinic were generally futile.
liebsack then saw nurse jones for a visit on october.jones confirmed that liebsack had had her blood drawn and had seen grant.jones also noted that liebsack was no longer showing symptoms of jerky movements thus,jones was no longer concerned about potential lithium toxicity.she never sought to confirm the results of the lithium test she had ordered.on november,liebsack suffered a heart attack,which led to this lawsuit.
liebsack brother and guardian,edward liebsack,brought suit in state court against several defendants,including acmhc,the lakeview assisted living facility,and the united states the united states then removed the action to federal court,and all other parties eventually settled.at the ensuing bench trial,liebsack argued that her injuries were due to the negligence of the government lab,for failing to run the lithium test and grant,for failing to determine the reason for liebsack october visit.the government argued that all of the fault lay with nurse jones,for failing to follow through on her lithium toxicity concerns and lakeview,for failing to relay their concerns about liebsack health to grant.
the district court found that nurse jones,lakeview,and the government lab were all negligent,but that grant was not.it apportioned fault as follows nurse jones lakeview government lab grant.with respect to nurse jones,the court held that she had failed to follow up on the laboratory request,failed to seek further testing,and failed to contact grant regarding her concerns.the court also noted that it had been over eight months since madlyn last lithium test,far longer than appropriated sic for one in madlyn condition.given madlyn history and symptomology,testing should have been more frequent.the court then ordered the government to pay damages and of liebsack past and future medical expenses.liebsack filed this timely appeal,and the government.we have jurisdiction under.
a district court finding of negligence is reviewed for clear error.vollendorff united states,cir.the existence and extent of the standard of conduct are questions of law,reviewable de novo,but issues of breach and proximate cause are questions of fact,reviewable for clear error.id.
liebsack contends that the district court finding regarding nurse jones negligence was erroneous because the government did not present an expert qualified under alaska statute that provision mandates that i n an action based on professional negligence,a person may not testify as an expert witness on the issue of the appropriate standard of care unless the witness is licensed by a state or another country trained and experienced in the same discipline or school of practice as the defendant or in an area directly related to a matter at issue and certified by a board recognized by the state as having acknowledged expertise and training directly related to the particular field or matter at issue.the government contends that does not apply to this action and that,even if it did,there was still sufficient evidence to sustain the district court ruling we agree with liebsack that applies to this action and that none of the testimony regarding nurse jones conformed with that provision.
