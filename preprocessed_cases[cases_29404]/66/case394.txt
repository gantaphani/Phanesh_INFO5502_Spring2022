in wiley county of san diego cal th,d,wiley,the california supreme court held that when a former criminal defendant sues his or her attorney for legal malpractice criminal malpractice,the former client actual innocence of the underlying criminal charge is a necessary element of the plaintiff cause of action.id.at,d.
in coscia mckenna cuneo cal th,d,coscia,the california supreme court reaffirmed wiley,supra,cal th,d,and then held that the client innocence must be shown by postconviction exoneration in the form of a final judicial disposition of the criminal case.coscia,supra,at,d.coscia also reaffirmed prior case law holding that the limitations period begins to run,subject to tolling,on the date the attorney committed an act or omission amounting to professional would necessarily occur during the attorney representation of the client.id.at,d.acknowledging that the statute of limitations on the legal malpractice action will in most cases expire before the client can obtain postconviction relief from the criminal conviction,coscia concluded the client should file the civil complaint within the limitations period,and the trial court should stay the malpractice case while the client diligently pursues postconviction relief in the criminal case.id.at,d.
for reasons that follow,we conclude that coscia is subject to the general and prevailing rule that judicial decisions are applied retroactively.the general rule that judicial decisions are given retroactive effect is basic in our legal tradition.brennan tremco,cal th,d,quoting newman emerson radio cal d.
in this legal malpractice case against plaintiff former criminal defense lawyer,plaintiff pete rose appeals from a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend,in favor of defendant harry hudson.the demurrer was sustained on the ground the complaint was by code of civil procedure section rose contends the limitations period was applied pursuant to coscia,supra,cal th,d,and argues the case should be applied prospectively,and he should be allowed a reasonable time to satisfy the limitations period.because we disagree that coscia should be applied prospectively only,we shall affirm the judgment of dismissal.
background 
rose complaint,filed on september,alleged a single cause of action for legal malpractice in hudson legal representation of rose in a criminal case wherein rose was convicted in november the conviction was vacated in october.
thus,the complaint alleged hudson,an attorney,negligently caused damage by acts or omissions in or about from december,through and including april.the complaint alleged 
in or about december,hudson was appointed by the county of san joaquin to represent rose who was arrested and charged with various criminal offenses including kidnap and rape of a year old girl.
defendant hudson represented rose so negligently and below the applicable standard that rose,although innocent of all charges,was convicted in november,and spent ten years in county jail and state prison until his conviction was vacated on october,and he was released.an order of exoneration declaring rose factually innocent was issued on february.
as a direct and proximate result of hudson negligence,rose was injured and suffered damages,including,but not limited to,deprivation of liberty,loss of earnings,mental and emotional distress,and deprivation of contact with his children.
hudson demurred to the complaint on the ground the complaint filed almost years after the criminal conviction was by both the and alternative limitations periods of section fn,ante.hudson argued the actual injury element of malpractice occurred when rose was convicted in november.hudson argued that matters of which the court could take judicial notice demonstrated that rose was indisputably aware of the alleged malpractice no later than november,when he filed an appellate brief claiming ineffective assistance of counsel on multiple grounds even factoring in the maximum tolling for incarceration,and even assuming the limitations period applied,the complaint should have been filed no later than november,and the september filing was too late.hudson argued a malpractice cause of action accrues upon the date of conviction,and pursuant to coscia,supra,cal th,d,the statute of limitations is not tolled while the criminal defendant seeks postconviction relief.
in opposition,rose argued he had no cause of action until his innocence was established,and coscia is either inapposite or wrongly decided.
the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,citing section and coscia,supra,cal th,d.
rose appeals from the ensuing judgment of dismissal.

standard of review 
this appeal from a judgment of dismissal following the trial court sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend presents questions of law,which we review de novo.walker allstate indem.th,d.
ii.the complaint was untimely 
rose argues coscia,supra,cal th,d,adversely affected his right to file his legal malpractice action by changing both the elements of the cause of action and the limitations period.therefore,argues rose,due process and sound public policy dictate that coscia new rule be applied prospectively and that rose be allowed a reasonable time to satisfy the limitations period.rose contends this reasonable time should run from the timely pursuit of the first postconviction remedies available to him after coscia,including remedies based on new scientific and technological advances.as we shall explain,rose argument is without merit.
the criminal defendant in coscia the client pled guilty in december,in federal court,to one felony count of conspiracy to violate federal securities laws.coscia,supra,cal th at,d.in march,he was sentenced to two years probation.in march,he filed a legal malpractice action against his lawyer and her law firm,alleging he was injured by her negligent advice.the lawyer demurred on the grounds of the statute of limitations and collateral estoppel.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend on the ground that the criminal conviction precluded relief in the malpractice case under the principles of collateral estoppel.ibid.
in the intermediate appellate court,the client sought to amend the complaint to allege he entered into the plea agreement despite his innocence of the criminal charges,and he accepted the plea in reliance on his lawyer advice that it would be futile to ask the prosecutor to agree to a misdemeanor plea in exchange for information the client had about other ongoing securities fraud.coscia,supra,cal th at,d.the intermediate appellate court held the client should be allowed to amend the complaint,and making exoneration a prerequisite to the malpractice action would render most criminal malpractice actions untimely under the limitations period.id.at,d.
the california supreme court held,contrary to the court of appeal,that exoneration by postconviction relief is a prerequisite to recovery for legal malpractice arising out of a criminal proceeding,even where a plea made collateral estoppel inapplicable though remand was appropriate to allow the client to plead innocence and seek a stay of proceedings pending pursuit of postconviction remedies.coscia,supra,cal th at,d.coscia explained as follows 
the elements of a legal malpractice action arising from a criminal proceeding are proof of actual innocence the attorney duty to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as members of the profession commonly possess and exercise breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the lawyer negligence.coscia,supra,cal th at,d.p ublic policy considerations require that only an innocent person wrongly convicted be deemed to have suffered a legally compensable harm.unless a person convicted of a criminal offense is successful in obtaining postconviction relief,public policy preclude s recovery in a legal malpractice action.id.at,d.the requirement of exoneration by postconviction relief is firmly grounded in the unique constitutional and statutory guarantees provided to criminal defendants unlike in the civil litigation area,a client does not come before the criminal justice system under the care of his counsel alone he comes with a full panoply of rights,powers,and privileges.these rights and privileges not only protect the client from abuses of the system but are designed to protect the client from a deficient representative.thus,whereas in a civil matter a case once lost is lost forever,in a criminal matter a defendant is entitled to a second chance perhaps even a third or fourth chance to insure that an injustice has not been committed.id.at,d.
coscia,supra,cal th,d,concluded,a plaintiff must obtain postconviction relief in the form of a final disposition of the underlying criminal example,by acquittal after retrial,reversal on appeal with directions to dismiss the charges,reversal followed by the people refusal to continue the prosecution,or a grant of habeas corpus a prerequisite to proving actual innocence in a malpractice action against former criminal defense counsel.coscia,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.
coscia next consider ed the effect of the foregoing requirement of exoneration by postconviction relief upon the application of the relevant statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions arising from criminal proceedings.id.at,d.the supreme court noted the court of appeal in coscia case declined to impose an exoneration requirement because in most cases the malpractice statute of limitations will expire before the convicted individual obtains postconviction relief id.at,d.coscia said the example of the practice in other jurisdictions,however,reveals that the requirement of postconviction relief,as a prerequisite to proving legal malpractice arising out of a criminal proceeding,need not result in a technical forfeiture of legitimate malpractice claims.ibid.coscia observed that some jurisdictions have held that the limitations period does not commence until the plaintiff has obtained postconviction relief,because the cause of action does not accrue for limitations purposes until that time.ibid.other jurisdictions have adopted a approach.id.at,d.they reject as mere legal fiction the rule that a wrongly convicted criminal defendant suffers no cognizable harm,and the malpractice claim does not accrue,until he or she has obtained appellate relief.ibid.to avoid the statute of limitations problem,the client might be required to initiate the malpractice suit prior to resolution of all postconviction proceedings,in which case the trial court should,upon motion of either party,stay the malpractice suit pending the client diligent effort to obtain resolution of postconviction remedies.id.at,d.
coscia,supra,cal th,d,chose the approach.coscia said the jurisdictions that rely on the legal fiction are inconsistent with the california supreme court previous decisions addressing the subject of accrual and actual injury under section,subdivision a,including jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,d.this statute provides that the limitations period begins to run,subject to tolling,on the date the attorney committed an act or omission amounting to professional negligence.an action for attorney malpractice shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first.citation.the wrongful act or omission giving rise to a criminal malpractice action necessarily occurred during the course of the attorney representation of the at some time thereafter,when the client obtained postconviction relief.with regard to tolling,the california supreme court decline d to adopt the legal fiction that an innocent person convicted of a crime suffered no actual injury until he or she was exonerated through postconviction relief a criminal its attendant financial and social ramifications,incarceration,probation,fines,or other damaging constitute appreciable harm,or actual injury within the meaning of section.coscia,supra,cal th at,d.the policy of protecting parties from having to defend stale claims is of particular concern in the criminal malpractice context,when years,even decades,may elapse before the wrongfully convicted criminal defendant obtains postconviction relief.id.at,d.
coscia concluded,the approach is most consistent with the requirements of section,subdivision a,and the interests of fairness to both plaintiffs and defendants in criminal malpractice actions.thus,the plaintiff must file a malpractice claim within the or limitations period set forth in section,subdivision a.although such an action is subject to demurrer or summary judgment while a plaintiff conviction remains intact,the court should stay the malpractice action during the period in which such a plaintiff timely and diligently pursues postconviction remedies by this means,courts can ensure that the plaintiff claim will not be barred prematurely by the statute of limitations.this approach at the same time will protect the interest of defendants in attorney malpractice actions in receiving timely notice and avoiding stale claims.coscia,supra,cal th at,d.
coscia remanded to allow the client to amend the complaint to allege actual innocence and stated the trial court should stay proceedings in the malpractice case as necessary to permit the client timely pursuit of postconviction remedies.id.at,d.
thus,under coscia,rose malpractice complaint was untimely,as follows the actual injury element was met no later than november,when rose was convicted.even assuming for the sake of argument that it could not be said he knew or should have known of hudson allegedly deficient performance at the time of conviction,rose clearly knew he was claiming attorney negligence no later than november,when he filed an appellate brief in the criminal case arguing ineffective assistance counsel,including an argument about the serology evidence.the appellate brief was filed by a different defense attorney,indicating hudson no longer represented rose in the criminal matter.thus,the one year limitations period of section fn,ante began no later than november.factoring in the two year tolling due to rose incarceration,his complaint had to be filed by november,and the complaint was too late.even assuming for the sake of argument that the four year period of section applied,the complaint had to have been filed by plus four years plus two years due to incarceration the complaint was still too late.
insofar as rose thinks coscia,supra,cal th,d,was wrongly decided,the argument fails,as we are bound to follow the precedent of the california supreme court.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.
insofar as rose argues coscia should not be retroactively applied to him,the argument fails.
thus,rose argues retroactive application of coscia to his case would violate due process.he cites aronson superior court d,which said due process concerns could arise when the legislature enacts legislation shortening a limitations period.id.at.however,since aronson dealt with retrospectivity of legislation,it does not control this case,because in this case rose complains a court opinion coscia is being retroactively applied.court opinions are different from legislation because courts declare law rather than make law.witkin,cal.procedure ed appeal.nevertheless,a similar rule applies to court opinions,as follows 
the rule that judicial decisions are generally applied retroactively is well established.citations.the rule is basic in our legal tradition.citations.however,the rule is not absolute.citations.it is subject to two narrow exceptions,based on considerations of fairness and public policy.citations.the supreme court has held a court may decline to follow the standard rule when retroactive application of a decision would raise substantial concerns about the effects of the new rule on the general administration of justice,or would unfairly undermine the reasonable reliance of parties on the previously existing state of the law.citation.gentis safeguard business systems,th,d.a court decision does not announce a new rule
