introduction 
rey piedra,an infant,suffered cardiac arrest,resulting in severe brain damage.rey parents,jesus piedra and agripina arroyo,as rey guardians ad litem,sued rey treating physician,dugan,for medical malpractice,negligent failure to obtain informed consent,and battery.the trial court granted a motion for nonsuit on the battery claim,and the jury found in favor of dugan on the malpractice and informed consent claims.
we conclude the trial court did not err by granting the nonsuit motion on the battery claim.dugan was unaware of any condition on the parents consent to treatment.therefore,we hold the physician could not be liable for battery because he did not intentionally violate the condition on the consent while treating plaintiff.given the jury verdict on the claim for lack of informed consent,even if the court erred in granting the nonsuit,any such error was harmless.
we also conclude there was substantial evidence to support the jury verdict on the claim for lack of informed consent the trial court did not err in instructing the jury regarding the settlement between plaintiff and the other defendants and the trial court did not err by submitting to the jury the issue of the gross amount of future damages,rather than the present value of those damages.therefore,we affirm.
statement of facts 
on april,rey piedra was admitted to fountain valley regional hospital and medical center fountain valley with a suspected seizure disorder.upon his discharge from the hospital on april,rey treatment was phenobarbital twice a day to prevent seizures.rey developed a rash over his entire body,swelling,and a swollen abdomen,and eventually stopped eating.rey mother cut the phenobarbital dose in half,and then stopped giving rey any medications on may.
rey was readmitted to fountain valley on may.the physician ordered that phenobarbital be discontinued and replaced with another anticonvulsant,ativan,as needed for seizures lasting longer than two minutes.
at fountain valley,rey mother signed a form regarding the conditions of admission,in which she consented to the procedures which may be performed during this hospitalization,including emergency treatment or services,and which may include,but are not limited to laboratory procedures,examination,medical or surgical treatment or procedures,anesthesia,or hospital services rendered rey under the general and special instructions of rey physician or surgeon.rey mother testified she told the admitting person,two nurses,and rey attending physician,magdalena salcedo,not to give rey any medication without her knowledge 
early the next morning,rey was transferred to the picu.the initial diagnosis was a drug reaction or acute systemic reaction to medication.dugan first saw rey on the morning of may.rey liver was enlarged he was dehydrated,anemic,and suffering from a rash and he had had an allergic reaction to phenobarbital.
rey needed fluids and blood products,which had to be administered through a central line.salcedo explained to rey parents,in spanish,that rey needed a transfusion,and rey father consented in writing to the central line placement.salcedo did not,however,discuss with rey parents the medications that would be used to sedate rey during the placement of the central line.dugan believed the consent to the central line procedure included consent to the use of the sedatives.
the placement of the central line began at,and was not completed until rey received two doses of versed and four doses of ketamine before and during the course of the procedure.those amounts of the drugs were not unusually large for this procedure in a child.rey mother was never told rey would be given ativan,versed,or ketamine,or what effect those drugs might have on rey.
dugan ordered an echocardiogram to determine whether rey had any cardiac abnormalities.dugan also ordered that ativan be administered as necessary to calm rey during the echocardiogram,which was performed at on may.a nurse administered ativan when rey movements were too erratic to allow an accurate echocardiogram.
at on may,rey suffered a prolonged seizure.dugan concluded rey needed emergency treatment and ordered a dose of ativan to prevent another seizure.dugan hoped preventing further seizures would avoid the need to intubate rey.a picu nurse testified this dose of ativan was administered to rey in response to emergency situations.dugan acknowledged he did not obtain consent from rey parents for treatment or prevention of seizures with ativan.
the results of the laboratory tests,returned at,showed respiratory failure and respiratory acidosis an increased acidity of the blood stream resulting from the inability to eliminate carbon dioxide from the body.dugan therefore ordered an immediate dose of mazicon to reverse the effects of ativan which can cause respiratory depression,and later intubated rey.to prevent movement and reduce pain during the intubation process,dugan gave rey succinylcholine,pavulon and fentanyl.rey parents consent was not obtained for the intubation because it was performed due to a emergency.
around midnight,rey condition began to deteriorate rapidly,and he suffered a cardiac arrest.dugan opined rey cardiac arrest was caused by hyperkalemia a high potassium level,which is a rare adverse effect of succinylcholine.plaintiff expert agreed with dugan opinion.
rey continued to suffer subclinical seizures,and was transferred to the university of california at los angeles medical center because fountain valley did not have the capability to monitor his continued seizure activity.as a result of his cardiac arrest,rey suffered severe brain damage and is likely to remain in a vegetative state for the rest of his life.
a pharmacological expert and a pediatric neurological expert offered by plaintiff testified rey respiratory depression and respiratory failure were caused by the combined effects of phenobarbital,versed,ketamine and ativan.plaintiff pediatric neurological expert testified rey probably did not suffer a seizure on the evening of may,but instead he had an episode of respiratory depression caused by the substantial amount of antiseizure or anticonvulsant medications in his system.
a witness,expert in anesthesiology and pediatric critical care,offered by dugan,testified ativan,ketamine,and versed are commonly used drugs with low risk of harm.the expert further testified the conditions of admission form signed by rey mother upon rey admission to fountain valley was a general consent to give such medications.plaintiff expert in pediatric critical care testified the standard of care did not require written consent for the administration of ketamine,versed,or ativan.additionally,plaintiff expert testified that no special consent,written or oral,is required if the drugs are administered in an emergency situation.
procedural history 
plaintiff sued dugan for professional negligence,negligent failure to inform,and battery.shortly before trial,four of the other defendants pacificare health systems,fountain valley,and leslie brody and joaquin merida settled with plaintiff and were dismissed from the case.another defendant,phillip madrid,was dismissed prior to trial.
before the jury began deliberating,but after both sides rested,the trial court granted a motion for nonsuit of the battery claim.in a special verdict,the jury found dugan was not negligent in rey medical care or treatment,and dugan had disclosed to rey parents all relevant information enabling them to make an informed decision regarding the proposed treatment to be rendered by dugan.judgment was entered,and plaintiff timely appealed.
discussion 
was substantial evidence supporting the jury verdict on the negligent failure to inform claim.
the cause of action against dugan for negligent failure to inform alleged he negligently failed to disclose to rey parents the contraindications for the use of ativan.plaintiff argues the jury verdict that dugan disclosed all relevant information to enable rey parents to make an informed decision regarding the proposed treatment to be rendered to rey was not supported by substantial evidence.
when a trial court factual determination is attacked on the ground that there is no substantial evidence to sustain it,the power of an appellate court begins and ends with the determination as to whether,on the entire record,there is substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,which will support the determination,and when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts,a reviewing court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court.if such substantial evidence be found,it is of no consequence that the trial court believing other evidence,or drawing other reasonable inferences,might have reached a contrary conclusion.citation.the substantial evidence standard of review is applicable to appeals from both jury and nonjury trials.citation.jameson five feet restaurant,th,d.
physicians have a duty to inform their patients of the known risks of death or serious bodily harm associated with proposed treatments.cobbs grant cal d.however,physicians need not discuss the risks inherent in common procedures that very rarely result in serious ill effects.ibid.additionally,in emergency situations,physicians need not obtain consent before treating a patient.preston hubbell d.the jury was instructed on both of those exceptions.
initially,we must identify the treatment for which dugan allegedly failed to obtain consent.in the opening appellate brief,plaintiff argues dugan failed to obtain informed consent from rey parents for the administration of ativan,versed,or ketamine.at trial,however,plaintiff claim was based on the lack of informed consent to the administrations of ativan to rey at and on may.neither the complaint nor the trial brief mentioned rey treatment with versed or ketamine.
dugan argues plaintiff waived the issue of the administrations of versed and ketamine because that argument was not presented to the trial court or the jury.beroiz wahl th,fn,d richmond dart industries,d.plaintiff does not dispute that the lack of informed consent regarding versed and ketamine was not argued in the trial court,and agrees dugan undisclosed use of versed and k etamine presents an entirely different issue than his undisclosed use of ativan.plaintiff contends,however,the versed and k etamine remain relevant to the ativan claim as to causation,since they helped set the stage for the,and as to the lack of disclosure which was consistent with the lack of ativan disclosure.we conclude the issue on appeal is whether there was substantial evidence to support the jury finding that dugan disclosed all the necessary information to rey parents regarding his treatment with ativan.
it is undisputed that neither dugan nor any member of the fountain valley staff specifically obtained informed consent from rey parents to treat him with ativan.
there was substantial evidence ativan is a commonly used,generally safe medication.robert spear,a specialist in pediatric intensive care and anesthesiology offered by dugan,testified ativan is very commonly used in picu and is considered a v ery safe drug.a nurse from fountain valley picu testified ativan is used frequently in children and is the drug of choice to treat children with seizures.plaintiff expert witness in pediatric neurology,arnold gale,testified ativan is often used as an emergency drug for seizures and is considered safe.although dugan testified ativan can be deadly when it interacts with other drugs,he did not testify how often it has such an effect,and thus how significant the risk is.in any event,the contradictory testimony does not change the fact there was substantial evidence ativan is commonly used and safe.
the first dose of ativan was administered to ensure an accurate reading of rey echocardiogram,a necessary and nonelective component of dugan treatment of rey.while this was not an emergency procedure,rey was facing a high probability of death absent immediate diagnosis and treatment,and the ativan was necessary to ensure an accurate test result.neither the echocardiogram nor the ativan used to sedate rey for the procedure inherently involve d a known risk of death or serious bodily harm,and dugan therefore had no duty to inform rey parents of,and obtain their consent to,the risks inherent in a common procedure with a rare risk of serious side effects.a very rare,but very serious,side effect occurred however,this does not change the fact dugan was not required to obtain rey parents informed consent at the time the first dose of ativan was administered to rey.
there was substantial evidence the second dose of ativan was administered to rey under emergency conditions.the second dose was given when dugan,relying on a nurse observation,determined rey was suffering a prolonged seizure accompanied by apnea and oxygen desaturation,conditions that were.dugan therefore determined rey needed an anticonvulsant immediately.
plaintiff expert in pediatric critical care,robert bart,testified the second dose of ativan was given in a nonemergency situation.bart opinion was based on the picu nurse testimony that rey seizure had stopped eight minutes before the ativan was administered.spear,however,testified administering medication to rey at that time was necessary to avoid the risk of additional seizures that could interfere with respiration and require intubation.brody,a pediatric neurologist and a former defendant in the case,testified a seizure accompanied by apnea and desaturation requires medication on an ongoing basis even after the initial seizure is over.dugan testified the remaining level of phenobarbital in rey system at on may was insufficient to prevent further seizures.
substantial evidence supported the jury verdict that dugan was not required to obtain rey parents informed consent to the two doses of ativan administered on may.
the court did not err by instructing the jury with baji regarding plaintiff settlement with the other defendants.
the trial court instructed the jury with baji,as follows in this case the plaintiff has made a settlement with pacificare health systems,to fhp health care,fou n tain valley regional hospital,leslie brody,phillip madrid,joaquin merida.the amount of the settlement has been disclosed to the court but not to you.if you find that the plaintiff is entitled to recover against the defendant james dugan,then you should award damages to the plaintiff for the same amount you would have awarded as if no such settlement had been made.in that event,the court will later deduct the amount of this settlement from the amount of your award and your verdict will be reduced accordingly.
plaintiff argues the court erred by instructing the jury with baji because the fact of the settlement had never been disclosed to the jury plaintiff cites no cases preventing a court from using baji when the jury has not previously learned other defendants reached a settlement with the plaintiff.all the cases we have found require the use of this instruction rather than evidence of the amount of the settlement.vahey sacia d.shepherd walley d.albrecht broughton d.the absence of an attempt to offer evidence of the settlement amount does not change the appropriateness of this instruction.
earlier in the trial,the jury was instructed ladies and gentlemen,during the course of this trial you may receive testimony or other evidence which pertains to,pacificare health systems,fountain valley regional hospital,leslie brody,philip madrid,and,joaquin merida,although plaintiff initially asserted a claim of medical negligence against these parties,such claim is no longer an issue in this case and those persons and entities are no longer parties in this case.do not speculate as to why these persons and entities are no longer involved in this case.you should not consider this during your deliberations.plaintiff agreed to this instruction.
even if the court erred by giving baji,a judgment may not be reversed for instructional error in a civil case unless,after an examination of the entire cause,including the evidence,the court shall be of the opinion that the error complained of has resulted in a miscarriage of justice.citation.soule general motors cal th,d.no such miscarriage of justice occurred here.plaintiff suggests baji caused him prejudice because the jury believed plaintiff was being greedy by pursuing dugan after receiving a substantial sum from the other defendants.first,to accept plaintiff argument would require us to accept that the jury completely ignored baji.second,the jury never reached the issue of damages.vahey sacia,supra,d at.any error in refusing to instruct with baji or was harmless because jury found the defendant was not negligent,and never reached the issue of damages.
the trial court did not err by preventing plaintiff from offering evidence of the present value of future damages.
the trial court granted defendant merida motion in limine to exclude evidence of how to reduce future damages to present value.the court refused to include a present value determination on the special verdict form.plaintiff claims this prejudiced him because he was required to present his damage claim as one for damages in the range of million to million,affecting plaintiff credibility with the jury.the court ruling on a motion in limine is reviewed for abuse of discretion.hernandez paicius th,d.
in medical malpractice cases,the trial court is required to enter an order that a defendant make periodic payments if the future damages awarded equal or exceed,if either party makes such a request.code civ,subd.a.it is proper for the trial court to submit to the jury the issue of the gross amount of future damages,while retaining for itself the timing of periodic payments,and thus the present value.salgado county of los angeles cal th,d.
plaintiff argues the battery claim was not subject to code of civil procedure section.as discussed below,the battery cause of action had been removed from the case before it went to the jury,and therefore any error was not prejudicial.
moreover,plaintiff could not have been prejudiced by the court order granting the motion in limine,because the jury never reached the issue of damages.the jury found dugan not liable on either of the claims before it.plaintiff argues he was prejudiced because the jury might have viewed the request for gross future damages as greed.this is speculative.
more importantly,the jury was instructed the court would make any necessary adjustments to the damages award to account for the present value of the damages.as you may be aware,a sum of money to be received in the future,or to be spent in the future,can be expressed in terms of its present value.the determination of the present value of a sum of money to be received or spent in the future requires a mathematical calculation.do not make any adjustment for the present value of the future medical costs and future loss of earning capacity.if such an adjustment is legally required,the court will perform the appropriate calculation.
the trial court did not err by granting a nonsuit on the battery claim even if the court so erred,the error was not.the issue 
plaintiff sued dugan for battery based on the administration of ativan to rey,alleging dugan failed to obtain rey parents informed consent to treat rey with ativan,the risks and dangers of ativan were never explained to rey parents,and rey parents had specifically forbade the use of any medication for rey without their authorization.
after both sides rested their case at trial,the court granted dugan motion for nonsuit on the battery claim.in granting the motion,the court stated i could find any evidence in the record here from which a reasonable jury could reach the conclusion that based upon this evidence,that this doctor treating this infant in the intentionally rendered a treatment that had not been consented to,or deviated from the scope of the consent.i think without any question the record here supports that dugan is performing what he believes to be routine and appropriate standard of care treatment upon an infant that been admitted and admitted pursuant to conditions of admission,which consent to the type of treatment that he providing my granting of the motion is based upon my belief that the record does not have evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that dugan intentionally rendered treatment that had not been consented to or intentionally deviated from treatment that had been consented to.
b.the standard of review 
a defendant is entitled to a nonsuit if the trial court determines that,as a matter of law,the evidence presented by plaintiff is insufficient to permit a jury to find in his favor.citation.in determining whether plaintiff evidence is sufficient,the court may not weigh the evidence or consider the credibility of witnesses.instead,the evidence most favorable to plaintiff must be accepted as true and conflicting evidence must be disregarded.the court must give to the plaintiff evidence all the value to which it is legally entitled,indulging every legitimate inference which may be drawn from the evidence in plaintiff favor.citation.a mere scintilla of evidence does not create a conflict for the jury resolution there must be substantial evidence to create the necessary conflict.citation.in reviewing a grant of nonsuit,we are guided by the same rule requiring evaluation of the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.citation.we will not sustain the judgment unless interpreting the evidence most favorably to plaintiff case and most strongly against the defendant and resolving all presumptions,inferences and doubts in favor of the plaintiff a judgment for the defendant is required as a matter of law.citation.nally grace community church cal d.we may not,however,consider the supporting evidence in isolation,and disregard any contradictory evidence rather,we must review the entire record.kidron movie acquisition th,d.
battery in the context of medical treatment 
a battery is any intentional,unlawful and harmful contact by one person with the person of another a harmful contact,intentionally done is the essence of a battery a contact is unlawful if it is unconsented to citation.the elements of a civil battery are.defendant intentionally did an act which resulted in a harmful or offensive contact with the plaintiff person.plaintiff did not consent to the contact and.the harmful or offensive contact caused injury,damage,loss or harm to the plaintiff.citation.fluharty fluharty th,d.
where a doctor obtains consent of the patient to perform one type of treatment and subsequently performs a substantially different treatment for which consent was not obtained,there is a clear case of battery.cobbs grant,supra,cal d at.consent is not necessary for medical treatment provided in an emergency.id.at.when a physician obtains the patient consent to a particular treatment and administers that treatment,but an undisclosed inherent complication with a low probability occurs,the patient has a claim for negligence,not battery.the battery theory should be reserved for those circumstances when a doctor performs an operation to which the patient has not consented.when the patient gives permission to perform one type of treatment and the doctor performs another,the requisite element of deliberate intent to deviate from the consent given is present.however,when the patient consents to certain treatment and the doctor performs that treatment but an undisclosed inherent complication with a low probability occurs,no intentional deviation from the consent given appears rather,the doctor in obtaining consent may have failed to meet his due care duty to disclose pertinent information.in that situation the action should be pleaded in negligence.id.at.
d.the conditions of admission form 
when rey was admitted to fountain valley on may,his mother signed a conditions of admission form on his behalf.that form read in relevant part the undersigned consents to the procedures which may be performed during this hospitalization,including emergency treatment or services,and which may include,but are not limited to laboratory procedures,examination,medical or surgical treatment or procedures,anesthesia,or hospital services rendered rey under the general and special instructions of rey physician or surgeon.plaintiff claims this form is simply informational and does not constitute any type of consent to treatment.
