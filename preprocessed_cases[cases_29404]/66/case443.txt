appellant assa weinberg,sought administrative mandamus against respondent medical center.the trial court denied weinberg petition.we affirm.
relevant factual and procedural history 
respondent is a nonprofit public benefit corporation and accredited acute care hospital.weinberg,a licensed physician,was appointed to respondent medical staff in.the case before us arises out of disciplinary proceedings against weinberg that culminated in the termination of his staff privileges and membership.
under the constitution,rules,and regulations of respondent medical staff,disciplinary proceedings are initiated by the chief medical officer cmo.the physician in question is entitled to notice of charges,access to evidence regarding the charges,and a hearing before a committee of physicians at which the physician may present evidence,and witnesses.the hearing committee recommendation is submitted to the medical executive committee mec,which reviews the record to ensure that the physician received a fair hearing,and that the recommendation is supported by the evidence and is consistent with the medical staff constitution,bylaws,and practices.
the physician in question may request an appeal from the mec recommendation to respondent board of directors board.absent any such request,the board will either i render a final decision in writing or ii remand the matter back to the mec hearing committee for further action or deliberation,and render a final decision at the next regularly scheduled board meeting.
in november,respondent cmo notified weinberg that his staff privileges were suspended due to substandard performance,and that he was entitled to a hearing on the matter.weinberg requested a hearing,and in december,respondent sent weinberg an amended notice of charges.
the hearing occurred between july and december before a committee.weinberg was represented by counsel,and the hearing committee received testimony and other evidence concerning weinberg treatment of nine patients.
the hearing committee report to the mec was not unanimous.four of the six committee members identified deficiencies in weinberg performance,but they declined to recommend termination of his staff privileges and membership.
the majority found that in one case,weinberg had misprescribed the dosage of a drug for a patient,and this inappropriate dose was a contributing factor in the patient death.with respect to the remaining eight patients,the majority found,inter alia,that he had delayed seeking a consultation with a cardiologist failed to record conversations with a pharmacist about an adjustment to the dosage of a drug engaged in substandard record keeping recommended use of a drug with which other physicians disagreed upset a patient wife by telling her that she would be killing her husband by having a medical tube removed,despite her express desire that her husband receive only hospice service failed to record in a timely manner a patient desires about terminating chemotherapy and failed to address in a timely manner a family desire to end treatment,notwithstanding the family durable power of attorney.nonetheless,the majority concluded that weinberg conduct in each of these cases did not warrant suspension of his staff privileges,and it recommended that he should have the opportunity to resolve his deficiencies.
two of the committee members dissented.with respect to the first of the aforementioned patients,the minority found that weinberg error in misprescribing the dosage contributed significantly to the death of the patient.furthermore,the minority found that his prescription practices regarding a second patient were at odds with hospital protocol.in view of the totality of many cases,the minority concluded that weinberg represent ed a continuing imminent danger to his patients.in addition,it concluded that weinberg was difficult or impossible to work with,and that his errors and personality traits warranted permanent suspension.
on may,the mec recommended to the board that weinberg privileges should not be terminated.a special subcommittee of the board with access to the record of the hearing committee then reviewed the mec report and recommendations.in view of the division of opinion within the hearing committee,the special subcommittee advised the board to ask the mec to reconsider the matter and address six enumerated issues based on the cumulative results of the nine case findings in the hearing committee report.
the board directed the mec to reconsider its recommendation.on september,the mec reaffirmed this recommendation and resolved the enumerated issues.regarding the recommendation,the vote tally was as follows.
regarding the enumerated issues,the voting results were as follows i did weinberg meet respondent standard of professional conduct.ii did weinberg not pose a risk to patients in his care.iii was weinberg capable of following hospital protocols with respect to the prescription of medication.iv was weinberg capable of modifying his behaviors and attitudes so as not to represent a threat to patients,patients family members,employees,or others in the hospital setting.v did weinberg meet medical staff rules and regulations concerning appropriate medical record documentation.vi did weinberg meet respondent policy and procedures regarding compliance with the documented desires of his patients and their legal representatives.
on october,the board issued its final decision to weinberg and terminated his staff privileges and membership.the final decision observed the lack of unanimity within the hearing committee and the mec,and stated w ithout substituting the lay board member sic medical judgment for that of the members of the hearing committee or mec and even giving great weight to the findings of the hearing committee majority,the conclusions and recommendations drawn by the hearing committee majority and endorsed by the mec are not supported by the substantial evidence contained in the record.
the final decision contains the following determinations e.that the appropriate standard of review of the nine cases focused upon by the hearing committee should have been the cumulative or aggregate weight of the evidence.that was not the standard used by the hearing committee majority.f.that your medical care poses a potential and imminent risk to patients in your care.g.that the record contains significant and recurring evidence of medication errors contributing to the death of at least one patient and reflecting a plan to experiment on another.h.that you violated the rights of patients and their families in cases.i.that your medical record documentation does not meet the pertinent standards,and that your lapses in documentation placed patients in jeopardy.j.that the record reflects your continuing refusal to change your deficient medical record practices despite notice and an opportunity to.
on december,weinberg filed a petition for writ of mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section.on may,the trial court denied the writ,and judgment was entered in accordance with this ruling.this appeal followed.
discussion 
weinberg contends that the trial court improperly denied its petition for writ of administrative mandamus because the board applied an incorrect standard in making its decision,has a conflict of interest,lacked statutory authorization for its decision,and received improper ex parte communications.as we explain below,he is mistaken.
standard of review 
code of civil procedure section,which provides for administrative mandamus,authorizes the trial court to determine the validity of any final administrative order or decision made as the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given,evidence is required to be taken,and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior tribunal,corporation,board,or officer,subd.a.
generally,in examining a hospital board decision,the superior court must determine two issues.hongsathavij queen of angels.medical center th,d code civ,subds.b d.first,it must determine whether the governing body applied the correct standard in conducting its review of the matter.second,after determining as a preliminary matter that the correct standard was used,then the superior court must determine whether there was substantial evidence to support the governing body decision.hongsathavij queen of angels.medical center,supra,th at,d.
here,weinberg has not included that evidence presented to the hearing committee within the record on appeal.generally,i n a section proceeding,it is the responsibility of the petitioner to produce a sufficient record of the administrative proceedings otherwise the presumption of regularity will prevail citations.elizabeth zolin th,d.for this reason,we presume that substantial evidence supports the board decision,and thus our inquiry is limited to whether the board applied correct standards in making its decision.this is a question of law that we review de novo.see hongsathavij queen of angels.medical center,supra,th at,d huang board of directors d.
business and professions code section,subdivision a 
weinberg contentions hinge on the standard for the board decision delineated in business and professions code section we therefore begin with an examination of this provision,which states in pertinent part it is the policy of this state that peer review be performed by licentiates.this policy is subject to the following limitations a the governing bodies of acute care hospitals have a legitimate function in the peer review process.in all peer review matters,the governing body shall give great weight to the actions of peer review bodies and,in no event,shall act in an arbitrary or capricious manner.
the key issues here concern the application of this provision to the board final decision.because no court has interpreted this provision,these issues involve questions of statutory interpretation.county of tulare campbell th,d.the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.to accomplish that objective,courts must look first to the words of the statute,giving effect to their plain meaning.if those words are clear,we may not alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.citation.in re jerry th,d.
section belongs to a statutory scheme et enacted in that essentially codifie s the requirements previously recognized in case law governing a physician right to a hearing regarding the termination of his or her staff privileges.sahlolbei providence healthcare,th,d.as the court explained in unnamed physician board of trustees th,d,although this statutory scheme delegates to the private sector the responsibility to provide fairly conducted peer review in accordance with due process,including notice,discovery and hearing rights,it also defines what constitutes minimum due process requirements for the review process.
in our view,section places a boundary on a governing body role in the peer review process,but it does not specify this role.section,on its face,ensures the board a legitimate function in the peer review process without mandating the form this function must take.generally,case authority establishes that the governing body precise role within the peer review process of a given hospital is determined by the bylaws and regulations of the medical staff.hongsathavij queen of angels.medical center,supra,th at,d huang board of directors,supra,d at.here,the medical staff constitution,rules,and regulations make the board the final decision maker in the peer review process,but they do not limit its role to that of an appellate body reviewing the mec recommendation for the existence of substantial evidence,or otherwise identify the standard governing the board decisions.we therefore conclude that the board decisionmaking is subject only to the standard found in section,subdivision a.
the remaining question concerns the nature of the standard that this provision imposes on governing bodies.to the extent that the provision bars arbitrary or capricious action by a hospital governing body,it invokes the standard applicable to administrative rulemaking under traditional mandamus.code civ.in this context,the trial court review is limited to whether the agency exceeded its proper authority,used unfair procedures,or acted in a manner that was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support.lewin joseph hospital of orange d,quoting pitts perluss cal d.as witkin has explained,this deferential standard respects that agency presumed expertise within its delegated authority.witkin,cal.procedure ed.administrative proceedings.
however,to the extent that subdivision a of section requires a hospital governing body to give great weight to the actions of peer review bodies,it evokes a limitation on the trial court exercise of its independent judgment when appropriate in administrative mandamus.generally,when administrative action implicates a public employee fundamental vested rights,the superior court exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.bixby pierno cal d,fn.omitted.
nonetheless,in exercising this judgment,the trial court must afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings.fukuda city of angels cal th,d.this standard is alternatively expressed as the requirement that the agency findings should be given substantial weight or great weight.see id.at,d.as our supreme court indicated in fukuda city of angels,supra,cal th at page,d,the rationale for this standard relies,in part,on the observation that such findings often are the product of expertise.
in view of the language of section,subdivision a,we conclude that the legislature has fashioned a standard of decision for hospital governing bodies that tracks the aforementioned principles.under this standard,the board action is subject to deferential review,provided that it acted within its delegated authority,and it properly exercised independent judgment upon the relevant evidence,provided that it accorded due weight to the findings of the hearing committee and mec,insofar as these findings reflect their domain of expertise.
regarding item,we further conclude that the board authority encompasses final responsibility for the quality of its medical staff and care,and thus its decisions within this domain are entitled to deference.respondent owes a duty of a fiduciary nature to its patients and the public to deliver safe and competent medical services.santa medical center th,d hongsathavij queen of angels.medical center,supra,th at,d elam college park hospital d.this duty is recognized in subdivision d of section,which provides that in the peer review process,a governing body and the medical staff shall act exclusively in the interest of maintaining and enhancing quality patient care.
ultimate responsibility for the discharging of this duty falls upon the board,which is entitled to act in accordance with principles of sound corporate governance.hongsathavij queen of angels.medical center,supra,th at,d.furthermore,as we have explained,the constitution,bylaws,and regulations of respondent medical staff render the board the final arbiter in peer review proceedings.
citing hongsathavij queen of angels.medical center,supra,th,d,and huang board of directors,supra,d,weinberg disagrees with item,contending that the board was required to review the actions of the hearing committee and the mec for the existence of substantial evidence.however,neither section nor these cases support this contention.as we have explained,section,by its plain language,does not impose substantial evidence review upon the board.moreover,unlike the case before us,the medical staff bylaws at issue in hongsathavij and huang expressly required the pertinent governing bodies to apply substantial evidence review.hongsathavij queen of angels.medical center,supra,th at,d huang board of directors,supra,d at.
great weight 
weinberg first contention is that the board did not accord great weight to the actions of the hearing committee and the mec.he is mistaken.
as the fukuda court explained,the pertinent presumption of correctness provides the trial court with a starting point for it is only a presumption,and may be overcome.because the
