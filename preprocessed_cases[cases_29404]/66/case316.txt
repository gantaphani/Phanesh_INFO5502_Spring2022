linda whitney,executive director of the medical board of california the board,filed a petition to compel walter montegut,to comply with investigational subpoenas the subpoenas issued in connection with an investigation of a complaint that montegut may be abusing drugs,prescribing to himself and over prescribing to patients.over various objections,the trial court granted the petition.
montegut contends the trial court erred in granting the petition because it was not timely filed within days of his noncompliance with the subpoenas the los angeles county superior court did not have jurisdiction to hear the petition under government code section the subpoenas were illegal because they were not supported by written patient releases and the subpoenas did not set forth legally adequate cause for enforcement.we affirm.
allegations of the petition and supporting documents 
the petition was filed in los angeles county superior court on june,seeking medical records of ten patients treated by montegut,pursuant to the board disciplinary and investigative authority over licensed physicians.the petition was supported by a declaration of rick chavez,a physician with board certification in addiction medicine and pain medicine,who reviewed prescriptions issued by montegut that revealed possible drug use and over prescribing to patients.chavez opined that he needs to review the patients medical records to determine why the medications were prescribed.the petition alleged the board investigation was being conducted in los angeles county and the designated place of compliance with the subpoenas was in los angeles county although the subpoena attached to the petition required production of patient records in tustin,which is in orange county.counsel for montegut notified the board investigator,erika george,on january,of objections to the subpoenas and the doctor refusal to comply.
the board filed a memorandum of points and authorities concurrently with the petition.the memorandum detailed the nature of the investigation,the authority of the board to investigate,and the necessity to enforce the subpoenas.
proceedings on the petition 
montegut filed objections to the petition on substantive,procedural,and jurisdictional grounds,as discussed below.the trial court issued an order to show cause,rejected each of montegut objections,and on may,the court signed an order compelling montegut to comply with the subpoenas.montegut filed a timely notice of appeal from the order.
discussion 
montegut first contention is that the petition to compel compliance with the subpoenas is subject to the same day time limit applicable to a petition for writ of mandate.because he refused to comply by january,montegut reasons the board had to file the petition no later than march,and the june,filing was beyond the applicable limitations period.
montegut cites no authority for the proposition that a petition to compel compliance with an investigational subpoena is the equivalent of a petition for writ of mandate which must be filed within days of the party failure to comply,nor does he engage in any analysis to support that conclusion.we need not address arguments for which a party provides no supporting authority.people williams cal th,fn.michael superior court th.
in any event,the trial court correctly ruled that a petition to compel compliance with a subpoena is not a petition for writ of mandate therefore the day statute does not apply.the board is empowered to issue investigative subpoenas for the purpose of investigating physician conduct.bus,subd.e.the power to enforce compliance with investigational subpoenas is found in section which expressly sets forth the requirements of the petition.section does not contain a day period of limitations,nor does it suggest in any fashion that a petition to compel compliance with a subpoena is the equivalent of a petition for writ of mandate.the petition in this case was not untimely.
montegut next argues the los angeles county superior court did not have jurisdiction to hear the petition.he contends jurisdiction in this case is in the orange county superior court under the provisions of section,because the subpoenas called for compliance in orange county and there is no evidence that any investigation of montegut was taking place in los angeles county.this contention involves issues of statutory interpretation and application of the substantial evidence rule to the trial court findings on jurisdiction.

when a trial court factual determination is attacked on the ground that there is no substantial evidence to sustain it,the power of an appellate court begins and ends with the determination as to whether,on the entire record,there is substantial evidence,contradicted or uncontradicted,which will support the determination,and when two or more inferences can reasonably be deduced from the facts,a reviewing court is without power to substitute its deductions for those of the trial court.if such substantial evidence be found,it is of no consequence that the trial court believing other evidence,or drawing other reasonable inferences,might have reached a contrary conclusion.bowers bernards d.the substantial evidence standard of review is applicable to appeals from both jury and nonjury trials.alderson alderson d.jameson five feet restaurant,th.
interpretation of section 
the statute assigning jurisdiction to hear petitions to compel compliance with investigational subpoenas is section,which provides as follows the superior court in the county in which any hearing is held or any investigation is conducted under the direction of the head of a department or the county in which testimony is designated to be given or documents or other items are designated to be produced,has jurisdiction to compel the attendance of witnesses,the giving of testimony,the answering without objection of interrogatories,and the production,inspection,and copying of papers,books,accounts,documents,and other items described in subdivision e of section as required by any subpoena issued by the department head.
section unambiguously defines the trial court jurisdiction to hear a petition to compel compliance with an investigational subpoena in three distinct ways.the petition may be filed in the county in which any hearing is held the county in which any investigation is conducted under the direction of the head of a department and the county in which testimony is designated to be given or documents or other items are designated to be produced.jurisdiction is therefore not limited to orange county,even though that county was the location for compliance with the subpoenas.
substantial evidence 
the trial court found that the los angeles county superior court has jurisdiction over the petition because the hearing on montegut interim suspension was held in los angeles,if an accusation is filed,it will be in los angeles,and investigation was conducted in both orange and los angeles counties.under the appropriate standard of review,the issue is not close,as the court jurisdictional findings are amply supported by substantial evidence.
first,the deputy attorney general acting as counsel for the board declared that a hearing had been held in october in the los angeles office of administrative hearings regarding interim suspension of montegut medical license.this sworn statement is uncontroverted.thus,in direct relation to the investigation of montegut,los angeles was the county in which any hearing is held,italics added.the broad jurisdictional language used by the legislature,including the phrase any hearing,does not support the interpretation urged by montegut,that any hearing means a hearing that is currently pending.had the legislature intended the meaning of section suggested by montegut,it would have provided for jurisdiction in the county in which any hearing is pending.the legislature did not use those words,and we decline to add them to section and thereby limit the broad jurisdictional language chosen by the legislature.the hearing on interim suspension,alone,is an adequate basis for jurisdiction in the los angeles county superior court.
the trial court also ruled that jurisdiction was proper under section because if an accusation is filed,any hearing will also be heard in los angeles county at the office of administrative hearings.we leave for another day the issue of whether a future hearing satisfies the jurisdictional requirement of the statute.it is sufficient for purposes of this case to hold,as we have above,that the prior hearing on interim suspension of montegut vests the los angeles county superior court with jurisdiction to hear the petition to compel compliance with the subpoenas.
second,the record contains substantial evidence to support the trial court finding that the investigation has been conducted in both orange county and los angeles county.because the court did not specify the evidence upon which it relied,we examine the entire record and draw all inferences in favor of the court express or implied findings under the substantial evidence rule.we begin by noting that the petition,which is deemed verified under the terms of code of civil procedure section see murrieta valley unified school dist.county of riverside d,specifically alleged that the board investigation is being conducted in los angeles county.
the board counsel explained in a declaration that she was assigned to investigate allegations of misconduct italics added against montegut in june,and that she direct ed the investigation of this case from her office in los angeles.pursuant to section counsel worked in conjunction with investigator george,who was located in orange county,using a vertical enforcement and prosecution model.part of counsel responsibilities include interviewing witnesses,researching applicable case law,making phone calls,filing the petition for interim suspension,and enforcement of investigational subpoenas.counsel declaration constitutes substantial evidence that investigation was conducted in los angeles county.
additional definitive proof that any investigation took place in los angeles county is found in the involvement of chavez.it is undisputed that chavez was utilized by the board to investigate montegut prescribing practices,and after his investigation of the prescriptions,the irregularities he observed caused him to conclude it was necessary to review the patients medical records that are the subject of the instant petition.chavez has medical privileges at two los angeles county hospitals,and most importantly,signed his declaration in redondo beach,which is located in los angeles county.the trial court could reasonably infer from the record that counsel for the board directed and participated in the investigation,chavez was an integral part of that investigation,and their activity took place in los angeles county.the court correctly found it had jurisdiction.
citing business and professions code section,subdivision a,montegut contends the subpoena was illegal because it was not accompanied by written patient releases.he further argues the letters notifying the ten patients of the subpoena of their records from montegut were insufficient because they did not specify a court or administrative officer because sic whom objections could be made.they merely state that the patients should consider consulting an attorney.montegut also relies on code of civil procedure section,as applied in sehlmeyer department of general services th,footnote sehlmeyer,for the proposition that a physician may refuse to comply with a subpoena for patient records if the notice to the patient fails to identify where the patient may file objections to disclosure of their records.
business and professions code section,subdivision a has no application in this case.the statute is a penalty provision that applies to a physician who refuses to comply with a subpoena for medical records after the patient has provided written consent.here,the ten patients in question have not provided written consent.montegut is not being penalized for failing to comply with the subpoenas as to consenting patients.this case concerns compliance with the subpoenas after the patients have failed to provide consent,not the penalty for noncompliance where there is patient consent.
we next turn to montegut contention regarding code of civil procedure section,subdivision e which describes the required written notice to a patient that a subpoena has been issued for the patient medical records.first,the patient must be given notice that records about the patient are being sought from the witness named on the subpoena.the notices to each patient here included a cover letter from investigator george stating that she had made an earlier written request to authorize release of the medical records held by montegut,but the patient had not responded.the letter included the following language i am writing to inform you that the medical board is attempting to obtain your medical records from montegut via service of a subpoena.investigator george letter was accompanied by a copy of the subpoena and a notice to medical consumers that identified the patients rights.investigator george letter and the supporting documents satisfied the first notice requirement of code of civil procedure section.
the second requirement of code of civil procedure section is notice to the patient that if he or she objects to disclosure of his or her medical records,the patient must file papers with the court or serve a written objection prior to the date specified for production.here,each patient received a document entitled notice to medical consumers,explaining the board duties and investigative powers and seeking the patients signature on an authorization to release of their medical records.the patients were advised of their right not to sign the consent form,but that the board will take the necessary steps to subpoena the records.patients were advised,you have the right to object to prodution of your records to the medical board in response to its subpoena.investigator george letter to each patient included the same admonition.the second notice requirement of code of civil procedure section was satisfied.
the third notice requirement is that if the parties do not agree in writing to cancel or limit the subpoena,the patient should consult an attorney about protecting the patient privacy rights.the notice to medical consumers provided to each patient in this case included the following admonition if you wish to make such an objection,you may want to consult an attorney to discuss your rights.investigator george letter to each patient contained the same admonition.the third statutory notice requirement was satisfied.
montegut contends there is an additional notice requirement under code of civil procedure section that the board did not satisfy notice advising the patient in which court,or before which tribunal,an objection could be made.code of civil procedure section contains no such requirement,and we decline to impose one.sehlmeyer,supra,th,cited by montegut,does not hold that code of civil procedure section requires a patient be given notice of where to object.the case stands for the unremarkable proposition that a patient must be given advance notice of a subpoena of medical records under code of civil procedure section.sehlmeyer,supra,at.the board provided the precise notice required by the statute in this case.
montegut final contention is that the subpoena did not set forth legally adequate cause for its enforcement.relying on wood superior court d,wood,montegut argues the declaration of chavez fails to support a finding overriding a patient privacy rights because chavez is not a member of the same medical specialty as montegut,and chavez conclusion that i t is not possible to ascertain with assurance why these medications were prescribed is legally insufficient for enforcement of an investigational subpoena.
qualifications and sufficiency of the opinion of chavez 
chavez declared he is board certified in addiction medicine,pain medicine,and family medicine.he earned his undergraduate degree in psychology at stanford university and his medical degree at the ucla school of medicine,where he has been a clinical assistant professor since.he was on the faculty at the usc school of medicine from.his current clinical practice is in the treatment of chronic pain and addiction medicine.he has clinical and admission privileges at torrance memorial medical center and little company of mary hospital in torrance.
in july,chavez was asked to review allegations of drug use and over prescribing by montegut.one of the documents he reviewed was a cures report which revealed significant irregularities in montegut prescribing practices.large quantities of phentermine were prescribed to one patient.patients were receiving the same prescription on the same day,in the same quantities,at two different pharmacies.multiple family members were receiving the same medication and refilling before the due date.montegut is a plastic surgeon,and chavez opined it seems unusual for someone in his specialty to prescribe these kinds drugs in these high amounts.such behavior is consistent with medication abuse,misuse or diversion.it is difficult to ascertain why these medications were prescribed without seeing the medical records for the patients.in chavez professional opinion,there is good reason for the necessity to review the medical records of the patients in question.in order to accurately determine and define these problems,certified medical records are necessary.
the trial court determination that a physician is qualified to render testimony as an expert witness must be upheld absent an abuse of discretion,which will be found only where the evidence shows that a witness clearly lacks qualification as an expert.people chavez cal d.jutzi county of los angeles d.
montegut argues that chavez is unqualified to render the opinion that the cures report showed irregularities in montegut prescribing practice,on the ground that chavez is not a plastic surgeon.we reject the argument.chavez did not express an opinion on how montegut performed plastic surgery.he did express an uncontroverted opinion,within his area of expertise of addiction and pain medicine,regarding the irregularities shown in montegut prescriptions in the cures report.those irregularities included prescriptions for large quantities of phentermine to one patient,patients receiving the same medication at different pharmacies on the same day,and multiple family members receiving the same medication,refilling before the due date.given chavez training,education,and experience,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in relying on his expert opinion that there were significant irregularities in montegut prescribing practices that necessitated further review of patient records.
adequacy of chavez opinion to support the subpoenas 
montegut argues that chavez declaration is insufficient as a matter of law to provide an adequate basis for an investigational subpoena based on his conclusion that i t is not possible to ascertain with assurance why these medications were prescribed.montegut argues wood,supra,d is directly on point in this case.the wood court found insufficient evidence to support an order compelling a doctor to comply with investigational subpoenas where the board expert expressed the opinion examination of patient records was necessary because of the definite possibility of excessive prescribing of controlled drug substances id.at.
wood involved administrative subpoenas directed to two physicians for the complete medical records of patients who had been prescribed schedule ii controlled substances.when the physicians refused to comply with the subpoenas,the board obtained a trial court order enforcing compliance.the court of appeal granted a peremptory writ of mandate overturning the order to comply.wood,supra,d at.the wood court based its conclusion that the subpoenas should not have been enforced on the following factors a patient right to privacy prohibited inspection of medical records in the absence of a compelling state interest id.at the right to privacy could only be protected if the board takes reasonable steps to notify the patient of the subpoena id.at if the patient does not waive the privacy right,the board must provide competent evidence that permits the trial court to make an independent finding of good cause,for review of the complete medical records of the patient ibid.and if the trial court is to make the decision of reasonable cause other than as a rubber stamp the root facts upon which an inference of improper prescribing is based must be laid bare id.at.based upon deficiencies in these four categories,the appellate court held there was no independent judicial assessment of good cause and the judicial function of assessing cause citation can not be abdicated by deferring to the bare conclusion of board personnel.ibid.
the problems with the subpoenas before the court in wood are not present in the instant case.wood conclusion that a compelling state interest is required to overcome the right to privacy predated our supreme court opinion in hill national collegiate athletic cal th hill,which rejected that interpretation of the right to privacy in article i,section,of the california constitution invasion of a privacy interest is not a violation of the state constitutional right to privacy if the invasion is justified by a competing interest.legitimate interests derive from the legally authorized and socially beneficial activities of government and private entities.their relative importance is determined by their proximity to the central functions of a particular public or private enterprise.conduct alleged to be an invasion of privacy is to be evaluated based on the extent to which it furthers legitimate and important competing interests.citation.id.at.the trial court here made a thorough analysis of the competing interests in this case,and other than challenging the adequacy of chavez declaration,montegut makes no argument the court erred in its analysis of competing interests as defined in hill.
the second issue identified in wood the absence of notice to the patients is not a factor in this case.it is uncontested that the patients were given the opportunity to consent to disclosure of their records,and when consent was not given,the patients received notice of the subpoena and their right to consult with counsel and object to the subpoena.as noted by the trial court,the patients are protected by section which prohibits disclosure of records seized pursuant to an investigational subpoena.
the third requirement of wood the board obligation to present competent evidence which supports the trial court finding of good cause for enforcement of the subpoena is satisfied by chavez declaration.we do not agree with montegut argument that chavez declaration is insufficient because it does not set forth information sufficient for this court independently to assess the likelihood of improper prescribing.chavez examined the department of justice official cures report and pointed out specific examples of prescribing irregularities.he identified large quantities of one controlled substance prescribed to one patient.he described patients receiving the same prescription on the same day and obtaining the same quantities at two different pharmacies.multiple family members were receiving the same medication and refilling before the due date.chavez declaration presents competent and specific evidence of identifiable instances of significant irregularities in montegut prescribing practices that warranted examination of the patients medical records.omitted from montegut description of chavez declaration is chavez further statements of good cause i
