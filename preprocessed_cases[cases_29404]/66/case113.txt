appellant latisha castillo castillo challenges the district court granting appellee emergency medicine associates,ema motion for summary judgment,on the ground that her medical malpractice claim is barred by virginia statute of limitations.castillo argues that the district court erred in failing to view the evidence in the light most favorable to her,and in finding that the continuing treatment doctrine did not apply to toll the statute of limitations.because we conclude that the claim is indeed and that the district court did not err in granting the motion for summary judgment,we affirm.
castillo came to the emergency department of prince william hospital on october,complaining of lower abdominal pain and several months history of severe nausea and abdominal pain with bloating.an unidentified emergency department physician diagnosed castillo with a urinary tract infection.doe prescribed antibiotics and discharged castillo that same day.upon discharge,castillo was provided with the following emergency services department discharge instructions 
the examination and treatment you received today in the emergency services department has been rendered on an emergency basis.it is not intended to be a substitute for comprehensive medical attention.should your condition worsen,any new symptoms develop,or you not recover as expected,please contact the doctor you were given for 
care listed below.if you can not reach the doctor,return to the emergency services department.you should return immediately to the nearest emergency room for any emergency.
emphasis added.the follow up care specifically refers castillo first to her own md in north carolina or a with wall for recheck in days if not better.id.wall is a gynecologist who works at prince william hospital,but is not employed by ema.the instructions go on to emphasize as follows it is important that you follow up with the doctor listed above,her own doctor or wall for a.id.emphasis in the original.
on october,castillo called the emergency department because her condition had not improved.initially,she asked to speak with wall.when wall could not be reached,castillo spoke with an unidentified emergency department physician,who prescribed a new medication over the telephone.on october,castillo returned to the emergency department,complaining of severe acute abdominal pain,fever,and chills.she was seen by james eskew,who admitted her to the hospital.on that day,castillo underwent surgery for treatment of abdominal adhesions and infected abscesses in the pelvic area,which had resulted from soilage due to a perforated intestine.all of the emergency department physicians who treated castillo were employed by ema.
castillo filed the original complaint on october.that complaint was voluntarily dismissed,and castillo filed an amended complaint on august.the amended complaint alleged that ema is liable for the acts and omissions of its agents,including doe,and that doe was negligent in his treatment of castillo on october.ema moved for summary judgment on the ground that castillo failed to bring her cause of action for medical malpractice within two years of the date it accrued.castillo argued that there existed a genuine issue of material fact regarding the date of the onset of her injury,and therefore a grant of summary judgment was improper.further,castillo contended that the district court should apply the continuing treatment doctrine to toll the statute of limitations while she was under the care of physicians employed by ema.for both these reasons,castillo argued that her cause of action was not.
the district court found that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to the timing of the injury,and that the continuing treatment doctrine did not apply.specifically,with respect to the continuing treatment theory,the court found that the relationship between castillo and doe terminated upon her discharge from the emergency department on october,and so,necessarily,did her relationship with ema.thus,the district court found that the statute of limitations barred castillo cause of action and granted ema motion for summary judgment.
we review a district court grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo.see stone liberty mut.ins,cir.to prevail on a motion for summary judgment,a party must show there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.at.in reviewing the evidence,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of castillo,the party.thompson aluminum of,cir.
as a federal court sitting in diversity,we interpret and apply the substantive law of the state in which the action arose.erie tompkins.in this case,the virginia statute of limitations applies.see rowland patterson,cir federal courts sitting in diversity generally apply state statutes of limitations.
the applicable virginia statute of limitations states that every action for personal injuries,whatever the theory of recovery shall be brought within two years after the cause of action accrues.ann.a michie.under virginia law,the statute of limitations for personal injury begins to run when the wrong is committed,rather than on the date the injury is discovered.see ann.michie t he right of action shall be deemed to accrue and the prescribed limitation period shall begin to run from the date the injury is sustained in the case of injury to the person caudill wise rambler,finding that the right to recover damages for personal injuries accrues at the time a person is injured.
in this case,the original complaint was filed on october.therefore,in order for the cause of action to fall within the statute of limitations,the injury must have been sustained on or after october,or the limitations period must have been tolled.
castillo contends that an issue of material fact existed regarding the date of injury,and that a reasonable jury could find that the injury began on or after october.she argues that a grant of summary judgment was therefore improper.
in making her argument,castillo contends that the actionable injury resulted from the adhesions and fistulas caused by the scarring that happened when an intestinal perforation was allowed to seal on its own instead of being treated.since the scarring occurred after the sealing of the perforation,and the sealing was complete by the time corrective surgery was performed on october,castillo argues that the scarring could have started after that date.
to support this contention,castillo offered the opinion of eric munoz,her expert on causation and damages.during his deposition,munoz opined that the intestinal perforation sealed s ome time before october but no one could say.castillo contends that based on this testimony,a reasonable juror could find that the scarring process occurred on or after october.
however,the following colloquy also occurred during munoz deposition 
q castillo presents on october and you are saying that between the tenth and the twelfth is basically the time frame within which to meet the standard of care 
q and after the twelfth she begins to receive some physical damage from the lack of intervention 
q let me put it this way on october,to a reasonable degree of medical certainty,in your opinion,because interventions were performed she has suffered physical damage 
q and that the physical damage became exacerbated day by day until she actually received the care 
additionally,during the depositions of castillo other expert witnesses,soloman shah and david munter,each opined that the damage from the perforated intestine began before october,further,in her memorandum to the district court in opposition to ema motion for summary judgment,castillo states that o n october,she had either a perforation of her intestine or she had and sic acute appendicitis.
each of castillo three witnesses agrees that medical intervention should have begun on october,on her first visit to the emergency department further,they agree that the onset of the injury occurred sometime before october.
thus,even under castillo version of the sequence of events,her focus on when the scarring process might have started is misplaced.the physical injury which led to the infections and the scarring occurred and worsened when her intestinal perforation went untreated during the period before october,more than two years prior to the running of the statute of limitations.
alternatively,castillo argues that the continuing treatment doctrine applies,and that the statute of limitations was tolled when treatment began on october.virginia courts agree that the continuing treatment doctrine tolls the running of the statute of limitations while a patient is undergoing a continuous and substantially uninterrupted course of examination and treatment for a particular ailment.farley goode.in order for the continuing treatment doctrine to apply,a relationship must exist over the course of treatment.see grubbs rawls,part of our rationale in farley was that as long as the relationship continued as to a particular or injury,then it could not be said that treatment had ceased.thus,in order for the continuing treatment to toll the statute of limitations in this case,there must have been a relationship between castillo and ema that continued from her first treatment by doe on october,until october.
virginia highest court has not addressed whether the continuing treatment doctrine applies in a situation such as this,when a patient is treated by different emergency room physicians during separate incidents,and those physicians are employed by the same association.when there is no decision by the highest state court,a federal court must apply what it find s to be the state law after giving proper regard to relevant rulings of other courts of the state.barnes thompson,cir internal quotation omitted.we therefore turn to a consideration of relevant virginia law.
virginia courts have found that a physician duty arises only upon the creation of a relationship that relationship springs from a consensual transaction,a contract,express or implied,general or special lyons grether,citation omitted.the relationship generally exists between an individual physician and his or her patient,arising when a patient entrusts his or her care to a physician and the physician accepts responsibility for that care.id.
when an individual is treated by more than one physician for the same ailment,that individual has separate relationships with each physician,and the continuing treatment doctrine applies separately to treatment by each physician.see hewlette proffer.cir,grubbs does not provide a separate standard for a joint treatment situation the statute of limitations was determined for each physician separately and independently of their joint treatment of the plaintiff.the application of the continuing treatment doctrine requires more than the continuous treatment of a single ailment the relationship must be continuous as well.in hollingsworth shenandoah medical imaging.cir,a patient brought a medical malpractice action against individual physicians and a radiology clinic for misdiagnosing breast cancer.the patient claimed that cancer should have been seen in a mammogram taken in june of.she filed a complaint in september of.the circuit court held that the statute of limitations barred the action,finding that two isolated readings by a radiologist did not constitute continuing treatment.the circuit court stated that 
some jurisdictions focus on the course of treatment without the additional requirement of the continuing individual relationship.while the virginia supreme court is cognizant of such authorities,it has consistently focused on both the individual relationship as well as the continuous course of treatment and held that both are requirements for the continuous treatment exception to apply.
id.at citation omitted.it is important to note,however,that virginia courts have found that treatment by subsequent physicians does not interrupt the original treatment for statute of limitations purposes where the first physician referred the patient to the other physicians,and the first physician,who committed the malpractice,continued to treat the patient for the same condition.see justice natvig,finding that the continuing treatment doctrine applied even though there had been eight years of treatment by the physician since the negligent act,and during that time the plaintiff had seen two other physicians for treatment of complications created by the negligent act.
to address castillo claim,we must preliminarily determine whether the continuing treatment doctrine can be applied to a corporation.castillo contends that a relationship may exist between ema and an individual,and her assertion is correct.the virginia supreme court cites the medical malpractice act as providing that there is no legal distinction between individual and organizational health care providers see pulliam coastal emergency servs.of richmond,finding that a corporation created to provide emergency physicians to staff emergency departments was a health care provider as defined by ann.vi.further,the virginia supreme court has found that a relationship can exist between an individual and a professional corporation that is a health care provider as defined by section.see didato strehler,finding that where the plaintiffs engaged a professional corporation to provide all health care that a family should receive from a professional corporation engaged in providing health care services relating to the practice of pediatrics,such an agreement was sufficient to create a direct relationship between the plaintiffs and the corporation.the analysis of whether the continuing treatment doctrine applies in such situations would appear to be substantially the same as when an individual relationship is involved whether there was an ongoing relationship with the corporate health care provider,and whether the patient was undergoing a continuous and substantially uninterrupted course of treatment for the same ailment.
castillo does not allege the existence of a direct relationship between herself and ema,however.rather,she attempts to take the analysis one step further.castillo argues that an indirect relationship arose with ema through her interactions with its unnamed.virginia law does not take us this far.
it is undisputed that all three emergency department physicians with whom castillo had contact were employed by ema it is also undisputed that treating castillo was within the scope of each of the emergency department physician agency however,the further determination that the existence of a relationship with the individual employees provides a basis for asserting the continuing treatment doctrine against the corporate health care provider that employs them is one we need not make on these facts.even if virginia law clearly allowed castillo to reach ema because of the continuing care of its,we conclude that the discrete and isolated nature of the emergency room contacts in this case do not support such a claim.
castillo saw two different emergency department physicians during two isolated visits more than a week apart,on october,and october.a third intervening contact occurred when she called the emergency department and spoke over the telephone with a third,unknown physician on october.there is no allegation that the three emergency department physicians consulted about the care of castillo,nor is there evidence of such in the record.doe did not refer castillo to the subsequent emergency department physicians who treated her.to the contrary,castillo was urged to seek follow up care from her own md or others should her condition not improve.none of the three emergency department physicians is castillo regular physician.further,the emergency services department discharge instructions given to castillo on october,explicitly state that t he examination and treatment you received today in the emergency services department has been rendered on an emergency basis.it is not intended to be a substitute for comprehensive medical attention.emphasis added.although the instructions provided that castillo was to return to the emergency services department if she could not reach the appropriate physician for care,they further stated that she should return immediately to the nearest emergency room for any emergency.id.e
