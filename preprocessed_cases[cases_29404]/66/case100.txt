introduction 
a.the underlying case,lakens fryer group 
in july,the lakens filed suit against attorney ronald bayer and several other defendants to recover money lost in a confidence scheme,in which the perpetrators of the fraud paid interest to early investors using money received from later investors in february,westport filed the instant declaratory judgment action.after some initial confusion resulting from westport failure to note that its declaratory judgment action was related to the lakens suit against bayer,both cases proceeded separately before the same district court judge.in september,after the conclusion of the nonjury trial in lakens fryer group,but before the district court issued its decision,the court ordered that westport declaratory judgment action would be determined on the basis of the record in lakens fryer group a brief recitation of the factual background of that underlying case is therefore a necessary part of our opinion here.
in november,leonard brown,a friend and sometime client of bayer,invested with keith fryer,who claimed to run a secondary mortgage business in england.fryer gave brown a promissory note bearing percent interest.fryer told brown that the very high financing rates in england allowed him to pay investors high rates of interest.fryer did not,in fact,run a mortgage business.rather,he used some of brown money to make the interest payments to brown and kept the rest for himself.
brown was pleased with the payments he received on his investment and proposed to fryer that brown bring in other investors in return for a commission.brown recruited another finder and retained bayer as his attorney to negotiate a commission arrangement with fryer.bayer negotiated an agreement that paid the finders a five percent commission each year on the additional money invested with fryer as a result of the finders activities.bayer received of the commissions.bayer himself invested heavily with fryer.
for the next several years fryer maintained the pretense that he ran a real mortgage business.brown hosted gatherings to which he invited prospective investors and at which fryer would present his nonexistent business as an investment opportunity.bayer attended these gatherings,sometimes introduced fryer,and generally promoted the investment.
morton and alan laken,father and son,attended such a gathering.they each purchased installment notes issued by one of fryer dummy corporations,park securities.they made their initial investments at bayer law office.together they purchased a total of worth of installment notes 
fryer confidence scheme lasted until,when some new investors insisted on an independent audit of fryer accounts.this audit exposed fryer fraud.
the lakens sued bayer,the fryer group of companies,and several other defendants for misrepresentation and fraud,among other things.over time the lakens learned that all defendants except bayer were fictitious,bankrupt,or otherwise judgment proof.bayer himself filed for bankruptcy before the lakens action against him reached trial.the bankruptcy filing automatically stayed the trial in the lakens suit against bayer.the lakens eventually obtained an order lifting the stay when they agreed to limit any damages they might receive to those available under bayer professional liability insurance policy with westport.westport then filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment that bayer westport policy provides no coverage for the lakens claims against bayer.
the lakens suit against bayer finally came to trial before the district court on september.on november,the court issued its decision.the court found for the lakens and against bayer on the lakens negligent misrepresentation claims and entered judgment in the lakens favor for.
in its decision,the district court found the following facts regarding bayer actions and his relationship to the lakens.bayer was fryer point of contact in america.bayer introduced fryer to potential investors at investment presentations.bayer enthusiastically endorsed the investment opportunity offered by fryer.he received funds from american investors and forwarded them to fryer in england.bayer received of the finders commissions on investments they solicited.he was authorized to draw checks on fryer american business account in emergencies.at one point,bayer suggested that arrangements be made to give investors greater security in their loans,such as blanket debentures covering all assets of the fryer companies,but the idea was dropped when fryer said that any such arrangement would require a reduction in the interest rates paid to the investors.
the court also found that the lakens never retained bayer to act as their attorney,but bayer a longtime attorney of the lakens friend,brown created the impression that he was looking out for the lakens interests.he permitted the lakens to believe that he had checked out fryer activities and claimed to have performed a due diligence investigation.he let it be known that he had gone to england as part of the investigation.the lakens relied on the information they received from bayer.
the trial court concluded that these facts provided a basis for bayer liability 
in my view,the circumstances give rise to the legal obligation on the part of bayer,either to make clear that he was not protecting plaintiffs interests and that they should seek legal advice elsewhere,or to exercise reasonable care to avoid misrepresentations to them.since he did neither,he is liable for their losses if their reliance upon his misrepresentations was reasonable.
the issue of justifiable reliance is a close one,but i believe the balance tips in favor of the plaintiffs on that issue.although they did no independent investigation of their own,they were led to believe,by persons they trusted,that the proposed investment had been thoroughly investigated by others more knowledgeable than themselves.

b.the policy 
bayer is the named insured on his lawyers professional liability insurance policy with airy insurance company,a predecessor to westport.airy issued the policy pursuant to bayer application.that application included a supplemental practice application which directed bayer to describe any financial planning or investment counseling that formed part of his practice.on this form,bayer answered no to questions asking whether his practice involved money management activities or recommending investment in specific securities.however,he described his activities regarding the park securities investments in an addendum he attached to his application 
k indly be advised that park securities,a mortgage company in manchester,england,borrows money from individuals to be used in its mortgage portfolio.i prepare the notes from the investors to park securities.the distribution of the investment income was,for a period of time,in,being wired to me,in bulk,and thereafter sent to the individual parties by my personal check.the current method of distribution of investment income is by wire to the mortgage company bank i n philadelphia with distribution being made by checks signed by the principal of the company.i do have deputy authority on the checking account for use in emergencies.i do not counsel the investors except to advise them to pay income tax on the funds since the mortgage company does not send.i do receive compensation for my work in cabling the funds and preparing the documents in the form of an override.
the insuring agreement of the policy issued to bayer declares that the policy provides coverage for claims against bayer arising out of services rendered or which should have been rendered by any insured and arising out of the conduct of the insured profession as a lawyer.
the policy contains two exclusions that are relevant to this lawsuit.exclusion e states that the policy does not apply to any claim arising out of any insured activities as an officer,director,partner,manager or employee of any company,corporation,operation,organization or association other than the named insured.exclusion g precludes claims arising out of or in connection with the conduct of any business enterprise other than the named insured which is owned by any insured or in which any insured is a partner,or which is directly or indirectly controlled,operated or managed by any insured either individually or in a fiduciary capacity.
proceedings in westport declaratory judgment action 
in its declaratory judgment action,westport asserted that the lakens claims arose from bayer activities in a business enterprise separate from his law practice,an enterprise in which he solicited investors and served as a local representative for fryer.westport argued that the insuring agreement in the policy,or either of the exclusions mentioned above,precluded coverage for the lakens claims against bayer.
relying on the evidentiary record from the lakens suit against bayer,the federal district court found the following facts relevant to westport action for declaratory judgment in all his contacts with the lakens,bayer considered himself to be practicing law as an attorney representing fryer in the united states and receiving contingency fees based on the results he obtained for fryer the lakens regarded bayer as engaged in performing legal services in his capacity as an attorney in all relevant activities,bayer held himself out to the lakens as a practicing attorney and realized that they dealt with him on that basis and bayer was never an officer,director,partner,manager or employee of anyone other than himself.
based upon these findings,the court concluded that,although there probably was not an actual attorney client relationship between bayer and the lakens,bayer policy covered the claims against him by the lakens.the district court also stated that the addendum to bayer application removed any doubt that bayer policy with westport covered the lakens claims.having issued its policy pursuant to bayer application,westport can not now disclaim coverage for liabilities arising from the precise activities thus described.the court ordered westport liable to pay the judgment rendered against bayer in lakens fryer group to the extent of policy limits,which in the body of the opinion it determined to be 
ii.discussion 
the district court sat as fact finder in this case.we review the court findings for clear error.see.a.in their briefs to this court,both parties profess to accept and rely upon the district court findings of fact.we note,however,that in places their representations of those facts are quite different from one another and from those of the district court.we consider it important,therefore,to state clearly that our review of the record in this case,including the lakens fryer group trial transcript,shows no clear error in the district court findings of fact.
interpretation of the insurance policy coverage is a question of law and our review is plenary.pacific indem.linn,cir.pennsylvania law governs our interpretation of this insurance policy and the extent of its coverage.we read policies to avoid ambiguities,if possible.northbrook ins.kuljian,cir.
a.the insuring agreement 
the insuring agreement states that the policy covers claims arising out of services rendered or which should have been rendered by any insured and arising out of the conduct of the insured profession as a lawyer.westport argues that the lakens claims did not arise out of bayer conduct as a lawyer and,therefore,the policy does not cover bayer liability for those claims 
citing a ninth circuit appellate decision,general accident ins.namesnik,cir,and a federal district court case from north carolina,smith travelers indem,westport contends that bayer policy covers only those claims that arise from acts or omissions unique to the practice of law.westport argues that the district court findings in lakens fryer group demonstrate that bayer liability to the lakens does not stem from failure to do anything related to uniquely legal skill or training.thus,according to westport,bayer liability is not covered by the insuring agreement.
we reject this argument.we note,as an initial matter,that neither namesnik nor smith applies pennsylvania law.in addition,namesnik does not stand for the proposition that a lawyer professional liability insurance policy covers only claims arising from acts unique to the practice of law.smith better supports westport argument,but we ultimately find it unpersuasive.
in namesnik,an attorney had recommended to his clients that they invest in corporations which he formed,operated,and for which he performed legal work.at the same time,the attorney continued to perform legal services for the clients.he billed the clients for that legal work,but not for any work performed in the financial ventures.when the clients lost the money they had invested,they brought a legal malpractice claim against the attorney and the insurer sought a declaratory judgment of noncoverage.the district court granted summary judgment to the insurer and the ninth circuit court of appeals affirmed.the ninth circuit determined that the lack of fees directly traceable to the investments,at a time when fees were billed for legal services supported the insurer contention that the clients claims against the attorney stemmed from his actions as a business agent rather than a lawyer.namesnik,at.the court held that the clients failure to respond directly to this evidence left no genuine issues of material fact,making summary judgment for the insurer appropriate.
namesnik does not require that the lakens claims stem from an act by bayer that required uniquely legal skill or training.if namesnik is applicable at all to the case before us,it merely requires that the lakens present evidence that bayer provided professional services from which the lakens claims arise.the facts found by the district court support the conclusion that the lakens presented such evidence.
in smith,a federal district court,citing a helpful new jersey supreme court case,determined that an attorney did not act in a legal capacity when he solicited,and then invested,funds from a.at.the court based its decision,in part,on its determination that the transaction itself is one that requires no legal skill or training.we conclude,however,that whatever persuasive authority that case provides is overcome by the following analysis which applies pennsylvania law.
bayer policy does not define what it means for an injury to aris e out of the conduct of the insured profession as a lawyer.the pennsylvania appellate courts have determined that use of the undefined phrase professional services may well give rise to a finding of ambiguity in an insurance policy.bi
