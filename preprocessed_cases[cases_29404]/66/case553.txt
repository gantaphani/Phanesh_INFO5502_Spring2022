the civil practice and remedies code requires a health care liability claimant to serve expert reports on providers within days after filing suit.if the claimant does not serve the report within days,the trial court must grant the affected party motion to dismiss the claim,and the failure to do so is subject to interlocutory appeal.if,however,the claimant report is timely but deficient,the trial court may grant a single,thirty day extension to cure that deficiency,and the order granting that extension may not be appealed.we must decide whether a defendant may immediately appeal when a trial court both denies a motion to dismiss and grants the claimant a thirty day extension to cure expert reports that,although served timely,are deficient.we conclude that the statute prohibits such an appeal.
factual and procedural background 
john burke matthews was admitted to heart hospital of austin on september.several days into his hospitalization,jan ogletree,a urologist,performed a urinary catheterization procedure on matthews.ogletree is alleged to have inserted the catheter negligently,causing matthews to suffer traumatic bruising,bladder perforation,and acute renal failure.matthews died on october.
plaintiffs nancy kay matthews and luann matthews brought a health care liability claim against ogletree and heart hospital of austin complaining of matthews medical care.pursuant to texas civil practice and remedies code section,the plaintiffs timely filed expert reports from richard karsh,a radiologist nurse alexandria burwell and nurses marilyn bignell and walli carranza.civ.prac.a.karsh report was directed solely to ogletree care although it did not mention him by name.karsh noted that matthews showed major extravasation of contrast,almost certainly representing a very significant bladder perforation i t is not even certain from an standpoint that the foley catheter is in the bladder.he continued 
in my opinion but i would have to defer to a urologist on this given the inability of the nursing staff to pass the foley catheter into the bladder and the necessity for the urologist to utilize a stiff metallic wire to traverse the urethra,such manipulation and catheterization should have been performed under fluoroscopic guidance.had that been done the perforation might well have been avoided but certainly could have diagnosed sic at the outset,with the likelihood of a smaller tear having resulted.
if not recognized in a timely manner,such a tear could lead to problems,including bladder or,if a urethral tear,urethral dysfunction,infection.it is apparent that a cystogram was performed shortly after the catheterization,although the exact timetable is unclear nor do i have records to determine whether or not the response of the physician to the tear was appropriate.of course,those might be best reviewed by a urologist.
the nurses reports were directed primarily to the care provided by the nursing staff at the hospital,although they outlined various alleged failures by ogletree to adhere to the standard of care as well.
ogletree timely objected to the sufficiency of the expert reports and moved to dismiss the case.ogletree asserted that a radiologist was incapable of opining on a urologist standard of care and that no curriculum vitae was attached to the expert report as the statute requires.civ.prac.a.ogletree also complained that the nurses reports did not satisfy chapter requirement that an expert testifying against a physician must be practicing medicine,id.a,something nurses may not do.
the hospital did not object to the reports within the statutory day period,but moved to dismiss nonetheless.civ.prac.a.the hospital contended that because the nurses reports lacked a physician opinion on causation,they were,as expert reports,not merely deficient,but nonexistent.because its motion to dismiss was based on the nonexistence of an expert report,rather than a complaint about the report sufficiency,the hospital contends that no objection was required.
the trial court found that the radiologist report was deficient,denied ogletree motion to dismiss,and granted the plaintiffs a thirty day extension to cure deficiencies.see.civ.prac.c.the court also denied the hospital motion,finding that the nurses reports implicated the hospital conduct and that the hospital failure to timely object to the reports sufficiency within days waived any objection.ogletree and the hospital brought an interlocutory appeal of the trial court order.see.civ.prac.a.
the court of appeals held that it lacked jurisdiction over ogletree appeal because the trial court denial of his motion to dismiss was coupled with the grant of an extension to cure the deficient reports.the court reasoned that ogletree could not sever the denial of the motion to dismiss from the grant of the extension and concluded that permitting an appeal to the denial would negate the statutory language prohibiting an appeal from an order granting an extension.id.as to the hospital,the court of appeals held that the hospital waived its objections to any deficiencies in the report and affirmed the trial court order denying the motion to dismiss.id.at.we granted the petitions for review.
discussion 
in,the legislature amended the statutes governing health care liability claims.act of june,ch.laws.as amended,texas civil practice and remedies code section provides that,within days of suit,a plaintiff must serve expert reports for each physician or health care provider against whom a liability claim is asserted.civ.prac.a.these reports must identify the applicable standards of care,the manner in which the care rendered by the physician or health care provider failed to meet the standards,and the causal relationship between that failure and the injury,harm,or damages claimed.civ.prac.r.if a plaintiff does not serve a timely report,a trial court shall grant the defendant motion to dismiss the case with prejudice.an order that denies all or part of the relief sought in such a motion may be immediately appealed.civ.prac.a authorizing interlocutory appeal from order that denies all or part of the relief sought by a motion under section b,b.but if a report is served,e ach defendant physician or health care provider whose conduct is implicated must file and serve any objection to the sufficiency of the report not later than the day after the date it was served,failing which all objections are waived.id.a.finally,i f an expert report has not been served within days because elements of the report are found deficient,the court may grant one extension to the claimant in order to cure the deficiency,id.c,and that decision may not be appealed,id.a an appeal may not be taken from an order granting an extension under section.
deficient reports 
ogletree argues that as a radiologist,karsh may not opine on a urologist standard of care and,therefore,no report was served that met the statutory definition of an expert report.see.civ.prac.because no report was served,he contends the trial court had no discretion to grant a thirty day extension,and that its denial of the motion to dismiss should therefore be immediately appealable.
that is not how the legislature drafted the statute,however.as the court of appeals noted,the predecessor statute allowed a discretionary thirty day extension for good cause and a mandatory thirty day grace period upon a showing that the failure to file a conforming report was due to accident or mistake and was not intentional or due to conscious indifference.at citing former.stat.the amendments,on the other hand,created a deadline within which expert reports must be served.if no report is served within the day deadline provided by a,the legislature denied trial courts the discretion to deny motions to dismiss or grant extensions,and a trial court refusal to dismiss may be immediately appealed.civ.prac.b stating that a trial court shall dismiss a claim when expert reports are not served within days.civ.prac.a authorizing interlocutory appeal of the denial of a motion to dismiss filed under b.this strict day deadline can lead to seemingly harsh results.see,thoyakulathu brennan,no pet.holding that expert report had not be
