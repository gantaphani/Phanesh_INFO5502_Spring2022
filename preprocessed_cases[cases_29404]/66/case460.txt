introduction 
plaintiff fern jacobs appeals a summary judgment in favor of defendant grossmont hospital on jacobs complaint for professional negligence and premises liability.the action arose when jacobs,following an unsuccessful suicide attempt,tripped and sustained injuries while at grossmont hospital during a hold under welfare and institutions code section,which allows temporary detention of mentally disordered individuals who pose a danger either to themselves or to others,for treatment and evaluation.the court granted summary judgment for grossmont hospital on the ground that the immunity of section applied to all civil tort liability related to an admission under a lawful section hold.
the issue before us is the scope of the immunity granted under section to i ndividuals authorized to detain.jacobs maintains that the immunity applies only to the decision to detain a person for a hold.grossmont hospital contends that if the decision to detain is lawful,that is,supported by probable cause,then the immunity applies to all evaluation and treatment that may occur during the detention,with the possible exception of extreme or outrageous acts not rationally related to either a therapeutic purpose or necessary to maintain the detention for the required period.
we conclude that in order to effectuate the legislature purpose to obtain prompt evaluation and treatment for persons detained pursuant to a hold,the immunity of section applies to individuals who initiate and maintain a detention under section.however,we further conclude that section does not confer immunity for negligent or other wrongful conduct that may occur in the evaluation or treatment of involuntarily detained patients.accordingly,we reverse the summary judgment.
factual and procedural background 
jacobs attempted suicide by overdosing on medication.the medical staff at grossmont hospital emergency room determined that jacobs posed a danger to herself and placed her on a hold under section.they also contacted jacobs primary care physician,who requested that jacobs be admitted to grossmont hospital for treatment related to her overdose.during the hold,pursuant to a doctor orders,a nurse assisted jacobs as she walked down the hospital corridor.jacobs was wearing a rubber slipper that caught on the floor,causing her to fall and fracture a bone in her leg.
jacobs sued grossmont hospital for professional negligence and premises liability.her professional negligence claim alleged that grossmont hospital negligently and carelessly failed to supervise and monitor plaintiff while she was making a doctor ordered walk down the hospital corridor and that defendants knew,or in exercise of reasonable care for plaintiff safety should have known,that plaintiff was likely to fall while walking as a result of her physical and mental condition.her premises liability claim alleged that she slipped and fell because grossmont hospital negligently,carelessly and recklessly entrusted,managed,maintained,controlled,inspected and supervised said premises so as to allow a substance to be on the floor where plaintiff was walking.
grossmont hospital moved for summary judgment on the ground that jacobs causes of action were barred by the immunity provisions of section.grossmont hospital maintained that because jacobs injuries occurred during treatment and evaluation provided in connection with a lawfully initiated hold,it was immune from liability.jacobs opposed the motion,arguing that the immunity provided by section applied only to the decision to detain a person,but did not provide blanket immunity for negligent or wrongful acts that may occur during the detention.alternatively,she argued that her admission to grossmont hospital was independent of the hold,and was thus outside the scope of the immunity conferred by section,because her admission had been authorized by her primary care physician.
after a hearing,the court granted summary judgment on the basis that section provides immunity from all civil tort liability related to an admission pursuant to a section hold the court concluded that if the initial detention was lawful,that is,supported by probable cause,there could be no civil liability for anything that might occur during the detention.the court further ruled that no separate admission by jacobs primary care physician had occurred so as to create liability outside the immunity of section.
discussiona.standard of review 
under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c,summary judgment is proper where the papers submitted establish that no triable issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.on appeal,the reviewing court exercises its independent judgment,deciding whether the moving party established undisputed facts that negate the opposing party claim or state a complete defense.romano rockwell,cal th,d,see also regents of university of california superior court cal th,d.the propriety of summary judgment in this case depends on whether the immunity provided by section applies to grossmont hospital on the undisputed facts presented.
involuntary detention of the mentally disordered and exemption from liability under the act

jacobs does not challenge grossmont hospital decision to detain her,in essence conceding that her involuntary detention was supported by probable cause and was therefore lawful under section.rather,she argues that under the plain language of section,the immunity applies only to the decision to detain a person,and not to acts that occur after the person is detained.
section,titled exemption from liability,provides in part 
individuals authorized under this part to detain a person for treatment and evaluation pursuant to article commencing with section shall not be held either criminally or civilly liable for exercising this authority in accordance with the law.italics added.
section clearly grants immunity to those individuals authorized to detain a person for a hold.this includes peace officers,members of the attending staff at designated facilities,certain members of a mobile crisis team and other professionals designated by the county.see ford norton th,d.however,the language of section is arguably ambiguous as to the scope of the immunity conferred.therefore,this court must determine whether the immunity provision of section pertains only to the decision to detain as jacobs alleges,to the detention itself and its inherent attributes,or to anything that may occur in the course of evaluation and treatment provided during the period as grossmont hospital claims.in order to make this determination,the court must apply basic principles of statutory construction.
