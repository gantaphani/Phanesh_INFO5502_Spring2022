jackson donahue is a law corporation owned by glenn jackson.j d is primarily involved in the defense of insureds in workers compensation litigation.in early,golden eagle hired j d to represent it and its insureds in workers compensation cases as one of its panel counsel.before beginning work for golden eagle,jackson,on behalf of his firm,acknowledged and agreed to golden eagle litigation handling procedures for panel counsel the guidelines by returning a signed copy of the guidelines to golden eagle.one purpose of the guidelines was to provide billing instructions for the firm.the guidelines authorized golden eagle to conduct audits of j d,utilizing both independent legal bill auditing firms and internal teams of auditors,claims personnel lawyers.
in his declaration in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,jackson stated he felt that he had the right to object to the auditors selected,and withhold his approval and cooperation,if the auditors assigned to perform the audit were incompetent or biased or,for whatever reason,including lack of sufficient pay,did not intend to spend the time necessary to adequately analyze the billing records.in addition,jackson felt he had the right to discuss with golden eagle any objections he had to either the auditor or the procedures employed.the guidelines,however,state only that the audit would be based upon solely the work quality,reporting and time and costs disbursements.
during the period of february,to june,j d submitted bills to golden eagle for legal fees in the amount of and expenses in the amount of.j d utilized a fee schedule for certain tasks,set monetary charges for specific tasks,rather than using billing,on invoices to golden eagle.although jackson disputed that the guidelines prohibited the submission of legal bills with entries,he conceded that the guidelines provided that block billing is unacceptable and will not be paid.
in january,golden eagle informed j d that it would be audited and hired stuart maue to do the work.stuart maue is engaged in the business of legal auditing.from july through july,john decker of stuart maue conducted an audit at jackson office.according to jackson,decker spent a total of about fifteen hours reviewing one hundred twenty three requested files.in august,stuart maue submitted its audit report to golden eagle.decker analysis of j d billing statements resulted in the classification of as unverified fees and as unverified expenses.thereafter,j d and golden eagle entered into a settlement on the fee dispute.golden eagle stopped referring cases to j d after stuart maue issued the audit report.
j d first amended complaint alleges claims of breach of contract,negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,fraud and deceit,defamation,intentional interference with contract and prospective business advantage,and unfair competition and false advertising.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant on all claims.j d appeals the grant of summary judgment on the causes of action for negligence,fraud,defamation,and unfair competition.in addition,jackson appeals the district court ruling that he lacked standing on the defamation claim.

to whom did stuart maue duty of care run 
under california law,t he threshold element of a cause of action for negligence is the existence of a duty to use due care toward an interest of another that enjoys legal protection against unintentional invasion whether this essential prerequisite to a negligence cause of action has been satisfied in a particular case is a question of law.adelman associated international insurance,th,d.in biakanja irving,cal d,the california supreme court undertook to create a checklist of factors to consider in assessing the existence of a legal duty of one party to another in the absence of privity of contract between them.in biakanja,the defendant notary public had prepared the will of plaintiff brother which left the entire estate to the plaintiff.due to defendant negligence,the will was improperly attested and could not be admitted to probate.as a result,plaintiff received only her intestate share of the estate.the court concluded that defendant owed a duty of reasonable care to plaintiff which he had clearly breached.in reaching this conclusion,the court was careful not to declare an unlimited scope of liability in favor of any person who might have received a benefit under a contract but for its negligent performance.the court emphasized that the end and aim of the transaction was to benefit the plaintiff biakanja and the injury to her from irving negligence was clearly foreseeable.id.at.
the determination whether in a specific case the defendant will be held liable to a third person not in privity is a matter of policy and involves the balancing of various factors,among which are the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to him,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,and the policy of preventing future harm.
id.this test has been used in cases applying biakanja to impose a duty of care and liability in negligence for its breach,in a variety of contexts.see,lucas hamm,cal d,attorney who undertakes to draft or prepare a will owes a duty not only to the testator but also to the testator intended beneficiary to complete the task in a manner which will achieve the testator purpose connor great western savings loan,cal d,applying the biakanja factors to find that a construction lender owed a duty to third party home buyers to discover and prevent major defects in homes the construction of which it financed because,by virtue of its position,it exercised control over the quality of the construction roberts ball,hunt,hart,brown baerwitz,d.attorney,in giving a written opinion to a client,which the attorney knew would be transmitted to and relied upon by a third party in dealing with the client,owed a duty of care to such third party in providing advice to the client because the third party anticipated reliance was the end and aim of the transaction gregory,cal d,contractor liable to lessee of premises for negligent delay in construction because injury from delay was foreseeable and circumstances established a special relationship between contractor and lessee even though they were not in privity of contract.as a group,these cases establish the principle that where the end and aim of the contractual transaction between a defendant and the contracting party is the achievement or delivery of a benefit to a known third party or the protection of that party interests,then liability will be imposed on the defendant for his or her negligent failure to carry out the obligations undertaken in the contract even though the third party is not a party thereto.adelman,th at,d.
bily arthur young,cal th,d,the case relied upon by the district court,has arguably limited the application of the biakanja principles.in bily,the california supreme court emphasized that there were three policy concerns that had to be considered before a duty could be found under the biakanja factors liability may in particular cases be out of proportion to fault parties should be encouraged to rely on their own ability to protect themselves through their own prudence,diligence and contracting power and the potential adverse impact on the class of defendants upon whom the duty is imposed.cal th at,d.bily involved plaintiffs who invested in a computer company that went bankrupt.the plaintiffs alleged they made their investment in reliance on the positive audit opinion of the defendant,an accounting firm.the case was before the california supreme court on appeal from a decision of the court of appeals that affirmed the trial court judgment of professional negligence against the defendants.
in bily,the court opined t he threshold element of a cause of action for negligence is the existence of a duty to use due care id.at.applying the biakanja factors,the court declined to permit all merely foreseeable third party users of audit reports to sue the auditor on a theory of professional negligence for the following three reasons.first,given that the watchdog role of an auditor is secondary,the complexity of the professional opinions rendered in audit reports,and the difficult and potentially tenuous causal relationships between audit reports and economic losses from investment and credit decisions,the auditor exposed to negligence claims from all foreseeable third parties faces potential liability far out of proportion to its fault.id.at.second,the generally more sophisticated class of plaintiffs in auditor liability cases,business lenders and investors permits the effective use of contract rather than tort liability to control and adjust the relevant risks through private ordering.id.for example,a third party might commission its own audit or investigation,thus establishing privity between itself and an auditor or investigator to whom it could look for protection.id.at.third,the court determined that reliance upon foreseeability alone was insufficient that auditor liability to merely foreseeable third parties would encourage dislocations of resources,including increased expense and decreased availability of auditing services in some sectors of the economy id.at.
another case the district court found controlling was decided sixteen years before bily,but anticipated its holding.in goodman kennedy,cal d,the court reviewed the biakanja factors before holding an attorney duty lies solely with the client and does not extend to any other third party.goodman involved plaintiffs who purchased stock in a company and later claimed that the defendants failed to disclose facts that affected the value of the stock.the defendant was the attorney for the corporation issuing the stock.after reviewing the factors in biakanja,the court held the defendants did not have a duty of care to the plaintiffs,who dealt with the attorney client in an arm length transaction,because to impose liability in such circumstances would inject undesirable reservations into the attorney counseling role.the attorney preoccupation or concern with the possibility of claims based on mere negligence as distinct from fraud or malice by any with whom his client might deal would prevent him from devoting his entire energies to his client interests.id.at.
the california and federal courts have applied the bily rationale to other suppliers and evaluators of information.for example,in the california supreme court reviewed the biakanja factors and applied bily to title insurers in quelimane,stewart title guaranty,cal th,d.the california supreme court reiterated its rationale for bily when it stated 
i n the business arena it would be unprecedented to impose a duty on one actor to operate its business in a manner that would ensure the financial success of transactions between third parties.with rare exceptions,a business entity has no duty to prevent financial loss to others with whom it deals directly.a fortiori,it has no greater duty to prevent financial losses to third parties who may be affected by its operations.

while j d argues that bily only applies to financial audits,rather than attorney billing audits,the california supreme court did not make the distinction j d urges.rather,the cases discussed indicated that the limitations bily placed on the biakanja factors apply widely to those who supply or evaluate information to limit their liability to even foreseeable third parties who have an interest in their work product.thus we hold the district court did not err when it concluded that bily dictated its negligence analysis,resulting in a finding that stuart maue owed j d no duty of care.
is j d a third party beneficiary of the contract between golden eagle and stuart maue 
j d contends that,even if bily applies,the district court erred in finding that j d did not fit within the exceptions to the bily rule.the district court held j d does not fit into the third party beneficiary exception because the audit engagement contract between stuart maue and golden eagle does not identify it as a third party beneficiary.further,the district court held that j d can not recover on the negligent misrepresentation exception because it did not present any credible evidence of reasonable reliance.
the district court was correct that,under bily,j d is not a third party beneficiary of the audit engagement contract between stuart maue and golden eagle.bily expressly held that an auditor liability for general negligence in the conduct of an audit is confined to the client,the person who contracts for or engages the audit services.cal th at,d at.the court,however,opined in a footnote that clients may include third party beneficiaries 
it is possible the audit engagement contract might expressly identify a particular third party or parties so as to make them express third party beneficiaries of the contract.third party beneficiaries may under appropriate circumstances possess the rights of parties to the contract this case presents no third party beneficiary issue.the auditor was engaged by the client to provide audit reporting to the client.no third party is identified in the engagement contract.therefore,we have no occasion to decide whether and under what circumstances express third party beneficiaries of audit engagement contracts may recover as clients under our holding.
cal th at,d at,internal citations omitted.in addition,as a matter both of policy and or reality there are no express third party beneficiaries of an ordinary,audit engagement contract.there are only incidental beneficiaries who have no legal rights arising from the contract.mariani price waterhouse,th,d.here,there is no allegation that j d is identified or impliedly recognized as a third party beneficiary to the audit engagement contract.golden eagle retained stuart maue to determine if j d billings were in accordance with golden eagle guidelines.if anything,the relationship between stuart maue and j d could best be described as investigatory if not antagonistic.in short,there is nothing to suggest that j d was anything other than an incidental beneficiary of the work stuart maue performed for golden eagle.
the court in bily also noted there is another class of people who,although are not clients,may recover on a theory of negligent misrepresentation rather than negligence because they may re
