maria del carmen mejia plaintiff appeals from a judgment of nonsuit in favor of community hospital of san bernardino respondent or respondent hospital,one of several defendants in her medical malpractice complaint.plaintiff argues that there was sufficient evidence that the negligent physician was the ostensible agent of respondent to survive the motion for a nonsuit.we agree and reverse,concluding that a nonsuit on the issue of ostensible agency was improper because plaintiff sought treatment at respondent hospital and there was no evidence that she should have known that the negligent physician was not an agent of respondent.

discussion 
on appeal,plaintiff argues that respondent was not entitled to a nonsuit because there was a triable issue as to whether the negligent radiologist was the ostensible agent of respondent.we agree.
national trend 
for the last century,courts throughout the country have struggled with the issue of whether hospitals are liable for the negligence of physicians.in doing so,they have confronted and cast aside two major impediments to liability.
the first impediment overcome was that of charitable immunity.early cases endowed hospitals with charitable immunity based on the theory that their funds should not be diverted from charitable purposes to pay tort damages.silva providence hospital of oakland cal d,silva simmons tuomey regional medical center,simmons clark southview hosp.family health ctr.ohio,clark.at that time,hospitals were true charities,providing minimal services to only the lowest classes of society.they were usually underfunded,dirty,crowded,and staffed by unpaid volunteer physicians who donated a few hours a week out of a sense of charity and for the unique opportunity to literally practice their skills on the poor.simmons,at clark,at.in substance,hospitals actually were nothing more than hotels providing rooms,buildings where private medical practitioners treat private patients paintsville hosp.rose,paintsville.
fortunately for all concerned,however,hospitals evolved.today,hospitals compete aggressively in providing the latest medical technology and the best facilities,as well as in attracting patients and physicians who will funnel patients to them.hospitals not only strive to be a source of pride in the local community,but they also seek to avoid operating at a financial loss.regardless of whether they are enterprises,they are run much like any large corporation and must operate in a fiscally responsible manner.like any business dependent upon attracting individual people as customers,hospitals in the aggregate spend billions to advertise their facilities and services in a variety of media,from newspapers and billboards to television and the internet.simmons,supra,at.as a result of this evolution,courts withdrew the protections of charitable immunity.silva,supra,cal d at,simmons,at clark,supra,at.
the second impediment overcome was that created by the application of the traditional rules of respondeat superior to skilled professionals,such as physicians.for many years the majority of courts followed the rule that physicians,because of their skill and training in a highly technical field,were not subject to control by hospital lay boards and thus could not be servants or employees in the sense required by the doctrine of respondeat superior.rather,physicians were classified as independent contractors with the result that the hospitals in which they labored could not be held vicariously liable for their medical mistakes.adamski tacoma general hospital,see also gilbert sycamore mun.hosp,gilbert.
courts soon realized,however,that the traditional emphasis on the master ability to control the servant was unrealistic in the context of the modern health care system.in an often cited passage,a new york court explained the conception that the hospital does not undertake to treat the patient,does not undertake to act through its doctors and nurses,but undertakes instead simply to procure them to act upon their own responsibility,no longer reflects the fact.hospitals,as their manner of operation plainly demonstrates,do far more than furnish facilities for treatment.they regularly employ on a salary basis a large staff of physicians,nurses and internes,as well as administrative and manual workers,and they charge patients for medical care and treatment,collecting for such services,if necessary,by legal action.certainly,the person who avails himself of hospital facilities expects that the hospital will attempt to cure him,not that its nurses or other employees will act on their own responsibility.bing thunig,see also gilbert,supra,at pamperin trinity memorial hosp,pamperin.in light of this modern reality,the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions employed ostensible or apparent agency to impose liability on hospitals for the negligence of independent contractor physicians.for comprehensive lists,see sword nkc hospitals,sword clark,supra,at.
although the cases discussing ostensible agency use various linguistic formulations to describe the elements of the doctrine,in essence,they require the same two elements conduct by the hospital that would cause a reasonable person to believe that the physician was an agent of the hospital,and reliance on that apparent agency relationship by the plaintiff.see,sword,supra,at pamperin,supra,at.
regarding the first element,courts generally conclude that it is satisfied when the hospital holds itself out to the public as a provider of care.butler domin,sword,supra,at.in order to prove this element,it is not necessary to show an express representation by the hospital.butler,at sword,at clark,supra,at gilbert,supra,at,reaffirmed in petrovich share health plan of illinois,pamperin,supra,at,jackson power alaska,fn,reaffirmed in ward lutheran hospitals homes soc.alaska,fn.ward adamski,supra,at.instead,a hospital is generally deemed to have held itself out as the provider of care,unless it gave the patient contrary notice.butler,at sword,at see also pamperin,at.many courts have even concluded that prior notice may not be sufficient to avoid liability in an emergency room context,where an injured patient in need of immediate medical care can not be expected to understand or act upon that information.simmons,supra,at sword,at clark,at,fn.
the second element,reliance,is established when the plaintiff looks to the hospital for services,rather than to an individual physician.butler,supra,at simmons,supra,at pamperin,supra,at jackson,supra,at.however,reliance need not be proven by direct testimony.clark,supra,at jackson,at,fn.see also pamperin,at i f a person voluntarily enters a hospital without objecting to his or her admission to the hospital,then that person is seeking care from the hospital itself.in fact,many courts presume reliance,absent evidence that the plaintiff knew or should have known the physician was not an agent of the hospital.butler,at sword,supra,at see also ward,supra,at,fn.in practice,however,few jurisdictions have required a showing of reliance.
as should be apparent to an astute observer,there is really only one relevant factual issue whether the patient had reason to know that the physician was not an agent of the hospital.as noted above,hospitals are generally deemed to have held themselves out as the provider of services unless they gave the patient contrary notice,and the patient is generally presumed to have looked to the hospital for care unless he or she was treated by his or her personal physician.thus,unless the patient had some reason to know of the true relationship between the hospital and the,because the hospital gave the patient actual notice or because the patient was treated by his or her personal agency is readily inferred.
most courts have arrived at a similar conclusion.for instance,the indiana supreme court observed that c entral to both of these is,the hospital manifestations and the patient the question of whether the hospital provided notice to the patient that the treating physician was an independent contractor and not an employee of the hospital.sword,supra,at see also butler,supra,at adopting sword.and some courts have expressly concluded that the plaintiff knowledge is the only relevant issue a hospital can be held vicariously liable for the negligent acts of a physician providing care at the hospital,regardless of whether the physician is an independent contractor,unless the patient knows,or should have known,that the physician is an independent contractor.gilbert,supra,at see also pamperin,supra,at grewe clemens general hospital,grewe in our view,the critical question is whether the plaintiff,at the time of his admission to the hospital,was looking to the hospital for treatment of his physical ailments or merely viewed the hospital as the situs where his physician would treat him for his problems.other courts have commented that the burden of proving ostensible agency in the hospital context has been so relaxed that it amounts to a nondelegable duty.ward,supra,at,fns.simmons,supra,at.the west virginia supreme court even went so far as to conclude that a hospital is estopped to deny an agency relationship whenever it makes emergency room services available to the public.torrence kusminsky,see also paintsville,supra,at the circumstances under which the hospital is liable are not unlimited.but the operation of a hospital emergency room open to the public,where the public comes expecting medical care to be provided through the normal operating procedures within the hospital,falls within the limits for application of the principles of ostensible agency and apparent authority.
this per se inference of ostensible agency actually follows logically from the evolution of the modern hospital described above.as the ohio supreme court explained in applying the traditional elements of ostensible agency in this way,those courts invariably recognize the status of the hospital and its role in contemporary society.not only is the hospital of today a large,business,but advances in medical technology have inevitably spawned increased specialization and industrialization.hospitals are the only place where the best equipment and facilities and a full array of medical services are available at any time without an appointment.with hospitals now being complex institutions,the emergency room has become the community medical center,serving as the portal of entry to the myriad of services available at the hospital.as an industry,hospitals spend enormous amounts of money advertising in an effort to compete with each other for the health care dollar,thereby inducing the public to rely on them in their time of medical need.the public,in looking to the hospital to provide such care,is unaware of and unconcerned with the technical complexities and nuances surrounding the contractual and employment arrangements between the hospital and the various medical personnel operating therein.indeed,often the very nature of a medical emergency precludes choice.public policy dictates that the public has every right to assume and expect that the hospital is the medical provider it purports to be.clark,supra,at see also butler,supra,at gilbert,supra,at pamperin,supra,at hardy brantley so d,the basic rationale is that,unless there is some reason for a patient to believe that the treating physician in a hospital is an independent contractor,it is natural for him to assume that he can rely upon the reputation of the hospital as opposed to any doctor,which is the reason he goes there in the first place.paintsville,supra,at.or,as more recently explained by the south carolina courts t he hospital itself has come to be perceived as the provider of medical services.according to this view,patients come to the hospital to be cured,and the doctors who practice there are the hospital instrumentalities,regardless of the nature of the private arrangements between the hospital and the physician.whether or not this perception is accurate seemingly matters little when weighed against the momentum of changing public perception and attendant public policy.simmons,supra,at.thus,because it is commonly believed that hospitals are the actual providers of care,ostensible agency can be readily inferred whenever someone seeks treatment at a hospital.
california law 
in california,ostensible agency is defined by statute.civil code section provides an agency is ostensible when the principal intentionally,or by want of ordinary care,causes a third person to believe another to be his agent who is not really employed by him.see also.civil code section further provides a principal is bound by acts of his agent,under a merely ostensible authority,to those persons only who have in good faith,and without want of ordinary care,incurred a liability or parted with value,upon the faith thereof.nominally,these statutes require proof of three elements first t he person dealing with the agent must do so with belief in the agent authority and this belief must be a reasonable one second such belief must be generated by some act or neglect of the principal sought to be charged third and the third person in relying on the agent apparent authority must not be guilty of negligence.stanhope coll.of chiropractic d,stanhope.of course,at heart,these three elements are the same as the two elements discussed above conduct by the hospital that would cause a reasonable person to believe there was an agency relationship and reliance on that apparent agency relationship by the plaintiff.
ostensible agency was first applied to a hospital in california under circumstances remarkably similar to the instant case.in stanhope,a large object fell on the plaintiff and he was rushed to the college of chiropractic which was only two blocks from his home.stanhope,supra,d at.the plaintiff had never been to the college before
