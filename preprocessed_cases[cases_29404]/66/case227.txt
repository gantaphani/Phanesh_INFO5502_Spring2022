first union national bank,as trustee of the southeast timber leasing statutory trust,se timber commenced this legal malpractice lawsuit against paul benham benham,a merger and acquisitions attorney,and his law firm,friday,eldredge clark,llp,for failure to timely file a lawsuit pursuant to ann.to determine the fair value of stock acquired by se timber during a merger with first land and timber corporation first land and timber.the district court excluded the proffered testimony of se timber legal expert,ruling that the expert lacked the qualifications necessary to testify regarding the applicable standard of care of an arkansas attorney.at the end of se timber case in chief,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of benham,holding that because se timber failed to present expert testimony,se timber was unable to prove that benham acts amounted to legal malpractice and se timber was unable to show as a matter of law that but for benham negligence,it could have won a trial concerning the fair value of the stock it acquired in the merger.se timber timely appealed the district court exclusion of its expert testimony and judgment as a matter of law in favor of benham.we reverse and remand to the district court for a new trial.
background 
in,first land and timber hired frank brown brown of brown and burke capital partners,to determine the fair price for all of its timberland and bank stock and arrange a sale of the stock.brown estimated the price at between million and million.brown formed se timber for the sole purpose of buying all of first land and timber stock and offered a price of million.se timber hired carl stoney stoney,a california merger and acquisitions attorney,to assist in the sale by arranging a merger between first land and timber and se timber.pursuant to the merger,se timber,as the surviving entity,would pay first land and timber stockholders million.this amount was approved as fair value by all but one of first land and timber stockholders,pictet overseas trust,as trustee of the henrietta jones trust hereinafter pictet.because stoney was not licensed to practice in arkansas,se timber hired benham,an arkansas attorney and partner in the law firm of friday,eldredge clark,llp,to represent it against pictet dissenters claim.benham informed pictet that he was representing se timber concerning pictet claims.
pictet wrote a letter to benham dated october,a copy of which was also sent to first land and timber,demanding a fair value estimate of first land and timber stock at million instead of million pictet also stated that the demand was made pursuant to ann,which allows a dissenting shareholder to reject the corporation offer of payment and notify the corporation in writing of its own estimate of the fair value of its shares.
se timber did not bring suit within days of pictet october,letter as required by ann.instead,on january,benham,on behalf of se timber,offered to pay pictet based on a fair value estimate of million.this offer was rejected on january,in a letter that was virtually identical to the letter sent by pictet on october.on january,benham advised se timber of pictet january,letter.according to benham,the january,letter triggered the rule under.benham did not advise se timber that the october,letter would trigger the rule.
benham initially advised se timber that arkansas law required pictet to file a lawsuit against se timber to obtain the fair value of million demanded in its letter.later,however,on february,benham advised se timber that required se timber to file a lawsuit to obtain a judicially derived fair value and avoid the amount demanded.se timber instructed benham to file suit on march.
in that suit,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of pictet,holding se timber failed to comply with by filing a lawsuit within days of the october,letter.se timber was ordered to pay pictet according to a fair value estimate of million,which resulted in pictet receiving more than the other stockholders.se timber was further ordered to pay pictet in costs and attorney fees 
se timber filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of arkansas against benham and friday,eldredge clark,llp,alleging legal malpractice.se timber filed a motion for summary judgment,which included the affidavit of charles owen owen,an arkansas attorney,who opined that benham conduct in representing se timber had fallen below the applicable standard of care.owen based his opinion,in part,upon benham failure to notify se timber that pictet october,letter complied with and benham failure to file a stock valuation suit within days of that letter as required by.in support of his opposition to summary judgment,benham submitted the affidavit of arkansas attorney john tisdale tisdale.tisdale opined that benham exercised reasonable skill and diligence as ordinarily used by other attorneys in good standing in arkansas.according to tisdale,pictet october,letter did not meet the requirements of a demand letter as required under and therefore the rule under was not triggered until receipt of the january,letter.the district court denied se timber motion for summary judgment,ruling that genuine fact issues remained concerning whether benham representation fell below the generally accepted standard of care.
se timber malpractice suit against benham proceeded to a jury trial on october.after having already denied a motion in limine to disqualify owen as an expert,the district court ruled him unqualified to testify under rule of the federal rules of evidence.according to the district court,owen lacked the experience or education relating to the standards and practice of an arkansas attorney for his testimony to show sufficient relevance and reliability under the facts and circumstances of this case.at the close of se timber case in chief,benham moved for judgment as a matter of law.the district court ruled that se timber was required to present expert testimony as to the relevant standard of practice of an arkansas attorney because the issue was not within the common knowledge of a lay person.the district court also determined that expert testimony was required to show whether se timber would have prevailed in the underlying stock valuation suit against pictet.because se timber proposed expert was disqualified,se timber presented no expert testimony on either issue.based upon these determinations,the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of benham.
se timber timely filed a notice of appeal,arguing that the district court abused its discretion by ruling owen unqualified to testify as an expert to the applicable standard of practice in arkansas erred in determining that the issue of legal malpractice in this case was not within the common knowledge exception and erred in ruling that as a matter of law,expert testimony was required to show that but for benham alleged negligence,the outcome of the underlying stock valuation law suit would have been different.
ii.discussion 
arkansas law legal malpractice 
we review the district court interpretation of state law de novo.vanderford penix,cir.under arkansas law,an attorney is negligent if he or she fails to exercise reasonable diligence and skill on behalf of a client.barnes everett,citations omitted.to prevail on its claim of attorney malpractice,se timber must show that benham conduct fell below the generally accepted standard of practice and that such conduct proximately caused se timber damages.id.to prove damages and proximate cause,se timber must show that,but for the alleged negligence of benham,the result in the underlying action would have been different.id.this requires se timber to prove a case within a case,or in other words,se timber must prove the merits of the underlying case as part of its proof of malpractice.id.arkansas law has consistently held that the attorney conduct must be measured against the generally accepted standard of practice.id.
an attorney is not liable to a client when,acting in good faith,he or she makes mere errors of judgment.moreover,an attorney is not,as a matter of law,liable for a mistaken opinion on a point of law that has not been settled by a court of the highest jurisdiction and on which reasonable attorneys may differ.
id.to prove its case to a jury,se timber had to present expert testimony as to what the standard of practice is,unless the district court determine d that such testimony wa s not necessary because the case falls within the exception.id.at.
in this case,the district court ruled that owen was not qualified to testify as an expert to the applicable standard of practice of an arkansas attorney and se timber claim failed as a matter of law because a the issue of legal malpractice in this case did not fall within the exception and b expert testimony was required to show that the outcome of the underlying lawsuit would have been different but for the alleged malpractice.we address these issues in turn.
admissibility of expert testimony 
we review the district court decision regarding the admissibility of testimony for an abuse of discretion.craftsmen limousine,ford motor,cir.federal rule of evidence governs the admission of expert testimony and provides 
if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,or experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise,if the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data,the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods,and the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.
we give district courts great latitude in determining whether expert testimony meets the reliability requisites of rule.craftsmen limousine,at.under rule,it is the trial judge,in admitting expert testimony,who has the gatekeeping responsibility to ensur e that an expert testimony both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.kumho tire carmichael,d citing daubert merrell dow,d.in making that determination,the district court may evaluate one or all of the following factors whether the theory or technique can be or has been tested whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication whether the theory or technique has a known or potential error rate and standards controlling the technique operation and whether the theory or technique is generally accepted in the scientific community.daubert,at.see also craftsmen limousine,at applying daubert to expert witness testimony in an antitrust case.regardless of what factors are evaluated,the main inquiry is whether the proffered expert testimony is sufficiently reliable.see unrein timesavers,cir t here is no single requirement for admissibility as long as the proffer indicates that the expert evidence is reliable and relevant.
the district court ruled that owen had not demonstrated the experience or the education to show sufficient reliability in his opinions.while acknowledging owen substantial experience in the merger and acquisition fields,the district court found that because owen conclusions were based on his own experience and not from the experience of other lawyers,his assessment of what a reasonable lawyer might do is insufficient.specifically,the district court reasoned that 
owen testified to substantial experience in the merger and acquisition fields.i think it fair to say that he has established expertise broadly in that area.what of the specific issues here,which is the knowledge about what a reasonable lawyer in arkansas would do with respect to complying with that statute as i interpreted his testimony,that comes from experience in two cases,and not from what other lawyers have done,but what he did,and from that concludes that a reasonable lawyer would do what he did.i do think that passes the test of having does mean his judgment is bad or that he would do it wrong.i talking not at all about that.i talking about his assessment of what a reasonable lawyer would do.it does not rely upon education,investigation,scholarly works,tests of any kind,special study that he has made as exhibited by writings.
no effort was made to learn the history of the statute why was this done how was it done what are the concepts that are being breathed into the statute hopefully are expressed well,hopefully will be interpreted rightly,as the legislature intended.
i mean it owen,when i say i mean no disrespect to you.but i am deserting my gatekeeping duty if i do say what i mean,and what i mean is,i think that in this circumstance,the issues involved in this case,that i must say you have not demonstrated the experience or the education to show sufficient relevance and reliability in your opinions relating to the issues,which are very tight,small,and may unimportant,but i mean small,specific issues that are at issue here.
emphasis added.
the district court ruling can not be reconciled with rule,which expressly allows a witness to qualify as an expert based on his own knowledge,skill,experience,training or education.see.we have excluded expert testimony because a proffered expert lacked personal experience in the area of testimony.see wheeling pittsburgh steel beelman river terminals,cir.in wheeling pittsburgh steel,we held that it was an abuse of discretion to allow a hydrologist to testify as an expert regarding safe warehousing practices.id.at.in so ruling,we reasoned that it was clear that a hydrologist specializing in flood risk management easily qualifies as an expert under federal rule of evidence and t hough eminently qualified to testify as an expert hydrologist regarding matters of flood risk management,the expert sorely lacked the education,employment,or other practical personal experiences to testify as an expert specifically regarding safe warehousing practices.id.emphasis added.
the district court ruling also attacks the factual basis of owen expert testimony.as a general rule,the factual basis of an expert opinion goes to the credibility of the testimony,not the admissibility,and it is up to the opposing party to examine the factual basis for the opinion in.only if the expert opinion is so fundamentally unsupported that it can offer no assistance to the jury must such testimony be excluded.bonner isp,cir quoting hose chicago northwestern transp,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.owen testimony was not so fundamentally unsupported that it can offer no assistance to the jury.
owen has been an attorney licensed in the state of arkansas for over years and has practiced extensively in the area of mergers and acquisitions.arkansas is the only state where owen has maintained a license.owen has previously received demand letters from dissenting shareholders and was familiar with and.he answered in the affirmative when asked whether his opinion refers to an attorney with reasonable diligence and the skill ordinarily used by attorneys.he answered in the affirmative when asked whether his experience made him aware of the reasonable degree of care that an attorney must apply in this case.in making his opinion,owen relied upon the depositions of the parties,the witnesses,the facts and circumstances surrounding se timber merger with first land and timber and acquisition of its stock,and his own experience.given these facts,we hold the district court abused its discretion in disallowing owen expert testimony on the issue of legal malpractice in arkansas 
judgment as a matter of law 
we review the grant or denial of judgment as a matter of law de novo,applying the same standards used by the district court.phillips collings,cir.according to rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,judgment as a matter of law should not be granted unless a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.a.in applying this standard,we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party without making credibility assessments or weighing the evidence.phillips,at citations omitted.a reasonable inference is one which may be drawn from the evidence without resort to speculation.fought hayes wheels int l,cir quoting,ekco group,cir.judgment as a matter of law is appropriate w hen the record contains no proof beyond speculation to support a verdict,at citation omitted.
the district court ruled that expert testimony is required to show se timber likelihood of success in the underlying action.in so ruling,the district court reasoned 
suffice it to say,mcdermott client here has shown that there would have been victory there.would that require expert evidence well,i suspect so i strongly suspect it would require expert damage,and it certainly requires some evidence that they would have won,not just they would have had evidence that the jury could have found for them if it had believed all its evidence and disbelieved all the others.i do think that would do so the evidence is insufficient here to show that there would have been victory for his side of the fight.
arkansas law does not require expert testimony to prove the likelihood of a different outcome in the underlying stock evaluation suit under arkansas law,the term fair value is recognized as also referring to value,fair cash value,market value,and full market value.sec.watson,discussing fair value under shareholder dissenter suit under.arkansas also recognizes that there is no set formula to determine the fair cash value of stock.id.citing victor broad,mahurin.relying on cases from other jurisdictions,arkansas has examined the following when determining fair value of stock asset value,earnings,dividends,management and e very relevant fact and circumstance which enters into the value of the corporate property and which reflects itself in the worth of corporate stock.sec,at citing phelps.moreover,the arkansas supreme court has held that a stock broker hired to value the shares of stock,and who actually did cause to be made an evaluation of the shares of stock,was a qualified witness to give sufficient evidence on the fair value of stock.sec,at.
the district court also misread barnes and vanderford,neither of which required expert testimony to prove the proximate cause element of a legal malpractice action.in barnes,the arkansas supreme court did not hold that expert testimony was required to prove whether the outcome of the underlying case would have been different,rather expert testimony was required to establish the applicable standard of practice of an attorney in arkansas for purposes of legal malpractice see barnes,at.the issue of expert evidence was never raised in vanderford,and we affirmed summary judgment on the basis that the malpractice plaintiff failed to present any evidence that the outcome of his action would have been different but for the alleged malpractice.vanderford,at.as we explained in justice carter,cir,a lthough the issue at hand in the malpractice case is a determination of the outcome of the underlying case,the jury in the malpractice case is permitted to decide this by substituting its judgment for the judgment of the factfinder,be it jury or judge,in the earlier case.
in its case in chief,se timber presented the video deposition of brown,who was engaged to make a value of se timber stock before the merger.brown testified to the facts and circumstances surrounding the merger,including the fact that he was hired to analyze what would be a fair price for all first land and timber timberland and bank stock.brown testified that the fair value of the stock of first land and timber at the time it agreed to sell it was no more than million.brown also testified that first land and timber directors accepted se timber million offer because it was the best offer.according to brown,there was no basis for pictet claim that the acquired stock was worth million.brown testimony was sufficient evidence of the fair value of the shares of first land and timber stock.accordingly,judgment as a matter of law was improper.
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we reverse and remand for a new trial consistent with the views expressed in this opinion.
i agree the district court improperly granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of benham with respect to both liability and damages,and i concur in the court decision to reverse and remand for a new trial.i also agree the district court abused its discretion when,on the grounds owen lacked the experience or education necessary to testify in this case regarding the standard of care required by a lawyer practicing in arkansas,it excluded the testimony of se timber legal expert,charles owen.
i do disagree,however,with the court failure to address whether the legal malpractice involved in this case fits within the exception,an issue the court states it need not address after determining the district court erred in excluding owen testimony.in my view,the one declining to address the exception does not necessarily follow from the other deciding the expert testimony issue.to the contrary,i view it as unnecessary to decide whether the district court erroneously excluded owen testimony if,in fact,the malpractice was so obvious expert testimony was unnecessary.by remanding for a new trial on both liability and damages,we are implicitly indicating there is a genuine issue of fact with respect to whether the conduct in this case fell below the applicable standard of care.because there are no genuine issues of material fact on such issue,i believe se timber should be saved the expense of a second trial on liability.i would,instead,remand with instructions to enter judgment as a matter of law in se timber favor on the issue of liability,and limit the scope of the second trial to the issue whether the legal malpractice caused se timber any damage.
there is no dispute lawyer benham missed the applicable statutory deadline for filing a fair valuation suit.as the court notes,se timber lost its fair valuation suit because it failed to file such timely.the district court presiding over the valuation suit specifically held pictet october,letter triggered se timber obligation to file suit within days 
pictet complied with in its october,letter by demanding payment of pictet own estimated fair value of its shares according to,se timber had sixty days from october,to commence a proceeding to resolve pictet claim.se timber did not commence this proceeding until march,two and months late to summarize,se timber clearly failed to pay pictet as required by the statute under,and clearly failed to commence a timely judicial proceeding under,the consequence of which is that se timber must pay pictet the amount it demanded on october,which is,plus interest.
the district court presiding over the fair valuation suit also noted the applicable statutory procedure is simple and straightforward.app.at.i agree.the arkansas business corporation act of the act,tit,ch,sets forth in a very straightforward manner the procedure a dissenting shareholder must undertake to assert dissenter rights under the act.likewise,the steps a corporation must consider in responding to a shareholder exercising dissenter rights are set forth in a straightforward manner.up until se timber failed to respond timely to pictet payment demands,both se timber and pictet precisely followed the procedures required by the act.
first,se timber informed pictet a vote on the merger would take place at a special shareholder meeting,and notified pictet of its dissenter rights in response,pictet notified se timber it would dissent from the merger and preserved its dissenter rights benham next provided notification of the approved merger and advised pictet it should make a demand for payment and deposit the certificates for the dissenting shares pictet timely certified it was the beneficial owner of shares of first land stock,demanded payment of the fair value of the shares,and deposited its share certificates 
upon receipt of pictet payment demand,the act required se timber to either a estimate the fair value of the stock and pay pictet for its shares within sixty days,or b return the share certificates to pictet se timber failed to pay pictet within days,triggering pictet statutory right to make its own fair value estimate 
pictet october letter specifically referred to the fact that s ix
