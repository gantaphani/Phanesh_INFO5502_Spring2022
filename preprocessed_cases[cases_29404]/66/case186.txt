this lawsuit arose out of a business partnership that went sour.glen hefferman,john pierre,and attorney yale bass were all involved in an car wash venture.hefferman contended that pierre stole that hefferman had invested in the car wash and deprived him of the value of his legal interest in the business he also claimed that pierre breached his fiduciary duty,committed fraud,and breached a contract.bass,hefferman charged,committed legal malpractice and aided,abetted,or otherwise participated in pierre fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.the district court entered a default judgment in hefferman favor against pierre for.the court found,however,that hefferman had failed to state a claim against bass.hefferman appeals the dismissal of his complaint against bass pierre is nowhere to be found and thus has not challenged the default judgment against him.we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
when reviewing a dismissal under rule b,we present the facts in the light most favorable to hefferman.see county of mchenry ins.of the west,cir.hefferman is a former illinois public schoolteacher who has since relocated to california.in,pierre,one of his longtime acquaintances,approached him with a plan to become partners in a car wash in skokie,illinois.at pierre request,hefferman supplied about for costs,such as equipment and a lease.later on,hefferman provided another hefferman also worked at the car wash several hours a day during the summer of without being paid.
in july,pierre took hefferman to bass office and told hefferman that bass would take care of the legal paperwork.at pierre request,hefferman paid bass legal fees,which came to more than a thousand dollars.hefferman understood from what pierre told him that bass was to represent both him and pierre in rendering these services.bass assured hefferman,i your guy.i make sure you protected and you get what been agreed.hefferman contends that bass did no such thing.not only did he fail to deliver on his promises,but he also prepared a release used to trick hefferman into relinquishing his interest in the business.pierre showed up at hefferman house in the middle of the night with that release and convinced hefferman to sign it by showing him only the second page,which stated that pierre indemnified and held hefferman harmless from any liability under the lease of the car wash building.but the first page of the release,which hefferman did not see when he signed,indicated that hefferman had resigned as officer and stockholder of the car wash.in the summer of,not having received any profit on his investment nor a salary for working in the business,hefferman visited pierre and sought an accounting or the return of his investment.pierre refused,telling hefferman that he was not entitled to anything.
hefferman sued pierre and bass under federal diversity jurisdiction.although hefferman recovered only in the default judgment,his original claim also sought damages for the value of his interest in the business and punitive damages there is thus no reason to think that it did not exceed.pierre defaulted,and bass moved to dismiss the claims against him under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court found that hefferman had failed to state any claim against bass and dismissed the case.hefferman appeals.
the only issue before us is whether hefferman second amended complaint states a claim or claims against bass.we begin our analysis with a reminder about the standards for evaluating a motion under rule b.as we noted earlier,we review the facts in the light most favorable to hefferman.no claim should be dismissed unless it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.hishon king spalding,d.see also mccready ebay,wl,at cir.july.
rule b does not stand alone.in swierkiewicz sorema,d,the supreme court stated rule a simplified pleading standard applies to all civil actions,with limited exceptions.rule b,for example,provides for greater particularity in all averments of fraud or mistake.this court,however,has declined to extend such exceptions to other contexts.id.at.the court also underscored the fact that o ther provisions of the federal rules of civil procedure are inextricably linked to rule a simplified notice pleading standard.id.see mcdonald household int l,cir.see also twombly bell atlantic,cir,cert.granted,d presenting the question whether a claim under the sherman act,requires heightened pleading.
rule a requires only a short and plain statement of the grounds upon which the court jurisdiction depends,a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,and a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks.as the supreme court pointed out in swierkiewicz,at,and as we reiterated in mcdonald,this is a notice pleading standard,not a fact pleading standard.at.the point of a notice pleading standard is that the plaintiff is not required to plead either facts or legal theories.see marshall knight,cir bartholet reishauer z√ºrich,cir complaints do not need to match facts to elements of a legal theory.see also cler.educ.ass n,cir in this regard,the supreme court has cautioned that t he federal rules reject the approach that pleading is a game of skill in which one misstep by counsel may be decisive to the outcome and accept the principle that the purpose of pleading is to facilitate a proper decision on the merits.quoting conley gibson,d.
this notice pleading regime stands in contrast to the fact pleading illinois has adopted.while the plaintiff is not required to set forth evidence in the complaint,the plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to bring a claim within a legally recognized cause of action,not simply conclusions.see marshall burger king,wl.june,analysis section,internal citations omitted.in illinois,the plaintiff must set forth sufficient facts to satisfy each element of a claim.see id.
in this case,whether they meant to or not,both the parties and the district court took an approach that resembled the illinois fact pleading rules far more than notice pleading of rule.the district court criticized hefferman pleadings under his legal malpractice claim for failing to allege facts supporting each of the elements of the claim.the court took the same approach with respect to hefferman theory that bass had aided and abetted pierre swindling.but rule imposes no such requirement.see kirksey reynolds tobacco,cir.that this case was brought under federal diversity jurisdiction,see,and thus state law governs the substantive rights of the parties,makes no difference.the federal rules of civil procedure apply to all cases filed in federal court,no matter what the basis of subject matter jurisdiction.see hanna plumer,d.that fact makes torres divis,d,which both hefferman and bass discuss at length in their briefs,and the other illinois cases they mention,utterly irrelevant.torres is similar to this case in that it involves pleading in a legal malpractice and breach of contract case,but it is decided within the framework of illinois fact pleading rules and therefore inapplicable.in federal court under rule,the rules are simple notice is what counts.not facts not elements of causes of action not legal theories.
regardless of what hefferman may be able to prove at a later stage of this litigation,count iv of hefferman second amended complaint certainly gives notice of the malpractice claim.under illinois law,legal malpractice requires an relationship,a negligent act or breach,proximate cause,and damages.see webb damisch,d.the district court found that hefferman had not properly alleged two relationship and proximate cause.but from the point of view of notice,rather than elements of a claim,this complaint said more than enough hefferman understood from what pierre told him that bass was to represent both him and pierre in rendering these services bass then told hefferman that i your guy.i make sure you protected and you get what been agreed bass then asked hefferman for an advance payment of fees and hefferman there and then paid bass several hundred dollars as hefferm
