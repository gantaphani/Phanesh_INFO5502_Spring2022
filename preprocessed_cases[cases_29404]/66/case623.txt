in this consolidated case,we review two decisions of the second district court of appeal all children hospital,department of administrative hearings,so d dca,and florida neurological injury compensation ass ferguson,so d dca.in each case,the second district certified conflict with decisions from the third,fourth,and fifth district courts of appeal on an issue regarding the subject matter jurisdiction of administrative law judges under the florida neurological injury compensation act as found in sections through,florida statutes supp nica.see of miami,so d dca gugelmin div.of admin.hearings,so d dca behan.neurological injury comp.ass n,so d dca.neurological injury comp.ass n,so d dca 
we frame the question in conflict as follows 
does an administrative law judge alj,when considering a nica claim,have jurisdiction to determine whether or not a health care provider has complied with the notice to obstetrical patients of participation in the plan as required by section 
in the two cases before us,the second district held that the nica statute,as it existed prior to the amendment,did not give the alj any jurisdiction to determine this notice issue the third,fourth,and fifth districts had reached the opposite conclusion and,subsequent to the second district certification of conflict,the first district issued an opinion aligning itself with the third,fourth,and fifth districts.see tabb.neurological injury comp.ass n,so d dca.
as explained below,we hold that when notice is raised as part of a claim filed under nica,an alj has jurisdiction to make findings regarding whether a health care provider has satisfied the notice to obstetrical patients requirement of section,florida statutes supp.in light of this holding,we quash the second district decision in all children hospital,and remand that case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.however,because the conflict question has become moot in ferguson,we dismiss that case.
factual and procedural background 
as stated,we have before us two decisions from the second district.in all children hospital,christopher glenn and anna glenn,now anna lentini,filed a civil suit in circuit court against all children hospital,all children alleging that the medical malpractice of all children neonatal nurses caused injuries to their newborn infant.so d at in ferguson,maria and garry ferguson brought a similar suit in circuit court against morton plant mease health care hospital morton plant and nurse lenore mccall,the certified nurse midwife,alleging medical malpractice in the delivery of their infant.so d at.
the relevant facts of each case are essentially the same.in each case,the infant parents filed a medical malpractice suit against the health care provider who assisted in the delivery of the infant the defending health care provider responded by raising the affirmative defense that the civil suit was brought in violation of nica exclusive remedy provision,section,florida statutes.in each case,the respective circuit court abated the medical malpractice action and ordered the parents to file a claim for compensation under the injury compensation plan established by section,florida statutes the nica plan.claims under the nica plan are heard and determined administratively as set forth in sections.
in each case,the parents complied with the circuit court order but did so under protest.they filed nica claims but alleged that the health care providers had not provided them with the notice required by section,florida statutes supp.this statutorily mandated notice informs obstetrical patients of the limited alternative for injuries under the nica plan.specifically,section,entitled notice to obstetrical patients of participation in the plan,provides 
each hospital with a participating physician on its staff and each participating physician,other than residents,assistant residents,and interns deemed to be participating physicians under c,under the florida neurological injury compensation plan shall provide notice to the obstetrical patients as to the limited alternative for neurological injuries.such notice shall be provided on forms furnished by the association and shall include a clear and concise explanation of a patient rights and limitations under the plan.the hospital or the participating physician may elect to have the patient sign a form acknowledging receipt of the notice form.signature of the patient acknowledging receipt of the notice form raises a rebuttable presumption that the notice requirements of this section have been met.notice need not be given to a patient when the patient has an emergency medical condition as defined in b or when notice is not practicable.
if a health care provider complies with this notice provision,according to section,compensation under the plan is the exclusive remedy for the covered injuries.therefore,in light of this allegation by the parents that the statutory notice was not provided,the health care providers were allowed to intervene in the administrative proceedings.
after an administrative hearing in each case,the alj found that the required notice was not provided.given this finding,the alj then ordered the parents to elect their waive the notice issue and pursue an award under nica or pursue the medical malpractice action in circuit court.in both cases,the health care providers appealed the alj order to the second district court of appeal.the second district reversed the alj orders because it determined that nica did not give the alj jurisdiction to make findings regarding notice.
the procedural history of the two cases varied on appeal.all children hospital,was the first case decided by the second district.so d.all children sought to challenge the substance of the alj findings regarding notice.the second district never reached this substantive claim.instead,as stated above,it held that nica does not give an alj jurisdiction to make findings regarding notice.specifically,the second district wrote 
on appeal,all children contends the alj erred in determining that its immunity from suit under nica was dependent on notice from both the mother obstetrician and bayfront.we decline to reach that issue,because we conclude that,under the governing statutory language,the alj jurisdiction was restricted to determining whether the claim was covered by nica and did not extend to the issue of whether a provider is entitled to invoke the exclusive remedy provision of the statute.
all children,so d at.
ferguson was decided next by the second district.so d.in ferguson,the florida neurological injury compensation association the association and morton plant appealed the alj order.before oral argument,the fergusons and morton plant notified the association and the second district that they had entered into a settlement agreement.the case proceeded,however and in accord with all children hospital,the second district again held that the alj did not have jurisdiction to make findings regarding notice.id.at.
the association requested that this court review the decisions of the second district and resolve the certified conflict.
ii.analysis 
again,the issue in conflict is whether an alj,when considering a nica claim,has jurisdiction to determine if a health care provider has complied with the notice to obstetrical patients required by section.because resolving this conflict requires the interpretation of a statute,our standard of review is de novo.dep t of children families,so d.as previously stated,we conclude that when a health care provider compliance with the notice requirement of section is raised as an issue in a nica claim,an alj has jurisdiction to make this determination.
to resolve the conflict question,we will contextualize the certified conflict by briefly outlining the purpose,structure,and relevant provisions of nica as they existed in summarize the analytical basis for the conflict between the district courts of appeal and set forth the statutory analysis we find most appropriate.we do this in the context of all children hospital,because ferguson is moot.
the issue raised in ferguson is now moot therefore,we dismiss the association petition for review.an issue is moot when the controversy has been so fully resolved that a judicial determination can have no actual effect.godwin state,so d.the fergusons waived their challenge to the adequacy of the hospital notice and agreed to accept an award under nica thus,our holding regarding the alj jurisdiction under nica will have no bearing on the fergusons case.accordingly,the association petition for review as to the ferguson case is hereby dismissed 
all children hospital 
the purpose and structure of nica 
nica was enacted in to address the adverse impact that the high cost of medical malpractice insurance premiums was having on the delivery of obstetric services in florida.see.stat.supp.in nica,the legislature established the nica plan.stat,for the purpose of providing compensation,irrespective of fault,for neurological injury claims.stat.the nica plan is administered by the association 
when an infant suffers what may be a neurological injury nica provides that the claimant usually the infant parent must file a claim for compensation under the nica plan with the association.stat.supp the claim is then reviewed by a medical advisory panel.the panel makes a written recommendation as to whether the claim is compensable under the nica plan.stat.supp.after the panel makes its recommendation,the claim is then heard and determined in an administrative hearing before an alj.stat.the alj must consider,but is not bound by,the recommendation of the medical advisory panel.stat.supp.
under the version of nica,the alj is expressly required to make three independent findings based upon all available evidence.stat.first,the alj must determine whether the claim is a neurological injury.a.stat.second,the alj must determine whether the injury was caused by a participating health care provider,as defined in section.b.stat.finally,if the first and second requirements are met,the alj must determine the amount of the award without any regard for fault.c.stat.
if the alj determines that a claim is compensable,compensation under the nica plan becomes the claimant exclusive remedy.see.stat.the rights and remedies granted by this plan shall exclude all other rights and remedies of such infant at common law or otherwise,against any person or entity directly involved with the labor,delivery,or immediate postdelivery resuscitation during which such injury occurs.a claimant may not bring or maintain a civil suit in violation of nica exclusive remedy provision.stat.supp.n o civil action may be brought or continued in violation of the exclusiveness of remedy provisions of.if the claim is ultimately determined to be compensable,nica exclusive remedy provision shields participating health care providers from a civil tort action based upon the same claim.see.stat.
however,as previously determined by this court,there is a condition precedent to nica exclusivity.predelivery notice of the health care provider participation in the nica plan must be given as required by section.see galen of,braniff,so d,t he only logical reading of the statute is that before an obstetrical patient remedy is limited by the nica plan,the patient must be given notice of the health care provider participation in the plan t he purpose of the notice is to give an obstetrical patient an opportunity to make an informed choice between using a health care provider participating in the nica plan or using a provider who is not a participant and thereby preserving her civil remedies.section provides that,except in the case of emergency or impracticability,a participating health care provider is required to furnish each obstetrical patient with notice that the nica plan limited alternative for neurological injuries may be the patient exclusive remedy or means of receiving compensation for those injuries.this notice must be made using a form provided by the association.
the analytical basis of the conflict question 
in both all children hospital,and ferguson,the second district certified conflict with,and behan.the conflict is based on divergent views over the scope of the alj duties in the nica claims process 
the second district held that t here is nothing in section or elsewhere in nica that gives the alj any responsibility or authority to determine that notice under section was or was not properly given.all children,so d at in essence,the second district viewed the alj subject matter jurisdiction as limited to making the three determinations mandated by section.under the statute,the three determinations mandated by section were a whether the injury claimed is a neurological injury b whether the obstetrical services were delivered by a health care provider that participates in the nica plan and c the amount of any compensation.according to the second district,since the alj jurisdiction was limited to these three tasks which it viewed as related solely to whether an injury is compensable under nica and,if so,the amount of compensation,the alj had no authority to determine anything related to notice.in other words,the second district reasoned that instead of being relevant to compensability,notice is relevant solely to whether the nica plan is the exclusive remedy for the covered injuries.
the other district courts of appeal took a broader view of the alj subject matter jurisdiction.each of these courts found jurisdiction in other provisions of the nica statutory scheme,outside of section.the fifth district was the first to do so in,so d.that court held that the alj has exclusive jurisdiction to make findings regarding whether the notice provided for by section was either given or excused.id.at.the fifth district based its holding largely upon its analysis of three amendments to the nica statute.id.at.according to the fifth district,these amendments were made in response to this court decisions in florida neurological injury compensation ass mckaughan,so d,and galen of florida,braniff,so d,so d at.specifically,the fifth district viewed the amendments as indicating the legislature intent to authorize the alj to make all determinations regarding a claim under nica.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the fifth district first presented the language of the amendments as follows 
in,after the mckaughan and braniff decisions,the legislature,in chapter,amended sections,and,as follows 
be it enacted by the legislature of the state of florida 
section.paragraph d of subsection of section,florida statutes,is amended to read 
legislative findings and intent.
the legislature makes the following findings 
d the costs of neurological injury claims are particularly high and warrant the establishment of a limited system of compensation irrespective of fault.the issue of whether such claims are covered by this act must be determined exclusively in an administrative proceeding.
section.section,florida statutes,is amended to read 
administrative law judge to determine claims.
the administrative law judge shall hear and determine all claims filed pursuant to ss.and shall exercise the full power and authority granted to her or him in chapter,as necessary,to carry out the purposes of such sections.the administrative law judge has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a claim filed under this act is compensable.no civil action may be brought until the determinations under have been made by the administrative law judge.if the administrative law judge determines that the claimant is entitled to compensation from the association,no civil action may be brought or continued in violation of the exclusiveness of remedy provisions of.if it is determined that a claim filed under this act is not compensable,the doctrine of neither collateral estoppel nor res judicata shall prohibit the claimant from pursuing any and all civil remedies available under common law and statutory law.the findings of fact and conclusions of law of the administrative law judge shall not be admissible in any subsequent proceeding however,the sworn testimony of any person and the exhibits introduced into evidence in the administrative case are admissible as impeachment in any subsequent civil action only against a party to the administrative proceeding,subject to the rules of evidence.an action may not be brought under ss.if the claimant recovers or final judgment is entered.the division may adopt rules to promote the efficient administration of,and to minimize the cost associated with,the prosecution of claims.
section.section,florida statutes,is amended to read 
notice to obstetrical patients of participation in the plan.
each hospital with a participating physician on its staff and each participating physician,other than residents,assistant residents,and interns deemed to be participating physicians under c,under the florida neurological injury compensation plan shall provide notice to the obstetrical patients thereof as to the limited alternative for neurological injuries.such notice shall be provided on forms furnished by the association and shall include a clear and concise explanation of a patient rights and limitations under the plan.the hospital or the participating physician may elect to have the patient sign a form acknowledging receipt of the notice form.signature of the patient acknowledging receipt of the notice form raises a rebuttable presumption that the notice requirements of this section have been met.notice need not be given to a patient when the patient has an emergency medical condition as defined in b or when notice is not practicable.
section.the amendments to sections and,florida statutes,shall take effect july,and shall apply only to claims filed on or after that date and to that extent shall apply retroactively regardless of the date of birth.
section.amendments to section,florida statutes,shall take effect july,and shall apply only to causes of action accruing on or after that date.
the fifth district then interpreted the applicability of these amendments to the conflict question by stating 
the language used by the legislature in its amendment to the act indicates that the administrative judge is to determine all matters relative to a claim.notably,the determination of the adequacy of notice is not excluded from the duties of the administrative law judge.section states that the administrative law judge shall hear all claims and shall exercise the full power and authority granted that is necessary to carry out the purposes of the section.the section further grants exclusive jurisdiction to the administrative law judge to determine whether a claim is compensable and precludes any civil action until the issue of compensability is determined.we believe that under these amendments,any issue raising the immunity of a health provider,including the issue of whether the health provider satisfied the notice requirements of the plan is an issue to be decided by the administrative law judge as one which relates to the question of whether the claim is compensable under the plan.we recognize that lack of proper notice does not affect a claimant ability to obtain compensation from the plan.however,a health provider who disputes a plaintiff assertion of inadequate notice is raising the issue of whether a claim can only be compensated under the plan.all questions of compensability,including those which arise regarding the adequacy of notice,are properly decided in the administrative forum.
our conclusion that the administrative forum is the intended exclusive forum to determine the notice question eliminates the effect,that is,the trial court and the administrative law judge each throwing the case back to the other on this question.we also note that a section notice issue is peculiar to a nica claim.the notice is not applicable to a common law tort or contract action.we also believe that it is economical and practicable to both the litigants and judicial system to have all nica issues determined by one tribunal.
this interpretation by the fifth district in was substantially followed by the first and third districts however,the second district expressly considered and rejected this analysis in all children hospital.though it agreed that s ince the adoption of the amendments,nica is very clear that the determination of whether an injury is compensable is exclusively within the province of the alj,it found that n othing in the amendments to nica did anything to extend the jurisdiction of the alj to the issues of notice and immunity from tort liability.all children,so d at.instead,the second district found that t he issue of immunity from tort liability and the related issue of notice are an entirely different matter from whether an injury is compensable under nica.id.at.
resolving the conflict question 
again,the narrow question we must resolve is whether the version of nica gives the alj jurisdiction to determine if the notice mandated by section was provided.as previously stated,we disagree with the second district holding that t here is nothing in section or elsewhere in nica that gives the alj any responsibility or authority to determine that notice under section was or was not properly given.all children,so d at.instead,we agree with judge kahn analysis of this question in tabb,so d,where he wrote 
the alj authority derives from section,florida statutes 
the administrative law judge shall hear and determine all claims filed pursuant to ss.and shall exercise the full power and authority granted to her or him in chapter,as necessary to carry out the purposes of such sections.the administrative law judge has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a claim filed under this act is compensable.no civil action may be brought until the determinations under have been made by the administrative law judge.if the administrative law judge determines that the claimant is entitled to compensation from the association,no civil action may be brought or continued in violation of the exclusiveness of remedy provisions of.if it is determined that a claim filed under this act is not compensable,neither the doctrine of collateral estoppel nor res judicata shall prohibit the claimant from pursuing any and all civil remedies available under common law and statutory law 
emphasis added.in order to hear and determine a claim,an alj must,almost of necessity,decide whether notice was given,because if no notice was given,the exclusivity provision of the statute does not apply.see.stat.galen,so d at.further,an alj has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a claim is compensable under the nica plan.in the absence of notice,the plan does not apply.given these provisions,we are led to conclude that an alj has jurisdiction to determine whether notice was given.as established law provides,an alj must have jurisdiction to determine whether the alj has jurisdiction.see,sun ins.boyd,so d,explaining that a tribunal always has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction.
notably,in,the legislature amended the nica statute to add section,florida statutes 
if it is in the interest of judicial economy or if requested to by the claimant,the administrative law judge may bifurcate the proceeding addressing compensability and notice pursuant to first,and addressing an award pursuant to,if any,in a separate proceeding.the administrative law judge may issue a final order on compensability and notice which is subject to appeal under,prior to issuance of an award pursuant to.
ch,at,laws of.in passing the amendment,the legislature implicitly acknowledged the existing case law indicating that an alj has jurisdiction to determine whether notice was provided pursuant to section.see generally,city of hollywood lombardi,so d,explaining that the legislature is presumed to know the judicial construction of a law when passing a new version of the law and to have adopted the prior judicial construction unless a contrary intent is expressed.
other district courts of appeal had,before,indicated that an alj has jurisdiction to determine whether the notice requirement was satisfied in a particular case.see.neurological injury comp.ass n,so d,dca the language used by the legislature in its amendment to the act indicates that the administrative judge is to determine all matters relative to a claim.notably,the determination of the adequacy of notice is not excluded from the duties of the administrative law judge a ny issue raising the immunity of a health provider,including the issue of whether the health provider satisfied the notice requirements of the plan is an issue to be decided by the administrative law judge as one which relates to the question of whether the claim is compensable under the plan.of miami,so d dca adopting decision in.see also gugelmin div.of admin.hearings,so d dca behan.neurological injury comp.ass n,so d dca.
tabb,so d at.
given our agreement with this analysis of nica in tabb,we hold that when notice is raised as part of a claim filed under nica,an alj has jurisdiction to make findings regarding whether a health care provider has satisfied the notice requirements of section,florida statutes 
iii.conclusion 
in conclusion,when the issue of whether notice was adequately provided pursuant to section is raised in a nica claim,we conclude that the alj has jurisdiction to determine whether the health care provider complied with the requirements of section.therefore,we quash the second district decision in all children hospital,and remand for further findings consistent with this opinion.we dismiss the petition to review ferguson as moot.
it is so ordered.
i dissent from the majority conclusion that the alj possessed jurisdiction to determine whether the notice mandated by section of the florida statutes was provided in this case.rather,i would conclude that the second district decision in all children hospital,department of administrative hearings,so d dca,holding that i t is the circuit court which must address th is issue in deciding whether a civil action will be allowed to proceed in the circuit court,should be approved.id.at emphasis supplied.
in interpreting the jurisdiction of the circuit court to determine notice under nica,this court should look to the workers compensation system for guidance,as it has so often in the past.see.neurological injury compensation ass mckaughan,so d,b ecause both the nica plan and the workers compensation system possess common purposes and characteristics and are aimed at accomplishing similar results,albeit in different contexts,we may regard and construe them in pari materia.this court has previously determined that because the nica plan,like the workers compensation act,is a statutory substitute for common law rights and liabilities,it should be strictly construed to include only those subjects clearly embraced within its terms.neurological injury compensation ass.div.of admin.hearings,so d,hereinafter doah emphasis supplied quoting humana of,mckaughan,so d,dca,approved sub nom.neuro.injury comp.ass mckaughan,so d.under the version of nica that is applicable in the instant case,the alj possesses exclusive jurisdiction solely to determine whether a claim is compensable under nica.see.stat.supp the issue of whether such claims are covered by this act must be determined exclusively in an administrative proceeding.under the specific language of nica,a determination of compensability entails assessing whether the injury claimed is a neurological injury whether obstetrical services were delivered by a nica participating physician and how much compensation should be awarded.see.stat.there is no mention whatsoever of notice in the version of section that is applicable to the instant case.since notice is not expressly listed as one of the issues that the alj must determine pursuant to section,we should not interpret nica to remove the right of individuals to have this issue heard and decided by a circuit court.rather,nica should be strictly construed to limit the jurisdiction of the alj to those items expressly relegated under section.see doah,so d at.
my conclusion is further bolstered by the fact that we have stated b ecause the assertion of nica exclusivity is an affirmative defense,factual disputes concerning notice should be submitted to the jury where a jury trial is requested on all questions of fact.galen of florida,braniff,so d.this court has previously determined that allowing a circuit court to determine the exclusivity of nica as an affirmative defense will not result in a frustration of the legislature purpose in enacting the plan.mckaughan,so d at quoting lower court opinion.in reaching this determination,we compared nica to the workers compensation system and concluded that we are not aware of any documented evidence indicating that the legislative goal of this system has been frustrated by the long established law that workers compensation immunity is an affirmative defense to a traditional tort action.id.quoting lower court opinion see also mandico taos,so d,the assertion that the plaintiff exclusive remedy is under the workers compensation law is an affirmative defense,and its validity can only be determined in the course of litigation.the court has jurisdiction to decide the question.the amendments to nica in no way altered this court holding in braniff because those amendments did not expressly delegate to the alj the authority to determine this issue of whether the notice mandated by section was provided.rather,the amendments granted an alj the exclusive jurisdiction solely to determine whether a injury is compensable under nica.see.stat.supp.
further,as noted in all children hospital,whether an entity is precluded from raising nica as an affirmative defense for failure to give notice is a completely distinct issue from whether an injury is compensable under nica.see so d at this is evidenced by the fact that an individual who was not provided notice is not excluded from receiving compensation under nica.see braniff galen of florida,so d,dca the presence or absence of notice will neither advance nor defeat the claim of an eligible nica claimant who has decided to invoke the nica remedy by making this filing,approved,so d.additionally,it is not necessary under nica for an alj to determine whether a party received notice pursuant to section in order to decide whether a injury is compensable under nica.see id.to decide the latter issue,the alj is only required to analyze the three elements listed in section.hence,absent specific language,we should not assign duties to the alj that have traditionally been delegated to the exclusive province of the circuit courts.see braniff,so d at.
like workers compensation,nica is a statutory substitute for common law rights and liabilities,and,therefore,it should be strictly construed to include only those subjects clearly embraced within its terms.doah,so d at quoting mckaughan,so d at.therefore,the nica plan must be interpreted narrowly so as not to sacrifice the common law rights of patients to a statutory substitute.i believe that the majority has erred in concluding that the alj possesses jurisdiction to determine whether the notice mandated by section was provided because there is no express language in section dictating such.rather,i would conclude that the second district in all children hospital properly determined that the issue of notice under the version of nica applicable to the instant case can only be resolved by the circuit court.
therefore,i dissent.
i would approve the thorough and opinion of judge canady for the unanimous panel of second district court of appeal judges in the decision below.in my view,the majority has ignored the conceptual differences between administrative proceedings structured to determine nica claims versus the entirely distinct judicial proceedings for malpractice claims in which the exclusivity provisions of nica may be invoked as an affirmative defense.in doing so,the majority has failed to adhere to this court prior controlling decision in galen of florida,braniff,so d.
because i find judge canady opinion compelling,i adopt it as my own.further,i set out here that portion of the opinion that i believe so clearly distinguishes the function of administrative proceedings under nica as those functions existed under the controlling law to be applied at the time of the underlying events involved in the second district ruling from the function of judicial proceedings.judge canady explains 
c.the limits of alj jurisdiction under nica 
in the instant case,the alj did something nica gave him no authority to do and failed to do what the statute required him to do.there is no basis in nica for the alj foray into the issue of immunity from tort liability under section and the related issue of notice under section.and there is no justification under nica for the alj failure to make a determination concerning the compensability of the injury which is the subject of the underlying claim.
the responsibilities of the alj are succinctly set forth in section.the alj must address the two basic questions which determine if a claim is compensable under the plan w hether the injury claimed is a neurological injury,a and w hether obstetrical services were delivered by a covered person in the course of labor,delivery,or resuscitation in the immediate period in a hospital,b.if both of these questions are answered in the affirmative,the injury is compensable under the plan.if either question is answered in the negative,the injury is not compensable.since the adoption of the amendments,nica is very clear that the determination of whether an injury is compensable is exclusively within the province of the alj,see.stat.supp subject,of course,to the right to pursue an appeal of the alj determination,see.stat.
the issue of immunity from tort liability and the related issue of notice are an entirely different matter.there is nothing in section or elsewhere in nica that gives the alj any responsibility or authority to determine either a that notice under section was or was not properly given,or b that a provider is or is not entitled to invoke the immunity from tort liability provided for in section.these issues are entirely distinct and separate from the issue of compensability under the plan.
the issue of notice is only relevant to the issue of whether a provider is eligible under section for immunity from tort liability.see galen,so d at.thus,the provision of notice has no bearing whatsoever on whether a claim is compensable.the availability of compensation under the plan is alike available to claimants who received proper notice under section and to claimants who did not receive such notice.see.neurological injury comp.ass n,so d,dca recogniz ing that lack of proper notice does not affect a claimant ability to obtain compensation from the p lan.a claimant can not be deprived of compensation under the plan due to the failure of a provider to give the required notice.see id.
nothing in the amendments to nica did anything to extend the jurisdiction of the alj to the issues of notice and immunity from tort liability.insofar as those amendments addressed the issue of the jurisdiction of the alj,they simply made clear to the holding in alj has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a claim filed under nica is compensable.the amendments also established that n o civil action may be brought until the determinations regarding compensability under have been made by the alj.id.no change was made in the determinations the alj is required to make under section.
in cases such as the instant one,where the potential claimant wishes to pursue tort remedies and to forgo any compensation from the plan,the task of the alj is limited to determining whether the injuries were compensable under section,and thus covered by nica,in accord with section d supp.in cases where the claimant seeks compensation from the plan,once an injury is determined to be compensable,the alj must go on to determine the amount of compensation that is awardable.see c.
if the alj determines that a claim is not compensable under nica,there can,of course,be no immunity from liability under section.if the alj determines that a claim is compensable but the potential claimant desires to forgo compensation under nica and to pursue a civil action for tort remedies,a determination must then be made concerning whether that civil action is in violation of the exclusiveness of remedy provisions of.that determination concerning tort immunity will turn on whether proper notice was given as required by section.galen,so d at stating that propriety of provider nica notice must be determined on a basis,b ecause the assertion of nica exclusivity is an affirmative defense in a civil suit and factual disputes concerning notice should be submitted to the trier of fact.
the factual and legal issues related to notice and tort immunity are within the jurisdiction of the circuit court in which a tort claim is brought.they are not within the jurisdiction of the alj.those issues are entirely irrelevant to the determination the alj must make concerning whether compensation is available from the association for a particular claim.it is the circuit court which must address those issues in deciding whether a civil action will be allowed to proceed in the circuit court.it,therefore,was error for the alj in the instant case to determine that the notice given was insufficient and that all children was not entitled to immunity from tort liability.
the alj further erred in requiring the claimants to make an election of remedies.see bayfront med,div.of admin.hearings,so d,dca reversing alj rulings regarding the election of remedies and the finding regarding nica exclusivity of remedy provisions gugelmin,so d at reversing administrative order of alj requiring claimants to elect between remedies and denying the hospital statutory immunity despite its timely notice under the p lan.finally,the alj errors of addressing the issues of notice,immunity,and election of remedies led him into the error of failing to carry out his responsibility to determine whether the injury was compensable under nica.
we realize that in the fifth district held that the adequacy of a provider notice is part of a compensability determination and that notice is thus a matter within the exclusive province of the alj.so d at.the court observed that its conclusion that the administrative forum is the intended exclusive forum to determine the notice question eliminates the effect,that is,the trial court and the alj each throwing the case back to the other on this question.id.at.for the reasons already stated,however,we conclude that the text of nica does not support the conclusion reached by the fifth district in that the question of proper notice is part of the compensability determination the alj is required to make.insofar as the supposed effect is concerned,we simply note that we are constrained to follow the ball wherever the legislature chooses to send it.
all children hospital,of admin.hearings,so d,dca.
the issue in this case is a very narrow one whether the administrative law judge alj has jurisdiction to determine whether obstetrical patients were given the required notice under section,florida statutes supp.the answer is based on principles of statutory interpretation.and the answer affects only a small number of cases because the language of the statute was amended in.there is no question that as of,the legislature has unambiguously vested exclusive jurisdiction in the alj to make all factual determinations as to whether the notice requirements of section were satisfied.see majority opinion at.
both the majority and the dissents base their conclusions as to whether the circuit court or the alj has jurisdiction to determine notice on the language of the statute.i conclude that the reasoning of chief justice lewis dissent and justice anstead dissent,which incorporates judge canady opinion,is more persuasive than the majority reasoning.first,the actual language vesting jurisdiction in the alj to make determinations on the compensability of a claim lists only three specific findings that the alj must make,none of which include the issue of notice.see.stat.supp.second,whether an obstetrical patient received the required notice is completely distinct from the compensability of a claim.
third,as chief justice lewis points out,this court has previously determined that because the nica statute limits common law rights,it must be strictly construed.see florida neurological injury compensation ass mckaughan,so d.further,as we explained in mckaughan,we take into consideration that this statute abridges florida constitutional guarantee of access to the courts.see id.at see also.stat.supp providing that
