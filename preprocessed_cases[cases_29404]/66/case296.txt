this is a legal malpractice case between parties based on alleged errors by counsel in patent prosecution and patent litigation.the case was filed in state court and then removed to federal court.akin gump strauss hauer feld,and branscomb,collectively akin gump appeal the interlocutory decision of the united states district court for the western district of texas denying their motion to remand air measurement technologies,corporation,and louis herbert stumberg collectively amt lawsuit,which motion asserted want of subject matter jurisdiction under federal patent law.air measurement,akin gump,no.because we conclude that the patent infringement question is a necessary element of amt malpractice claim and raises a substantial,contested question of patent law that congress intended for resolution in federal court,we affirm.
amt alleged the following facts in their complaint,which we accept as true for purposes of this appeal.stumberg and his partner james fulton now deceased and not a party to the action developed technology for a safety device for firemen and other emergency personnel who require supplemental oxygen.integrated into breathing apparatuses scba,the safety device calculates the user remaining airtime,measures temperature,and computes the amount of time the user can remain safely in a fire environment or other hazardous situation.notice of removal complaint iv.the device also contains an alarm that sounds if the wearer is motionless for a particular period of time.id.stumberg and fulton formed air measurement technologies,and corporation to develop,license,and market the safety device.in,stumberg engaged patent attorney gary hamilton to secure patent protection for the safety device and related technology.
with hamilton knowledge,stumberg and fulton began marketing a prototype of their invention in.hamilton filed the first patent application on august,which issued as patent patent on october,and is entitled integrated firefighter safety monitoring alarm system.hamilton also prosecuted continuation applications that issued as patent patent patent and.during the course of the patent prosecution,hamilton was associated with akin gump and now practices law with hamilton terrile,
prior litigation 
amt filed six infringement suits in the western district of texas prior litigation against scba manufacturers hamilton allegedly belatedly filed the first patent suit in,and stumberg retained new counsel in for the pending patent litigation.all six suits settled between and for a total of approximately million without a judicial determination of infringement,invalidity,or unenforceability of amt patents.
during the course of the prior litigation,amt,with the help of new counsel,discovered various errors hamilton allegedly made during patent prosecution and patent litigation.the alleged errors are that hamilton failed to file the initial patent application within the one year on sale bar of b failed to disclose two prior patents and other facts during the prosecution of the patent applications failed to file in a timely fashion the application that resulted in the patent,which contains the broadest claims to the invention miscalculated the settlement damages in the draeger prior litigation failed to inform amt of his mistakes despite his fiduciary duty to do so failed to inform amt adequately of the existence of the prior litigant defenses of on sale bar and inequitable conduct and made misrepresentations to amt.compl.iv.
current litigation 
amt filed suit against hamilton and several law firms in a texas state court on may,for legal malpractice,negligence,negligent misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary state law claims.amt alleges that akin gump errors forced them to settle the prior litigation far below the fair market value of the patents because the prior litigation defendants were,inter alia,able to raise as defenses invalidity,on sale bar and unenforceability due to inequitable conduct that would not have existed without attorney error.
akin gump removed the case to the western district of texas on june,under,arguing that the resolution of amt suit requires the resolution of a substantial question of patent law.akin gump counterclaimed for a declaration of invalidity of the patents on various grounds and a declaration that the patents are not,by reason of attorney conduct,unenforceable based on inequitable conduct or invalid based on b.
amt filed a motion to remand on july,which the district court denied on september,on the ground that amt suit necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law,because,in order to prevail,amt must establish that their infringement claims were otherwise valid,but that hamilton negligence afforded the patent defendants certain defenses under patent law.air measurement,hamilton,no,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,quoting christianson colt indus.operating,d.
on june,a little over three years after the removal of the case,the parties changed postures.branscomb,moved to remand the case,asserting that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking,and amt opposed.the district court denied the motion to remand on the ground that it had jurisdiction under.in so holding,the district court determined that grable sons metal products,darue engineering manufacturing,d,did not veto its jurisdiction and certified the following issue for interlocutory appeal pursuant to b 
w hether a texas legal malpractice claim arising out of underlying patent prosecution and patent litigation necessarily raises a question of federal patent law,actually disputed and substantial,that a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.
air measurement,hamilton,no,slip op.at.on october,akin gump petitioned for permission to appeal under b.we exercised our discretion and granted the petition on november.air measurement,akin gump strauss hauer feld.non precedential.
this appeal presents an issue of first impression in this court.the issue concerns whether,under the circumstances of this case,the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over amt legal malpractice suit we review the district court jurisdictional determinations without deference.bd.of regents nippon.where,as here,there is no diversity of citizenship,there must be federal question jurisdiction.see generally,providing district courts with subject matter jurisdiction over diversity and federal question cases.amt asserts that jurisdiction is proper under,which provides district courts with exclusive federal jurisdiction over any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents.a the district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents,plant variety protection,copyrights and trademarks.such jurisdiction shall be exclusive of the courts of the states in patent,plant variety protection and copyright cases.
in christianson,the united states supreme court set forth a test for determining whether federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over a case pursuant to a.at.section jurisdiction extends to any case in which a complaint establishes either that federal patent law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law,in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the claims.id.the parties to this appeal concede that the first part of the christianson test is inapplicable because the malpractice cause of action asserted by amt in their complaint is created by state law.therefore,our analysis concerns whether patent law is a necessary element of amt malpractice claim.
in making this determination,we are limited to an analysis of amt complaint.see caterpillar,williams,d.under the complaint rule,arising under jurisdiction must be determined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff statement of his own claim in the bill or declaration,unaided by anything alleged in anticipation or avoidance of defenses which it is thought the defendant may interpose.christianson,at.citations omitted.this rule applies even if both parties admit that the defense is the only question truly at issue in the case.id.citations omitted.thus,a claim does not arise under the patent laws if a patent issue appears only in a defense to that claim,thompson microsoft,or appears in an answer as a counterclaim,holmes group,vornado air circulation,d.
amt argues that their malpractice claim requires resolution of a substantial question of patent law.based on our review of amt removal complaint without consideration of allegations that may be made in anticipation or avoidance of akin gump defenses and without contemplation of akin gump counterclaims,we agree.a review of the complaint reveals that approximately seven allegations of error in the context of patent prosecution or patent litigation,see supra,are the bases of amt legal malpractice claim.see compl.v defendant acts and omissions as pleaded above,jointly and severally,constitute legal malpractice and professional negligence,and negligent misrepresentations,each of which acts or omissions was the proximate cause of plaintiffs loss of recovery on their claims asserted in the patent litigation.amt alleges that these errors forced them to settle prior litigation for sums demonstrably and significantly less than their fair value.id.iv.
under texas state law,the elements of a malpractice claim are an attorney owed plaintiff a duty stemming from the relationship,the attorney breached that duty,the breach proximately caused plaintiff injuries,and damages.peeler hughes luce,internal citation omitted.because amt malpractice claim stems in part from unsuccessful prior litigation,amt must establish that they would have prevailed in the prior litigation but for akin gump negligence that compromised the litigation.this is called the case within a case requirement of the proximate cause element of malpractice.see ballesteros jones.
in order to prevail on a legal malpractice claim which arises from prior litigation,the plaintiff has the burden to show that but for the attorney negligence,he or she would be entitled to judgment,and show what amount would have been collectible had he or she recovered the judgment.this is commonly referred to as the suit within a suit requirement.
because the plaintiff must establish that the underlying suit would have been won but for the attorney breach of duty,this suit within a suit requirement is necessarily a component of the plaintiff burden on cause in fact.
id.internal citations omitted.because the underlying suit here is a patent infringement action against scba defendants,the district court will have to adjudicate,hypothetically,the merits of the infringement claim.because proof of patent infringement is necessary to show amt would have prevailed in the prior litigation,patent infringement is a necessary element of amt malpractice claim and therefore apparently presents a substantial question of patent law conferring jurisdiction.see christianson,at.
indeed,we would consider it illogical for the western district of texas to have jurisdiction under to hear the underlying infringement suit and for us then to determine that the same court does not have jurisdiction under to hear the same substantial patent question in the case within a case context of a state malpractice claim.see grable,at.
the arising under doctrine captures the commonsense notion that a federal court ought to be able to hear claims recognized under state law that nonetheless turn on substantial questions of federal law,and thus justify resort to the experience,solicitude,and hope of uniformity that a federal forum offers on federal issues.
id.citation omitted.there is simply no good reason to deny federal jurisdiction in this case.
our decision today follows our precedent,we have held that patent infringement presents a substantial question of federal patent law conferring arising under jurisdiction.for example,in additive controls measurement systems,flowdata,the plaintiff filed a business disparagement claim in texas state court alleging that the defendant had warned plaintiff customers that plaintiff product infringed defendant patent.the defendant removed the case to federal court under.id.we held that the state law business disparagement claim arises under the patent laws because plaintiff would have to prove the falsity of the statement that its products infringe defendant patent by proving.id.at thus,plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends upon resolution of a substantial question of patent law,in that proof relating to patent infringement is a necessary element of plaintiff business disparagement claim.accord scherbatskoy halliburton,cir finding jurisdiction and transferring case to this court where proof of breach of contract claim requires proof of infringement.we see no logical basis for treating a state law business disparagement tort requiring proof of patent any differently from the present state law malpractice tort requiring proof of patent infringement.
in addition to proving patent infringement in the case within a case context,amt will have to show that it would have prevailed against the defenses the prior litigants raised.these are not the sort of defenses contemplated by christianson,at,for they are part of the malpractice causation element rather than the defenses raised by akin gump in the current litigation.the defenses of the scba litigants fall into two categories those that stem from the alleged attorney errors,defenses,such as the defenses of inequitable conduct and on sale bar and those that are independent of these errors,related defenses 
there is a dispute regarding which of these defenses,if any,amt will have to prove had merit,defenses or defeat as defenses lacking merit,defenses.for example,akin gump asserts that amt position is that it does not have to prove that the defenses were valid defenses but only has to show that these defenses were available or plausible in view of the alleged errors.therefore,per akin gump,the district court does not have to resolve a substantial question of patent law.amt disagrees.
to the extent that amt has to prove or overcome invalidity,invalidity may be a substantial question of patent law.see hunter douglas,harmonic design,holding that a state law claim of injurious falsehood presented a substantial question of patent law where plaintiff had to show the invalidity of the patent,overruled in part on other grounds by midwest,karavan trailers,en banc in relevant part.regardless of the defenses amt would have to address,if any,amt would certainly have to prove patent infringement that alone confers jurisdiction.because we consider the patent infringement issue alone to be a sufficient jurisdictional basis for the case,we do not reach whether,under texas law,amt would have to prove certain defenses were valid or merely available.
akin gump contends that the impaired settlement value theory,the allegation that attorney error compromised the value of amt patents is a novel theory of malpractice that does not require the resolution of a substantial question of patent law if there is a theory upon which amt can prevail on their malpractice claim that does not involve a substantial patent law question,then patent law is not essential to the malpractice claim,and jurisdiction is lacking.see christianson,at.a claim supported by alternative theories in the complaint may not form the basis for a jurisdiction unless patent law is essential to each of those theories.
the impaired settlement value theory calculates the difference between the actual settlement amount and the predicted settlement amount absent malpractice.we view the impaired settlement value theory as a theory of damages,not a theory of liability for malpractice in addition to computation of damages,amt must still prove it would have been successful in the underlying litigation but for the alleged errors,which will require proof of patent infringement.thus,the impaired settlement value theory does not obviate the case within a case element of amt claim.
