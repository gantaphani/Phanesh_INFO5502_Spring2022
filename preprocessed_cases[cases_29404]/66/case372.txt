introduction 
this writ proceeding arises in a medical negligence action in which plaintiffs,makya connors,a minor,by and through her guardian ad litem anthony hill,and tamara hill,individually together plaintiffs,reached a settlement in excess of million with four defendants,including long beach memorial medical center the hospital and fastaff,the employer.shortly after the settlement was placed on the record in open court,perinatologist tamerou asrat,and his employer,magella medical group together the physicians settled separately with plaintiffs for,equaling less than percent of the amount at issue and percent of their insurance coverage.the trial court found the physicians settlement was made in good faith code civ,thus precluding the hospital from seeking equitable indemnity from the physicians.the hospital petitioned for a writ of mandate challenging the good faith determination.we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that the settlement between the physicians and plaintiffs was in good faith.accordingly,we grant the petition and direct the trial court to vacate that order.
factual and procedural background 
labor and delivery 
hill was a high risk patient and so she was under the care of the physicians during labor and delivery.at on february,dwanda trask,a nurse employed by fastaff,administered pitocin to augment hill labor and placed the patient on an electronic fetal heart monitor.fetal heart monitor tracings can be viewed from the patient room,the nurses station,and the doctors lounge.
at around,the fetal heart monitor began to show abnormalities.asrat visited the patient at and noted that she was completely dilated,percent effaced,and ready to begin pushing.he also noted at that time that the fetal heart tracings were abnormal,but he did not check on his patient again until 
meanwhile,asrat was in the hospital at all relevant times.no other physicians were responsible for hill care during asrat shift from february to.nor were there residents checking on hill during her labor that night.in the period between and on february,there were five patients in labor and delivery for whom asrat was the attending obstetrical physician.between and,he was responsible for four such patients.
some time between and,nurse trask testified,she called asrat to inform him that she had turned off the pitocin and repositioned the patient,and that there were some late decelerations in the fetal heart rate.nurse trask reached asrat in the doctors lounge where there was a monitor showing the fetal heart monitor tracings.according to nurse trask,asrat responded that he would continue to monitor the fetal heart beat pattern to see whether it resolved itself once the pitocin was turned off.
asrat denied having the conversation with nurse trask or being told between and that there were repetitive late decelerations on the heart tracings.rather,asrat testified that had he been given the information that nurse trask claims to have relayed to him at,he would have immediately gone to evaluate the patient.nurse trask call was not noted in the medical records.
nurse trask again called asrat in the doctors lounge at and informed him that the baby was not properly stationed despite the fact that the patient had been pushing for two hours.she also testified that she told asrat that the fetal heart rate had several persistent variable decelerations and periods of late decelerations.she did not advise asrat that the baby could not tolerate any more pushing,she explained,because he would know that,given her report and his ability to view the fetal heart tracings in the doctors lounge.asrat responded to nurse trask that he would make a decision within the next hour.
admitting he received the nurse call,asrat denied she mentioned any problems,and so he understood the tracings were reassuring.had he been told about the abnormal tracings,asrat testified,he would have gone to see the patient.
at,nurse theresa ann krehbiel,took over the patient care.at,the nurse coordinator reviewed the fetal tracings and requested that asrat evaluate the patient stat.asrat arrived at,reviewed the fetal heart monitor tracings and ordered a crash,or emergency,cesarean section.asrat denied having any information about the patient condition before the call and maintains that when nurse krehbiel assumed the patient care,the fetal tracings were troubling,with recurrent late decelerations and slow return to the baseline,with the result that the baby should have been delivered as soon as practicable.he explained that had he been informed of the infant condition at,he would have gone to the patient room and may have called for a cesarean section.the fetal heart rate tracings did not begin to be of concern until around,he testified,which was when he should have been called.the child was born at and the apgar scores were consistent with ongoing neurological damage.plaintiffs filed their complaint alleging causes of action for negligence and emotional distress.
the deposition testimony of plaintiffs expert,manning 
plaintiff perinatology expert,frank arthur manning,enumerated asrat breaches of the standard of care.based on the fact that the abnormal fetal heart rate was present at asrat visit,the expert opined,it was required for asrat by the standard of care to define a plan for her management that he had to continue the ongoing care of his patient and determine what was going to happen to her w ithin minutes of the visit he should have been reassessing her and establishing a plan.the expert felt quite strongly about this that asrat should not have left the patient room at or thereabouts.manning stated i think the standard of care required the attending physician not to abandon the patient,so that the obstetrician can not leave the room without a defined plan.italics added.manning also testified that asrat continuously breached the standard of care by failing to return to see the patient for over three hours.even accepting asrat did not receive nurse trask call,manning opined,asrat should have come in to see the patient.at this baby,if it not going to deliver spontaneously,should be delivered by caesarean section by.
the settlement 
plaintiffs calculated that their damages,including future care,lost future earnings,and past medical expenses,would exceed million.hence,plaintiffs made a settlement demand in of million.the demand was global meaning plaintiffs would not settle with defendants individually.
after mediation,two tortfeasors,who are not parties to this proceeding settled for.that left million as the remainder of plaintiffs global demand.after a second apparently unsuccessful mediation session,counsel for the physicians indicated his clients willingness to explore the possibility of defendants contributing to a settlement and arbitrating the relative percentages later.the parties discussed a proposal whereby the physicians would pay million,fastaff would furnish million,and the hospital would supply million to a global settlement,subject to a final allocation of respective contributions in binding arbitration.these conversations occurred about two weeks prior to the april,final status conference.plaintiffs soon stated that unless their demand was met by april,their offer would be withdrawn and increased.on april,fastaff agreed to pay million and the hospital consented to paying million.
as for the physicians,the hospital understood that they had no settlement authority.but,the day after the hospital and fastaff reached a settlement,the physicians attorney contacted plaintiffs counsel.when plaintiffs confirmed that the agreed settlement did not include them,counsel for the physicians offered plaintiffs as separate,additional,new money in return for a dismissal of his clients from the lawsuit.
just hours after the hospital and fastaff put their settlement on the record on april,the hospital learned of asrat settlement.
the motion of the physicians for good faith determination 
six days later,the physicians moved for a good faith determination.the physicians argued that there was no evidence they colluded with plaintiffs and the settlement figure was large enough to en
