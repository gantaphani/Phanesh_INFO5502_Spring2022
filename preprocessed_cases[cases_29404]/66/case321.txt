plaintiffs and appellants juan jose leal and juan carlos hernandez,the husband and son of decedent felipa hernandez,filed a wrongful death action against defendant cha hollywood presbyterian medical center hospital and defendant and respondent antoine mansour.at the close of plaintiffs evidence,the hospital motion for nonsuit was granted,and trial by jury proceeded as against mansour.plaintiffs appeal from the judgment entered in favor of mansour,the jury having found any negligence by mansour was not a substantial factor in the death of hernandez.plaintiffs sole contention on appeal is the trial court erred in allowing mansour to present evidence and argument to the jury that a ventilator malfunction was the cause of death,not the negligence of mansour.plaintiffs argue that code of civil procedure section section precluded mansour from presenting such evidence and arguments,and the trial court therefore erred in allowing that evidence to be presented to the jury and in denying plaintiffs motion for new trial.we conclude the court did not err and therefore affirm.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs have not raised a substantial evidence question.we summarize the material facts germane to our discussion.
on august,hernandez experienced a gallbladder attack,having suffered for years from problems with her gallbladder.she went to the hospital emergency room and was admitted for treatment.her doctor,mansour,had previously discussed surgical options with hernandez,in light of her history,and he again recommended she undergo a laparoscopic cholecystectomy the surgery.hernandez agreed and the surgery was performed by mansour that same day.there were no apparent complications during surgery,and the following morning hernandez appeared to be doing well and was scheduled to be discharged.
however,around midday on august,hernandez condition deteriorated.she exhibited multiple symptoms,including shortness of breath,low blood pressure and chest pain.mansour ordered hernandez to be immediately taken to the intensive care unit icu.he requested several consults from other physicians,believing hernandez may have been suffering from a pulmonary embolism,a heart attack,or a bile leak.
after steven gitlin,the pulmonary specialist,essentially ruled out a pulmonary embolism,a cat scan was performed and it was determined that fluid was accumulating in hernandez abdomen.mansour ordered the fluid drained,but a needle aspiration procedure was performed instead,removing only some of the fluid,which appeared to be bile.mansour placed another order for fluid drainage under ultrasound requiring the placement of a drain.sometime in the evening of august,hernandez was placed on a ventilator because of her deteriorating condition.
on august,radiologist edward neymark placed a drain in accordance with mansour order and recovered liters of greenish brown peritoneal fluid from hernandez abdominal cavity.arash alborzi,specializing in internal medicine and infectious diseases,determined hernandez was suffering from sepsis and septic shock due to an infection in her abdomen and ordered antibiotics.
around in the evening of august,the alarm on hernandez ventilator sounded and icu nurse,robert bustos,immediately responded to her room.he determined the ventilator was properly connected and she appeared to be receiving oxygen,but he called for the respiratory technician.the technician could not determine the reason for the alarm,and switched out the ventilator for a new one,while nurse bustos manually provided oxygen to hernandez.during this time,hernandez pulse dropped precipitously.a code blue was called at,resuscitation efforts were administered,and the medical records reflect the notation of a return pulse at 
yoo,a neurologist,was called in to assess hernandez after the code blue.it was determined hernandez suffered injury resulting from a lack of oxygen to the brain and did not experience a return of any prognostic signs indicating recovery,such as corneal response to light or other normal neurologic indicators.hernandez remained in a coma and passed away on august.no autopsy was performed.
plaintiffs filed suit against the hospital and mansour stating claims for medical negligence and wrongful death.plaintiffs alleged the hospital was negligent,among other things,in failing to insure that the ventilator used in the care of felipa hernandez was properly functioning and that she at all times received adequate oxygen.plaintiffs alleged mansour failed to adhere to the standard of care in performing the surgery and hernandez care.
the case proceeded to a jury trial in january.plaintiffs presented expert testimony primarily focused on the postoperative care provided by mansour.in essence,plaintiffs expert opined that mansour breached the standard of care by failing to timely return hernandez to surgery to correct the bile leak,and possible bowel or intestinal perforation,which resulted in the accumulation of fluid,abdominal infection and septic shock.jordan goodstein opined the cause of death was peritonitis or infection in the abdominal cavity.edward phillips,an expert retained by the hospital but called by plaintiffs to testify in their,also opined that mansour breached the standard of care and that hernandez should have been taken back to surgery on august because she was suffering from an abdominal catastrophe.
following the completion of plaintiffs,the hospital orally moved for a nonsuit.the grounds stated for the motion were that plaintiffs failed to present any expert testimony on the standard of care relative to the hospital on the issue of the alleged ventilator malfunction.after allowing argument,the court granted the motion.the court entered a minute order stating hospital motion for is argued and granted.plaintiff sic action against hospital is dismissed.
mansour then presented his evidence,calling andrew woo,an expert neurologist,as his first witness.before woo provided any testimony,plaintiffs counsel asked to approach,and a side bar conference was held.plaintiffs counsel said i want to make sure we not going to hear testimony about a ventilator malfunction that caused harm to this patient,because we already heard that there no testimony on that and the hospital has already been dismissed.
defense counsel responded absolutely,your honor.it goes to causation.where he been designated.we wo ask questions about the standard of care,but we absolutely entitled to ask about causation.i not bound by a failure of plaintiff to put on his case against the hospital.the court ruled the testimony would be permitted.
woo testified to his opinions about hernandez cause of death.he stated that,in his opinion,hernandez suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest on august due to a ventilator malfunction that was documented in the medical records.he conceded she was septic and very sick but that the timeline of her vital signs showed that her numbers had actually begun to improve,and then there was a very sudden event resulting in a rapid drop of blood pressure.t he fact that there was some type of documented mechanical or ventilator failure,the fact they literally had to change the ventilator,put in a new switch for a new machine after this whole arrest took place,makes me feel in my opinion that the ventilator had some significant role in causing the cardiopulmonary arrest.woo went on to opine that hernandez passed away days later and that the cardiopulmonary arrest causing the anoxic brain injury was the primary reason for her death.on,woo conceded the septic shock was also a substantial factor in hernandez experiencing cardiopulmonary arrest on august.
the next morning,plaintiffs presented a trial brief to the court arguing that the evidence presented by mansour regarding the ventilator malfunction was improper under section,subdivision d,and that the court should strike the testimony.plaintiffs also proposed two jury instructions instructing the jury that because the court granted a nonsuit in favor of the hospital,the jury could not attribute any fault to the hospital in rendering a verdict.the court entertained argument,but deferred a ruling,noting that counsel had presented
