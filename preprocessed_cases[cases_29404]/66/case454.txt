plaintiff and appellant doreece artal artal appeals a judgment in favor of defendant and respondent susan allen,allen based on the defense of the statute of limitations code civ,at the initial phase of a bifurcated nonjury trial 
artal awoke after pelvic surgery with throat pain,which was severe and persisted.artal knew she had been intubated for anesthesia by allen for surgery and believed the throat pain was related to the intubation,but was unaware that the intubation had been performed in a negligent manner.artal eventually underwent exploratory surgery,which revealed a thyroid cartilage fracture.
prior to the exploratory surgery,artal did not,and could not,discover the injury and its negligent cause.because artal filed suit within one year of discovering the injury and its negligent cause,and within three years of the injury,the judgment is reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court with directions to reinstate the action.
factual and procedural background 
on may,artal was admitted to cedars sinai medical center to undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy for suspected endometriosis.allen was the anesthesiologist for the surgery and intubated artal for the general anesthetic.artal was advised she might experience hoarseness and a sore throat for to hours after the surgery,and was instructed to call a doctor if the pain was not relieved by medication.
immediately after the surgery when artal awakened in the postanesthesia recovery room,she had severe throat pain.the pain was still severe hours after the surgery.however,artal waited to follow up with brooks,her surgeon,and did not see him for two weeks.
because the throat pain persisted and was severe,artal,sometimes accompanied by her husband saw at least specialists in the months following the may,surgery.artal consulted specialists in the fields of ent,neurology,head and neck,pulmonology,internal medicine,gastroenterology,pain,anesthesiology,psychiatry,dentistry,physical therapy and acupuncture.she was given possible diagnoses of tonsil infection,tumor or cancer,sinus infection,gastroesophageal reflux disease,a stone in the sublingual gland,injury to the cord of tympany,brain tumor,lupus,possible other autoimmune disease,emotional mental problems,capillary hyperplasia,carotidynia,cryptic tonsils,asthma,costochondritis,bruxism,salivary gland inflammation,neuralgia,neuropathy,glossopharyngeal neuralgia,pectoral upper back spasm,and postural irregularity.
on april,artal saw flaum,an ent specialist,at which time she completed a medical history form stating her problem as p ain in tongue,throat,neck,feeling of something in my throat all the time,recent sensation of numbness around chin all on left side pinching pain,following intubation.italics added.
on may,artal saw,a pain specialist,and completed a pain evaluation form.in response to the question what do you think is the cause of your pain,artal wrote,i do know.i feel that some sort of trauma was caused during intubation.italics added.
on november,artal underwent exploratory surgery by burke in an attempt to determine the cause of the pain she had been suffering since the may,surgery.after this surgery,burke informed artal that the superior cornu of the thyroid cartilage,the left side was fractured,and it was poking at a angle at the vertebral column.burke did not tell artal that the pain was caused by the intubation,he did not attribute the deformed thyroid cartilage to negligence,and he did not state that allen had been negligent.
a few days after the exploratory surgery by burke,artal thought about it and attributed the fracture to the intubation by allen.
proceedings.
on october,less than one year after undergoing the exploratory surgery,artal filed this action against allen,alleging professional negligence.
allen answered and raised the limitations period of section as an affirmative defense.allen moved for summary judgment,asserting the action was because artal discovered her injury no later than may,and failed to sue within one year thereof.as indicated,on may,artal wrote on pain evaluation form that the pain was caused by some sort of trauma during intubation.
the trial court denied summary judgment,finding there is a triable issue of fact as to the date of discovery of the alleged negligence.
the matter proceeded to a bifurcated trial,commencing with allen statute of limitations defense.
trial court ruling.
after hearing the first phase of the bifurcated trial,the trial court ruled the action is barred by the statute of limitations.the plaintiff was advised at the time of the surgery that she might experience pain for a couple of days.her pain continued past that time and she went to see many doctors to determine the source of her pain and discomfort.on april,plaintiff wrote on a form that her pain was following intubation.on may,she indicated on a form that she submitted to cedars sinai that some sort of trauma was caused during intubation.the complaint was not filed until october.the information that plaintiff had was sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry notice.in addition,plaintiff is a dentist with training in hospital medicine.her husband is an internist and he went with her to many of the doctor s appointments.plaintiff argued that while she knew she had pain,she did not know that it was caused by negligence.yet,at the time she filed her complaint,she had never been told that her injuries were caused by negligence.in other words,plaintiff finally decided to file this action without any doctor telling her that negligence had occurred.her decision to file was based on her own decision that negligence must have occurred.she had the facts upon which to base this suspicion within the statute of limitations.the court recognizes that plaintiff made every effort to ascertain the cause of her pain.she sought out numerous doctors in many medical fields.she did not rest until she finally had the medical answer.but,from a legal perspective,the search was too long.plaintiff had the suspicion and she was required to file the action.this was not done in a timely fashion.
artal filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.

discussion 
general principles plaintiff must file suit within one year of discovering the injury and its negligent cause.
section provides i n an action for injury against a health care provider based upon such person alleged professional negligence,the time for the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the injury,whichever occurs first.thus,section contains two periods of limitation,a period and a period,both of which must be met.rose fife d.
under section,the period is tolled upon proof of fraud,intentional concealment,or the presence of a foreign body,which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect,in the person of the injured person.the statute makes clear,however,that the period is not similarly extended.thus,regardless of extenuating circumstances,the patient must bring suit within one year after he discovers,or should have discovered,the injury.sanchez south hoover hospital,see supra,cal d at pp.gutierrez mofid cal d.
