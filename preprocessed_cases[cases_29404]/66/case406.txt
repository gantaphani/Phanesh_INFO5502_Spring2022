introduction 
appellant morgan,lewis bockius llp hereinafter morgan lewis appeals from the trial court grant of respondent ralph cassady motion for a new trial on his statutory and common law indemnity claims.cassady,an attorney,performed legal services for a client,rallie rallis,for over years.during that period,cassady practiced law with several firms and in a variety of capacities.for a period,cassady was employed as of counsel by morgan lewis.years later,rallis sued cassady,morgan lewis,and other firms and attorneys with whom cassady had been affiliated,for a variety of claims including professional negligence,premised on numerous aspects of cassady and those entities representation occurring over a multiyear period.morgan lewis provided a defense for several other attorneys,but not for cassady.after incurring legal fees for his defense,cassady sought indemnity from morgan lewis under labor code section which requires employers to indemnify employees for expenses or losses incurred in direct consequence of the discharge of their duties.morgan lewis prevailed on a summary judgment motion which disposed of cassady claims,but the trial court subsequently reversed course and granted cassady a new trial.morgan lewis appeals from that ruling.
we affirm the trial court grant of a new trial.under section,an employer must indemnify an employee for attorney fees and costs incurred in defending a third party lawsuit,where such expenses are necessary and the lawsuit is based on the employee conduct within the course and scope of his or her job duties.because proof that the defense costs were incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties is an element of the claim,the employee has the burden to prove the conduct on which he or she was sued arose in the course and scope of the employment.to meet that burden on the somewhat unique facts of this case,cassady bears the burden to prove which expenses he incurred as a result of performance of his duties with morgan lewis as opposed to other employers.however,morgan lewis summary judgment motion failed to show that cassady lacked,or could not obtain,sufficient evidence to prove this element of his claim.in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we likewise conclude morgan lewis failed to meet its burden to prove cassady lacked evidence to establish his common law indemnity claim.therefore,the trial court appropriately granted the motion for a new trial.
factual and procedural background 
the rallis action.
attorney cassady served as legal counsel for rallis and for various corporations and business entities in which rallis was an officer,director,or shareholder,from until november.during that period,cassady practiced with several different law firms,including morgan lewis and was rallis principal contact at each firm.as of january,cassady,practicing as cassady corporation,was a partner of hahn cazier.in february,substantially all the attorneys and employees of hahn cazier joined the morgan lewis firm.cassady was employed by morgan lewis as of counsel for approximately months,from february,through march.
on january,rallis sued cassady,morgan lewis,and other firms and attorneys with whom cassady had practiced while representing rallis the rallis action.rallis alleged legal malpractice,breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,negligent and intentional misrepresentation,and equitable indemnity,for alleged acts of professional negligence committed by cassady and the other defendants between approximately through.some of the conduct upon which rallis claims were premised was alleged to have occurred while cassady was employed by morgan lewis some was alleged to have occurred while cassady practiced with other law firms.
rallis revised second amended complaint alleged that cassady,and the various firms with whom cassady was associated at the applicable time periods,had advised and represented rallis in regard to the formation,acquisition,and affairs of various business entities,including mark industries,american corporation of california ahlc,and mark equipment center of south florida.cassady was also alleged to have been a,officer and director in various businesses which rallis formed or acquired.
the rallis complaint further alleged that in,terminated edward moloney,the company general manager and a percent stockholder.during the period through,cassady precipitated moloney lawsuit by mishandling negotiations and failing to keep rallis apprised of the risks and progress of the matter.rallis also alleged professional negligence and related claims in regard to a plethora of other transactions,including the acquisition of a competitor in the sale of a property to a corporate officer in the sale of assets in and the subsequent of its affairs the handling of distributions to stockholders in or after a stock sale and indemnity agreement a mark industries transaction and a proposed stock offering.
defense and resolution of the rallis action.
morgan lewis retained the law firm of sheppard mullin to defend it and certain former hahn cazier partners in the rallis action.morgan lewis did not provide a defense to cassady,who had already retained his own counsel,baird brown.brown also defended cassady corporation,cassady klein,ray klein,and klein corporation in the rallis action.morgan lewis subsequently advised cassady that it would not indemnify cassady or pay his defense fees.
by,all rallis claims had been dismissed either voluntarily,on demurrer,or through summary adjudication and summary judgment.the summary judgments were granted on statute of limitations grounds.rallis appealed.this court affirmed in part and reversed in part.rallis cassady,opn.ordered nonpub.we reversed the judgments in favor of cassady,cassady corporation,cassady klein,and another defendant.we affirmed the judgments in favor of morgan lewis and hahn cazier.cassady and the other remaining defendants entered into a settlement agreement with rallis,and the case was dismissed with prejudice.
the parties indemnity claims.
in july,cassady sued morgan lewis for indemnity,under both section and the common law.cassady sought fees and costs of approximately,plus interest,and the attorney fees and costs incurred in enforcing his section rights,subd.c.cassady indemnity demand included defense costs arising from his alleged conduct both at morgan lewis and while a partner at hahn cazier.
morgan lewis against cassady and certain other defendants in the rallis action,seeking contractual indemnity based upon a agreement between cassady and morgan lewis,reimbursement under section and declaratory relief.morgan lewis sought approximately in fees and costs it incurred defending the rallis action.
cassady moved for summary adjudication on morgan lewis section indemnity claim.the trial court denied the motion.
morgan lewis moved for summary judgment against cassady,on the ground cassady could not establish essential elements of his claims.morgan lewis contended,in regard to cassady section indemnity claim,that cassady did not possess,and could not reasonably obtain,evidence demonstrating which defense costs he necessarily expended in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties while at morgan lewis and cassady could not establish morgan lewis liability under section based solely on what rallis alleged cassady did while employed at morgan lewis.morgan lewis argued that cassady common law indemnity claim,like the section claim,must fail because cassady does not possess and can not reasonably obtain the needed evidence.
cassady responded,inter alia,that the law is that morgan lewis is responsible for all of cassady fees and costs in the rallis action except to the extent that morgan lewis can provide a reasonable basis for apportioning the fees and costs.cassady conceded that certain transactions about which rallis had complained were not indemnifiable because they occurred when cassady was not employed at morgan lewis.cassady estimated that the cost of defending those actions was.according to cassady,the remaining attorney fees he incurred defending the rallis action amounted to approximately.
the trial court granted morgan lewis summary judgment motion on the grounds advanced by morgan lewis.
the trial court then conducted a bench trial on morgan lewis cross complaint,and ruled in cassady favor 
cassady motion for a new trial.
cassady moved,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,for a new trial on the ground the trial court committed legal error when granting morgan lewis summary judgment motion code civ,subd.the trial court granted the motion,concluding it had erred when it granted morgan lewis summary judgment.in its oral ruling,the court stated that while cassady had the burden to prove his damages were necessary and in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties during the time he worked with morgan lewis,a triable issue of fact existed with regard to how attorney fees should be apportioned.the trial court minute order granting the motion did not contain a specification of its reasons for decision.
morgan lewis timely appealed the new trial order.code civ,subd.a.cassady filed a protective from the portion of the judgment granting summary judgment to morgan lewis.
contentions of the parties 
morgan lewis contends cassady had the burden to prove what portion of expenses he necessarily incurred in direct consequence of his employment with morgan lewis,and to distinguish expenses attributable to the time he practiced law elsewhere.the trial court original grant of summary judgment was proper,morgan lewis asserts,because it was undisputed that cassady did not possess,and could not reasonably obtain,evidence to make such an apportionment.
cassady urges that apportionment of indemnifiable expenses is not required because at least some of his defense costs arose from the discharge of his duties while at morgan lewis,and claims arising from his representation of rallis while employed at morgan lewis and at other firms were factually intertwined.further,cassady asserts that if apportionment is required,it should be morgan lewis burden because morgan lewis refused to provide his defense.finally,assuming he bears the burden of apportioning fees,cassady urges that morgan lewis summary judgment motion was wrongly granted because morgan lewis failed to establish cassady does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,the evidence necessary to make such an apportionment.
discussion 
standard of review.
a decision granting summary judgment may be challenged by a motion for a new trial.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,scott farrar d.a new trial may be granted under code of civil procedure code section,subdivision if the original ruling was erroneous as a matter of law.ramirez usaa casualty ins.d.normally,an order granting a new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,at,d,sole energy petrominerals th,d.however,as morgan lewis points out,the trial court order granting the new trial was procedurally deficient.code of civil procedure section requires that the trial court state the grounds and reasons for its grant of a new trial in writing,either in the order itself or in a separate statement filed within ten days.code civ,thompson friendly hills regional medical center th,d stewart truck ins.exchange th,d.the failure to supply an adequate specification of reasons or grounds renders the new trial order defective,but not void.bank of america cal d,thompson friendly hills regional medical center,supra,at,d.under such circumstances the party seeking a new trial has the burden to sustain his or her position on appeal.bank of america,supra,at,thompson,supra,at,d.here,the trial court did not prepare the mandated specification of reasons.accordingly,cassady has the burden to sustain his position on appeal.
the ruling at issue is the grant of morgan lewis summary judgment motion.an order granting summary judgment,of course,is reviewed independently.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,kahn east side union high school dist.cal th,d,state of health services superior court cal th,d.summary judgment should be granted when there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.kahn east side union high school,supra,at,d,tucci club mediterranee th,d.
labor code section.
section provides,in pertinent part,a an employer shall indemnify his or her employee for all necessary expenditures or losses incurred by the employee in direct consequence of the discharge of his or her duties,or of his or her obedience to the directions of the employer,even though unlawful,unless the employee,at the time of obeying the directions,believed them to be unlawful.c for purposes of this section,the term necessary expenditures or losses shall include all reasonable costs,including,but not limited to,attorney fees incurred by the employee enforcing the rights granted by this section.
section thus requires an employer to indemnify an employee who is sued by third persons for conduct in the course and scope of his or her employment,including paying any judgment entered and attorney fees and costs incurred in defending the action.jacobus krambo th,d douglas los angeles d.grissom vons companies,th,d plancarte guardsmark th,d los angeles police protective league city of los angeles th,d.as long as the employee is acting within the scope of his or her employment,the right to indemnity is not dependent upon a finding that the underlying action was unfounded.jacobus krambo,supra,at,d but see teamsters union local cir.
the elements of a section,subdivision a cause of action,as delineated by the statutory language,are the employee made expenditures or incurred losses the expenditures or losses were incurred in direct consequence of the employee discharge of his or her duties,or obedience to the directions of the employer and the expenditures or losses were necessary.the second element,at issue here,is met if the conduct defended against was within the course and scope of employment.jacobus krambo,supra,th at,d devereaux latham watkins th,d.in determining whether for purposes of indemnification an employee acts were performed within the course and scope of employment,the courts have looked to the doctrine of respondeat superior.citations.under that doctrine,an employer is vicariously liable for risks broadly incidental to the enterprise undertaken by the is,for an employee conduct that,in the context of the employer enterprise,is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer business.citations.citations.jacobus krambo,supra,at,d plancarte guardsmark,supra,th at,d devereaux latham watkins,supra,th at,d.an employee conduct may fall within the scope of his or her employment even though the act does not benefit the employer,even though the act is willful or malicious,and even though the act may violate the employer direct orders or policies.jacobus krambo,supra,at,d.
whether an employee acts are within the scope of employment is ordinarily a question of fact,but may be resolved as a question of law when the material facts are undisputed and no conflicting inferences are possible.farmers ins.group county of santa clara cal th,d,jacobus krambo,supra,th at,d.
here,unlike in the typical section case,there is no dispute that cassady representation of rallis while at morgan lewis was within the scope of his employment.instead,the question is the application of section when the defense costs arose from cassady alleged conduct spanning a period during which he was employed by several different successive employers.
morgan lewis must indemnify cassady,if at all,only for defense costs arising from cassady representation of rallis while employed by morgan lewis.
when interpreting a statute,we look to the plain meaning of the statute words,which are generally the most reliable indicator of the legislature intent.stephens county of tulare cal th,d,fitch select products cal th,d.the plain language of section makes clear that morgan lewis is responsible for indemnifying cassady,if at all,only for those defense costs arising from aspects of cassady representation of rallis undertaken during the period cassady was employed by morgan lewis.defense costs arising from cassady conduct when he was practicing law elsewhere do not meet the statutory criteria they simply can not have been incurred in direct consequence of the discharge of duties for morgan lewis.requiring morgan lewis to indemnify cassady for costs of defense based on alleged malpractice while he was working at other firms would contradict the express scope of the indemnity provided for by section.therefore,we necessarily reject cassady theory that morgan lewis must indemnify him for nearly all his defense costs because defense of the claims can not easily be disentangled from defense of the other claims.
cassady,however,contends that,where claims involve a common core of facts and are based on related legal theories,attorney fees need not be apportioned.see,reynolds metals alperson cal d,attorney fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an issue common to both a cause of action in which fees are proper and one in which they are not allowed bell vista unified school dist.th,d apportionment is not required when the claims for relief are so intertwined that it would be impracticable,if not impossible,to separate the attorney time into compensable and noncompensable units liton engineering contractor,united pacific insurance th,d where liability of two parties was so factually interrelated that it would have been impossible to separate the activities involved in an arbitration into compensable and noncompensable time units,allocation was not required drouin fleetwood enterprises d.attorneys fees need not be apportioned between distinct causes of action where plaintiff various claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories.
but none of these cases assist cassady,in that they did not involve application of section.section is not an attorney fees statute it is an indemnity statute.it expressly conditions the right to indemnity on a showing that the expenditures arose as a direct consequence of the discharge of the employee duties.if the expenditures did not arise from discharge of the employee duties,indemnity under section can not be had.see douglas los angeles,supra,d at.
on the other hand,where cassady incurred fees on an issue common to defense of rallis claims arising both from periods he was and was not employed by morgan lewis,indemnity is proper.reynolds metals alperson,supra,cal d,is instructive.in reynolds,the plaintiff sued on a consignment agreement which did not include an attorney fee provision,and on promissory notes,which did.the action was resolved adversely to the plaintiff,and attorney fees were awarded to the defendants.reynolds concluded that the defendants could not recover fees incurred solely for defending causes of action based on the consignment agreement.id.at.however,the court further reasoned that plaintiff joinder of causes of action should not dilute its right to attorney fees.attorney fees need not be apportioned when incurred for representation on an issue common to both a cause of action in which fees are proper and one in which they are not allowed.id.at.expenses common to both the promissory note and the consignment agreement therefore qualified for the fee award.id.at.
analogously here,the fact cassady worked for or was associated with more than one employer should not dilute his right to indemnity for costs incurred in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties at morgan lewis.thus,if cassady counsel performed work necessary to defense of a claim or issue predicated on both his conduct while at morgan lewis and elsewhere,indemnity for those fees is appropriate.reynolds metals alperson,supra,at.such defense costs would fall within section ambit because they would have been incurred in the defense of the morgan claims,even in the absence of the claims.
cassady bears the burden of proving which defense costs are attributable to his representation of rallis while employed by morgan lewis.
we likewise reject cassady argument that morgan lewis should bear the burden of apportioning defense fees between itself and other law firms.as we have observed,one of the elements of cassady section claim is that the expenditures or,the costs of defense of the rallis incurred in direct consequence of cassady discharge of his duties for morgan lewis.as noted,to establish this,it must be shown that the conduct defended against was within the course and scope of cassady employment with morgan lewis,subd.a jacobus krambo,supra,th at,d.
evidence code section provides,except as otherwise provided by law,a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.under evidence code section,the plaintiff normally bears the burden of proof to establish the elements of his or her cause of action.sargent fletcher,able th,d.
in rare instances,the burden of proof set forth in evidence code section is altered.it is true that t he general rule allocating the burden of proof applies except as otherwise provided by law.the exception is included in recognition of the fact that the burden of proof is sometimes allocated in a manner that is at variance with the general rule.lakin watkins associated industries cal th,d.in deciding whether to shift the normal allocation of the burden of proof,the courts consider a number of factors the knowledge of the parties concerning the particular fact,the availability of the evidence to the parties,the most desirable result in terms of public policy in the absence of proof of the particular fact,and the probability of the existence or nonexistence of the fact.citation.id.at,d,sargent fletcher,able,supra,th at,d.however,the exceptions to evidence code section are few,and narrow sargent fletcher,able,supra,at,d and the normal allocation of proof has been altered only on rare occasions national council against health fraud,king bio pharmaceuticals,th,d.shifting the burden of proof from the plaintiff to the defendant rests on a policy judgment that there is a substantial probability the defendant has engaged in wrongdoing and the defendant wrongdoing makes it practically impossible for the plaintiff to prove the wrongdoing.id.at,d,and cases cited therein sargent fletcher,able,supra,at,d,and cases cited therein.
cassady fails to persuade us that we should alter the normal burden of proof here.the evidence necessary to establish the facts essential to cassady,what work he performed for rallis while employed at morgan not lie peculiarly within morgan lewis knowledge and competence.to the contrary,the relevant evidence is primarily within cassady knowledge and control.see generally wolf superior court th,d.cassady,far better than morgan lewis,knows what professional services he performed for rallis during which time periods,and has better access to the relevant evidence.morgan lewis is especially unlikely to have ready access to information or evidence about what services cassady performed for rallis during periods when cassady was not employed by morgan lewis.
no public policy would be served by requiring employers to indemnify for expenses attributable to an employee conduct while working for a different employer.it would be unfair to force an employer to pay for employee torts that are unconnected with the activities of the business.citation.forcing liability upon an employer for torts that do not arise from the enterprise contravenes the basic rationale underlying the theory of respondeat superior.bailey filco,th,d.the obvious purpose of section is to protect employees from suffering expenses in direct consequence of doing their jobs.grissom vons companies,supra,th at,d janken gm hughes electronics th,fn,d.here,rallis alleged malpractice and other claims occurring over a roughly period.cassady was employed by morgan lewis for only approximately months of that time.no public policy would be served by forcing morgan lewis to foot the bill for defense of claims arising from conduct which occurred while cassady was not employed by the firm.
finally,morgan lewis is not alleged to have engaged in wrongdoing that makes it practically impossible for cassady to prove his claims.to the extent cassady may find it difficult to apportion his defense costs because of a lack of detail in his attorney billing records,that circumstance can not be attributed to morgan lewis.
cassady asserts that apportionment should be a morgan lewis problem,not a cassady problem because morgan lewis put itself in this situation by ignoring labor code section and refusing to defend cassady in the first place.he argues,where,as here,the employer ignores its duty under section and forces the employee to defend himself,the burden of apportioning the employee defense costs between claims arising from the employment and other claims ought to fall on the employer.
implicit in cassady argument is the suggestion that certain principles applicable in the insurance law context should apply to section.in the insurance context,in a mixed,one in which some claims are potentially covered and others are insurer has a duty to defend the entire action prophylactically,as an obligation imposed by law in support of the policy.buss superior court cal th,d,fn.omitted state of california pacific indemnity th,d croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation the rutter group.the insurer duty to defend is not apportioned based on the period of coverage.state of california pacific indemnity,supra,at,d.when an insurer refuses to defend an action in which a potential for coverage exists,the insured may recover defense costs,including attorney fees allocable to the defense of noncovered claims,unless the insurer can prove they were unreasonable or unnecessary.id.at,d see also transport indemnity cal th,d,croskey,supra,at.
the instant situation resembles the mixed action scenario,in that certain aspects of the defense of the rallis action are potentially indemnifiable,whereas other portions of the rallis action based upon cassady conduct when he was not employed by morgan clearly not at least not by morgan lewis.despite this superficial similarity,insurance principles have no application here.an insurance policy is a contract between an insurer and an insured citations,the insurer making promises,and the insured paying premiums,the one in consideration for the other,against the risk of loss citations.citation.the insurer promises require it both to indemnify and to defend its insured.citation.state of california pacific indemnity,supra,th at,d.
first,the record is not entirely clear as to whether or when cassady tendered his defense to morgan lewis,or simply sought reimbursement of his attorney fees after the fact.assuming cassady requested morgan lewis defend him,however,morgan lewis failure to furnish defense counsel does not mean it must later indemnify cassady for all defense costs.section does not impose a duty to defend upon an employer.the existing caselaw on this point is contradictory.compare grissom vons companies,supra,th at,d with jacobus krambo,supra,th at,d.douglas los angeles,supra,d at page,stated that section requires an employer to defend or indemnify an employee who is sued by third persons for conduct in the course and scope of his employment.douglas further reasoned that if an employer elects to run a risk and refuses to defend and indemnify an employee who is sued as a result of acts and conduct within the scope of his employment,then the employer must bear the consequences of labor code section if it is established that the employee was sued as a result of acts and conduct within the scope of his employment.douglas los angeles,supra,at.douglas concluded,when an employer refuses to defend an employee in an action which may or may not be unfounded for conduct which may or may not have been within the course and scope of his employment and it is ultimately established that the action was unfounded and the employee acted within the course and scope of his employment,then the employer has an obligation under labor code section to indemnify the employee for his attorney fees and costs in defending the action.douglas,supra,at.
grissom vons companies,supra,th at pages through,d,explained why the statement in douglas was too broad.section does not say that an employer must defend an employee.the word defend does not appear in section.the statute merely requires the employer to indemnify the employee for all that the employee necessarily expends in direct consequence of the discharge of the employee duties.the focus of the actual words of the statute is on the employee expenditure.if that expenditure is necessarily in direct consequence of the discharge of the employee duties,then the employer must indemnify,reimburse the employee.grissom vons companies,supra,at,d,fn.omitted.grissom also pointed to the dictionary definition of indemnify,which does not mean defend.id.at,fn,d.an employer may obviate the need to indemnify for attorney fees by providing counsel under some circumstances see id.at,d,but it is not required to do so.
more recently,jacobus krambo,supra,th,d,citing douglas,stated that section requires the employer not only to pay any judgment entered against the employee for conduct arising out of his employment but also to defend an employee who is sued for such conduct.jacobus krambo,supra,at,d see also plancarte guardsmark,supra,th at,d section obligates the employer not only to pay any judgment entered against the employee for conduct arising out of his employment but also to defend an employee sued by a third person for such conduct.
on this point,we believe grissom has the better view.it is certainly true,as douglas reasoned,that the employer who declines to provide a defense must pay defense costs if it is determined that the acts for which the employee was sued arose in the course and scope of employment.however,as grissom reasoned,section does not expressly include a requirement to defend it speaks only in terms of indemnification.indemnity may be defined as the obligation resting on one party to make good a loss or damage another party has incurred.citation.mccrary construction metal deck specialists,th,d.defense and indemnity are distinct concepts.the duty to indemnify requires payment of money,while the duty to defend entails the rendering of a service,the mounting and funding of a defense.certain underwriters at lloyd of london superior court cal th,d,croskey,et,cal.practice guide insurance litigation,supra.certainly,if the legislature wished to impose a duty to defend as well as the duty to indemnify,it knew how to do so.compare with,expressly providing that,upon request,a public entity shall provide for the defense of any civil action or proceeding brought against certain public employees on account of acts or omissions in the scope of employment.nor is the indemnity requirement at issue here based upon a contract between the parties.see,subd.requiring that,when an indemnity contract is interpreted,a person indemnifying is bound to defend actions brought against the person indemnified in respect to the matters embraced by the indemnity,absent a showing of a contrary intent.
in any event,section does not transform an employer into an insurer.even the authorities that impose a duty to defend have been careful to clarify that the duties imposed by section are not coterminous with an insurer duty to defend.unlike an insurer,the employer need not defend whenever there is a mere potential for liability.jacobus krambo,supra,th at,d plancarte guardsmark,supra,th at,d same.as douglas explained,in a section action,the right of recovery is derived from a statute rather than an insurance policy.since the statutory right is based upon a state of fact if he is sued in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties as such,or of his obedience to the directions of the employer it must logically follow that if the statutorily defined state of facts does not exist then the statutory rights do not arise.douglas los angeles,supra,d at,italics added.
further,there are significant differences between an insurer and an.boyer jensen th,d.liability insurers protect insureds against damage or liability from generally defined risks in exchange for a premium.citation.insurers have a distinct and duty to defend their insureds.heppler peters th,d.when an indemnity contract imposes the duty to defend,that duty is not triggered until it is determined that the proceeding against the indemnitee is embraced by the indemnity.ibid.
because principles applicable in the insurance context do not apply here,morgan lewis failure to defend cassady does not mandate that morgan lewis reimburse cassady for attorney fees allocable to the defense of claims premised on cassady conduct while employed somewhere other than morgan lewis.
in sum,we hold cassady must prove,as an element of his section cause of action,that the attorney fees and costs he seeks arose from the discharge of his duties while at morgan lewis.we next turn to the question of whether morgan lewis summary judgment motion established cassady did not possess,and could not obtain,evidence to make such a showing.
morgan lewis failed to carry its initial burden on summary judgment that cassady did not possess,and could not obtain,evidence proving that at least some of the costs of defending the rallis action were incurred in direct consequence of the discharge of his duties.
summary judgment standard.
in moving for summary judgment,a defendant has met his burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if he has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,code civ,subd.o syngenta crop protection,helliker th,d.
a defendant moving for summary judgment need not conclusively negate an element of the plaintiff cause of action he need only show that one or more elements can not be established.in other words,all that the defendant need do is to show that the plaintiff can not establish at least one element of the cause of example,that the plaintiff can not prove element although he remains free to do so,the defendant need not himself conclusively negate any such example,himself prove not aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted.a defendant may show an element can not be established by presenting evidence that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,needed evidence.id.at,d,kahn east side union high school,supra,cal th at,d,syngenta crop protection,helliker,supra,th at,d.morgan lewis could satisfy its initial burden to show an absence of evidence through admissions by the plaintiff following extensive discovery to the effect that he has discovered nothing aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,at,d,or through discovery responses that are factually devoid.union bank superior court th,d.argument alone is insufficient.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,at,d.
in opposing a defendant motion,the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of his or her pleadings to show that a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,must set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.
morgan lewis failed to establish cassady did not possess,and could not obtain,evidence to support his indemnity claim.
as noted above,the trial court ruling was based on its finding that cassady did not possess and could not reasonably obtain evidence to establish his expenditures were necessary and incurred as a direct consequence of discharge of his duties at morgan lewis.morgan lewis summary judgment motion attempted to make that showing primarily in two ways.first,morgan lewis fact cassady did not,cassady and his counsel admit that cassady claim against morgan lewis for indemnification under labor code section is based upon the allegations in the rallis a ction.in support,morgan lewis offered various discovery and deposition excerpts in which cassady affirmed that the basis for his indemnity claim was the rallis action relying on douglas los angeles,supra,d,morgan lewis argues cassady could not establish morgan lewis liability under s ection based solely on what rallis alleged cassady did,but instead must show that the actual conduct for which he was sued was committed while employed by morgan lewis.
it is true that the allegations in a complaint do not,at trial,constitute evidence of the truth of the allegations made therein san diego police officers city of san diego th,fn,d,and a party can not rely on its own pleadings as evidence to support or oppose a summary judgment motion.aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d,college hospital superior court cal th,fn,d.but here,rallis complaint was evidence of the lawsuit cassady was required to defend against.whether true or not,rallis allegations necessarily defined the scope of the action cassady defense costs arose from the necessity to defend against the allegations in the complaint.the mere fact cassady indemnity claim was based upon the allegations in the rallis complaint therefore does not establish a lack of evidence.to the contrary,it is difficult to imagine what else the indemnity claim could have been based upon.neither the language of morgan lewis undisputed fact,nor the evidence cited in support thereof,established an absence of evidence that cassady was sued,at least in part,because of his representation of rallis while employed at morgan lewis.instead,undisputed fact set forth the unremarkable proposition that cassady defense costs were necessitated by the rallis action,and the scope of the defense was framed by rallis particular allegations.
moreover,the evidence cited in support of fact did not demonstrate the absence of evidence.one cited interrogatory called for cassady to specify each act he contended he was sued for in the rallis action.it is hardly surprising,therefore,that cassady responded by referencing the rallis complaint and summaries thereof prepared by morgan lewis attorneys.given that the interrogatory was expressly framed in terms of what the rallis action alleged,criticism that the response referenced the complaint seems misplaced.two of the cited deposition excerpts set forth cassady theory about why he should be indemnified for his representation of rallis while employed elsewhere.while cassady theory may have been incorrect,his responses did not demonstrate a lack of evidence that at least some of the defense expenses arose due to his rendering of professional services to rallis while employed by morgan lewis.thus,undisputed fact and the evidence offered in support did not suffice to shift the burden to cassady to show a triable issue.
douglas los angeles,supra,d,does not compel a contrary conclusion.in that case,a newspaper reporter was sued over a series of articles he had written,allegedly using documents that had been illegally obtained.after the newspaper refused to defend the action,the reporter obtained his own counsel and later sought reimbursement of his attorney fees and costs under section.the trial court held for the newspaper.id.at.it held that if the reporter did what the plaintiff alleged that he did,it would have been outside the scope of his employment,and that the newspaper had no knowledge that what the reporter in fact did was outside the scope of his employment.id.at.the appellate court reversed,concluding that the trial court had failed to make a finding on a material issue of fact,and the findings made did not support the judgment.id.at.the trial court should have made a finding regarding the truth of the reporter allegation that the acts for which he was sued were undertaken at the direction of the newspaper.id.at.in this context,douglas reasoned that t he test is not what the third person alleges but what were the facts.id.at.
we do not read douglas as standing for the principle that a defendant sued for malpractice and related claims can not reference the allegations of the third party complaint as relevant to a determination of the necessary scope of his defense.instead,douglas stands for the prosaic proposition that a trier of fact calle
