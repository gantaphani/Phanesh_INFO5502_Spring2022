the issue in this case is whether limitations bars the plaintiff medical malpractice claims.ronald moss sued harshad shah,claiming shah negligently performed surgery on moss right eye and neglected to provide adequate treatment.the trial court granted shah motion,which alleged that moss did not file suit within two years of the tort or breach,as the medical liability and insurance improvement act requires.see.stat.the court of appeals held that moss claims were not barred,reversed the judgment,and remanded the cause to the trial court.we disagree and hold that article section bars both moss negligent surgery and negligent treatment claims.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment for shah.
background 
on may,moss first saw shah after another eye doctor diagnosed a detached retina in moss right eye.on june,shah surgically implanted a scleral buckle to keep moss retina in place.moss continued to have problems with his vision after the surgery,but shah warned him that removing the scleral buckle could result in another retinal detachment.moss visited another specialist for an opinion about his blurred vision.and,based on that specialist recommendation,shah removed the scleral buckle on november.
moss saw shah five times for recheck visits,the first visit occurring two weeks after the november surgery.moss then saw shah twice in january for one month recheck visits and once in may for a three month recheck visit.finally,moss visited shah on october,for a final recheck visit.
moss did not visit shah again until a yearly exam on november.at that time,moss complained about a new floater in his vision that appeared since the last recheck visit.shah discovered that moss retina had again detached.consequently,shah repaired the second detached retina on december.but moss still complained about blurred vision after that surgery.and,despite several other procedures and eventual cataract surgery,moss eventually lost sight in his right eye.moss visited shah for the last time on july,when shah told moss he could do nothing more to improve his vision.
moss notified shah about his malpractice claims on april,and filed suit on june.in his petition,moss claims shah,in november,negligently removed the scleral buckle that shah previously implanted to repair moss detached retina.he further alleges that shah did not adequately monitor moss eye following the surgery.specifically,moss claims that shah negligent surgery and failure to carefully monitor moss condition on a weekly or monthly basis to detect and prevent further retina detachments caused the eventual blindness in his right eye.
shah moved for summary judgment,claiming that the statute of limitations in article section bars moss claims.shah alleged that moss should have filed suit within two years after november,the date shah surgically removed the scleral buckle.in response,moss presented conrad moore affidavit as expert evidence.moore opined that moss past experiences with a retinal detachment and tears required shah to provide moss with careful and continuous treatment.he stated that the removal of the scleral buckle,without careful on a weekly or monthly basis thereafter was a deviation from the standard of care and caused moss second retinal detachment.shah then supplemented his evidence with his own affidavit wherein he stated that he did not provide moss with a continuing course of treatment after the november surgery.he explained that moss retina was attached after that surgery and thus further continuous treatment was unnecessary.shah also claimed that moss visits from november through november were routine periodic checkups.the trial court granted summary judgment for shah.
moss appealed,arguing that his claims are not because shah engaged in a negligent course of treatment for moss eye problem that continued until his last office visit on july.the court of appeals agreed and reversed the trial court judgment,holding that limitations did not bar moss negligence claims.at.the court relied on the part of section that provides that limitations begins to run from the date the medical treatment that is the subject of the claim is completed.stat.
we granted shah petition for review to determine if article section bars moss medical negligence claims.
ii.the parties contentions 
shah argues that moss two claims are under article section.first,he argues that limitations bars moss claim because the surgery occurred on an ascertainable date and thus limitations runs from that date for any resulting injuries.see earle ratliff,holding that limitations began on surgery date because the plaintiff did not allege negligence gormley stover,same.specifically,shah contends,moss claim is barred because his suit was not brought within two years after the november surgery.
second,shah argues that limitations also bars moss negligent treatment claim.he contends that moss allegation that shah should have ordered weekly or monthly exams after the surgery does not establish a course of treatment,because this court has held that w hile the failure to treat a condition may well be negligent,we can not accept the proposition that the failure to establish a course of treatment is a course of treatment.bala maxwell,quoting rowntree hunsucker.shah urges that limitations could run only from dates moss actually visited the office.therefore,the last date shah could have breached any duty to provide additional care was on october,the last recheck visit.shah further maintains that the november,visit when he discovered moss second retinal detachment was not part of any course of treatment because it was only a yearly exam.
in response,moss argues that limitations runs from the last day shah treated moss for eye problems and not the november surgery date.he contends that shah engaged in a course of treatment for moss retinal problems from the november surgery date until july,the last time shah saw moss.moss maintains that the november surgery removing the scleral buckle,coupled with the inadequate care and monitoring,caused his injury.therefore,the limitations period did not begin to run until the last date shah saw moss.see.stat.
additionally,moss contends that shah was not entitled to summary judgment on moss claim because shah motion did not discuss this allegation.moss also argues that applying section to bar his claims violates the texas constitution open courts provision.see.const.art.i.
iii.applicable law 
limitations for medical negligence claims 
article section measures the limitations period for medical negligence claims from one of three dates the occurrence of the breach or tort,the last date of the relevant course of treatment,or the last date of the relevant hospitalization.stat,husain khatib.a plaintiff may not choose the most favorable date that falls within section three categories.husain,at.rather,if the date the alleged tort occurred is ascertainable,limitations must begin on that date.earle,at.and if the date is ascertainable,further inquiry into the second and third categories is unnecessary.husain,at kimball brothers.
however,there may be instances when the exact date the alleged tort occurred can not be ascertained.the second category in section contemplates such a situation wherein the patient injury occurs during a course of treatment for a particular condition and the only readily ascertainable date is the last day of treatment.kimball,at.but before the last treatment date becomes relevant to determining when limitations begins,the plaintiff must establish a course of treatment for the alleged injury.rowntree hunsucker.moreover,if the defendant committed the alleged tort on an ascertainable date,whether the plaintiff established a course of treatment is immaterial because limitations begins to run on the ascertainable date.husain,at.
fraudulent concealment 
fraudulent concealment in cases estops a provider from relying on limitations to bar a plaintiff claim.borderlon peck.the plaintiff must show the provider actually knew a wrong occurred,had a fixed purpose to conceal the wrong,and did conceal the wrong from the patient.earle,at.fraudulent concealment tolls limitations until the plaintiff discovers the fraud or could have discovered the fraud with reasonable diligence.velsicol chem.winograd.
in borderlon,this court held that article section does not abolish fraudulent concealment as an equitable estoppel to the affirmative defense of limitations.borderlon,at.a plaintiff who asserts fraudulent concealment to avoid summary judgment on limitations grounds must raise a fact issue that would support this assertion.earle,at.
c.the texas constitution open courts provision 
the texas constitution guarantees that persons bringing claims will not unreasonably or arbitrarily be denied access to the courts.const,all courts shall be open,and every person for an injury done him,in his lands,goods,person or reputation,shall have remedy by due course of law.earle,at jennings burgess.a statute that unreasonably or arbitrarily abridges a person right to obtain redress for injuries another person harmful act causes is an unconstitutional law violation.earle,at jennings,at.consequently,our constitution open courts provision protects a person from legislative acts that cut off a person right to sue before there is a reasonable opportunity to discover the wrong and bring suit.neagle nelson.and the legislature can not abrogate the right to bring a claim without showing that the statute objectives and purposes outweigh denying the constitutionally guaranteed right of redress.weiner wasson,sax votteler.
to establish an open courts violation in an article case,a litigant must first show a cognizable,claim that article limitations provision restricts.see jennings,at.then,the litigant must show the restriction is unreasonable or arbitrary when balanced against the statute purpose and basis.jennings,at sax,at.the limitations provision in article section does not violate the open courts guarantee if the plaintiff had a reasonable opportunity to discover the alleged wrong and bring suit before the limitations period expired.earle,at jennings,at.
standard of review 
the standard for reviewing a summary judgment under texas rule of civil procedure c is whether the moving party carried its burden of showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that judgment should be granted as a matter of law.lear siegler,perez.a defendant moving for summary judgment on a statute of limitations affirmative defense must prove conclusively that defense elements.velsicol chem,at.in reviewing a trial court summary judgment,we resolve all doubts against the movant,and we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovants.kpmg peat marwick harrison county hous.fin,lear,at.additionally,in determining whether a disputed material fact issue exists,we take as true evidence favorable to the nonmovant.american tobacco,grinnell.
iv.analysis 
negligent surgery claim 
the court of appeals determined that the second retinal detachment occurred some time between the november surgery and moss yearly office visit in november.at.consequently,the court of appeals concluded that the tort date is unascertainable,and thus,it applied section treatment completion doctrine to determine the date when limitations began to run.at.we disagree with the court of appeals analysis.
moss petition alleges two claims negligent surgery and negligent treatment.the date shah removed the scleral buckle is.thus,the court of appeals erroneously applied a analysis to conclude that limitations does not bar moss claim.see at.
when the date of the alleged tort or breach is ascertainable,limitations begins to run from that date.husain,at kimball,at.this rule applies even if the exact date on which the injury occurred is unknown.husain,at.if the date the doctor alleged negligence took place can be ascertained,then there are no doubts to resolve and we must measure limitations from that date.husain,at.here,because the alleged tort date is ascertainable,and because moss did not file suit within two years of that date,article section bars moss negligent surgery claim.
negligent treatment claim 
the court of appeals determined that the evidence demonstrated a course of treatment that shah administered for moss retina problems.at.it further concluded that,because there was some evidence that the november visit related to the continuing relationship between shah and moss to treat moss retinal problems,there was a fact issue about when the course of treatment ended.at.it thus rejected shah argument that the last date on which limitations could begin for moss negligent treatment claim was october,the last recheck visit.at.again,we disagree with the court of appeal analysis.
the court of appeals dismissed shah argument that the same analysis we applied to the plaintiffs claims in husain and rowntree applies to moss negligent treatment claim.at.instead,it concluded these cases are distinguishable because they involved an alleged duty to perform specific tests during specific office visits rather than an alleged duty to monitor or continue treatment.at.the dissent also concludes that husain and rowntree do not apply for the same reason.at.but the court of appeals and dissent distinction ignores the rule applied in those cases that is,if the date the alleged tort or breach took place is ascertainable,a analysis is immaterial to determining when limitations begins to run.
in rowntree,the plaintiff alleged that the doctor did not diagnose,monitor,and otherwise properly treat her occluded artery when he treated and prescribed medication for her high blood pressure.at.this court had to determine if the plaintiff taking the prescribed medication created a course of treatment absent any other office visits or medical services.rowntree,at.we concluded there was no course of treatment because the plaintiff allegation was her doctor breached a duty to perform certain exams that would have detected the occluded artery.rowntree,at.thus,we held that limitations began to run on the last date the doctor actually saw the plaintiff and had the opportunity to perform his alleged duties.rowntree,at.
further,in husain,the plaintiff alleged that her doctor was negligent in not performing certain medical exams,after she complained about a lump in her breast,to detect her breast cancer.at.we concluded that the dates on which the doctor alleged negligence took place were readily ascertainable because the doctor did not perform the necessary exams during specific office visits.husain,at.moreover,we held that,because the doctor alleged negligence occurred on ascertainable dates,it was therefore immaterial whether the doctor established a course of treatment for the patient condition.husain,at.
this court holding in kimball is also instructive.at.in that case,the plaintiff was admitted into the hospital for chest pains.his surgery was postponed,however,because the defendant doctor was unable to intubate and the plaintiff suffered respiratory and cardiac failure.after this incident,the doctor performed no other procedures on the plaintiff and did not see him again though the plaintiff stayed in the hospital for six more days.kimball,at.the plaintiff sued the doctor for negligence two years after the last day he stayed in the hospital.this court affirmed the trial court summary judgment for the doctor on limitations grounds,concluding that the precise date of the alleged tort was ascertainable from the case facts.that is,the alleged tort occurred on the only date the doctor had contact with the plaintiff.accordingly,we held that the plaintiff could not invoke the second or third categories in section to measure the limitations period and,therefore,the claims were.kimball,at.
that a analysis is immaterial if the tort date is ascertainable is further exemplified in chambers conaway,a case upon which moss relies.see.there,the plaintiff alleged that her doctor did not diagnose her breast cancer despite her complaint about a lump in her breast and her numerous visits to the doctor for ailments unrelated to that complaint.chambers,at.the plaintiff presented evidence establishing that her doctor had a duty to perform tests and to monitor any conditions of which he had a lump in the plaintiff breast.chambers,at.we concluded that the doctor allegedly breached this duty on the specific dates when the plaintiff visited the doctor.chambers,at.because the tort dates were ascertainable,we refused to apply a analysis,and we held that limitations began to run from the date the plaintiff last saw the doctor.chambers,at see also bala,at holding that doctor could have breached duty to conduct medical tests only when he examined the plaintiff on specific dates and thus limitations ran from the plaintiff last office visit.
here,moss expert affidavit opines that shah had a duty to provide careful treatment on a weekly or monthly basis after he surgically removed the scleral buckle in november.we must take this evidence as true.see american tobacco,at.accordingly,we assume that the proper standard of care was as moss expert or monthly visits after the november surgery.applying the duty the alleged standard of care imposes,we would conclude that limitations began to run each time shah saw moss,beginning with the first visit in november.this is because shah breached the alleged duty to provide weekly or monthly treatment on every date he actually saw moss.see husain,at rowntree,at.but we view the evidence in the light most favorable to moss.see kpmg peat marwick,at lear,at.therefore,the last date shah could have ordered additional weekly or monthly office visits was during the last recheck visit on october.
the court of appeals and the dissent arrive at a contrary conclusion and hold that the yearly exam in november was part of shah course of treatment for moss retina problems.at,at.however,the court of appeals and the dissent analysis ignores the rule that,if the date the alleged negligence occurred is readily ascertainable,whether a course of treatment existed is immaterial.husain,at chambers,at.and it ignores that it is the breach of the duty the alleged standard of care or monthly,when applied to this case facts,dictates when limitations began to run.see husain,at chambers,at.moss medical records demonstrate that moss last recheck visit was on october,and shah did not diagnose the second detached retina until moss visited shah more than twelve months later on november.because of the standard of care alleged,the last date shah could have breached the alleged duty to provide weekly or monthly visits was on october.consequently,the november,visit is immaterial to our analysis.
additionally,the dissent incorrectly suggests that kimball language supports the conclusion that limitations runs from the completion of moss alleged course of treatment.at.but that language expressly states that article limitations prong applies only if the patient injury occurs during a course of treatment for a particular condition and the only readily ascertainable date is the last day of treatment.kimball,at emphasis added.here,because we must assume moss alleged standard of care is true and apply the duty that arises from it to the facts,we can identify an ascertainable tort.therefore,we do not apply a limitations analysis.
similarly,the dissent mistakenly contends that chambers supports the notion that,if the applicable standard of care requires treatment for a particular condition,a physician may breach an ongoing duty to monitor that condition without doing so on any single date.at.but the dissent conclusion disregards that we declined to apply a analysis in chambers because,based on the duty the plaintiff alleged,we could ascertain the tort date.chambers,at.thus,even if the standard of care requires an ongoing duty to monitor,we do not apply the limitations provision if we can ascertain the tort date.
accordingly,we conclude that the last date on which shah could have breached his alleged duty to provide more frequent treatment was on october.because moss filed suit in june,more than two years after shah allegedly neglected to provide the proper care,limitations bars this claim.see.stat.
fraudulent concealment 
moss argues that limitations does not bar his claims because shah fraudulently concealed the negligent nature of the november surgery and the treatment.moss claims that when shah diagnosed the second retinal detachment in november,shah actually knew he committed malpractice in removing the scleral buckle.and moss contends that shah explanations about moss blurred vision after the surgery for the second retinal detachment were designed to conceal this negligence.moreover,moss argues that shah motion did not consider his allegations,and therefore,the court of appeals decision to remand the case should stand.
moss contention that shah motion did not consider his claim is without merit.to avoid summary judgment on limitations grounds,moss must have raised a fact issue to support his assertion.see earle,at baptist mem l hosp.arredondo.moss had to raise a fact issue showing shah knew moss had been wronged and concealed that fact to deceive him.see earle,at.
here,the only evidence moss relies upon to support his allegation is his affidavit and parts of his deposition testimony.the affidavit,however,does not allege any facts suggesting that shah knew,after the november surgery,that he was negligent and that he concealed this known wrong to deceive moss.the affidavit only states that shah told moss,before the november surgery,that moss eye had healed and the scleral buckle could be removed.moreover,shah deposition testimony indicates that before the november surgery,shah told moss about the risks in removing the scleral buckle.both the affidavit and the deposition testimony indicate that after the second surgery in,shah told moss that he needed time to heal and his blurred vision should improve.but this evidence does not show,or even suggest,that shah made these assurances to conceal a known wrong or to deceive moss.see earle,at holding affidavit stating that the doctor told the patient surgery would improve his condition and was needed for reasons that later showed not to be true was not evidence that the doctor knew the statements were false when he made them and intended to conceal a known wrong.
accordingly,moss evidence did not raise a fact issue demonstrating that shah knew about the alleged negligence and that he concealed this wrong to deceive moss.because moss did not raise a fact issue to support his claim,the limitations period was not tolled and limitations bars moss claims.see earle,at.
open courts challenge 
moss also argues that our constitution open courts provision precludes article section from barring his negligence claims.see.const.art.i.moss did not learn about the second retinal detachment until almost two years after shah removed the scleral buckle.he then waited an additional seventeen months before filing suit.but moss contends that the limitations period should not bar his claims,because he did not know there was a causal connection between shah conduct and moss eventual blindness until after his final office visit with shah in july.
moss negligence claims against shah reflect medical malpractice claims.see jennings,at.we have already concluded that article section bars these claims.therefore,it was moss burden to raise a fact issue demonstrating that he did not have a reasonable opportunity to discover the alleged wrong before the limitations period expired so that the open courts guarantee applies.see earle,at.
the evidence shows moss knew,even before the november surgery,that removing the scleral buckle could result in another detached retina.it also establishes that moss had vision problems indicating the possibility of another detached retina.the evidence further demonstrates that moss continued to have vision problems from october,when moss had his last recheck visit and limitations began to run on his negligent treatment claim,to november,when shah diagnosed the second retinal detachment.and those vision problems remained even after the second surgery.accordingly,the evidence demonstrates moss had a reasonable opportunity to discover the alleged wrong and bring suit within the two year limitations period.
additionally,even if we take as true moss assertion that he could not have sued within the limitations period because he did not discover shah negligenc
