in an effort to stem frivolous suits against health care providers,the legislature has made a number of changes in the rules of civil litigation.among them has been a requirement since for early expert reports and a provision since for interlocutory review of those reports since adoption of the latter provision,of the courts of appeals in texas have routinely conducted interlocutory review of allegedly inadequate reports but two courts have second and in this case the tenth courts of appeals have held they have no jurisdiction of such appeals 
we have jurisdiction to determine whether a court of appeals has properly declined jurisdiction because we agree with the great majority that interlocutory review is proper,we reverse.
background 
dewayne funderburk,as next friend of his daughter whitney funderburk,filed this suit claiming rory lewis was negligent in treating whitney broken wrist.when lewis moved to dismiss the case for failure to serve an expert report,funderburk pointed to a letter in the medical records.the letter said nothing about any standard of care,breach,or causation.nevertheless,the trial court refused to dismiss,instead granting a extension during which funderburk served a report by a local osteopath.lewis again moved to dismiss,and the trial court again denied his motion.lewis then filed an interlocutory appeal with the tenth court of appeals,which dismissed for want of jurisdiction,with one justice dissenting 
ii.interlocutory review of inadequate reports 
section of the civil practices and remedies code provides that within days of filing a claimant must serve a curriculum vitae and one or more expert reports regarding every defendant against whom a health care claim is asserted section has numerous subparts,including 
subpart b requiring trial courts to dismiss a claim with prejudice and award fees if an expert report has not been served by the statutory deadline 
subpart c allowing a extension of the deadline if a report is found inadequate and 
subpart l providing that a motion challenging a report adequacy should be granted only if the report does not represent a effort to comply with the statute 
of these and other rulings a trial court might make under section,the legislature provided for interlocutory review of just two.first,an immediate appeal can be taken if a trial court denies relief sought under subpart b second,an immediate appeal is allowed when a trial court grants relief under subpart l the question here is whether the trial court order falls under b or l a jurisdictional question as a denial under b is immediately appealable but a denial under l is not.
we disagree with the tenth court of appeals that lewis motion,which sought dismissal and attorney fees,falls under subpart l.only subpart b provides for dismissal and fees.subpart l provides for challenges to inadequate reports,but says nothing about dismissal or fees.that is because some those filed within the first seek dismissal or fees until the window has closed.only when that window has closed and no report has been filed can a defendant move for dismissal and fees under subpart b.
funderburk argues that because subpart b refers to cases in which an expert report has not been served,it must be limited to cases in which there is no report at all.but in section c,the legislature made clear that when it used the words an expert report has not been served,it meant to include cases in which an inadequate report has been served 
if an expert report has not been served within the period specified by subsection a because elements of the report are found deficient,the court may grant one extension to the claimant in order to cure the deficiency 
when a statute uses a term with a particular meaning,we are bound by the statutory usage as subpart c defines a timely but deficient report as one that has not been served,the same meaning must be given the same phrase in subpart b 
we do not reach the question addressed in the concurring opinions here because it is not raised.as stated in his reply brief,lewis has made it abundantly clear that he is not appealing the trial court initial order no matter how vehemently he disagrees with it,but instead is only appealing the order denying his second motion to dismiss.
accordingly,the court of appeals had jurisdiction to consider the alleged inadequacy of funderburk report,and erred in concluding that it did not.
iii.changing experts to cure any deficiency 
rather than remanding to the court of appeals to consider the merits of the osteopath report,lewis asks us to dismiss this case instead.he argues that the extension in section c allowing a claimant to cure the deficiency permits only amendments by the original expert rather than substitutions by a new one.but in section i,the statute provides that a claimant may satisfy any requirement of this section by serving reports of separate experts.because the statute allows a claimant to cure a deficiency,and that requirement like all others may be satisfied by serving a report from a separate expert,we agree with funderburk that the statute does not prohibit him from changing experts midstream.
accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case to that court to consider the remaining arguments raised by the interlocutory appeal.
as part of house bill medical package,the legislature amended sections and of the texas civil practice and remedies code to allow for interlocutory appeals of certain orders regarding expert reports in health care liability claims.see.civ.prac.section a allows immediate appeal from an order that denies dismissal under section b when an expert report has not been served within days of filing suit.id.see id.a.section a allows appeal from an order that grants a challenge to an expert report adequacy under section l.see id.a emphasis added.as the court of appeals interpreted these provisions,section b applies only when an expert report is wholly absent within the statutory period and has no effect when an amended report is filed after an extension to cure a deficient report has been granted.
i agree with the court that whether an expert report is absent within the statutory period,or a deficient report is filed and an opportunity for cure has not yielded an adequate report,the statutory basis for a defendant motion to dismiss is the same the plaintiff has failed to serve an expert report as section b requires and,if the trial court denies the motion,the defendant is entitled to interlocutory review.see.civ.prac.a.in my view,however,this conclusion rests on the fact that subsection b and subsection c of section together define unserved reports to include both absent and deficient reports,not on the court premise that only subsection b provides for the relief dismissal and fees that lewis sought.if an amended report is filed and the trial court denies a meritorious challenge to the report adequacy,the statutory requirements for an expert report have not been met and by subsection b terms,the effect is as though no report has been served at all.id.b,c,l.
but while an absent report and a deficient one are treated the same way under section b for purposes of interlocutory appeal,the legislature has precluded review of the latter when an extension to cure has been granted.see id.a an appeal may not be taken from an order granting an extension.as i read the statutory scheme,when a report,however deficient,has been served,the trial court actions in denying the dismissal motion and granting an extension are inseparable,and section a bars review of the trial court order.see ogletree matthews,wl,thus,even when a report is deemed not served because it is deficient,the trial court retains jurisdiction to grant a extension,and the legislature explicitly stated that such orders are not appealable.in this case,the trial court assessed the wroton report and stated i think it is deficient.i think that that intended as your expert report,it deficient under the rules.i going to grant a extension because the trial court denial of lewis first motion to dismiss based on the wroton report was accompanied by an extension to cure,i disagree with
