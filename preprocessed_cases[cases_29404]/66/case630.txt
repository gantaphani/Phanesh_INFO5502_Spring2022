in this case,we must interpret a statute of repose applicable to medical malpractice cases.section b,florida statutes,extends the normal statute of repose for such actions to seven years when fraud,concealment,or intentional misrepresentation of fact prevents discovery of the injury.the fifth district court of appeal has certified the following question of great public importance 
does the term concealment as used in section b,florida statutes,encompass negligent diagnosis by a medical provider 
nehme smithkline beecham clinical,so d,dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.we answer the question in the negative and approve the decision of the fifth district court of appeal.
on may,rhonda nehme had a gynecological examination and pap smear at the volusia county public health department.the slide of the pap smear was delivered to smithkline beecham clinical laboratories.smithkline then sent the slide to shutze techman,the predecessor corporation of premiere medical laboratories,for interpretation.in a june report,a cytotechnologist at shutze techman interpreted the slide as normal and within normal limits.because the slide was interpreted as normal,no other cytologist or pathologist reviewed it,nor was the slide chosen for a random oversight review.later expert testimony revealed that the interpretation was egregious and that the cytopathological evidence of malignancy was as big as a house.nehme was diagnosed with cervical cancer in february,of which she died in december.
in september,over five years after the pap smear report,petitioner naji nehme filed a medical malpractice and wrongful death complaint alleging that the cytotechnologist had misinterpreted the pap smear and that a proper interpretation would have revealed the existence of the malignancy.the petitioner sought damages on behalf of the estate,himself,and the nehmes six minor children.the respondents smithkline,premier,and shutze moved for summary judgment,arguing that the case was barred by the statute of repose as set forth in section b,florida statutes,which requires that any medical malpractice action be commenced no later than four years from the date of the incident or occurrence.the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the respondents.
on appeal,the petitioner argued that the statute of repose should be extended to the full seven years allowed by section b in cases of fraud,concealment,or intentional misrepresentation of fact.the fifth district disagreed and affirmed in accordance with myklejord morris,so d dca plurality opinion,review denied,so d.nehme,so d at.the fifth district noted,however,that myklejord is not binding precedent because only one of the judges on the panel concurred in its reasoning.nehme,so d at.the fifth district also recognized that both the plurality and the dissent in myklejord relied on nardone reynolds,so d.therefore,because the language in nardone can be read to support a conclusion either way,as evidenced by myklejord,the fifth district certified the question of great public importance.nehme,so d at.
at issue is whether the term concealment as used in section b,florida statutes,encompasses negligent diagnosis by a medical provider.as an initial matter,however,the parties disagree as to whether the or version of section b applies in this case.the petitioner relies on the version of the statute,while the respondents argue the version should apply.the fifth district relied on the version.see nehme,so d at citing b.stat.the version of the statute provides 
an action for medical malpractice shall be commenced within years from the time the incident giving rise to the action occurred or within years from the time the incident is discovered,or should have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence however,in no event shall the action be commenced later than years from the date of the incident or occurrence out of which the cause of action accrued.an action for medical malpractice is defined as a claim in tort or in contract for damages because of the death,injury,or monetary loss to any person arising out of any medical,dental,or surgical diagnosis,treatment,or care by any provider of health care.the limitation of actions within this subsection shall be limited to the health care provider and persons in privity with the provider of health care.in those actions covered by this paragraph in which it can be shown that fraud,concealment,or intentional misrepresentation of fact prevented the discovery of the injury within the period,the period of limitations is extended forward years from the time that the injury is discovered or should have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence,but in no event to exceed years from the date the incident giving rise to the injury occurred.
b.stat.emphasis added.the version does not contain the phrase.see b.stat.supp.the law that enacted the amendment in provided this act shall take effect july,and shall not apply to causes of action arising from acts,events,or occurrences that take place before that date.ch,laws of.the act,event,or occurrence which the cause of action arose out of in this case was the alleged negligent diagnosis of nehme pap smear slide in.therefore,the version of section b applies.
as quoted above,section b,florida statutes,extends the normal statute of repose in a medical malpractice action to seven years in cases of fraud,concealment,or intentional misrepresentation of fact.the statute does not define concealment,and the parties disagree about its meaning.the petitioner contends that the term concealment does not require knowledge,while the respondents argue that it does.
because the statute does not define the term concealment,the court must resort to canons of statutory construction in order to derive the proper meaning.seagrave state,so d.one of the most fundamental tenets of statutory construction requires that we give statutory language its plain and ordinary meaning,unless words are defined in the statute or by the clear intent of the legislature.green state,so d.when necessary,the plain and ordinary meaning of words can be ascertained by reference to a dictionary.seagrave,so d at see also state,so d,stating that a court may refer to a dictionary to ascertain the plain and ordinary meaning which the legislature intended to ascribe to the term.
to extend the repose period,the statute requires that concealment prevent the discovery of the injury.conceal is defined as to prevent disclosure or recognition of and to place out of sight.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.more specifically,concealment is defined as the act of refraining from disclosure esp.an act by which one prevents or hinders the discovery of something and the act of removing from sight or notice hiding.black law dictionary ed.under these definitions,concealment connotes knowledge.
other tools of statutory construction also lead us to conclude that concealment implies knowledge.under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis a word is known by the company it keeps,one examines the other words used within a string of concepts to derive the legislature overall intent.see cepcot of bus.prof l,so d,dca carraway armour,so d.here,the string of concepts in the statute is fraud,concealment,or intentional misrepresentation of fact.fraud is generally defined as a knowing misrepresentation of the truth or concealment of a material fact to induce another to act to his or her detriment and a misrepresentation made recklessly without belief in its truth to induce another person to act.black law dictionary ed.intentional misrepresentation of fact is the intentional done with the aim of carrying out the act act of making a false or misleading statement about something.id.at.applying the doctrine of noscitur a sociis,because both fraud and intentional misrepresentation of fact involve a level of knowledge or intent,we conclude that the legislative intent was to extend the repose period when intentional acts prevent discovery of the injury.a negligent diagnosis,without more,does not constitute concealment.here,no evidence suggested that the respondents knew the slide reading was erroneous.
