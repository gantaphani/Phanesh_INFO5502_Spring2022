josef maatuk appeals from the judgment entered in favor of respondent bruce guttman,on maatuk complaint.we affirm.
respondent represented maatuk,a mechanical engineer,in litigation which resulted in the invalidation of two patents which maatuk had obtained for a liquid level sensor.this legal malpractice case followed.in this case,the jury was instructed that respondent was negligent in his representation of maatuk.on special verdicts,the jury found negligence and that respondent had breached his fiduciary duty the jury also found that the breach of duty was a substantial factor in causing harm or monetary damage to maatuk,and made the same finding about respondent negligence on damages,the jury was asked what are josef maatuk monetary damages past and future lost earnings the jury answered.
the question on appeal concerns damages,more specifically,the trial court order striking the testimony of maatuk damages expert,barbara luna.our summary of the facts is directed toward that issue 
maatuk expected to profit from his invention through a licensing agreement through which he would earn a royalty on each sale.
he presented evidence that his sensor worked,or could be made to work,could be built from readily available components at the commercially attractive price of,was attractive to industry because it had no moving parts and was,and that it had many commercial applications.he presented evidence that,for instance,in a car,his sensor could measure fuel level,density,and vapor leakage engine oil density and level coolant level and quality windshield wiper fluid level and transmission fluid viscosity and level.thus,five of his sensors could be used in a car.car manufacturers would pay for each.a pleasure boat could use the sensors for fuel level,water level,and septic tank height,at per sensor 
this evidence was in large part through his own testimony.for instance,the only evidence that the sensor could be manufactured for was his testimony,as was the only evidence on the number of sensors which could be placed in a car or boat,and the price which could be charged,though maatuk enablement expert,alberto schroth,testified that the sensor could be built from readily available components and had commercial application for use in transmissions,batteries,compressors,commercial washing machines,and that the sensor was attractive because it had no moving parts.
much of maatuk evidence concerned commercial interest in his technology.the patents,which he obtained in and,were invalidated in.he presented evidence that in,he entered into an agreement with kysor medallion,under which kysor medallion would test the technology and fund development of the probe,a critical part of the sensor.in,he entered into an agreement with,the other party to the patent litigation.would test the sensor and if the tests were successful,license and manufacture the device.when the patent litigation was filed,in,he was discussing funding for productization,validation,and testing of the technology with the robert bosch corporation.there was also interest from tedesco vickers,navistar,visteon,and walbro.maatuk evidence was that and tests showed that the device worked within the specifications set out for the development phase,and that any problems were easily fixable.
on damages,maatuk testified that the patents were worth million,based on the fact that bosch was interested in funding commercialization of the device,and that bosch had a percent market share and would pay a three percent royalty.the jury was instructed that he was testifying as a lay witness,not as an expert.maatuk also testified that after the first two patents were invalidated,the value of his remaining technology was reduced.everyone could go back to his earlier technology,modify it,and get a patent.
luna,maatuk expert witness on damages,was a cpa and business appraiser with experience in valuing patents.she calculated lost royalties between,the year after the patents were invalidated,and,reasoning that each patent had a year life dating from the patent application.based on assumptions on the royalty rate,number of units that is,cars or boats,manufactured each year,the number of sensors which would be placed in each unit,the price which would be charged for each sensor,and the market penetration maatuk sensor would achieve,she concluded that maatuk lost royalties had a present value of between million and million.
luna assumption on the number of units manufactured was based on published statistical information.the royalty rate,three percent,was based on a published database and on the documents in this case.the assumptions about number of sensors which could be placed in each unit,cost to manufacture,and the price which could be charged,she learned from maatuk,a consultant,fred beegle,who worked with maatuk in the bosch discussions,and in some instances from other depositions in this case.the assumption about market penetration was based on conversations with maatuk and beegle,and was that maatuk sensor would have five percent of each market in,building to percent in certain markets and to percent in other markets.
respondent evidence was that maatuk did not suffer any damages from the loss of his patents,because he never had a product to sell.he had an idea,but no product.
respondent experts testified that the kysor medallion and test results showed that the sensor did not work,and respondent emphasized the fact no one had actually licensed the technology.instead,each manufacturer who expressed interest quickly lost interest.for instance,kysor medallion,which had agreed to pay to productize the probe to a specified degree of accuracy and to pay additional sums for future phases of development,made an initial payment of,and a second payment of,and refused to pay any more.the matter went to arbitration,which did not result in an order that kysor medallion make an additional payment,too,refused to license the technology,but instead took out its own patent,disclosing one of maatuk patents as prior art.
maatuk had entered into evidence the report of a bosch engineer,emphasizing the portion which said that the sensor has the potential to sense the level of other fluids such as engine oil,transmission fluid,windshield washer fluid the defense emphasized the conclusion that though the basic function was demonstrated,it is unclear whether a commercially viable product would meet the requirements of an automotive fuel delivery system,etc 
another defense expert,gary cochran,a physicist with experience in the automotive industry in design,and in manufacturing costs,testified that the kysor medallion test results showed problems which were consistent with the problems he saw in the device as described in the patents.
respondent also called,for instance,alexander strozer,an engineer at magneti marelli,which manufactures parts for the boat,automotive,and motorcycle industries.in or,strozer looked at data maatuk supplied and tested prototypes of maatuk probe.he found accuracy problems,and no visible progress since the kysor medallion tests.strozer believed that maatuk had had enough time to work on the problems,and that given that he had solved them,he would not be able to solve them in a year,which was what magneti needed.the technology was too far from a product,and was more of a concept.strozer also testified that maatuk did not have the kind of professional approach to testing which would allow magneti marelli to partner with him in developing the sensor.a former employee of vickers tedesco testified that vickers tedesco had at one point found maatuk technology interesting,but did not move forward because maatuk had no working product.
on of fred beegle,respondent elicited the testimony that maatuk had claimed that the sensor had one percent accuracy,but that there was no evidence to support the claim,and that as far as beegle knew,no one had ever made maatuk technology work.
cochran also testified,as an expert,on the cost to mass produce the device described in maatuk patents,which he put at a device.the technology then in use cost between and a device.boat manufactures paid no more than for a liquid level sensor.
