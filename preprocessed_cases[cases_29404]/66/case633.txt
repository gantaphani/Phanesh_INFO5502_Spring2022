we have for review gracey eaker,so d dca,in which the district court affirmed the dismissal of an action initiated by the petitioners,donna and joseph gracey graceys,a couple allegedly injured by the counseling activities of a psychotherapist,against donald eaker eaker.the graceys sought the recovery of emotional distress damages that were allegedly inflicted by eaker actions in revealing the most confidential of information disclosed to him by each individual during and only as part of a confidential and fiduciary relationship.in affirming the dismissal of the graceys action,the district court held that their complaint sounded in negligence and failed to adhere to the requirement of the impact rule that some physical impact to a claimant be alleged and demonstrated before the claimant can recover emotional distress damages.id.at.
in addition to affirming the dismissal of the petitioners action,the district court certified a question of great public importance 
whether an exception to florida impact rule should be recognized in a case where infliction of emotional injuries resulted from the breach of a statutory duty of confidentiality.
id.at.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.we are concerned that the certified question as phrased by the district court may be more expansive than necessary to resolve this case under the facts before us.therefore,we rephrase the certified question limited to the facts involved here as follows 
whether florida impact rule is applicable in a case in which it is alleged that the infliction of emotional injuries has resulted from a psychotherapist breach of a duty of confidentiality to his patient,when the psychotherapist has created a statutory confidential relationship.
for the reasons stated below,we answer the rephrased certified question in the negative and hold that the impact rule is inapplicable to the facts of the case before us.
in a fourth amended complaint,the graceys averred that eaker is a licensed psychotherapist who,for profit,provided treatment to them in individual counseling sessions,ostensibly seeking to intervene in the most personal of matters directed to marital difficulties.they also alleged that eaker,during individual therapy sessions,
would inquire about,and each of the petitioners would disclose to him,very sensitive and personal information that neither had disclosed to the other spouse at any time during their relationship.petitioners would disclose this information because they were led to believe,by eaker,that such information was necessary for treatment purposes.
the petitioners further alleged that a direct violation of florida law occurred in that despite being under a statutorily imposed duty to keep the disclosed information confidential eaker nevertheless unlawfully divulged to each of the petitioners individual,confidential information which the other spouse had told him in their private sessions.subsequent to these disclosures,the graceys set forth that they realized that eaker had devised a plan of action designed to get them to divorce each other.the graceys claimed that such actions by eaker constituted breaches of his fiduciary duty of confidentiality that was owed individually to them.
with regard to the damages resulting from eaker actions,the graceys alleged that 
they have sustained severe mental anguish upon learning of the actions of the other spouse,of which they individually were not aware,and that eaker disclosure of these actions has caused irreparable damage to any trust that they would have had for each other moreover,they alleged that eaker actions have caused great mental anguish for the m individually in their personal relationships with others due to their inability to trust the others in those personal relationships.
additionally,the graceys asserted that they have incurred substantial costs and expenses in undergoing further treatment in an attempt to correct the mental damage inflicted upon them by eaker actions.
in upholding the trial court dismissal of the petitioners action,the district court expressed that it was constrained to agree with eaker assertion that a dismissal was proper,because florida law does not recognize a cause of action for negligent infliction of emotional distress without an accompanying physical injury.gracey,so d at.
we conclude that while the determinations by both the trial court and the district court relied upon general principles of florida tort law and general application of the impact rule,such does not accommodate the intent and purpose of section of the florida statutes and renders its protection meaningless.accepting all allegations as true,which we are required to do because this case is before us on the dismissal of the action at the pleading stage we determine that the plaintiffs have presented a cognizable claim for recovery of emotional damages under the theory that there has been a breach of fiduciary duty arising from the very special confidential relationship recognized and created under section of the florida statutes.
decades ago,we commented on the nature of the fiduciary relationship 
if a relation of trust and confidence exists between the parties that is to say,where confidence is reposed by one party and a trust accepted by the other,or where confidence has been acquired and abused,that is sufficient as a predicate for relief.the origin of the confidence is immaterial.
quinn phipps,so.we have also accepted the concept that t he purpose of a duty in tort is to protect society interest in being free from harm.casa clara condominium ass n,charley toppino sons,so d.here,the graceys allege that eaker advertised himself as a licensed psychologist with special competence as a marital therapist.the relationship between eaker and the graceys was not merely of a casual nature,which states typically do not regulate.for profit,eaker intentionally interjected himself between the graceys in the role of confidant and counselor,and under a veneer of trust and confidence encouraged each to reveal without hesitation the most private of thoughts,emotions,fears,and hopes.without justification or authorization,eaker is alleged to have repaid this repositing of confidence in him by placing the dagger of damage in the very soul of the graceys marriage,thereby exacerbating the problem for which the graceys sought his assistance.
the florida legislature has recognized and found that one emotional stability and survival must be protected to the same extent as physical safety and personal security.our representatives have declared for the people of florida that emotional survival is equal in importance to physical survival.stat.to preserve the health,safety,and welfare of florida citizens,our legislature found itself compelled to take action to protect the confidentiality of the communications involved in the most private and personal relationships interwoven with mental health practitioners.in undeniable terms the public policy of this state guards emotional survival,which the legislature has declared affects physical and psychophysical survival.it is with this background and structure that the legislature intended to protect the delicate and fragile disclosures within the professional relationship when it established section of the florida statutes,which states in pertinent part any communication between any person licensed or certified under this chapter and her or his patient or client shall be confidential.if this legislative provision is to have any life or meaning and afford reliable protection to florida citizens,our people must have access to the courts without an artificial impact rule limitation,to afford redress if and when the fiduciary duty flowing from the confidential relationship and statutory protection is defiled by the disclosure of the most personal of information.
in addition to our stated public policy and statutory structure of protection for certain confidential relationships,we have recently recognized the fiduciary duty generally arising in counseling relationships in doe evans,so d.there,one having marital difficulties alleged that a priest intervened in the situation and during counseling activities breached a duty of trust and confidence by becoming sexually involved with her.see id.at.recognizing the principles suggested in the restatement second of torts,we noted that a fiduciary relationship does exist between persons when one is under a duty to act for or give advice for the benefit of another upon matters within the scope of the relationship.see id.at.further,one in such a fiduciary relationship is subject to legal responsibility for harm flowing from a breach of fiduciary duty imposed by the relationship.see id.
with this backdrop of both common law and statutory protection the source of eaker duty to the petitioners is easily identified.the statutory scheme clearly mandated that the communications between the petitioners and eaker shall be confidential.stat.this created a clear statutory duty that,if violated,generated a viable cause of action in tort.see,lewis city of miami,so,alford meyer,so d dca.
the elements of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty are the existence of a fiduciary duty,and the breach of that duty such that it is the proximate cause of the plaintiff damages florida courts have previously recognized a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty in different contexts when a fiduciary has allegedly disclosed confidential information to a third party.see barnett bank of marion county,shirey,so d dca plaintiff entitled to damages for breach of fiduciary duty because bank employee disclosed sensitive financial information to a third party moreover,courts in other jurisdictions,along with legal commentators,have concluded that a fiduciary relationship exists between a mental health therapist and his patient.see,hoopes hammargren,psychiatrists and all physicians have fiduciary relationship with patients eckhardt charter hosp.of albuquerque,mental health counselors have fiduciary relationship with their patients macdonald clinger,noting that fiduciary responsibilities were implicit in and essential to the relationship between patient and his psychiatrist watts cumberland county hosp.system,fiduciary relationship exists between psychiatrist and patient,rev in part on other grounds,see also benjamin schutz,legal liability in psychotherapy charles eger,psychotherapists liability for extrajudicial breaches of confidentiality,restatement second of torts,cmt.a fiduciary relation exists between two persons when one of them is under a duty to act for or to give advice for the benefit of another upon matters within the scope of that relation.citation omitted 
clearly evident in the decisions of courts that have determined that a fiduciary relationship exists in the and contexts is the notion that a fiduciary has a duty not to disclose the confidences reposed in him by his patients.see hoopes hammargren,at psychiatrists and all physicians have duty to keep confidences of patients eckhardt charter hosp.of albuquerque,at mental health therapists owed duty of confidentiality to patient macdonald clinger,at the relationship of the parties was one of trust and confidence out of which sprang a duty not to disclose confidential information.watts cumberland county hosp.system,at psychiatrist had duty not to disclose confidential information these cases are also persuasive authority and support our conclusion that a psychotherapist who has created a fiduciary relationship with his client owes that client a duty of confidentiality,and that a breach of such duty is actionable in tort 
we have previously stated that d uty is not sacrosanct in itself,but only an expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the particular plaintiff is entitled to protection or not.rupp bryant,so d,quoting william prosser,handbook of the law of torts at ed.here,the statute unambiguously indicates the intent of the legislature to protect from unauthorized disclosure the confidences reposed by a patient in his or her psychotherapist.a breach of this duty not to disclose is therefore actionable under the common law cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.see generally berger sonneland,allowing action in tort for breach of physicians duty of confidentiality delineated in state statute,rev on other grounds,eckhardt charter hosp.of albuquerque,at allowing action in tort for breach of psychological counselor duty of confidentiality,the sources of such duty being both fiduciary relationship and state statutes 
we emphasize that while we determine that a duty of confidentiality exists,it is not absolute.for instance,section of the florida statutes delineates three instances in which communications between patient and psychotherapist are not cloaked with confidentiality none of which applies in the instant case.see also macdonald clinger,at disclosure of confidential information by a psychiatrist to a spouse is justified whenever there is a danger to the patient,the spouse or another person otherwise information should not be disclosed without authorization.it is unnecessary for us at this time to define the exact contours of the exceptions to the duty of confidentiality.the graceys satisfied the breach and causation elements of their claim by alleging that eaker disclosed the confidences of one spouse to the other,and that these disclosures were the proximate cause of their emotional distress.the remaining element of their cause of action,for which the district court certified the question of great public importance,concerns the damage element.specifically,the issue is whether the impact rule is applicable when a psychotherapist is alleged to have inflicted emotional distress on the patient as a result of breaching his fiduciary duty of confidentiality 
the impact rule requires that a plaintiff seeking to recover emotional distress damages in a negligence action prove that the emotional distress flow s from physical injuries the plaintiff sustained in an impact upon his person.humana of florida,so d.florida version of the impact rule has more aptly been described as having a hybrid nature,requiring either impact upon one person or,in certain situations,at a minimum the manifestation of emotional distress in the form of a discernible physical injury or illness.see kush lloyd,so d.we have stated that the underlying basis for the impact rule is that allowing recovery for injuries resulting from purely emotional distress would open the floodgates for fictitious or speculative claims,so d at.
we have,however,in a limited number of instances either recognized an exception to the impact rule or found it to be inapplicable in kush lloyd,we noted that the impact rule generally is inapplicable to recognized torts in which damages often are predominately emotional.kush,so d at.also in kush,we held that the emotional distress damages of parents who had endured the wrongful birth of their deformed child,after having been assured by medical personnel that they were not at risk of conceiving a deformed child,were not subject to proof under the impact rule.see id.at.we recognized that if the impact rule was inapplicable to emotional distress damages for torts such as defamation or invasion of privacy,in which the emotional distress of the victim was likely less severe,it should also be inapplicable to the more severe emotional distress of parents who had been assured that they were not at risk of bringing a deformed child into the world.see id.at 
the emotional distress that the graceys allege they have suffered is at least equal to that typically suffered by the victim of a defamation or an invasion of privacy.indeed,we can envision few occurrences more likely to result in emotional distress than having one psychotherapist reveal without authorization or justification the most confidential details of one life.our reasoning in kush thus provides ample support for the notion that the impact rule should be inapplicable to the instant case 
furthermore,in macdonald clinger,the new york appellate court considered a case very factually similar to the one before us.in macdonald,it was alleged that during two extended courses of treatment with the defendant psychiatrist,
the plaintiff revealed intimate details about himself which the defendant later divulged to plaintiff wife without justification and without consent.as a consequence of such disclosure,plaintiff alleges that his marriage deteriorated,that he lost his job,that he suffered financial difficulty and that he was caused such severe emotional distress that he required further psychiatric treatment.
at.similar to the instant case,the defendant in macdonald filed a motion to dismiss,which was granted.
the court in macdonald characterized the relationship between the plaintiff and his psychiatrist as one of trust and confidence out of which sprang a duty not to disclose.defendant breach of that duty was a violation of a fiduciary responsibility to plaintiff implicit in and essential to their relation ship.id.at.most important for our purposes is that the court in macdonald did not subject the plaintiff to any special pleading requirements,such as proof under the strictures of the impact rule,regarding his emotional distress damages.instead,the court concluded that such a wrongful disclosure is a breach of the fiduciary duty of confidentiality and gives rise to a cause of action sounding in tort.id.at.we see this line of reasoning in macdonald as highly persuasive and hereby adopt it.
taking into consideration our decision in kush,the decision in macdonald clinger,the case law on the nature of the fiduciary relationship in the and contexts and the attendant duty of confidentiality imposed on the practitioner,along with the intent of the legislature in passing section of the florida statutes,there is ample authority to determine that the impact rule should be inapplicable in the case before us.therefore,we hold that the impact rule is inapplicable in cases in which a psychotherapist has created a fiduciary relationship and has breached a statutory duty of confidentiality to his or her patient.we therefore answer the rephrased certified question in the negative.we make no comment or determination regarding the merits of the instant case.
the concerns voiced that our decision today will open the floodgates of litigation are without merit.we note that the civil trial system in our country has withstood the test of time for more than years.it is a system in which the finder of fact ultimately determines which allegations of injury are meritorious and which are not.we are confident this system will continue to function well when it considers claims of the type now before us.our legislature has established the public policy of this state,has stated that emotional status is of equal importance as physical status,and has specifically declared the type of information allegedly disclosed as confidential and privileged.the only reasonable and logical injuries generally flowing from a violation of the statutory protection are emotional in nature.imposition of the impact rule in this context would render the legislative intent and its statutory implementation meaningless and without substance.the artificial impediment of an impact rule should not be imposed to override clear legislative intent.
on the other hand,our holding should not be construed as bringing into question the continued viability of the impact rule in other situations.six years ago,this court stated its belief in the overall efficacy of the impact rule 
we reaffirm our conclusion that the impact rule continues to serve its purpose of assuring the validity of claims for emotional or psychic damages,and find that the impact rule should remain part of the law of this state.
humana of florida,so d at.today we simply hold that the impact rule is inapplicable under the particular facts of the case before us.
accordingly,we quash the decision of the district court to the extent that it affirmed the dismissal of the petitioners claim for emotional distress damages on the basis of the applicability of the impact rule.we remand the cause to the district court with directions that the petitioners be allowed to pursue their claims without having to conform proof of their emotional distress damages to the strictures of the impact rule.
it is so ordered.
i agree with the majority decision.however,i write to express my view that florida should join the growing number of states that have abolished the arbitrary restriction on tort claims imposed by the judicially created impact rule 
the impact rule,as applied in florida,holds that,in the absence of a discernible physical injury or illness flowing from emotional distress or an actual impact,a person can not recover compensatory damages for mental distress or psychiatric injury.see generally hagan bottling,so d.the rationale for the impact rule as a limitation on certain claims is that it serves as a means of assuring the validity of claims for emotional or psychic damages.humana of florida,so d.however,this court wariness of psychic damages has not prevented it from carving out exceptions to the impact rule in a variety of the present case demonstrates.see,kush lloyd,so d,champion gray,so d,receded from on other grounds in zell meek,so d.
in my view,the impact rule reflects an outmoded skepticism for damages resulting from mental injuries.as best summarized by the illinois supreme court 
the requirement of physical manifestation of emotional distress is overinclusive because it permits recovery for mental anguish when the suffering accompanies or results in any physical impairment,regardless of how trivial the injury.more importantly,the requirement is underinclusive because it arbitrarily denies court access to persons with valid claims they could prove if permitted to do so.
additionally,the requirement is defective because it encourages extravagant pleading and distorted testimony.to continue requiring proof of physical injury when mental suffering may be equally recognizable standing alone would force victim s to exaggerate symptoms of sick headaches,nausea,insomnia,to make out a technical basis of bodily injury upon which to predicate a parasitic recovery for the more grievous disturbance,the mental and emotional distress she endured.
corgan muehling,quoting elizabeth hosp.garrard,citations omitted.
i believe that the traditional foreseeability analysis applicable to negligence claims is the more appropriate framework for a limitation on tort recovery in this state.see mccain florida power,so d,the duty element of negligence focuses on whether the defendant conduct foreseeably created a broader zone of risk that poses a general threat of harm to others.the respondent psychotherapist in this case owed a duty of confidentiality to the petitioners.the petitioners allege that they were direct victims of the respondent breach of that duty because the respondent revealed the most confidential communications gained during the relationship.there should be no arbitrary limitation on the petitioners ability to claim damages as a result of the substantial breach of a fiduciary duty such as the one that allegedly occurred in this case.it seems reasonable to entrust florida juries,which are routinely asked to determine pain and suffering when an emotional injury is accompanied by a physical injury,to determine fault and damages surrounding claims of purely mental injuries.see corgan,at noting its faith in jurors or other judicial factfinders to discern whether a claimant has suffered emotional distress that should be compensated.thus,i certainly concur with the majority that the impact rule should not bar the petitioners recovery in this case.
while i am sympathetic to the wrong petitioners allege,i see no reason to depart from the public policy and jurisprudence of this state requiring a plaintiff seeking emotional distress damages to show that the alleged emotional distress is evident in some form of physical injury,impact.with this decision,the majority,in effect,puts the whole camel under the tent,as it is more than likely that this court will be presented with equally compelling scenarios of alleged emotional trauma which will be difficult to distinguish from this case,and thus the public policy requiring the rule will no longer be policy at all.indeed,there will be no requirement of impact,and this case is sure to become precedent allowing almost all parties who claim damages for emotional distress to survive dismissal of their actions despite speculative,or even fictitious,claims of emotional injury which the rule was designed to prevent.
moreover,i find that no rational basis has been presented here to abandon this policy.rather,by judicial fiat,the majority carves out a major exception based solely on the emotional injury alleged here,which effectively eviscerates the rule requiring any impact in the claim for emotional distress damages.at the outset of its analysis,the majority asserts that the lower courts determinations do not accommodate the intent and purpose of section of the florida statutes.majority op.at emphasis added.yet nothing in the express language of section or its legislative history comes close to expressing an intent or purpose to do away with florida impact rule.contrary to the majority assertion of the existence of clear legislative intent,majority op.at,the legislative history of section is as to any other intended purpose of the statute beyond the regulatory context even if i were to read in a civil cause of action for its violation as does the majority,i see nothing in the wording of the statute or its legislative history eliminating the requirement for an impact when alleging emotional distress under this statute.
furthermore,based on our decision in time insurance burger,so d,it also appears that the legislature knows how to write a statute which allows for emotional distress damages to be claimed under it,without being subject to the impact rule,if it chooses to do so.specifically,in time insurance,this court considered whether the fact that section,florida statutes,authorized damages for suits against certain insurance carriers for failure to pay claims,did so in such a manner that proof of emotional distress damages would not be required under the strictures of the impact rule.in holding that emotional distress damages claimed pursuant to the statute were not subject to proof under the impact rule,this court based its reasoning on the language of the statute itself,which stated that damages shall include those which are reasonably foreseeable result of a specified violation of this section.so d at.in this case,however,the legislature has made no such authorization under the statute at issue and,therefore,strictly as a matter of statutory interpretation and this court jurisprudence,damages for emotional distress incurred as a result of a violation of section should not be recoverable in the absence of proof which satisfies the impact rule.
in addition,despite the majority characterization of the requirement to allege some sort of physical manifestation of injury when making a claim for emotional distress damages as an artificial impact rule limitation,majority op.at,this court has for over a century repeatedly stated that the impact rule supplies a useful function of weeding out fraudulent claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress.
the impact rule has had a long legal history in this state,beginning with this court decision in international ocean telegraph saunders,so.in essence,the impact rule requires that before a plaintiff can recover damages for emotional distress caused by the negligence of another,the emotional distress suffered must flow from physical injuries the plaintiff sustained in an impact.reynolds state farm mut.auto.ins,so d,dca,review denied,so d.as explained by one commentator,the underlying basis for the rule is that allowing recovery for injuries resulting from purely emotional distress would open the floodgates for fictitious or speculative claims.thomas cooley,cooley on torts ed.as this court stated in saunders,compensatory damages for emotional distress are spiritually intangible,are beyond the limits of judicial action,and should be dealt with through legislative action rather than judicial decisions.at,so.at.another commentator has stated that the requirement of a physical impact gives courts a guarantee that an injury to a plaintiff is genuine.page keeton et,prosser and keeton on the law of torts,at ed.further,without an impact requirement,defendants would not be sure whom they had injured or where they may have injured a person,thus paralyzing their ability to defend themselves.id.at.
in recent years,we have continued to uphold the impact rule,finding that the underlying basis for the rule still exists and that no new reason has been shown to justify overruling prior decisions of this court regarding this issue.for instance,in gilliam stewart,so d,we found that an individual whose physical injuries were allegedly due to physical fright suffered when an automobile struck her house could not recover for those injuries because she had failed to show the requisite physical impact.similarly,in brown cadillac motor car division,so d,we found that the driver of a defective automobile that struck and killed the driver mother had no cause of action for his mental distress because he sustained no physical injury.
humana of florida,so d,emphasis added.
furthermore,the exceptions to the impact rule are few.the first truly recognized exception to the impact rule was recognized in champion gray,so d.in champion,this court recognized the claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress not unlike the claim alleged here in situations in which damages flow from a significant discernible physical injury when such injury is caused by psychic trauma resulting from negligent injury imposed on another who,because of his relationship to the injured party and his involvement in the event causing that injury,is foreseeably injured.id.at.it is important to note,however,that champion provided only a partial exception to the impact rule,because while the claimant was not required to show impact or impingement upon her physical person,she was nevertheless still required to show a significant discernible physical injury as evidence of the alleged psychic trauma.id.
other exceptions to the impact rule come in the form of judicial decrees that the impact rule should not apply to the seeking of emotional distress damages in connection with certain torts because,unlike the circumstances of the instant case,the very commission of those torts is proof enough that significant emotional distress for the victims will ensue.see kush lloyd,so d,holding impact rule does not apply when emotional distress damages are sought in connection with the tort of wrongful birth,because those damages are inseparably connected to,and obviously inure to the victims of,that tort see also tanner hartog,so d,holding impact rule inapplicable to tort of negligent stillbirth because the emotional distress damages flow obviously from the cause of action.
moreover,in both kush and tanner,this court took great pains to say that it was finding the impact rule inapplicable only in very strictly confined circumstances.see tanner,so d at noting the desirability of the impact rule for proving the genuineness of emotional distress claims and holding the impact rule inapplicable only to narrow classes of cases like negligent stillbirth and wrongful birth kush,so d at noting the inapplicability of impact rule to wrongful birth situations likely reaches the outer limits of recovery in the absence of showing of impact and consequent mental distress manifested by physical injury.
while it is also true that emotional distress damages connected with some predominately emotional torts,like defamation and invasion of privacy,are not subject to proof under the impact rule,this court in humana of florida,so d,also held that emotional distress damages pursuant to a claim for negligent false diagnosis of status are subject to the impact rule.in,a patient who was misdiagnosed as being brought suit against the hospital,laboratory,and physician responsible for misdiagnosis.this court held that although the patient claimed to have suffered bodily injury including hypertension,pain and suffering,mental anguish,and loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life,he did not prove a physical manifestation of resultant emotional distress to satisfy the requirements of
