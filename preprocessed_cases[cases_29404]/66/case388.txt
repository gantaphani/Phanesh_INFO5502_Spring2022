plaintiffs and appellants yahaira ayala ayala,a minor,by and through her guardian ad litem and mother,rita rios rios,and rios individually collectively,plaintiffs,appeal a judgment in favor of defendant and respondent arroyo vista family health center arroyo following a defense verdict in a medical malpractice action.
plaintiffs theory of malpractice is that arroyo was negligent in failing to test ayala to determine whether she was suffering from hyperglycemia and as a consequence,ayala fell into a diabetic coma and suffered permanent brain injury.
the essential issue presented on appeal is whether the trial court committed prejudicial instructional error by instructing the jury pursuant to caci this case requires us to address the circumstances under which it is appropriate to give said instruction.
we conclude that in order for caci to be given,there must have been expert testimony presented to the jury to the effect that a medical practitioner chose a medically accepted method of diagnosis or treatment from among alternative medically accepted methods of diagnosis or treatment.
in this case,the defense presented expert testimony that ayala health care providers acted within the standard of care,even though they failed to diagnose ayala hyperglycemia.however,the defense did not present any evidence that the method used to diagnose ayala condition,namely,a medical history and physical examination,was one of a number of approved or recognized methods of diagnosing a patient with ayala history and symptoms.therefore,caci,the alternative method of diagnosis or treatment instruction,should not have been given.
we also conclude that on this record,the giving of caci,although erroneous,was nonprejudicial.therefore,the judgment is affirmed.
factual and procedural 
ayala,born in august,was a patient of arroyo since she was three weeks old.
on april,ayala,who was then about four and a half years old,was seen at arroyo for a physical with ramos.her chart noted chronic obesity and a family history of diabetes.ramos recommended dietary changes and increased exercise.
on december,ayala returned to arroyo,where she was seen by goldberg with a cough and symptoms.she then weighed pounds.
some two weeks later,on january,ayala again went to arroyo with complaints of headaches,which were waking her up at night.a nurse weighed ayala and noted she weighed pounds,a two pound loss from her previous visit.this was the first time ayala had a loss of weight from one visit to the next.owyang performed a full neurological examination to rule out any serious problems.he diagnosed ayala with headaches,prescribed motrin and advised ayala mother,rios,to take ayala to the clinic or the emergency room immediately if ayala experienced any focal weakness,in which one side of the body does not work properly with the other side,or if there were any loss of consciousness,seizures or worsening symptoms.
less than one month later,on february,ayala returned to arroyo with fever,vomiting,diarrhea,congestion and cough 
at the february,visit,ayala blood pressure went from elevated at the january visit to low,and she now weighed pounds a loss of pounds.
based on her presenting symptoms,luetkehans concluded ayala had a viral illness.he ascribed both her upper respiratory symptoms and her stomach symptoms to that virus.he prescribed motrin and a prescription syrup for ayala.ayala and rios left the clinic at rios had the prescriptions filled at the adjacent pharmacy and went home with ayala.
that evening,ayala condition worsened.at in the morning,rios called the paramedics.they arrived five minutes later.david raya,one of the paramedics,found ayala in her parents bed,unresponsive.he tried to assess her level of consciousness and found her to have a glasgow coma scale of,which is as low as one can go.raya used a glucometer to check ayala blood sugar and found her blood sugar was above,which means the patient is having a diabetic coma or a diabetic ketoacidosis.ayala was transported to huntington memorial for treatment.
ayala initial presentation at the hospital was type diabetes.she subsequently became insulin dependent,was found to have antibodies to the pancreas and is now considered type diabetic.
the diabetic coma caused significant and permanent brain injury.although ayala has a life expectancy of an additional years,it is unlikely she will ever reach higher than the moderately retarded range,which means she could attain the age of a three or four year old in some of her functioning,but her judgment and aggression when she is thwarted is actually worse than that,so she would not even be functioning as a normal three or four year old.
proceedings.
on may,plaintiffs filed suit against arroyo and luetkehans for medical negligence based on the failure to diagnose and treat ayala for hyperglycemia.
on may,the matter came on for a jury trial.there was conflicting testimony as to the nature of ayala symptoms see fn,ante,and whether the standard of care required luetkehans to test ayala for hyperglycemia.
plaintiffs expert testimony.
suparna jain,a pediatric endocrinologist,testified weight loss is a classic clinical presentation of hyperglycemia.other symptoms of hyperglycemia can include increased urination,increased thirst,dehydration,increased appetite,headaches,lethargy and fatigue,difficulty in concentration,infections and blurry vision.
jain opined the diabetic coma could have been prevented had ayala been duly diagnosed and treated.at the time ayala was in the clinic at,she was certainly hyperglycemic.she was exhibiting increased urination and increased thirst and she was diabetic.according to jain,luetkehans diagnosis of a viral illness was incomplete and was unreasonable under the circumstances.there was no notation of dehydration as a diagnosis and there was no testing for hyperglycemia.the standard of care required in this situation with a child with a family history of diabetes,with chronic morbid obesity,who is losing weight now rapidly over a short period of time,was that h yperglycemia should have been looked at.
defense expert testimony.
chavis,a board certified pediatrician,testified as to her opinions regarding the care rendered to ayala.
according to chavis,when ayala was examined on april,based solely on the fact she was obese and that her maternal grandmother had type diabetes,the standard of care did not require screening labs to determine whether she was prediabetic.guidelines do not call for diabetes screening for children under the age of.further,she was unaware of any guideline for a child that recommends screening for diabetes on a quarterly basis.just because a patient is obese does not mean the patient will have diabetes.only to percent of obese children might develop diabetes after the age of.
chavis further opined that on january,owyang also acted within the standard of care.when presented with a history of headaches,one of which woke her up at night,and photophobia,a reasonable and prudent physician would perform a physical examination to determine whether there was an acute process such as an intracranial bleed or aneurysm or a chronic process such as a migraine headache.owyang performed a physical exam,ruled out any acute process,diagnosed ayala as having headaches,prescribed motrin and directed a return to the clinic if there were focal weakness 
further,the two pound weight loss from december to january should not have been a cause of concern for owyang.a weight loss of two pounds in a child weighing pounds,and who also came in with a history of headaches,did not require owyang to inquire into the potential for hyperglycemia.
finally,with respect to the february,visit,chavis opined luetkehans met the standard of care.ayala presented with cough,congestion,diarrhea,fever and vital signs that were all consistent in february flu season with upper respiratory tract infection,gastroenteritis,and viral illness.luetkehans was not required by the standard of care to inquire further into ayala weight loss,which was attributable to the vomiting and diarrhea.further,luetkehans did not need to worry about dehydration because ayala was not listless,lethargic or una
