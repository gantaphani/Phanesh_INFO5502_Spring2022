patricia thompson patricia and george thompson collectively the thompsons contracted for medical insurance with health net and chose scripps clinic scripps as their medical group.after the thompsons filed a complaint alleging medical malpractice against two physicians affiliated with scripps,scripps informed the thompsons that it was exercising its right under its contract with health net to have health net transfer the thompsons to another medical group.health net transferred the thompsons to university of california at san diego health network ucsd.the thompsons then filed this lawsuit,contending that scripps policy of terminating medical care for patients who file lawsuits against its physicians is illegal.
scripps contends summary adjudication should have been granted as to the intentional interference with contract cause of action because there was no interference with the thompsons contract with health net and because patricia treating physicians were not third parties to that contract the negligent infliction of emotional distress and breach of fiduciary causes of action because scripps breached no duty the unruh civil rights act,cause of action because litigants are not a protected class the cartwright act bus,cause of action because there was no unlawful trust between scripps and healthnet the unfair competition bus,and breach of public policy causes of action because a patient right to sue does not supercede a physician right to withdraw from a patient care and punitive damages under code of civil procedure section.we grant the petition as to the unruh civil rights act,the cartwright act,the unfair competition and the breach of public policy causes of action and as to punitive damages.we deny the petition as to the other causes of action.
factual and procedural history 
scripps is a group medical practice governed by a group of physicians who represent scripps physicians.the governing physicians established a policy to terminate further medical care for all patients and their families upon the receipt of an intent to sue letter.however,scripps will not terminate care for a patient unless it determines that another medical care system can duplicate the services scripps has been providing and the transfer would not jeopardize the patient care,given the patient current medical state.
scripps initiated this policy because a lawsuit irreparably compromises the relationship,thereby potentially compromising the care rendered to the patient.might not be as forthcoming for fear that information would be used in their lawsuit.further,patient litigants sense of what is important to communicate to other scripps physicians could be colored by the lawsuit,making it difficult for the physician to determine what is true and unbiased.patients may also believe that other scripps physicians will not give them balanced care.for example,a patient may believe that a physician who does not timely return a telephone call is punishing the patient.continuing the relationship might also put a physician in the awkward position of testifying against a colleague.
on march,patricia was in a serious accident.at the time,scripps provided medical care to the thompsons through their health insurance provider,health net.alleging negligent treatment of patricia broken clavicle,the thompsons filed a medical malpractice claim against roger thorne and michelle carpenter,both of whom were affiliated with scripps.at the time the malpractice action was filed,patricia was no longer being treated by thorne and carpenter,but was being treated by other scripps physicians michael botte and jan froenke for the broken clavicle,and kelly harkey for endometriosis.
on june,myrna binford,a scripps employee,sent the following letter to the thompsons scripps clinic medical group has been notified of the legal action you have taken against the group.because of this legal action,scripps clinic is requesting that health net immediately terminate you with scripps clinic and transfer your membership to another medical group.please contact health net member services at for assistance in selecting a new medical group in your area.your transition to a new group should occur by.in the interim,the urgent care center at the torrey pines campus is open from to daily and the urgent care center at rancho bernardo is open from to for your needs.your primary care physician can provide medically indicated prescription refills during this time.your prompt attention and cooperation in this is greatly appreciated.
when patricia received bindford letter,she immediately requested health net reassign the couple to a new medical group.health net transferred the thompsons to ucsd,effective july.as the result of scripps actions,patricia had to cancel a visit with harkey that had been scheduled near the end of june even though patricia was still suffering severe pain and bleeding.before patricia could be referred to a new gynecologist at ucsd,she had to schedule a visit with her new primary care physician and receive authorization.patricia care was also delayed until ucsd received her medical records from scripps.
the thompsons sued scripps and binford for damages arising from the termination of care.the third amended complaint,which is the operative complaint,includes causes of action for tortious interference with contractual relations,negligent infliction of emotional distress,violation of the unruh act breach of fiduciary duty unfair competition breach of public policy and violation of the cartwright act.in addition to other forms of relief,the thompsons sought punitive damages.
on march,scripps moved for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication.on the same day,the thompsons moved for summary adjudication of the unruh civil rights act,cartwright act,unfair competition and breach of public policy causes of action.on june,the court issued its tentative ruling in which it granted scripps motion for summary judgment as to binford but did not grant summary adjudication of any causes of action as to scripps.the court also denied the thompsons motion for summary adjudication.after oral argument,the court adopted the tentative ruling as its final order.

interference with contractual relations 
we reject scripps contention the court should have granted summary adjudication of the intentional interference with contractual relations causes of action.in the third amended complaint,the thompsons alleged scripps disrupted their contractual relationship with health net and their contractual relationship with their treating physicians.the court declined to grant summary adjudication because scripps moving papers did not address the issue of interference with the thompsons relationship with their treating physicians.although scripps contended in its reply that it could not interfere in the thompsons relationship with their treating physicians because those physicians were employees of scripps,the court found the evidence scripps cited did not show that the treating physicians were scripps employees.
we first note that the thompsons allege two separate causes of action for intentional interference with contractual relations because they allege that scripps interfered with two separate and distinct contracts one with health net and the other with their treating physicians.when plaintiffs allege that the defendant single wrongful act invaded two different primary rights,he has stated two causes of action,and this is so even though the two invasions are pleaded in a single count of the complaint.skrbina fleming th,d relying upon lilienthal fowler superior court th,d.in its moving papers,scripps ignored the thompsons cause of action for intentional interference with the contractual relationship with their treating physicians.the court ignored the thompsons cause of action for intentional interference with the health net contract.we review each of these causes of action separately.
the elements of the cause of action of intentional interference with contractual relations are a valid contract between plaintiff and a third party defendant knowledge of this contract defendant intentional acts designed to induce a breach or disruption of the contractual relationship actual breach or disruption of the contractual relationship and resulting damage.citation.quelimane stewart title guaranty cal th,d.wrongfulness independent of the inducement to breach the contract is not an element of the tort ibid.further,the tort does not require that the actor primary purpose be disruption of the contract.id.at,d.
scripps contends that it could not interfere in the contractual relations between the thompsons and their treating physicians,who are employees of scripps,because a party to a contract can not tortiously interfere with that contract.applied equipment litton saudi arabia cal th,d.scripps failed,however,to address this cause of action in its moving papers.it did not,therefore,list the employee status of the treating physicians on its separate statement of undisputed material facts.this is the golden rule of summary adjudication if it is not set forth in the separate statement,it does not exist.both the court and the opposing party are entitled to have all the facts upon which the moving party bases its motion plainly set forth in the separate statement.citations united community church garcin d.see also north coast business park nielsen construction th,d.
scripps tried to remedy its failure in its reply brief by relying upon the separate statement of undisputed material facts supporting the thompsons motion for summary adjudication,which stated that patricia was being treated by three scripps clinic doctors and that t here are over doctors at scripps clinic medical group.these facts do not establish that the relationship of the treating physicians to scripps is one of.the trial court correctly found that scripps failed to meet its burden of production of evidence.
scripps also contends its termination of medical care for the thompsons did not disrupt the thompsons relationship with health net because the thomspons agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of health net contract with scripps and the thompsons,contractual relationship with health net was not disrupted.scripps states,p laintiffs cite no authority for the proposition that as members of health net,they did not agree to be bound by the terms and conditions health net has set for its providing medical groups.however,as the movant,the the burden of production.scripps introduced no evidence that the terms and conditions of its contract with health net were incorporated in the thompsons contract with health net.
we reject scripps argument that the summary plan description of health net plan spd includes a provision implying that a medical provider can terminate a patient who files a lawsuit.under the spd,a patient can be terminated for refusing to follow treatment,for disruptive behavior,for failure to pay,and for misrepresentation or fraud.scripps contends health net,which has discretionary authority to interpret the benefits of this plan,has interpreted the term disruptive behavior to include filing a lawsuit.the health net ppg operations manual,which governs the contractual relationship between scripps and health net,states that a patient may be terminated for one instance of the following behavior fraud,disruptive or abusive behavior,dangerous behavior,and receipt of a notice of intent to sue.in this list,a notice of intent to sue is not listed as a form of disruptive behavior,but rather as another type of behavior warranting termination.therefore,scripps evidence does not support its contention that health net interpreted the term disruptive behavior in the spd to include filing a lawsuit.because scripps failed to meet its burden to produce evidence that the terms and conditions of its contract with health net were incorporated into the thompsons contract with health net,scripps did not make a prima facie case,and the burden of production did not shift to the thompsons.
scripps also relies on the following undisputed fact at no time were plaintiffs insurance benefits provided to them by health net interrupted.although the thompsons did not dispute this fact,they raised a triable issue of fact as to whether the benefits for which they contracted with health net were disrupted.scripps sent the letter terminating the thompsons on june.although patricia immediately requested a transfer to a new medical group,that transfer was not effective until july.during the hiatus between june and july,patricia could not see her treating physicians for care,including a scheduled visit with harkey.
ii.negligent infliction of emotional distress and breach of fiduciary duty 
we reject scripps contention the court should have granted summary adjudication of the negligent infliction of emotional distress and breach of fiduciary duty causes of action.the court denied the motion because the thompsons raised a triable issue of fact as to breach,based upon the declaration of david goldstein,the thompsons expert.goldstein declared scripps breached the standard of care and its fiduciary duty by violating the ama code of medical ethics and the hippocratic oath,because its policy is retaliatory and promotes the of physicians over that of patients.
it has long been the law in california that a physician can lawfully abandon a patient only after due notice,and an ample opportunity afforded to secure the presence of other medical attendance.payton weaver d.quoting lathrope flood,revd.on other grounds cal,hongsathavij queen of angels.medical center th,d in the absence of the patient consent,the physician must notify the patient he is withdrawing and allow ample opportunity to secure the presence of another physician.baji.
scripps contends that because it gave adequate notice to the thompsons and because health net transferred them to ucsd medical group,the thompsons did not raise a triable issue of fact as to breach.we disagree.as we discussed above,there was a hiatus between the time scripps denied the thompsons access to its physicians for nonemergency services and the time the thompsons were assigned to ucsd.the thompsons raised a triable issue of fact as to whether they were given ample time to retain other physicians.
we also reject scripps contention it breached no duty because its contract with health net allows it to terminate a patient who files a lawsuit.as discussed above,scripps failed to produce evidence that the terms and conditions of its contract with health net were incorporated into the contract between the thompsons and health net.
iii.unruh civil rights act 
we agree the court erred by denying scripps motion for summary adjudication of the cause of action for violation of the unruh civil rights act.the court denied both parties motions for summary adjudication because neither party addressed the theory of physical disability and medical condition discrimination.
the court analysis is based upon an incorrect reading of the complaint.paragraph of the complaint alleges that scripps actions were unreasonable and constitute arbitrary discrimination against thompson physical disability and medical condition italics added.paragraph of the complaint alleges that the actions that constitute the discrimination were taken in retaliation for the underlying medical malpractice lawsuit those actions consist of scripps termination of the thompsons as patients.
although the complaint could be more clearly drafted,it states that the actions that constitute the discrimination are scripps termination of medical care for patients who file a medical malpractice suit against a scripps physician.further,the thompsons explained in oral argument that both parties agreed the cause of action under the unruh civil rights act is based on these people,the thompsons,as a member of a group of patient litigants,asked the court to base its ruling on that theory,and offered to amend the complaint if it was unclear.the court erred by not modifying its tentative ruling to address the retaliatory discrimination pled in the complaint.
because the parties agree this cause of action is based upon discrimination against patient litigants,we discuss the merits of the parties motions for summary adjudication of this issue we adopt the clear,succinct explanation of current unruh civil rights act law stated in hessians motorcycle club flanagans th,d hessians in addition to the particular forms of discrimination specifically outlawed by the unruh civil rights act sex,race,color,courts have held the act prohibit s discrimination based on several classifications which are not specifically enumerated in the statute.citation.these judicially recognized classifications include unconventional dress or physical appearance citation,families with children citation,homosexuality citation,and persons under age citation.
in harris capital growth investors xiv cal d,the supreme court reexamined these earlier decisions which treated the list of statutory classifications as illustrative rather than restrictive citation and cautioned against extending the act reach any further.w ere we writing on a clean slate,the repeated emphasis in the language of sections and on the specified classifications of race,sex,religion,would represent a highly persuasive,if not dispositive,factor in our construction of the act.citation.citation.the court concluded the legislature intended to confine the scope of the act to the types of discrimination specifically identified in the statute.citation.
despite this conclusion,the harris court did not overrule the prior cases which extended the act to certain nonenumerated classifications.citation.the court did,however,adopt a new,narrower construction of the act and made it clear future expansion of prohibited categories should be carefully weighed to ensure a result consistent with legislative intent.citations.citation.to that end,the court engaged in a inquiry in considering and rejecting application of the act to economic new classification at issue in that case.citation.in the wake of harris,courts have consistently followed this analysis when determining whether discrimination which implicates a new classification is prohibited by the act.citations.hessians,supra,th at,d.
in order to determine whether scripps termination of patient litigants violates the unruh civil rights act,we follow the harris analysis,which consists of analyzing the language of the statute,the legitimate business interests of the defendants,and the consequences of allowing the new discrimination claim.hessians,supra,th at,d.we are guided by gayer polk gulch,d.gayer a case decided after holds that retaliatory discrimination against litigants does not violate the unruh civil rights act.
we first consider the language of the statute,which states in part b all persons within the jurisdiction of this state are free and equal,and no matter what their sex,race,color,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,or medical condition are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,advantages,facilities,privileges,or services in all business establishments of every kind whatsoever.c this section shall not be construed to confer any right or privilege on a person that is conditioned or limited by law or that is applicable alike to persons of every sex,color,race,religion,ancestry,national origin,disability,or medical condition.in harris,the court interpreted subdivision c to mean that a landlord can limit access to public accommodations as long as the policy is applicable alike to all persons regardless of race,color,sex,religion,harris,supra,cal d at.scripps policy also applies to all patients who sue scripps physicians for malpractice,irrespective of the race,color,sex,and religion of the patient.
the harris court also applied the statutory interpretation canon of ejusdem generis to reconcile the plain language of the statute,including its listed discriminatory classifications,with the holdings of our prior cases and the legislature actions and reactions to our decisions.harris,supra,cal d at.it determined that the common element was personal as opposed to economic person geographical origin,physical attributes,and personal beliefs.ibid.scripps policy does not rely upon a patient personal characteristics,but upon that patient conduct.gayer,supra,d at.filing a lawsuit is clearly conduct.we find,therefore,that scripps policy does not constitute the kind of discrimination that the unruh civil rights act was meant to preclude.
we next consider whether scripps has a legitimate business interest in excluding patient litigants.under harris,the critical issue is whether the challenged policy bears a reasonable relation to commercial objectives appropriate to an enterprise serving the public harris,supra,cal d at.the thompsons contend scripps policy is not rationally related to scripps services because scripps terminates medical care of a patient litigant irrespective of whether the patient malpractice claim is legitimate how long the patient has been with the group and whether the patient has been compliant during that period and whether the patient care has been transferred to scripps physicians who have not been sued.none of these contentions address scripps stated reasons for the ensure the relationship is not compromised.patient litigants might color the information they disclose to a scripps physician because they fear the information could be used in the lawsuit.additionally,although against scripps policy,a scripps physician might treat differently,and even if not,the patients might believe they were not getting proper care.scripps concerns about communication and the relationship are reasonably related to the medical services it provides.
lastly,we consider the consequences of allowing a discrimination claim by patient litigants.we agree the analysis of the court in gayer a ppellant urges that such conduct creates a class of persons who have filed lawsuits.but such logic could be applied to any kind of conduct.were we to hold that the conduct involved here gave rise to a protected class under the act,we would open the door for a seemingly endless stream of new cases never contemplated by the legislature.gayer,supra,d at.we find that retaliatory discrimination against patient litigants does not violate the unruh civil rights act.
we are not persuaded by the thompson reliance on vaughn hugo neu proler international d.vaughn,which held the unruh civil rights act was violated when a scrap metal dealer refused to deal with the plaintiff years after the plaintiff had successfully sued the dealer for sex discrimination under the unruh civil rights act.vaughn was decided before harris and relied upon earlier california supreme court cases that applied the more expansive application of the unruh civil rights act the california supreme court explicitly rejected in harris.further,vaughn is easily distinguished in vaughn the previous discrimination suit between the parties had been settled several years before the alleged retaliatory exclusion took place.citation.the defendant in vaughn could hardly argue that plaintiff was excluded because tensions between the parties were running high as the result of the pending lawsuit.gayer,supra,d at.unlike vaughn,scripps is concerned that the tensions between the parties caused by a pending lawsuit will have a negative impact on the relationship.
iv.cartwright act 
we agree the court erred by failing to grant scripps motion for summary adjudication of the cartwright act cause of action.the cartwright act prohibits illegal trusts,where a trust is a combination of capital,skill or acts by two or more persons a to restrict trade or commerce,b to limit production or increase prices,c to prevent competition,d to fix prices or e to agree to restrict prices.bus.the refusal to sell a product to a consumer violates the cartwright act only when the refusal involves an agreement between two entities and the purpose of the agreement is to restrain trade.quelimane stewart title guaranty,supra,cal th at,d.
the court denied scripps motion for summary adjudication because it found the thompsons raised a triable issue of fact that there was an agreement between scripps and health net to terminate medical care for patients who file lawsuits.we agree the thompsons raised a triable issue of fact as to an agreement.the cartwright act,like the federal sherman act,does not proscribe independent action.chavez whirlpool th,d chavez.to that effect,the manufacturer can announce its resale prices in advance and refuse to deal with those who fail to comply.and a distributor is free to acquiesce in the manufacturer demand in order to avoid termination.monsanto service,d an unlawful combination arises,however,if the manufacturer goes beyond those measures by seeking communication of a dealer acquiescence or agreement to secure the dealer compliance,such as by means of coercion,and the dealer so communicates.chavez,at,d describing monsanto.
the thompsons do not dispute that health net independently created its policy of allowing medical groups to transfer patient litigants.further,health net does not require medical groups to terminate patient litigants in recognition of the fact that ppgs will have varying standards of acceptable patient behavior,the guidelines on the following page show the types of behavior which health net will consider as grounds for termination.on the other hand,scripps can not transfer a patient litigant who is insured by health net without health net consent.therefore,the thompsons have raised a triable issue of fact as to whether scripps action of requesting health net terminate the medical care of a patient litigant satisfies the requirement of a combination.
we find as a matter of law,however,the thompsons evidence does not show that the purpose of scripps policy is to restrain trade,prevent competition,or affect prices scripps introduced evidence that the purpose of its policy is to ensure that patient care is not compromised due to a degradation of the relationship.this evidence is sufficient to make a prima facie case that restraint of trade is not the purpose of the agreement between scripps and health net.the burden then shifts to the thompsons to present evidence to raise a triable issue of fact.the thompsons dispute scripps purpose because are terminated from care whether or not the treating physicians believe there has been a degradation of the relationship or their ability to care for the patient.even if the thompsons have raised a triable issue of fact as to the reason for scripps policy,the evidence fails to show how trade is restrained by scripps policy.the thompsons expert,robert fellmeth,also failed to address how scripps policy restrains trade.fellmeth declared that scripps and health net engaged in a concerted refusal to deal,which constitutes an unlawful trust under the cartwright act because t he market is properly,with results determined by consumer demand,not dictated from above by collusive agreement.
we reject the thompsons contention that an illegal trust can result from a narrowing of consumer choice irrespective of a restraint on trade or a restriction of prices.they base this contention upon a misinterpretation of marin county bd.of realtors,palsson cal d,marin.in marin,the supreme court held that when the marin county board of realtors board limited access to the multiple listing service mls to members of the board,the board engaged in a group boycott marin concerns an horizontal boycott,which involves the joint efforts of competitors at the same level of distribution as the plaintiff to disadvantage that competitor by denying him the tools necessary to complete.freeman san diego of realtors th,d.the court found that the board practice pose d serious anticompetitive dangers both to licensed real estate salesman and to consumers.marin,at.it limit s entry into a competitive field by making it difficult for nonmembers to compete effectively with members,which limits consumer choice and affects the price of commissions.id.at.
unlike the policy of the board in marin,scripps policy does not create an horizontal boycott because it does not disadvantage other physicians or medical groups by denying them the tools necessary to compete.the marin court statement that a ntitrust laws are designed primarily to aid the consumer marin,supra,at,does not imply that any action that limits of consumer choice violates the cartwright act.in a case where a grocer left a large store vacant,the court explained an allegation that defendants actions reduce market choices otherwise available to consumers does not imply a diminution of competition and thereby violate the cartwright act.the same can be said of every occasion that an enterprise ceases to offer its goods or services by going out of business.gregory albertson,th,d gregory.similarly,scripps merely withdrew its services from certain patients.we note that consumers,like the thompsons themselves,agree to limit their choice of physicians by choosing a health maintenance organization as their medical insurance provider.
unfair competition and violation of public policy 
scripps contends it has not engaged in unfair competition or violated public policy because physicians have the right to withdraw from a patient care and because patients have no right to treatment by a particular physician.the thompsons contend scripps policy violates the law because it impedes a patient right to seek redress for malpractice in the courts and violates a physician duty to his patients.because the same policies lie behind the unfair competition and public policy causes of action,we will discuss both through the lens of unfair competition law.
unfair competition includes any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice.bus.by proscribing any unlawful business practice,section borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.citation.however,the law does more than just borrow.the statutory language referring to any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent practice italics added makes clear that a practice may be deemed unfair even if not specifically proscribed by some other law.because business and professions code section is written in the disjunctive,it establishes three varieties of unfair or practices which are unlawful,or unfair,or fraudulent.in other words,a practice is prohibited as unfair or deceptive even if not unlawful and vice versa.citation.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.
although the unfair competition law is broadly written to permit courts to restrain dishonest or unfair business dealings,the scope of the law is not unlimited.courts may not simply impose their own notions of the day as to what is fair or unfair.specific legislation may limit the judiciary power to declare conduct unfair.if the legislature has permitted certain conduct or considered a situation and concluded no action should lie,courts may not override that determination.when specific legislation provides a safe harbor,plaintiffs may not use the general unfair competition law to assault that harbor,supra,cal th
