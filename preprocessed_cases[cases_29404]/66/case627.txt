in this case,we decide whether a potential plaintiff may assign a legal malpractice claim involving the preparation of private placement memoranda.in two prior cases,we allowed the assignment of other types of claims,contrasting them to claims for legal malpractice,which we stated were not assignable.see forgione dennis pirtle agency,so d permitting the assignment of claims against an insurance agent kpmg peat marwick union fire ins,so d permitting the assignment of claims against an accountant conducting an independent audit.in the decision below,the third district court of appeal permitted the assignment of a legal malpractice claim,analogizing an attorney preparing private placement memoranda to the accountant conducting an independent audit we described in kpmg.see kaplan cowan liebowitz latman,so d,dca.that holding expressly and directly conflicts with our statements in kpmg and forgione albeit in dictum implying a blanket prohibition against assignment of legal malpractice claims.therefore,we accepted jurisdiction.cowan liebowitz latman,kaplan,so d table see art.v,b.const see also watson realty quinn,so d,accepting jurisdiction based on conflict between the district court opinion and dictum in a prior supreme court case and receding from the dictum.for the reasons explained below,we approve the district court decision.we agree that because lawyers preparing private placement memoranda,like independent auditors,owe a duty to those who rely on statements contained in their published documents,parties may assign claims for legal malpractice committed in preparing them.we therefore recede from the broad dicta in kpmg and forgione purporting to prohibit the assignment of all legal malpractice claims.nevertheless,we stress that the vast majority of legal malpractice claims remain unassignable because in most cases the lawyer duty is to the client.
medical research industries,mri,a florida corporation,developed and marketed homeopathic medical products.to raise money for capital improvements,mri decided to issue a private placement of shares in the company.mri majority shareholder,william tishman,consulted attorneys who prepared private placement memoranda.through four private placements between and,mri raised over million from about shareholders.later,tishman borrowed about million in unsecured loans from mri,leading to its eventual insolvency.mri sued tishman to recover the loan amount and obtained a judgment.unable to satisfy the judgment,however,mri executed an assignment for the benefit of creditors to donald kaplan kaplan then sued for legal malpractice the attorneys who prepared the private placement memoranda.the trial court granted the attorneys motions to dismiss,concluding that legal malpractice claims are personal and not assignable and are exempt from levy and sale under an execution of assignment.
on appeal,the third district reversed.it held that kaplan had standing to bring the legal malpractice claims against the attorneys b ecause the legal services at issue were not personal in nature but involved the publication of corporate information to third parties,the investors and therefore the policies underlying the prohibition of bare assignment of legal malpractice claims are inapplicable.kaplan,so d at.the district court relied on kpmg holding that the relationship of a corporate client to an independent auditor does not implicate the same confidentiality concerns as the typical relationship.see kpmg,so d at.the court concluded that such concerns were not present in this case either,because the attorneys shared their information with third,shareholders and the investing public.the court also held that because kaplan,as an assignee for the benefit of creditors,was charged with gathering and liquidating mri assets,kaplan is no different from a trustee in bankruptcy who has full standing to bring a debtor legal malpractice claim.so d at.
ii.analysis 
we agree with the district court that the public policy concerns with permitting the assignment of legal malpractice claims are substantially attenuated,if they exist at all,when attorneys prepare private or public placement memoranda.in such circumstances,attorneys act much as accountants do in performing independent audits.that is,they act not just for the corporation benefit,but for the benefit of all those who rely on the representations in their this case,potential shareholders.because we approve the district court holding on this ground,we need not consider the court alternative theory of assignability that an assignee for the benefit of creditors is analogous to a bankruptcy trustee,to whom legal malpractice claims may be transferred.see so d at in re alvarez,cir holding that a legal malpractice claim arising from bankruptcy counsel alleged negligence was property of the estate under a.
below we discuss a our previous cases addressing the assignability of legal malpractice claims b the role and duties of attorneys preparing private placement memoranda and c why assignments of claims against attorneys involved in private placement memoranda do not implicate the public policy concerns generally associated with the assignment of legal malpractice claims.
forgione and kpmg 
as noted above,we previously have discussed the assignability of legal malpractice claims in two cases that did not involve such claims.in forgione,we considered whether an insured could assign a claim for negligence against an insurance agent for failure to obtain proper coverage.so d at.we said yes,reasoning that parties can assign causes of action derived from a contract or statute.id.at.we compared the relationship between a prospective insured and an insurance agent with the relationship.we noted that in contrast to the former relationship,the relationship is confidential and personal and thus can not be assigned florida law views legal malpractice as a personal tort which can not be assigned because of the personal nature of legal services which involve highly confidential relationships.so d at quoting washington fireman fund ins,so d,dca.
several years later,we permitted the assignment of a claim against an independent auditor for professional malpractice in preparing an audit.see kpmg,so d at.as in forgione,we noted that legal malpractice claims are not assignable because of the personal nature of legal services which involve a confidential,fiduciary relationship of the very highest character,with an undivided duty of loyalty owed to the client.kpmg,so d at.we found that unlike an attorney,who must zealously represent a client in an adversarial setting,an independent auditor who is hired to give an opinion on a client financial statements must do so with an independent impartiality which contemplates reliance upon the audit by interests other than the entity upon which the audit is performed.id.we distinguished the public policy reasons discussed in forgione that prohibit assignment of legal malpractice claims because r ather than acting as an advocate with an undivided duty of loyalty owed a client,an independent auditor performs a different function.so d at.
private placement memoranda 
we agree with the district court that the role of the attorneys in this case was similar to that of the independent auditors in kpmg.the claim is based on the attorneys preparation of private placement memoranda and communications surrounding their production the memoranda disclosed information to mri shareholders and many potential investors.like the independent auditors in kpmg,the attorneys intended that third parties would rely on the representations made in the memoranda.the legal services at issue,therefore,were not personal but involved publication of corporate information.
