kathleen barrow,individually and as the personal representative of the estate of robert barrow et,appeals a superior court jury verdict in which the jury found,carl abramowicz,negligent in his care of barrow,but not liable for barrow death because his negligence was not a proximate cause of harm to barrow.
the barrows focus their arguments on two errors the trial judge allegedly made.they claim that the trial judge erred when he did not permit the testimony of abramowicz medical expert that was favorable to the barrows and erred again when he permitted abramowicz to opine on issues of causation without providing proper notice to the barrows.because we agree with the barrows that the trial judge erred in these two respects,we reverse and remand this case to the superior court for a new trial.
facts and procedural history 
on november,abramowicz viewed of robert barrow chest.doctors diagnosed barrows with lung cancer in april.metastatic lung cancer caused his death on january.the barrows allege that abramowicz negligently interpreted and reported barrow november,chest and that his failure to detect and report discoverable cancer at that early stage in resulted in a curable lung cancer metastasizing and becoming an end stage,incurable cancer by the time of its diagnosis in.specifically,the barrows contend that abramowicz i failed to report that abnormalities in the upper left lobe of barrow left lung could be cancer and,ii failed to recommend a follow up chest ct scan which would have led to the diagnosis of lung cancer while it was confined to the left upper lobe in.
from the outset of the case,abramowicz has denied that he misread barrow november,chest.abramowicz also contends that barrow lung cancer was at an advanced stage on november,and that,because of the cancer rapid growth,treatment would not have made a difference.abramowicz maintains,arguably inconsistently,that no discernable cancer could be detected in the left upper lobe of his lung as of november.
in accordance with deadlines established by the trial scheduling order,the barrows identified their trial experts.they identified two radiologists,konerding and magid,to testify on standard of care issues and two cancer specialists,denittis and martin,both oncologists,to testify on causation issues.abramowicz,after receiving a deadline extension,identified two oncologists,krasnow and creech,whose opinions were limited to causation issues.abramowicz did not disclose any standard of care experts.moreover,in response to rule e expert witness interrogatories,abramowicz did not list himself,or any other radiologist,as an expert who would be offering expert opinion testimony on any issue at trial.
the parties deposed pretrial all of the designated expert witnesses.for the barrows,both konerding and magid opined that abramowicz violated the applicable standard of care and that those violations caused a material delay in the diagnosis of barrow lung cancer.they also testified that the abnormalities shown in the november,chest were consistent with the presence of lung cancer and that abramowicz should have identified the abnormalities as a potential malignancy and recommended that a chest ct scan be performed to further evaluate the abnormalities in order to facilitate a definitive diagnosis.
on medical causation issues,both denittis and martin testified that the failure to recognize and report the abnormalities in november of,caused a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of barrow lung cancer,which resulted in no treatment plan for lung cancer,and allowed the cancer to advance and metastasize from its primary site in the left upper lobe.as a result,by the summer of when the cancer was eventually diagnosed,it had become incurable.these oncology experts also opined that the radiographic abnormalities on barrow november,chest and july,chest ct scans were cancerous,and that the primary site of barrow lung cancer was in the left upper lobe.
for abramowicz,krasnow opined in a written report,and again at his pretrial deposition,that barrow primary lesion was located in the left upper lobe of his left lung and that the abnormalities on the november,chest were cancerous to a reasonable medical certainty.krasnow further testified that the cancer in that location already had metastasized by november of.in his pretrial deposition,creech contested the malignant nature of barrow abnormalities and the location of the primary site of his lung cancer.he also testified that i he could not locate the primary tumor and,ii that the tumor was not in the left upper lobe because the radiographic abnormalities in the left upper lobe were benign.
the barrows moved to strike that portion of krasnow opinion that related to whether barrow lung cancer had metastasized by november,as unreliable.the trial judge agreed,while emphasizing that his ruling did not affect krasnow other proffered medical opinions,including his opinion that the location of barrow primary lung tumor was in the left upper lobe.
the trial judge entered the final pretrial order signed by all parties that identified all of the parties expert witnesses on february.the barrows designated as experts the doctors they previously had disclosed pursuant to the pretrial scheduling order.the barrows expressly reserved the right to call abramowicz experts,including krasnow,without objection from abramowicz.abramowicz similarly reserved the right to call the barrows designated expert witnesses.the barrows also expressly reserved the right to introduce the pretrial discovery deposition of witnesses who could not attend the trial.although abramowicz objected to other matters affecting the trial,he did not object to the barrows introducing the pretrial discovery depositions of witnesses that would be unavailable at trial 
the trial was scheduled to begin on february.a few days before trial,abramowicz counsel requested a continuance because of illness.the trial judge granted the continuance and rescheduled the trial to begin august,and later ruled that the parties were to remain in the same position at the rescheduled trial as they would have been had the case proceeded to trial as originally scheduled.
shortly before trial,abramowicz counsel informed the barrows that he would not be calling krasnow as a trial witness.the barrows then identified relevant portions of krasnow pretrial discovery deposition testimony that they intended to introduce at trial.the proffered testimony related to krasnow opinions that the location of barrow primary lung tumor was in the left upper lobe and the radiographic abnormalities on the november,chest were cancerous.abramowicz objected.
the barrows argued to the trial judge that the pretrial order had properly identified krasnow as an expert witness that the barrows could call in the or in rebuttal on an issue that went to the heart of the barrows claims.the barrows contended that they had properly reserved the right to introduce the deposition testimony of krasnow in the pretrial order and abramowicz had not objected.moreover,they asserted,the deposition testimony was admissible pursuant to superior court civil rule.finally,the barrows argued that our opinion in green alfred dupont institute of the nemours was persuasive,if not controlling,authority for their position.
with the trial underway,the trial judge ruled that the barrows would not be permitted to introduce krasnow pretrial deposition testimony the judge distinguished green on the basis that the green court admitted the expert deposition testimony because it was designated as a trial deposition,as opposed to a pretrial discovery deposition,as was the case here.the trial judge also alluded to a general bar against parties calling opposing standard of care experts in delaware 
the trial judge also permitted abramowicz to give a causation opinion by testifying at trial that barrow radiographic abnormalities in the left upper lobe were benign and that there was no cancer in the left upper lobe of his lung.the trial judge permitted this testimony over the barrows objections made shortly before the start of trial and again at trial during abramowicz direct examination.the barrows objected to the testimony because abramowicz had not properly disclosed his medical causation opinion before trial and because the opinions he gave at trial contradicted those he had given under oath at his pretrial deposition 
after abramowicz testified,creech testified that there was no cancer in the left upper lobe of barrow lung and that the radiographic abnormalities shown on his diagnostic studies in the left upper lobe were benign.in closing,abramowicz counsel argued that the abnormalities in barrow upper left lobe were not cancerous and,therefore,any negligence on abramowicz part could not have been the proximate cause of harm to barrow because no cancer originating from the upper left lobe would have been diagnosed in,even if further studies had been conducted in.
the jury,responding to special interrogatories,found abramowicz negligent,but concluded his negligence did not proximately cause harm to barrow.
on september,the barrows appealed,arguing that the trial judge erred when he precluded them from introducing relevant portions of krasnow pretrial deposition testimony on medical causation,and again when he permitted abramowicz to opine on medical causation at trial that he had not properly disclosed and that were inconsistent with opinions he expressed in his pretrial deposition.
discussion 
i.the trial judge decision to bar pretrial discovery deposition testimony 
the barrows allege that the trial judge erred when he ruled that they could not introduce krasnow pretrial deposition testimony on issue that went to the very heart of their case.when the excluded evidence goes to the very heart of plaintiffs case and might well have affected the outcome of the trial,the exclusion of the evidence warrants a new trial.we review a trial judge evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion if we find the trial judge abused his discretion,we must then determine whether the mistake constituted significant prejudice so as to have denied the appellant a fair trial.
here,krasnow medical opinion on the location of barrow primary tumor focused on the most important disputed causation issue in the case.in order to determine causation,the jury needed to decide whether the radiographic abnormalities in barrow left upper lobe were benign.if they were,the follow up diagnostic testing required by the standard of care,which included the surgical removal of the abnormal tissue in the left upper lobe,would not have revealed barrow cancer.any negligence on abramowicz part,therefore,could not have proximately caused barrow death.
krasnow opinion was relevant,highly probative evidence that contradicted the testimony of abramowicz expert,creech.indeed,the jury finding of negligence but no proximate cause strongly suggests that the exclusion of this evidence had a bearing on the trial outcome.as a result,we find that krasnow pretrial deposition testimony on causation issues went to the very heart of the barrows case.
abramowicz argues,and we agree,that krasnow causation testimony echoed the opinions of the barrows other medical experts,konerding,denittis,and martin,and,thus,was cumulative.but,the fact that evidence may be cumulative does not render it inadmissible.the barrows cite to green proposition that a trial judge should only sparingly limit a party presentation of evidence on the ground that it is cumulative indeed,green dictates that the exclusion of important evidence warrants a new trial,even if there was other evidence of the same general character or the rejected evidence was cumulative.
furthermore,it is clear to us that a medical opinion favorable to the barrows case from the lips of one of abramowicz experts is potentially more persuasive to a jury than the testimony of an additional plaintiff expert.underlying our ruling in green is the principle that a litigant has the right to introduce all relevant evidence,even if generated by an adverse party,which goes to the very heart of a case and could affect the outcome of the trial 
we next consider whether the barrows properly reserved their right to introduce krasnow pretrial deposition testimony at trial.the barrows posit that,on february,abramowicz counsel signed,and the trial judge approved,a pretrial order in which the barrows expressly reserved the right to call abramowicz witnesses,including krasnow under superior court civil rule,the trial judge enters a trial scheduling order which governs pretrial conferences,scheduling,and trial management.rule mandates that parties follow the trial judge scheduling order,thus assuring that the parties conduct predictable discovery parties must be mindful that scheduling orders are not merely guidelines but have full force and effect as any other order of the superior court.the barrows claim that the trial judge disregarded the agreed upon terms of the pretrial order,and,thus,abused his discretion when he prohibited them from introducing krasnow pretrial deposition testimony.
the barrows allege that green dupont controls in green,we found that the trial judge abused his discretion when he precluded the plaintiff,who properly reserved her right in the pretrial order,from introducing relevant portions of the trial deposition testimony of a defense expert who the defendants decided not to call as a trial witness.attempting to distinguish green,abramowicz argues that the witness testimony at issue in green was trial deposition testimony,as opposed to the pretrial discovery deposition testimony,and points to how this distinction affected the parties expectations regarding the depositions use at trial.arguing that the parties in green anticipated the use of the expert deposition,and here,did not,abramowicz cites to the green court reasoning that the pretrial order reflected an understanding,shared by the parties as well as the expert,that the deposition was to be shown to a jury who would give it the same weight as live testimony.
abramowicz also cites to hambleton christina care health services,a superior court case with similar facts that diverged from green precedent.distinguishing hambleton facts from those of green,the hambleton court focused on the designated purpose of the deposition at the time it was taken and whether the parties had sufficient notice of the parties intent to use the content at trial.the hambleton court concluded that the deposition was a discovery deposition and neither party intended or contemplated when taking it that it would be used at trial.indeed,the trial judge here relied on hambleton distinction between a trial deposition and a discovery deposition when he prohibited the barrows from using krasnow pretrial deposition testimony abramowicz here touts that the parties did not agree to use the discovery deposition at trial,did not notice it as a deposition for use at trial and,therefore,created no expectation it would be used at trial.
we agree with the barrows that green controls and find the distinction between a trial deposition and a discovery deposition superfluous on the facts here.while abramowicz argument makes practical sense in the abstract,given that the pretrial order is tantamount to a contract between the parties for conducting pretrial preparation,we find that rationale inapplicable here abramowicz clearly intended to use krasnow pretrial deposition testimony at trial and had notice of the barrows intention to do the same.on february,abramowicz counsel signed,and the trial judge approved,a pretrial order in which he expressly reserved the right to call krasnow and specifically identified d eposition and interrogatory answers as exhibits he intended to use at trial the barrows similarly expressed their intent to use the same material and witnesses when they reserve d the right to introduce any exhibit identified by the defendants which,by abramowicz own denotation,included krasnow pretrial deposition testimony.while he objected to other evidence proffered,abramowicz did not object to the barrows proposal to introduce the witness pretrial deposition testimony and he also reserved the right to call the barrows trial witnesses.indeed,it appears to be common practice for parties to designate each other witnesses fo
