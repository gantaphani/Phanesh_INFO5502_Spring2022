introduction 
code of civil procedure section provides that a plaintiff in an action for medical malpractice must file the action within three years of the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the injury,whichever occurs first.we hold that,when the plaintiff in a medical malpractice action alleges the defendant health care provider misdiagnosed or failed to diagnose a preexisting disease or condition,there is no injury for purposes of section until the plaintiff first experiences appreciable harm as a result of the misdiagnosis,which is when the plaintiff first becomes aware that a preexisting disease or condition has developed into a more serious one.
steve drexler filed this medical malpractice action against david petersen,a primary care physician,craig german,a neurologist,and their employer,healthcare partners medical group,alleging that petersen and german negligently misdiagnosed the cause of his headaches.when finally an emergency room doctor correctly diagnosed a brain tumor as the cause of the headaches,drexler needed emergency surgery.by that time,the tumor had grown so large that surgeons had to sever drexler cranial nerves to remove it,which caused drexler loss of vision in his left eye,deafness in his left ear,facial paralysis,loss of musculature and strength,depression,and sexual dysfunction.
the trial court granted a motion by all three defendants for summary judgment on the ground that section barred drexler action.because there are disputed issues of material fact regarding whether drexler discovered his injury within the meaning of section more than one year before he filed this action,we reverse.
factual and procedural background 
drexler seeks treatment for his headaches 
in december drexler consulted petersen about headaches he had been experiencing for a month petersen diagnosed drexler with tension headaches.
in january drexler returned to petersen,still complaining of headaches on the right side of his head and neck.petersen again diagnosed drexler with tension headaches and prescribed pain medication.
in september drexler again consulted petersen regarding pain on the back and sides of his head.petersen told drexler that tension was still causing his headaches and to keep taking the prescribed pain medication.
in november drexler returned yet again to petersen,complaining of daily headaches that began with occipital back of the head pain.he told petersen the headaches improved with massage and physical therapy.petersen ordered more pain medication and referred drexler to physical therapy.
in november members of drexler family called petersen and informed him they were taking drexler to the emergency room because drexler head and neck pain was so severe he could not lift his arms.the family members also told petersen that they wanted drexler to have a magnetic resonance imaging study mri of the muscle and that drexler knows it is a muscle.petersen explained that an mri is not useful for muscle pain.petersen later spoke with drexler and noted that the pain remain ed occipital and in the trapezius distribution to the shoulder,and that drexler statement ca move shoulders means his muscles hurt,not that he has neuro weakness.petersen continued to prescribe pain medication and physical therapy,advised drexler to continue seeing a chiropractor,and added acupuncture to drexler treatment.in response to drexler statement i need an mri,petersen wrote,answer mri is a diagnostic tool most used by surgeons contemplating surgery.he has palpable tender muscle spasms.his headache is completely relieved when these resolve.the mri will not add to his diagnosis.
a few months later,on january,drexler returned to petersen for neck pain.petersen records reflect that drexler reported,it a muscle,while pointing to his trapezius.when drexler asked why he felt pain in the back of his head if the problem was in his trapezius muscle,petersen explained the attachments again and how neck muscle tension classically causes pain in the occiput.drexler also reported that he was experiencing pain radiating down his right arm and numbness in his fourth and fifth fingers,although drexler could not remember when he started experiencing the tingling in his hands.petersen reported pain is muscular,reproducible with palpation of trapezius muscle and neck movement,does not involve the head other than occiput,so an mri of his head is not indicated.he wants an mri of his trapezius,but that is not likely to reveal anything that would alter the treatment.petersen prescribed continued use of pain medication and referred drexler to pain management.in addition,because drexler complain ed of intermittent para e sthesia tingling in extremities in right ulnar nerve distribution,and since he was convinced he need ed an mri,petersen defer red to neurology in this regard.
on february,drexler consulted german,a neurologist,for headaches and right arm tingling.drexler told german that the tingling in his fingers and pain in his right arm began four or five years earlier when he suffered some trauma to the arm while attempting to change a tire,and that a subsequent car accident caused additional injury to the arm.german diagnosed drexler with carpal tunnel syndrome as a likely explanation for shoulder pain and par a esthesia and a headache probably resulting from medication overuse.german prescribed various medications for pain and inflammation and advised him to wear wrist splints at night for six to eight weeks.
on march,german performed an electromyogram nerve conduction study,an electrical test of nerves and muscles to identify the source of the tingling.german diagnosed drexler with ulnar nerve entrapment at elbow and advised him to stop putting pressure on his elbows.german explained to drexler that the problem with his elbow was separate from his headaches,the pain medication was for the headaches,and if he did not want to take the medication he should follow up with his primary care physician.
on may,drexler called petersen about severe headaches he had been suffering off and on for three years and complained he was not getting the treatment that he should be getting.drexler again reported pain in his trapezius,occiput,and shoulder,and again stated he thought it was muscular.petersen told him to take the pain medications and referred him to a pain management specialist,imad rasool.
on october,drexler returned to petersen with the same neck pain and occipital headache.the medical records state,same exaggerated urgency to the problem,stating how much it affects his life,how it is nearly impossible to function,how he ca sleep or go out socially.petersen continued to diagnose a headache and cervicalgia neck pain.petersen gave drexler an injection of pain medicine,referred him to pain management,and explained again that more diagnostic tests were not needed.
on january,drexler consulted with petersen for the last time.petersen saw drexler as a hallway consult,and drexler reported that he finally used the referral to pain management,and his pain was greatly improved.the medical records indicate that rasool conducted an mri of drexler neck and diagnosed him with disk disease,which petersen noted was common in many necks and often seen incidentally on mri.petersen noted that drexler should continue with rasool for musculoskeletal neck pain and follow up with petersen as needed.
during the time drexler treated with petersen,and briefly treated with german,he did not seek any other medical treatment.drexler testified at his deposition,however,that he never believed that his headaches were due to tension and stress,or that a problem with the muscles in his neck or shoulders caused the headaches.drexler testified that,after the first few visits,he did not think petersen properly diagnosed his headaches,he thought german diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome was a joke,and at no time was he ever satisfied with the medical treatment he received from petersen or german.he testified that he nevertheless continued to trust petersen i trusted petersen knew what he was talking about.then when we got the second opinion by german,a neurologist,and then to see rasool,i thought i was being taken care of yet drexler was sufficiently dissatisfied with his treatment by petersen that on january,the day of the hallway consultation,drexler obtained his medical records so he could consult with an attorney about whether he could sue petersen for malpractice.the attorney told drexler he did think drexler had a case.drexler did not see another primary care physician until the fall of.
drexler symptoms become more severe,and he ultimately learns he has a brain tumor 
in october drexler went to olive view medical center complaining of headaches and diplopia double vision.doctors there scheduled an mri of drexler brain,but drexler did not stay for the procedure because he felt the line was too long.drexler subsequently saw an optometrist,who prescribed glasses,but the glasses did not improve his double vision.
in late january drexler went back to olive view medical center complaining of a new onset of unsteady gait,progressive voice hoarseness,and dysphagia difficulty swallowing over the last three months.doctors conducted an mri of drexler brain and discovered a very large meningioma brain tumor.the tumor was impinging on drexler brain stem and causing focal neurologic defects of cranial nerves,which likely account ed for drexler diplopia,dysphagia,dysphonia difficulty in speaking,and ataxia gait abnormality.doctors recommended drexler have emergency surgery.on january,doctors removed the tumor,which caused drexler serious injuries.
c.the court summary judgment ruling 
on july,drexler filed this action,alleging that petersen and german negligently failed to diagnose,and delayed the diagnosis of,his brain tumor.the trial court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on the grounds that both the and the limitations periods in section barred drexler claim.the court ruled that the statute of limitations barred drexler medical malpractice claim against petersen because drexler had a suspicion of wrongdoing by january,when he ordered his medical records and consulted an attorney.the court ruled the limitations period also barred his claim against german because the court found that drexler had a suspicion of wrongdoing as early as march,when german diagnosed him with carpal tunnel syndrome.the court also ruled that the statute of limitations period barred drexler claim against german because drexler suffered an injury in march,when german failed to diagnose drexler brain tumor.finally,the court ruled that healthcare partners was entitled to summary judgment because no claims remained against petersen or german.drexler timely appealed.
discussion 
standard of review and general law 
we review the trial court grant of summary judgment de novo and decide independently whether the parties have met their respective burdens and whether facts not subject to triable dispute warrant judgment for the moving party as a matter of law.jessen mentor th,see schachter citigroup,cal th.we liberally construe the evidence in support of the party opposing summary judgment and resolve doubts concerning the evidence in favor of that party.hampton county of san diego cal th.
a defendant has the initial burden to show that undisputed facts support summary judgment based on the application of an affirmative defense.trovato beckman coulter,th,see melendrez ameron internat.th.the statute of limitations operates in an action as an affirmative defense.norgart upjohn cal th.t he question of when there has been a belated discovery of the cause of action,especially in malpractice cases,is essentially a question of fact,and i t is only where reasonable minds can draw but one conclusion from the evidence that the question becomes a matter of law.brown bleiberg cal d,accord,whitfield roth cal d,see bispo burton d,reversing summary judgment because of a factual issue regarding when the patient suffered injury within the meaning of the medical malpractice statute of limitations jolly eli lilly cal d,w hile resolution of the statute of limitations issue is normally a question of fact,where the uncontradicted facts established through discovery are susceptible of only one legitimate inference,summary judgment is proper.
b.the statute of limitations does not bar drexler malpractice claim as a matter of law 
section provides in an action for injury or death against a health care provider based upon such person alleged professional negligence,the time for the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the injury,whichever occurs first.a plaintiff in a medical malpractice action must satisfy the requirements of both the and the limitations periods.brown bleiberg,supra,cal d at doe doe th,artal allen th.the injury commences both the and the limitations periods.see larcher wanless cal d,the meaning of the word injury as used in the statute designate s the event which starts the running of the overall now limitation period,and the discovery of which is the basis of the shorter limitation.the limitations period,however,does not begin to run until the plaintiff discovers both his or her injury and its negligent cause.see gutierrez mofid cal d,the term injury,as used in section,means both a person physical condition and its negligent cause sanchez south hoover hospital cal d,the word injury had come to be used in the cases to denote both a person physical condition and its negligent cause.t he word injury has the same meaning in the parallel now three year and limitation periods of the statute.larcher wanless,supra,cal d at,fn.accord,bispo burton,supra,d at,fn.see wells fargo bank superior court d,fn.the california supreme court has stated that injury had the same meaning in relation to both the one and the limitations under former section see also gilloon humana,fn.i t is to be presumed that the legislature intended the term injury to have the same meaning in the parallel and limitation periods in nevada medical malpractice statute.
as noted,the trial court ruled that drexler,having consulted an attorney in january to determine whether he could sue petersen and german for malpractice,had a suspicion of wrongdoing by that time.the fact that drexler contemplated suing petersen and german is strong evidence that drexler suspected the doctors had not properly diagnosed or treated his headaches.see gutierrez mofid,supra,cal d at facts that the plaintiff knew of her injury almost immediately after the operation and consulted a lawyer because she wanted to explore her legal remedies constituted constructive notice of her claim.even with the presence of such suspicions,however,the and limitations periods did not begin to run until drexler discovered his injury that is,became aware of additional,appreciable harm from his preexisting condition and,with respect to the limitations period,also had reason to believe that injury was caused by the wrongdoing of peterson and german.
in most cases,the plaintiff discovers his or her injury prior to,or contemporaneously with,learning its negligent cause.as a result,w ith regard to the limitation provision,the issue on appeal usually is whether the plaintiff actually suspected,or a reasonable person would have suspected,that the injury was caused by wrongdoing.garabet superior court th.the issue in this appeal,however,is not whether drexler had actual or constructive knowledge of the doctors alleged wrongdoing,but when drexler discovered his injury.
the definition of injury under section 
the word injury in section refer s to the damaging effect of the alleged wrongful act and not to the act itself.larcher wanless,supra,cal d at,fn.therefore,t he date of injury could be much later than the date of the wrongful act where the plaintiff suffers no physical harm until months or years after the wrongful act.steketee lintz,williams rothberg cal d.the injury,however,is not necessarily the ultimate harm suffered,but instead occurs at the point at which appreciable harm is first manifested.brown bleiberg,supra,cal d at,fn.see hills aronsohn d,hills appreciable harm may become apparent before the ultimate harm or diagnosis.each case necessarily will turn on its own particular circumstance.it could well be that an injury or pathology will not manifest itself for some period after the last treatment by a physician.on the other hand,that injury or pathology may manifest itself and the patient will suffer known appreciable harm at a time prior to the ultimate result.bispo burton,supra,d at see warren schecter th,statute of limitations runs from point at which appreciable harm was first manifested,and m anifested is that point at which the damage has become evidenced in some significant fashion when the damage has clearly surfaced and is noticeable mcnall summers th,statute of limitations begins to run when there is appreciable harm or the point in time at which appreciable harm is first manifested marriage family center superior court d,t he word manifest as used by our courts indeed suggests not only actual damage but that the damage has made itself known in some outward fashion.
in many medical malpractice cases,the patient alleges that the health care provider has performed a procedure that caused some injury.in such cases,it is relatively easy to determine when both the injury and its cause occurred,whether the injury occurs immediately following the procedure or does not manifest itself until months or even years later.see,garabet superior court,supra,th at plaintiff suffered cloudy vision,dryness in his eyes,and double vision within weeks of having lasik surgery mcnall summers,supra,th at plaintiff suffered memory loss soon after receiving electroconvulsive therapy rose fife d,plaintiff discovered injury from insertion of defective intrauterine device when she suffered pelvic infection many years later.
when a patient experiences appreciable harm before the ultimate harm,that appreciable harm will start the limitations period.for example,in hills,supra,d,the plaintiff received silicone injections in her breasts from the defendant doctor in.id.at.in,when the plaintiff noticed lumps and soreness,she consulted a second doctor who informed her that the lumps were typical after silicone injections.ibid.in april a third doctor informed the plaintiff that she was suffering from silicone granulomatosis due to silicone injections and discussed the possibility of surgery to remove the silicone lumps.ibid.almost two years later,on january,the third doctor noted that the plaintiff feels that the lump in her right breast has gotten larger and also,that her breasts have become more uncomfortable id.at.that doctor recommended both a mastectomy and breast reconstruction,and the plaintiff had surgery on february and march.id.at.on march,the plaintiff filed a malpractice suit against the defendant.ibid.affirming summary judgment for the defendant doctor,this court rejected the defendant argument that the injury occurred on the date of the negligent act in,when the defendant injected the silicone,and also rejected the plaintiff argument that the injury did not occur until the mastectomy in.id.at.instead,this court held that the key event was the soreness and lumps the plaintiff experienced in,four years before she filed her lawsuit.ibid.this court explained this admission is sufficient to show that she suffered the damaging effect of the alleged malpractice on that date in.id.at see bispo burton,supra,d at rejecting the defendant argument that the injury occurred on date of the hip surgery,rejecting the plaintiff argument that the injury occurred four years later upon learning that leg amputation was necessary,and finding there was a factual issue regarding when the plaintiff suffered injury.
injury in a case of failure to diagnose a preexisting,latent condition 
when a plaintiff brings a malpractice action based on the defendant failure to diagnose,or misdiagnosis of,a latent,progressive condition,identification of the injury is more difficult.see raddatz cir,w hen a claim of malpractice is based on a failure to diagnose,warn,or treat a patient for a injury,rather than affirmative conduct creating a new injury,identification of both the injury and its cause may be more difficult for a patient.only one published case in california addresses the issue of when a plaintiff suffers appreciable harm in the context of misdiagnosis of a preexisting,hidden condition.in steingart white d steingart the plaintiff noticed a lump in her breast,and in february the defendant doctor diagnosed the lump as fibrocystic disease,a benign condition.id.at.the plaintiff believed the lump was very nodule and hard,and she had a feeling of cognitive dissonance about the diagnosis.id.at.because she had some question in her mind about the diagnosis,she made an appointment with a second doctor a few months later.the second doctor ordered a mammogram,which was negative for cancer.ibid.the negative result reassured the plaintiff that she did not have cancer.ibid.in the plaintiff went to a third doctor,who ordered another mammogram.again the results were negative.ibid.in april the plaintiff noticed a change in the contour of the upper outer quadrant of her right breast.ibid.the third doctor immediately referred the plaintiff to a fourth doctor,who performed a lumpectomy and informed the plaintiff that she had stage ii breast cancer.ibid.
on march,more than four years after the defendant doctor examination,but within one year of the change in contour of the breast and the cancer diagnosis,the plaintiff filed a malpractice action.steingart,supra,d at.the court,reversing an order granting the defendant motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds,rejected the defendant argument that the plaintiff suffered an injury cancer as manifested by the lump at the time the first doctor examined her on february.id.at.instead,the court determined that the plaintiff suffered no damaging effect or appreciable harm from the defendant doctor asserted neglect until the third doctor discovered her cancer in april.ibid.the court rejected the defendant argument that the plaintiff lump,which she knew about in,was like the lump and soreness in hills,which had commenced the running of the statute of limitations.id.at.the court holding recognized the difference between a plaintiff who can connect her injury to a prior negligent procedure,and a plaintiff whose injury predates consultation with a doctor a lthough the plaintiff knew about the lump at the time the defendant examined her,such a condition is not a clear indication of injury,either damaging effect or appreciable harm.unlike the plaintiff in hills,the plaintiff in steingart was not advised the lump was the result of any earlier treatment the silicone injections.on the contrary,she was told repeatedly the lump was nonthreatening.ibid.
there are federal cases under the federal tort claims act ftca addressing the issue of when a medical malpractice plaintiff discovers an injury after a doctor failure to diagnose a preexisting,hidden condition.see b for example,in augustine cir.augustine the court recognized the difficulty a patient may have in identifying both the injury and its cause when a doctor fails to diagnose or treat a preexisting condition where a claim of medical malpractice is based on the failure to diagnose or treat a condition,the injury is not the mere undetected existence of the medical problem at the time the physician failed to diagnose or treat the patient or the mere continuance of that same undiagnosed problem in substantially the same state.rather,the injury is the development of the problem into a more serious condition which poses greater danger to the patient or which requires more extensive treatment.id.at.the court in augustine held,in this type of case,it is only when the patient becomes aware or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have become aware of the development of a preexisting problem into a more serious condition that his cause of action can be said to have accrued for purposes of section b.see mamea wl,at plaintiff discovered her injury when she learned that her previously diagnosed condition,kidney stones,had deteri
