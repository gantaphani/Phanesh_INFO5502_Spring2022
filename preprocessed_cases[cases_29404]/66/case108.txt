columbia venture,llc appeals an order of the district court dismissing its second amended complaint with prejudice.see.b.the court concluded that columbia venture state law claims are preempted by the national flood insurance act of nfia,et.for the following reasons,we affirm.

columbia venture owns a large parcel of property along the congaree river in south carolina.in,the federal emergency management agency fema began a reassessment of flood elevation maps of this area.pursuant to the nfia,fema hired dewberry davis,llc dewberry as an independent contractor to provide engineering and related services to assist in the remapping effort.dewberry provided the hydraulic model used to designate a large portion of columbia venture property as part of the floodway.this designation prevented columbia venture from developing much of its property,thereby greatly reducing the property value.columbia venture filed an administrative appeal of fema determination pursuant to that was ultimately unsuccessful.see columbia venture,llc sc wildlife,cir per curiam holding that fema failure to timely publish notice in accordance with was harmless and did not warrant vacating fema final determination 
columbia venture then brought this action against dewberry,alleging state law claims of professional malpractice,civil conspiracy,injurious falsehood,and violation of the south carolina unfair trade practices act scutpa.columbia venture contends that the hydraulic model provided by dewberry,which was used to determine the flood elevations,is flawed and inaccurate.columbia venture also argues that fema concealed this information and the reasons for the changes in the floodway determination when it pursued its administrative appeal.
pursuant to rule b,dewberry moved to dismiss the first amended complaint on the ground that the statute of limitations had run on columbia venture claims.the district court denied the motion,holding that columbia venture had alleged sufficient facts to support a finding that it did not have notice of its potential cause of action against dewberry.columbia venture then filed a second amended complaint,and dewberry filed another motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b.in this motion,dewberry argued that the claims were preempted by the nfia.additionally,dewberry argued that all of columbia venture claims were and,alternatively,that the claims otherwise failed because dewberry did not owe a duty of care to columbia venture.dewberry also argued that columbia venture failed to properly allege a conspiracy claim,failed to properly allege an injurious falsehood claim,and did not state a claim under scutpa.
the district court dismissed the second amended complaint,holding that the nfia preempts columbia venture state law claims under a theory of obstacle preemption,which is a sub set of implied conflict preemption.specifically,the court held that permitting landowners to bring state law tort claims against fema independent contractors would obstruct the purposes of the nfia because such litigation would increase the cost to fema and hinder its efforts to implement the flood insurance program.further,the court held that such claims would destroy the balance struck by congress in establishing the limited administrative appeals process under.because it held that columbia venture claims are preempted,the court did not reach dewberry alternative theories for dismissal.
the initial question we have to address is one we raised at oral argument whether the district court addressed the issue of preemption prematurely under constitutional avoidance principles.we have held that federal preemption of state law is a constitutional question because it is premised on the supremacy clause of the united states constitution,and when a party provides alternative independent state law grounds for disposing of a case,courts should not decide the constitutional question of preemption before considering the state law grounds.see bell atl,prince george county,cir citing ashwander.valley,brandeis,concurring see also h r block,raskin,cir applying bell atlantic to remand the case for consideration of whether the statute applied to the plaintiff before deciding whether it was preempted.in this context,an independent state law ground is one that allows us to avoid deciding a constitutional question.mediaone group,county of henrico,cir.
here,dewberry asserts five state law grounds for dismissal.three of these columbia venture failed to state a conspiracy claim,an injurious falsehood claim,or south carolina unfair trade practices clearly not independent state law grounds that allow us to avoid deciding the preemption issue because they only relate to one of the five claims.see id.at.accordingly,we need not address these issues under bell atlantic.
dewberry also argues that columbia venture claims fail because it did not owe a common law duty of care to columbia venture.however,columbia venture scutpa claims are not governed by a common law duty of care but by ann.therefore,the lack of duty defense is not an independent state law ground because a holding that dewberry owed no common law duty to columbia venture would still leave the preemption issue to be resolved with respect to the scutpa claim.see mediaone group,at.accordingly,we need not address this theory under bell atlantic.
finally,dewberry argues that all of columbia venture claims are.unlike dewberry other grounds for dismissal,this ground is potentially dispositive of all of the claims because all claims are governed by a statute of limitations period.ann.under bell atlantic,this independent state law ground must be addressed before we reach preemption.although we have discretion to address this issue or to remand it for consideration by the district court,the district court already denied dewberry motion to dismiss on this ground with regard to the first amended complaint.because we see no distinction between the amended complaint and the second amended complaint as they relate to the statute of limitations defense,we now address it on appeal.
dewberry bears the burden of establishing that the claims are barred by the statute of limitations,and where the material facts are in dispute,the issue becomes one for the jury.brown finger.pursuant to south carolina discovery rule,the limitations period begins to run where the facts and circumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and experience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim against another party might exist.wiggins edwards,citing snell columbia gun exchange,d,see graniteville,ih,holding that plaintiff could not have known of its potential cause of action until an expert determined the cause of the fire.under this rule,the statute of limitations is triggered when the plaintiff discovers the injury,not when he discovers the identity of another alleged tortfeasor.see wiggins,at.
columbia venture alleges professional malpractice among other claims.in some professional malpractice cases,south carolina courts have found that the potential claim was or should have been discovered not when the plaintiff had knowledge of the injury but when the plaintiff had reason to know that the injury alone was the result of wrongful conduct by the professional.see garner houck,finding that a jury question was presented as to when the plaintiff knew or should have known that he had a cause of action against doctors for negligence that caused a family member death true monteith,holding that there was a question of fact
