plaintiff kevin bushling underwent surgery on february,to remove his gall bladder and to biopsy a mole on his abdomen.the following morning plaintiff began to experience pain in his left shoulder.thereafter,he filed this action against the surgeon and the anesthesiologist who performed the february surgery and the hospital in which it took place,alleging they had been negligent in his treatment and care,which resulted in the injury to his shoulder.
defendants filed a summary judgment motion and produced evidence to show that they were not guilty of negligence in plaintiff treatment or care.plaintiff opposed the motion,relying primarily on declarations from two medical experts,katz and mar,to establish a triable issue of material fact.the trial court found that plaintiff evidence on the motion did not raise a triable issue of material fact and entered judgment for the defendants.plaintiff appeals.
because the declarations of katz and mar failed to provide a factual basis or a reasoned explanation for the doctors opinion that defendants were guilty of negligence,the declarations were of no evidentiary value.plaintiff failed to establish a triable issue of material fact and we affirm the judgment.
facts and proceedings 
on may,plaintiff filed his action for negligence,alleging that defendants fremont medical center medical center,phillip caruso,and charles rosson,negligently caused damage to plaintiff on february,in that they or their agents assisted,performed,diagnosed and treated plaintiff in such a negligent manner during and after surgery so as to cause severe damage to plaintiff shoulder and that their conduct fell below the applicable standard of care.the complaint further alleged that defendants negligence was the substantial,proximate,direct cause of the injury to plaintiff,which included nerve damage and loss of use of his shoulder.each defendant denied the allegations and asserted numerous affirmative defenses.later in the proceedings each defendant filed motions for summary judgment.
caruso motion 
on march,caruso filed his motion for summary judgment.he asserted that the medical care he provided to plaintiff fell within the appropriate standard of care and that plaintiff could not establish a causal connection between his injury and the surgery or to his aftercare.
in his separate statement of undisputed facts caruso asserted when rosson performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on plaintiff at the medical center on february,caruso served as the anesthesiologist.caruso provided general anesthesia services during surgery,including positioning,and assisted in plaintiff transfer to the care unit.he had no further contact with plaintiff.
nothing occurred during the february surgery or during plaintiff transportation from the operating room to have caused injury to his shoulder.caruso care and treatment was appropriate and within the standard of care.
plaintiff saw stephen weber for an orthopedic consultation on june,at which time plaintiff complained of left shoulder pain related to his february operation.weber subsequently performed surgery on plaintiff shoulder,which included release of the transverse ligament over the nerve.
in support of his motion and his statement of undisputed facts,caruso filed his declaration,stating,in general,that he was the anesthesiologist during plaintiff surgery,that he had reviewed all of the medical records relating to that surgery,and that his care and treatment of plaintiff consisted of providing general anesthesia services to plaintiff and accompanying him to the care unit.caruso also declared that he was familiar with the types of injuries which can occur due to positioning or trauma associated with surgical procedures involving general anesthesia,including laparoscopic cholecystectomies and that t here was nothing which occurred during plaintiff surgery or transportation from the operating room which caused injury to his shoulder.
caruso submitted the declaration of ritu jain,a board certified anesthesiologist,who stated that because she had been the anesthesiologist in laparoscopic cholecystectomies more than times,she was familiar with the surgical and anesthesia procedures involved in plaintiff surgery and with the types of injuries that can occur during them.based on her experience,together with her review of all the records in the case and the deposition testimony of weber,it was her opinion that caruso met the standard of care in all his actions.
caruso also submitted portions of weber deposition.weber testified that during his orthopedic consultation with plaintiff on june,plaintiff reported that he went to sleep during the february operation in a supine position,then experienced disabling pain on waking.weber determined that it was unlikely that plaintiff injury was a traction injury,given the fact that his entire procedure was probably performed supine.weber thereafter operated on plaintiff shoulder and found there was no tear to plaintiff rotator cuff.weber also said that as with carpal tunnel at the wrist,he was able to release the transverse ligament,which is a tight ligament that runs over the top of a small notch in the scapula.that procedure allows more space in that area of the shoulder.
during the surgery weber found nothing consistent with trauma to,or a traction injury of,plaintiff shoulder.he testified that in his opinion,based on reasonable medical probability,this nerve injury had no specific cause,positioning or other problems,and that what the bulk of the literature suggests,certainly my personal experience with these injuries.weber concluded that plaintiff injury was idiopathic,explaining i diopathic means we do know.i think we do know what probably did cause it.that what idiopathic is all about.i like to be better by saying idiopathically we do know what causes it.that what it is or another way to phrase idiopathic.i mean,there usually is no cause.i do know how to be more clear.it s a frustrating concept,but i think maybe i could phrase it idiopathic means there usually is no cause.
rosson motion 
rosson motion similarly asserted that his care and treatment of plaintiff was within the applicable standard of care and that plaintiff could not show a triable issue of fact as to causation.
rosson separate statement of undisputed facts asserted that plaintiff appeared at the emergency room at the medical center on february,with upper abdominal discomfort.after an evaluation by richard evans,plaintiff was admitted to the hospital.william irvine asked rosson to consult on plaintiff case on february.rosson determined that plaintiff suffered from acalculous cholecystitis and gilbert disease benign liver disease.rosson recommended plaintiff undergo an endoscopic cholecystectomy and possibly a cholangiogram.
rosson explained to plaintiff that an open cholecystectomy might have to be performed if the doctors encountered problems with the endoscopic procedure.plaintiff understood the risks and benefits of the procedure.on february,he signed a consent and authorization form.
plaintiff arrived in the operating room at on february.anesthesia was started and rosson made the incision at.the incision was closed and plaintiff left the operating room at.according to rosson contemporaneous operative report,plaintiff was transferred to the recovery room and he tolerated the procedure well.he remained stable throughout the day.
at on february,plaintiff first complained of bilateral shoulder pain medications were administered as ordered.he was discharged later that day after it was determined that his recovery from surgery was uneventful.
on february,during a examination with rosson,plaintiff complained again of left shoulder pain.rosson relieved the complaint with an injection of marcaine and ordered a examination in one week.
on march,plaintiff returned to see rosson and said he had started physical therapy for his left shoulder pain.rosson noted the pain had returned.
after plaintiff discharge,william hope,a neurologist,treated him on referral from an orthopedist.hope determined as of may,that plaintiff suffered from a suprascapular nerve palsy of the left shoulder.
weber,a board certified orthopedic surgeon,evaluated plaintiff on june.weber concluded that plaintiff suffered from a suprascapular neuropathy.he discussed its etiology with plaintiff and explained he found it hard to believe that the injury was a traction injury,because plaintiff surgical procedure on february was probably performed in the supine position.weber noted that many such injuries were idiopathic in nature,occurring for a variety of reasons after a variety of types of surgical procedures that are,in the literature.
on july,weber performed a suprascapular nerve release on plaintiff left shoulder.the procedure was conducted without complication.
rosson included in his motion plaintiff medical records and a declaration from luther cobb,a board certified general surgeon.based on his familiarity with the standard of care in general surgery including over laparoscopic cholecystectomies that he had performed and his review of the records in the case,cobb declared that the bilateral shoulder pain of which plaintiff complained the day after his february surgery is a recognized risk of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and can occur in the absence of negligence.it was not caused by the surgery.rosson treatment was within the applicable standard of care.
rosson also included in his motion an excerpt from weber deposition that essentially paralleled the excerpts filed with caruso motion.
the medical center motion 
the medical center asserted that weber testimony established that plaintiff could not show negligence or causation and that he had not offered any expert evidence to the contrary.
the medical center separate statement of undisputed facts alleged,in addition to that which the other separate statements alleged weber determined during surgery that plaintiff did not suffer from a rotator cuff tear weber was still of the opinion that plaintiff shoulder injury was not caused by positioning,trauma,or traction based on reasonable medical probability,the injury was not caused by a sharp blow to the top of the shoulder or by being dropped on the shoulder plaintiff problem was in the nature of mononeuritis,an inflammation of the nerve,unrelated to positioning or any alleged trauma during or after the original surgery.
the medical center attached medical records and excerpts from plaintiff discovery responses as exhibits,along with weber deposition and curriculum vitae.
plaintiff opposition to the motions 
in plaintiff consolidated opposition to defendants motions,he asserted,based primarily on the declarations of ronald katz and timothy mar,that triable issues of fact existed as to negligence.in the alternative,also based on those declarations,he requested a continuance for further discovery into the cause of his injury.
in response to the medical center assertion that plaintiff original surgery was performed with plaintiff in the supine position,plaintiff asserted that the surgery was merely begun in that position according to the operative report,plaintiff was moved during the surgery to remove a mole from his back the report failed to show the position of plaintiff left arm or how this other procedure took.the report,which plaintiff relied on for the allegation that he was turned from the supine position during surgery,states that the operation performed was an endoscopic cholecystectomy and incision of a mole on the right anterior side of the abdomen 
in response to the medical center claim that weber informed plaintiff and his wife on june,that plaintiff injury was not a traction positioning injury,plaintiff asserted that weber report merely stated it was hard to imagine traction injury when procedure probably performed in supine katz declaration shows that weber was wrong to testify that the medical literature does not support the theory that positioning can cause injuries like plaintiff.
in response to the medical center assertion that weber told plaintiff on june,that his injury was idiopathic in nature,plaintiff asserted that to weber idiopathic means he does not know.
in response to the medical center assertion that weber held the opinion after performing his surgery that plaintiff shoulder problem was not caused by positioning,trauma,or traction,plaintiff asserted that weber admitted he did not know how plaintiff left arm was positioned during the original surgery.
in response to the medical center claims of a ruling out a sharp blow to the top of plaintiff shoulder,being dropped on his shoulder,positioning,or transportation from the operating room as causes of his injury and of b defining those causes as idiopathic and in the nature of a mononeuritis or inflammatory problem unrelated to the positioning or any alleged trauma,plaintiff took the position that the declarations of katz and mar showed it was more probable than not the injury occurred from negligent traumatic injury or improper positioning or stretching of the extremity.
in response to caruso assertion that nothing occurred during surgery or transportation from the operating room to have caused plaintiff injury and that all of his treatment was within the standard of care,plaintiff asserted that the declarations of katz and mar were to the contrary,as well as the suspicions of hope and vallier who did treatment of a positioning injury,and weber lack of knowledge about the causation of the injury and the positioning of plaintiff arm during the surgery.
in response to rosson evidence that plaintiff signed an authorization form for the surgery,knowing the risks and benefits,plaintiff asserted that the authorization did not mention the risks of improper positioning,dropping,or stretching of the extremity.
in response to rosson claim that plaintiff tolerated the procedure well,remained postoperatively stable throughout the day,and was eventually discharged the following day after it was determined he had recovered uneventfully from the surgery,plaintiff asserted disputed injury to shoulder and repeatedly sedated.see plaintiff h fremont records.
in response to rosson claim that william hope,who treated plaintiff after his discharge,determined by may,that plaintiff suffered from a suprascapular nerve palsy of the left shoulder,plaintiff relied on,and attached as an exhibit to his opposition,an evaluation report prepared by garry vallier,who suspected a possible positioning injury.plaintiff also attached a neurological referral report by william hope,which stated that hope was unable to explain plaintiff condition in terms of expected course of the february surgery and was suspicious that this could even have been coincidental though concern over positioning resulting in pressure to the suprascapular nerve intraoperatively has been raised.
plaintiff responded to rosson assertions that weber thought the injury was idiopathic and that rosson treatment was within the standard of care and did not cause plaintiff injury,by reciting the qualifications of his experts,katz and mar,then setting out their contrary opinions plaintiff also asserted that he could not have been supine throughout the surgery unless defendants removed the mole on his back through a hole in the operating table.
the declaration of katz 
the declaration of ronald katz,furnished by plaintiff in opposition to the motion,reads as follows

finally,if the court was inclined to grant the summary judgment motion,plaintiff requested a continuance of the hearing based on katz and mar opinions that depositions of the defendants and hospital staff were necessary to p inpoint whose negligence is responsible for this injury 
defendants replies 
citing kelley trunk th,d kelley,all defendants asserted that the katz and mar declarations were wholly conclusory and therefore insufficient to defeat summary judgment.rosson and the medical center also filed evidentiary objections to the declarations,asserting that katz and mar declarations lacked foundation.
each defendant objected to plaintiff request for a continuance on the basis that at the time of the motion,the litigation had been pending for approximately two years during which time plaintiff had not initiated discovery.defendants argued that plaintiff had not prosecuted the action diligently and that plaintiff request for further time for discovery should be denied.
the trial court ruling 
the trial court issued an order granting summary judgment to all defendants,finding that plaintiff declarations were deficient pursuant to kelley,and thus plaintiff opposition to the motion failed to raise a triable issue of material fact as to the standard of care or causation.the court did not expressly sustain the defendants evidentiary objections to the declarations of katz and.the court sustained an objection to the reports of vallier and hope on the basis that they were hearsay and lacked foundation,a ruling which plaintiff does not challenge on appeal.the court granted summary judgment to the doctor defendants on the separate and independent grounds of an insufficient showing of a violation of the standard of care and causation,and to the medical center on the issue of causation.the court thereafter entered judgment dismissing plaintiff action.
discussion 
ithe trial court ruling granting summary judgmenta.california summary judgment law.
after a trio of rulings by the united states supreme court in clarifying the federal law of summary judgment matsushita.zenith radio,d anderson liberty lobby,d and celotex catrett,d,the legislature amended the statutes relating to summary judgment law in california.the legislature purpose was to amend california laws so that state summary judgment practice would more closely conform to federal practice,which would,in turn,liberalize the granting of summary judgment motions.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.
the legislative amendments and the california supreme court interpretation of those amendments in aguilar have provided the courts with points of reference by which summary judgment motions must now be determined.
thus,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuading the court that there is no triable issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.there is a triable issue of material fact if the evidence on the motion would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion given the applicable standard of proof.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
further,the party moving for summary judgment initially must produce evidence sufficient to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of a triable issue of material fact.if the moving party makes that showing,the party opposing the motion then has the burden of producing evidence sufficient to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.id.at,d.
where,as here,a defendant moves for summary judgment and the plaintiff bears the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence at trial on the issues that are the subject of the motion,the defendant initially must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact not to find any underlying material fact more likely than not aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.more specifically,a moving defendant must make a prima facie showing that the plaintiff does not possess,and can not reasonably obtain,sufficient evidence to establish at least one element of plaintiff cause of action.id.at,d.if a defendant has met that burden,the plaintiff must then present evidence that would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find in his favor more likely than not.see id.at,d.if the court determines that the evidence presented by the plaintiff and all of the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom show one or more of the elements of the cause of action only as likely as,or less likely than,an absence of one or more of those elements,it must grant a defendant motion for summary judgment.see id.at,d.
on appeal,we review the record de novo to determine whether the moving party met its burden of proof.lewis county of sacramento th,d.we consider all of the evidence set forth in the supporting and opposition papers,except that to which objections have been made and sustained by the court,and all uncontradicted inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence.artiglio corning cal th,d.
b.the moving parties evidence in support of the motions.
we first consider whether defendants produced evidence sufficient to constitute a prima facie showing that in this matter,there is no triable issue of material fact.we conclude that they did.
to prevail at trial,plaintiff will be required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendants were negligent,that is,they breached the applicable standard of care,that plaintiff was harmed,and that defendants negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff harm.judicial council of california civil jury instructions caci.
defendants placed evidence before the trial court that challenged two elements of plaintiff action,the violation of the standard of care and causation.summarized,defendants evidence showed that the doctors who performed the surgery did so within the standard of care,that the hospital treatment of plaintiff was also within the standard of care and that plaintiff shoulder pain was not caused by any deficiency in their services.more specifically,the doctors and the hospital declared that plaintiff surgery was conducted in accordance with established medical and surgical procedures and without complication and that his recovery was uneventful.the moving parties placed before the court the plaintiff medical records relating to the procedure and plaintiff recovery.the records were consistent with the declarations filed in support of defendants motions.
defendants also presented portions of weber deposition testimony.weber described the medical care he provided to plaintiff when he attempted to relieve plaintiff pain,including the surgery weber performed on plaintiff shoulder.weber surgical examination of plaintiff shoulder revealed that plaintiff rotator cuff was not torn and that there was no evidence of trauma to plaintiff shoulder.it was weber opinion that plaintiff injury was idiopathic.he explained that term meant the injury had an unknown cause,or no cause,and that the examination and surgery he performed was consistent with an idiopathic injury,because it revealed no indication that the injury to plaintiff shoulder was caused by a blow to the shoulder or traction injury or other trauma.weber concluded that the nerve injury was of unknown cause,one that could have occurr ed for a variety of reasons after a variety of types of surgical procedures that are,in the literature.
it is unclear whether plaintiff contended in the trial court that defendants had not produced evidence sufficient to support a prima facie case in defendants favor.while plaintiff mentioned in passing that d efendants rely heavily on weber who admitted he did not know the cause of plaintiff injury,plaintiff then turned to his own evidence on the motion,arguing that the declarations of katz and mar were sufficient to demonstrate there was a triable issue of material fact.
we do not construe plaintiff incomplete recitation of weber opinion,which is unaccompanied by argument on the point,as a claim that defendants failed to produce evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie case in their favor thus relieving plaintiff of the burden of meeting that evidence.but even if we did,we conclude that the moving parties production of evidence was sufficient to support their position,that is,paralleling the words of aguilar,sufficient to require a reasonable trier of fact not to find a violation of the applicable standard of care and not to find that plaintiff injury was caused by anything that defendants did or failed to do.
on appeal plaintiff enlarges his attack on defendants initial production of evidence by arguing that the declarations of rosson,cobb,and jain are conclusory and thus insufficient to establish a prima facie case for the defense.assuming without deciding that plaintiff can raise this argument without having objected to the declarations on this basis in the trial court and that this argument is a pure question of law that can be raised for the first time on appeal see generally state of california ex rel.public works bd.bragg d,we reject it.
it is not conclusory for rosson to describe his treatment of plaintiff and state that he was not negligent.the declarations of cobb and jain,both of whom are experienced in the relevant medical procedures and both of whom reviewed the plaintiff medical records relating to the surgery and in jain case,based also on the deposition testimony of weber were also admissible.to state that one has experience in certain medical procedures and has reviewed pertinent medical records and that based on that experience and that review,the declarant has found nothing to support a claim of medical malpractice and therefore concludes that there was none is not an improper conclusion for an expert witness.the expert has given an explanation for that expert conclusion that defendants are not guilty of medical malpractice based on the expert experience and the patient medical records,there is no evidence to support a claim of negligence as a cause of injury.the reason for the opinion is the absence of evidence of medical malpractice.that opinion is significantly different than one that concludes that the standard of care has not been met resulting in an injury,but fails to give a reasoned explanation,based on facts and not on speculation,of why the expert has come to those conclusions.
plaintiff evidence in opposition.
in a matter such as this,where the conduct required of a medical professional is not within the common knowledge of laymen,a plaintiff must present expert witness testimony to prove a breach of the standard of care.flowers torrance memorial hospital medical center cal th,d,landeros flood cal d.plaintiff also must show that defendants breach of the standard of care was the cause,within a reasonable medical probability,of his injury.jennings palomar pomerado health systems,th,d jennings.
as related above,plaintiff attempted to meet defendants prima facie showing by presenting the medical records relating to plaintiff surgery and care,the declarations of katz and mar,and references to weber deposition.because the trial court sustained objections to the documents relating to vallier and hope examinations of plaintiff,a ruling plaintiff does not challenge on appeal,we may not consider either of those doctors reports.
a properly qualified expert may offer an opinion relating to a subject that is beyond common experience,if that expert opinion will assist the trier of fact,subd.a.even so,the expert opinion may not be based on assumptions of fact that are without evidentiary support or based on factors that are speculative or conjectural,for then the opinion has no evidentiary value and does not assist the trier of fact.jennings,supra,th at,d.moreover,an expert opinion rendered without a reasoned explanation of why the underlying facts lead to the ultimate conclusion has no evidentiary value because an expert opinion is worth no more than the reasons and facts on which it is based.kelley,supra,th,d judicial council of california civil jury instructions caci believability of expert opinion depends on the expert training and experience,the facts the expert relied on and the reasons for the opinion.
in this case,both katz and mar were of the opinion that plaintiff injury was caused by defendants negligence in that more probably than not,plaintiff had been dropped,his arm had been improperly positioned during surgery,or his arm had been stretched.the difficulty that plaintiff encounters in his attempt to avoid summary judgment by relying on the katz and mar opinions is that there is no evidence that plaintiff was dropped,that he was improperly positioned,or that his arm was stretched during the procedure or recovery.the doctors assume the cause from the fact of the injury.katz and mar opinions are nothing more than a statement that the injury could have been caused by defendants negligence in one of the ways they specify.but,an expert opinion that something could be true if certain assumed facts are true,without any foundation for concluding those assumed facts exist jennings,supra,th at,d,has no evidentiary value.see pacific gas electric zuckerman d.
in his opposition to the summary judgment motion,plaintiff attempted to support a single fact,which he says shows that he was either improperly positioned during surgery or that he suffered trauma to his shoulder by virtue of his arm being stretched.as noted earlier,he reads the medical records to suggest that although the gall bladder surgery was done while he was in the supine position lying on his back,he was turned over,at least to some degree,when the surgeons removed the mole on his back.in support of that factual contention,he relies on the operative report that notes the second procedure was incision of a mole on the right anterior side of the abdomen.italics added.but the anterior side of the abdomen is the front of the abdomen,not the back.thus,the operative report rebuts the single fact on which plaintiff appears to rely.
we recognize that katz and mar declared that plaintiff shoulder injury occurred more probably than not from the events they list in their declaration.but that conclusion is no more than speculation if there is no factual basis for those events.and we note that plaintiff presented no evidence to suggest that an injury such as the one he suffered was rare or unusual in the absence of negligence.indeed,given weber opinion,it was neither.
for the reasons stated,katz and mar declarations were of no evidentiary value on the question of negligence or causation.there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.plaintiff evidence in opposition to the motion fails and the motion for summary judgment was properly granted.
the trial court denial of a continuance 
if it appears from the affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication or both that facts essential to justify opposition may exist but can not,for reasons stated,then be presented,the court shall deny the motion,or order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or discovery to be had or make any other order as may be just code civ,subd.h.
in his opposition to summary judgment,plaintiff requested a continuance to conduct further discovery based on the affidavits of katz and mar,who opined in unison that f urther discovery such as depositions of the doctor defendants and hospital staff will be necessary to p inpoint whose negligence is responsible for this injury and who fell below the standard of care.plaintiff attorney did not file an affidavit,but argued that further discovery had been initiated to break the conspiracy of silence 
to have been entitled to a continuance,plaintiff was required to show,by affidavit,that facts essential to his opposition to the summary judgment motion existed,and the reasons why they could not be presented at the time of the motion.he failed to do so.
the doctors affidavits imply without explanation that further discovery will pinpoint those defendants who are guilty of negligence,that is,one presumes,which defendant dropped the plaintiff,or improperly positioned his arm,or stretched his arm in a manner that would cause injury to his shoulder.the affidavits amount at most to speculation that is contradicted in the medical records to which all parties had access.
even if the affidavits were deemed reliable enough to suggest that there may have been facts undiscovered at the time to show that defendants,or any of them,had been negligent,the doctors affidavits do not explain why those facts could not have been presented by the time of hearing on the motion.
this action was filed on may.the summary judgment motion was heard on april.there is no indication in this record that plaintiff initiated any discovery whatsoever during the period of time between the complaint and the motion and certainly no explanation,even outside the required affidavits,of why he could not have conducted the discovery necessary to present the opposition evidence by the time of the hearing.
plaintiff relies on bahl bank of america th,d,arguing that a continuance is virtually mandated upon a good faith showing that a continuance is necessary to obtain facts essential to justify opposition to a summary judgment motion.plaintiff is correct that bahl made that observation.for the purpose of this opinion,we need not decide whether it is correct for assuming that it is,the court observation does not aid plaintiff here.the virtual mandate to which plaintiff refers presupposes a good faith showing that there are facts in opposition that may exist and a good faith showing why those facts could not have been presented at the time of the hearing.plaintiff has made neither showing here,and the motion to continue was properly denied.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.
plaintiff bushling went into the defendant hospital for an operation on his abdomen.
the morning after the operation,while plaintiff was in the hospital,he experienced pain in his shoulder.
although he has undergone several surgeries on his shoulder,plaintiff has lost the use of his shoulder through nerve damage and is totally disabled.
in moving for summary judgment,the defendants declared that they did nothing wrong.weber,who performed subsequent surgery on plaintiff shoulder,declared that,in his opinion,plaintiff injury had an unknown cause.
in response to this showing by the defendants,plaintiff filed the declarations of two physicians.one of them,ronald katz,was the former chairman of the department of anesthesiology at both the university of california,los angeles ucla and the university of southern california usc schools of medicine.at the time of his declaration,he was professor of anesthesiology at both ucla and usc.both of plaintiff experts reviewed all medical records and weber deposition and testified that,to a probability,the kind of injury suffered by plaintiff could not have occurred in the absence of negligence.
the expert testimony set forth in plaintiff declarations created a triable issue of fact.the trial court erroneously struck these declarations and the majority compound that error.this case should have gone to a jury.
i respectfully dissent.
at the outset,i note that the majority frame the issues on summary judgment by referring frequently to aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.they do so in part for the proposition that aguilar concluded amendments to the summary judgment statute were designed to liberalize the granting of summary judgment motions.
in my view,aguilar,supra,cal th,d,has nothing to do with the central issue in this case whether plaintiff expert declarations should have been considered as reliable evidence.the way in which aguilar liberalized the granting of summary judgment motions was that,for the first time,a defendant could obtain summary judgment by demonstrating that the plaintiff had no evidence by which to prove his case.that is not at issue in this case.
aguilar,supra,cal th,d,did nothing to change the following rules for the adjudication of a summary judgment motion which the majority fail to acknowledge as set forth by the california supreme court in molko holy spirit cal d at page,summary judgment is a drastic measure that deprives the losing party of a trial on the merits.citations.it should therefore be used with caution,so that it does not become a substitute for trial.citations.the affidavits of the moving party should be strictly construed,and those of the opponent liberally construed.citations.any doubts as to the propriety of granting the motion should be resolved in favor of the party opposing the motion.citations.
these procedural rules for the review and granting of a motion for summary judgment are designed to preserve the constitutionality of the summary judgment procedure.as the court recently explained in bahl bank of america th at page,d though often said,it appears necessary to again reiterate that a summary judgment is a drastic measure which deprives the losing party of trial on the merits.bunzel american academy of orthopaedic surgeons d.see also rincon burbank unified school dist.d.the right to a jury trial,embodied in article i,section of the california constitution,is at stake.see troutman,the jury trial,cautioning against too liberal summary judgment as an abandonment of the principles of our forefathe
