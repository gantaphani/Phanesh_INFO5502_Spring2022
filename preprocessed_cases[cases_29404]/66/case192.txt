a wisconsin jury convicted jarrett adams,along with dimitri henley,of five counts of sexual assault,and adams was sentenced to years in prison.adams appealed his conviction to the wisconsin court of appeals and the wisconsin supreme court,neither of which granted him relief.having exhausted his state court remedies,adams filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the eastern district of wisconsin,challenging both the sufficiency of the evidence and the effectiveness of his trial counsel.the district court denied his petition.we reverse the district court decision based on the constitutional deficiencies of his trial counsel.
in september,jarrett adams,dimitri henley,and rovaughn hill,three men from chicago,were selling cologne at the university of wisconsin at whitewater shortly before fall semester classes were to begin on the evening of september,the men were playing video games in the dorm room of shawn demain,a freshman whom they had met during their sales rounds.meanwhile,a female freshman who resided in the same dorm as demain,and roommate,heidi sheets,were attending a party a few blocks away.while at the party,had approximately three or four beers.upon returning to the dorm later that evening,the women went to demain dorm room,where they first met the three men from chicago.
at trial sheets and offered different stories of what happened next.sheets claimed that both women invited the men up to their room,which was located three floors above demain.while the men and proceeded to the room,sheets went down the hall for approximately minutes to speak with another friend.according to,however,neither she nor sheets invited the three men to their room.rather,she left demain room by herself and went to her room.when she opened the door to her room,the three men suddenly appeared at the door and barged in,telling to put on music so that they could dance.after selecting a compact disc,the men took turns dancing provocatively with,groping her breasts and grabbing her crotch.she claimed she did not resist because she was scared.the situation deteriorated further.one of the men pulled onto sheets bed,and adams,standing before her,pulled down his pants,leaving him with only his boxers on.
at this point,sheets entered the room.both sheets and testified that sheets became upset and stormed out of the room.followed sheets out of the room,and none of the men restrained her from doing so.sheets entered another room on the same floor,but refused to let inside.through the closed door,asked sheets whether she was mad at her and overheard sheets calling her a slut.during her time in the hall,never indicated that anything was amiss or attempted to enter another room.after waiting a few minutes,left the door and decided to go downstairs instead of returning to her room.upon reaching the staircase,however,she came across hill waiting for her.he turned around,directing her back to her room where the other men were waiting.
upon returning to her room,the men ordered her to sit on the floor,and complied,sitting on the floor with her legs crossed indian style.shortly thereafter adams told her to lie down,which did.adams tried to remove her pants,while kept her knees close together in an attempt to stop him.eventually,however,in the face of adams continued tugging,she relaxed her legs.he removed pants and underwear,and then proceeded to have sex with her.after adams stopped,the other men took turns having sex with.during this time,one of the men also rubbed his penis against her face,telling her to suck this,as turned her face to avoid it.
the three men left,and called her boyfriend,joshua lodwick.although did not want to go to the hospital or talk to the police,lodwick and others convinced her to do both.adams,hill,and henley were eventually charged with sexual assault.they were first tried together in,but that trial resulted in a mistrial after the state attempted to amend its charges after the close of evidence.subsequently,adams and henley were tried together.later,hill was tried separately.
at the second trial,both john fiske,adams lawyer,and steve luchsinger,henley lawyer,about earlier statements to her treating doctor and at the first trial,pointing out inconsistencies among various accounts she had given.adams and henley offered no defense witnesses,choosing instead to rely on their perception that the state failed to prove all the elements of sexual assault.the jury,however,found adams and henley guilty on all five counts.hill,on the other hand,called defense witnesses at his subsequent trial,including demain,who testified that he saw smoking cigarettes with the three men after the alleged assault occurred.this trial ended in a hung jury.while the state renewed its prosecution of hill later,the court eventually dismissed the case against hill because the state had failed to turn over certain police investigation notes to the defense.
on appeal,adams mounted a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence,as well as various decisions made by his trial counsel.the wisconsin court of appeals affirmed the conviction,and the wisconsin supreme court denied review.adams then proceeded to the eastern district of wisconsin,where he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus,again challenging the sufficiency of the evidence and his attorney performance.the district court denied the petition,finding the evidence sufficient to support adams convictions and that his attorney made reasonable strategic trial choices.
before this court,adams again challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and his counsel effectiveness.adams first claims that the state failed to establish that his sexual contact with involved either the use or threat of force or lack of consent,each of which is a required element to prove sexual assault in wisconsin.adams also argues that his trial attorney was constitutionally ineffective based on several events at trial.specifically,adams challenges his counsel failure to request a jury instruction for a lesser included offense,his decision not to vigorously,and his failure to properly investigate demain.
on appeal from a denial of habeas corpus relief,we review issues of law de novo and issues of fact for clear error.see perry mccaughtry,cir.to qualify for habeas relief,adams must show that the state court proceedings adjudicating his claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.see also van patten deppisch,cir bintz bertrand,cir.a state court decision constitutes an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law if the state court correctly identifies the governing legal principle from supreme court jurisprudence but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the present case.see dunlap hepp,cir.we have previously explained that an unreasonable decision,in this context,is one well outside the boundaries of permissible differences of opinion.mcfowler jaimet,cir.
adams first mounts challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence that established two of the elements of sexual assault.on direct appeal,the wisconsin court of appeals reviewed adams sufficiency claims under the standard annunciated in state poellinger,an appellate court may not reverse a conviction unless the evidence,viewed most favorably to the state and the conviction,is so insufficient in probative value and force that no trier of fact,acting reasonably,could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.wisconsin effectively duplicates the supreme court standard for sufficiency challenges,see jackson virginia,d,and adams does not claim that the wisconsin court of appeals applied the wrong standard rather,adams suggests that the court of appeals applied the proper standard unreasonably.
wisconsin defines the crime of sexual assault as sexual contact or sexual intercourse with another person without consent of that person by use or threat of force or violence.stat.a.turning to adams initial challenge,he contends that the state failed to prove the use or threat of force or violence element.a wisconsin court has previously explained 
the use or threat of force or violence element of violence element of sexual assault under.stat.a is satisfied if the use or threat of force or violence is directed to compelling the victim submission.the element is satisfied whether the force is used or threatened as part of the sexual contact or whether it is used or threatened as part of the sexual contact to compel the victim submission.
state hayes.the wisconsin supreme court has clearly stated that use of force would include both forcible contact or the force used as the means of making contact.see state bonds.to put it another way,force used during the sexual act or contact to compel submission can satisfy the statute,not just force prior to the actual sexual act.in bonds,for example,the wisconsin supreme court found that forcibly grabbing her nipple and then squeezing and pulling it sufficed for the force element of sexual assault,though it also was the extent of the sexual contact.id.at.in addition to the use of actual force,a threat of force that compels submission also satisfies this requirement.the message conveyed by a threat is determined by the context in which it occurs.state jaworski.this determination requires an examination of such factors as the place where the event occurred,the victim understanding of the threat,and physical disparities between victim and assailant.see id.
the wisconsin court of appeals did not dwell very long on adams sufficiency challenge,simply concluding that t he victim testimony,if believed,was sufficient to support the charges the jury was instructed on.wisconsin adams,wl,at.lexis,at.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the conviction,we agree that sufficient evidence established both use of force and threats of force.specifically,testified that the men groped her breasts and crotch while dancing with her in her room.after she followed sheets out of the room,she stated that she attempted to go downstairs,only to have one of the men physically turn her around and lead her back into the room.upon her return to the room,she attempted to keep her legs together,but adams persisted in taking off her pants and underwear.while did not want him to do this,she eventually could no longer keep her legs together in light of his repeated attempts.all of these actions were uses of force to compel her submission to sexual contact or intercourse.while this is not a case of a beating or extreme violence against,the statute does not require that type of force.it only requires force to compel what happened here according to testimony.
moreover,even if there were insufficient evidence of actual force,sufficient evidence supported a finding of a threat of force.as stated above,threats of force are evaluated based on the context in which they accrue.see jaworski,at.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the conviction,the context in this case establishes a threat directed to obtaining submission.testified that as she entered her room,she was surprised by three men that she barely knew,who followed her into her room uninvited.the men then ordered her to put on music and groped her while dancing.one of the men pulled her onto a bed,while adams dropped his pants.she was able to leave the situation temporarily when she unsuccessfully tried to enter another room where her roommate had relocated.when she attempted to go downstairs,she was met at the stairwell by one of the men and returned to her room.at that time,the room was dark,and she was surrounded by three men who ordered to sit down,then lie down,with adams proceeding to take off her pants and underwear despite her attempts to prevent him.while this case does not feature an explicit threat,given the number of men,their orders to,and their aggressive,actions despite her unwillingness,the context described by was one of intimidation geared to making her submit to sexual intercourse.the wisconsin court of appeals,therefore,applied jackson reasonably to the force element.
adams also argues that the evidence of lack of consent was insufficient.wisconsin defines consent as words or overt actions by a person who is competent to give informed consent indicating a freely given agreement to have sexual intercourse or sexual contact.stat.adams relies on the fact that eventually took part in the sexual intercourse as an overt act indicating consent.however,such a reading would hollow out the consent requirement,basically removing from the realm of sexual assault any instance when the victim did not overtly resist.a victim of sexual assault is not required to resist the assault to establish that the act was nonconsensual.state,see also state clark.at trial,expressly testified that the men engaged in intercourse with her without her giving any verbal consent.moreover,stated that she committed no overt acts that would suggest consent to the men,instead testifying that she complied with their orders out of fear.a reasonable juror could have concluded that she merely followed directions rather than gave consent.see clark,at.the state,therefore,introduced sufficient evidence that would allow a jury to conclude neither words nor overt actions supplied the necessary consent element.again,the conclusion of the wisconsin court of appeals was not unreasonable.
turning to adams second group of claims,he brands his trial counsel constitutionally deficient because of a number of questionable trial decisions.the wisconsin court of appeals properly referenced strickland washington,d,in its evaluation of adams ineffective assistance challenges.the strickland analysis requires adams to demonstrate that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and the deficient performance caused him prejudice.see,harris cotton,cir perry,at.regarding the performance inquiry,we presume that counsel actions fall within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,strickland,at,and defer to strategic by a trial attorney,see brown sternes,cir.see also hough anderson,cir our review of the performance of counsel must be highly deferential.internal citations omitted.despite this weighty deference,we nonetheless must carefully consider whether the attorney brought to bear the skill and knowledge that allows for a proper adversarial testing process,considering all the circumstances.see hough,at.to succeed in meeting the prejudice prong of strickland,adams must further show a reasonable probability that,but for counsel errors,the result of the proceeding would be different.see see also brown,at.a reasonable probability is defined as one that is sufficient to undermine confidence in an outcome.see strickland,at.on a habeas appeal,we look at the strickland test not directly,but rather ask whether the lower court made a reasonable application of this law to the facts of this case.floyd hanks,cir.
in this case,adams points to three main instances of substandard performance by trial counsel.first,he argues that fiske unreasonably failed to request a jury instruction regarding sexual assault.second,he contends that fiske erred by not vigorously or clearly presenting various inconsistencies among her descriptions of events.finally,and most substantially,adams claims that his trial counsel failed in his duty to conduct a reasonable investigation by not locating and talking to demain,who could have conceivably served as a witness on adams behalf.
jury instructions 
adams claims that fiske failed in his professional duties by not seeking a jury instruction for the lesser included offense of sexual assault.in wisconsin,sexual assault is sexual intercourse with a person without consent of that person.stat.basically,this offense has the same requirements as sexual assault,except it does not necessitate any showing of force.adams believes that,given the paucity of evidence relating to force at his trial,fiske should have requested this additional instruction rather than rely upon an gamble.
fiske did not overstep the bounds of professional competence in this respect.according to fiske testimony during a proceeding,he was aware of the lesser included offense of sexual assault,and he understood its constituen
