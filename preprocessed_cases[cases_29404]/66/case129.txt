lonnie brown,nettie brown,jerry brown,and pat brown the browns appeal from an order staying proceedings and compelling arbitration of their claims against citigroup global markets,formerly smith barney smith barney,life annuity insurance company ge,and pacific life insurance company pacific collectively appellees.
the browns are investors in,and beneficiaries of,smith barney securities brokerage accounts.smith barney representative,patrick holt holt,managed these accounts,investing in variable annuities from ge and pacific,as well as a variety of stocks.
upset with holt investment decisions,the browns sued smith barney,ge,pacific,and holt in louisiana state court the state action,alleging fraud,negligence,and breach of various common law and statutory duties.the defendants removed the state action to federal district court.soon thereafter,smith barney,with intervenors ge and pacific,filed two separate civil actions against the browns in federal court the federal actions one against lonnie and nettie brown,and one against jerry and pat brown.both lawsuits sought an order compelling arbitration of the browns claims pursuant to the federal arbitration act faa,based on arbitration clauses that were included in smith barney client agreement with the browns.appellees also moved for a stay pending arbitration in the state action pursuant to section of the faa 
soon thereafter,smith barney and pacific moved to compel arbitration under the faa in the federal actions.around this time,the district court consolidated the state action with the federal actions.smith barney,with pacific joining,then filed a reply in support of the motions to compel arbitration and to stay the consolidated action,arguing for a stay based upon section.
contemporaneously with this flurry of activity,the browns moved to remand the state action as untimely removed.they also moved to dismiss the federal actions and the complaints in intervention on jurisdictional grounds,asserting that holt,a to the federal actions,is an indispensable party under federal rule of civil procedure whose joinder would destroy diversity of citizenship.they also argued that the court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction.the district court remanded the state action but denied the motion to dismiss the federal actions.rather than consider the issue of arbitrability,however,the court stayed the federal actions pending the outcome in the remanded state action because i t would be a waste of judicial resources and of the parties time and treasure if both federal and the state court were to proceed simultaneously in these cases 
the appellees moved in the federal actions to alter or amend the stay order,arguing that the policy favoring arbitration required lifting the stay and ordering arbitration despite the threat of piecemeal litigation in state and federal court.the district court agreed,vacating the stay as improvidently issued and ordering additional briefing addressing the issue of arbitrability.
after receiving briefing,the district court addressed the sole issue to be decided in the federal of the browns claims against the appellees.the district court concluded that the browns were bound by an arbitration clause in their client agreements and were compelled to arbitrate their claims against smith barney.it also concluded that the actions of smith barney,intervenors ge and pacific,and holt were inextricably intertwined because t here is no way to bring actions against either ge or pacific without considering the actions of smith barney and its employee,patrick holt.applying equitable estoppel,the court then ordered arbitration of the claims against pacific and ge as well.without offering a basis for its authority,the district court then stay ed the browns actions against all the defendants within its jurisdiction,to include smith barney,pacific,and ge pending binding arbitration.
the browns appeal from the district court order compelling arbitration and staying proceedings.appellees contend that this court does not have jurisdiction to hear the browns appeal.as always,we have jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction.cerveceria cuauhtemoc moctezuma de.beverage,cir.
section b of the faa forbids appeals of interlocutory orders granting a stay under section or directing arbitration to proceed under section however,a final decision with respect to an arbitration is appealable under section a.a decision is considered final under the faa if it ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing more for the court to do but execute the judgment.green tree fin.randolph,d.
in this case,the district court granted the sole remedy sought by the plaintiffs in the federal order compelling arbitration.although the district court did not dismiss the case,there was nothing left for the court to do but execute the judgment.see am.heritage life ins.orr,cir holding that the district court decision was final and appealable where it ordered arbitration,stayed proceedings,and closed the case.under green tree,the order compelling arbitration in the federal actions ended the litigation in federal court on the merits and was a final appealable decision under a.see sphere drake ins.plc marine towing,cir the civil action was an independent proceeding brought solely to test arbitrability and stay the various law suits.the arbitration order amounts to a final disposition in this context and ends the litigation.mcdermott int l,underwriters at lloyds,cir generally,if the only issue before the court is the dispute arbitrability,a court decision on that issue constitutes a final decision.
appellees argue that the stay in this case rendered the order under b.see b specifying that an appeal may not be taken from an interlocutory order granting a stay under.that it stayed the browns actions within its jurisdiction is,however,of no moment unless the stay was of proceedings before the district court under.here,the district court did not state the authority for its stay,and it is impossible to discern from the record whether the district court thought its stay was issued pursuant to section.although the only authority cited in the parties motions was section,the court terse statement that it was staying the browns actions against all the defendants within its jurisdiction is subject to multiple plausible interpretations 
we must speculate upon the authority for the stay based upon brief language in the order,the numerous overlapping and multifarious motions of the parties,and our interpretation of the voluminous district court filings in three separate that have been consolidated and separated,removed and remanded.under such circumstances,remand to the district court for clarification is often required.see,joseph city of new orleans,cir remanding to the district court to clarify its order where such clarification was needed to determine appellate jurisdiction.
remand is unnecessary in this case.based upon our independent review of the record,we conclude that the stay could not have been issued pursuant to.see gulf guar.life ins.life,cir reviewing the district court arbitration order and the record to determine appellate jurisdiction in the matter of legel,braswell gov t sec,cir.unit b where a district court fails to make necessary findings,a remand for entry of such findings is the usual recourse for an appellate court however,where all of the issues on appeal may be fairly resolved from the record presented,a remand may not be required.that section,by its terms,does not authorize a federal court to enjoin ongoing state as the remanded state federal proceedings.and,furthermore,the record discloses that there was nothing left for the district court to stay in the federal actions after it remanded the state action and ordered the parties to the arbitration table.unless the district court was staying some undefined or future proceedings in the federal actions,its stay order could have only applied to actions against the appellees in the remanded state action such a stay could not be properly issued pursuant to section 
we hold that the district court did not issue a section stay and,furthermore,that the arbitration order is a final decision under green tree and a.accordingly,the order is appealable.
having determined our jurisdiction on appeal,we turn to the browns contention that the district court erred by a exercising jurisdiction over the federal actions b refusing to abstain from exercising jurisdiction c ruling that the arbitration agreement is valid and binding and d ruling that the browns claims against pacific and ge are arbitrable.
the browns assert that the district court erred in denying their motion to dismiss the federal actions because holt is an indispensable party whose joinder would destroy diversity jurisdiction we review the denial of a motion to dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party for an abuse of discretion.hs,wingate,cir.
under rule,a person subject to process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction must be joined if 
in the person absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties,or the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest or ii leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest.
a.if a person who qualifies under rule a can not be made a party because,for example,joinder would destroy jurisdiction,a federal court must determine whether that person is indispensable.in making this determination,the court should consider 
first,to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties second,the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided third,whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate fourth,whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.
b.when assessing these factors,the relevant inquiry is whether in equity and good conscience the action shall proceed among the parties before it,or should be dismissed,the absent person being thus regarded as indispensable.see pulitzer,cir noting that the rule inquiry is highly practical and.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that holt is not an indispensable party under rule b.the threat of piecemeal,inconsistent litigation of claims and issues,the browns primary concern,is insufficiently prejudicial to render a party indispensable under rule given the preference for arbitration under the faa.tools mason,cir see doctor,distajo,cir noting that any prejudice from piecemeal litigation is overcome by the strong bias in favor of arbitration.furthermore,the browns fear that the federal and state courts will reach conflicting interpretations of the arbitration clauses themselves does not present the degree of prejudice necessary to support a conclusion that holt is an indispensable party.painewebber,cohen,cir see,edgewater,cir refusing to find an absent party indispensable where the only danger is inconsistent judgments on the arbitration issue.given the slight risk of prejudice,consideration of the extent to which any prejudice can be reduced or eliminated,rule b second factor,is largely unnecessary.see cohen,at.as to the third factor under rule b,requiring arbitration of these claims in accordance with the arbitration agreement,while allowing a state court to pronounce upon the issue of arbitrability,does not render the potential judgment inadequate.id.finally,although the state court may be able to provide an adequate alternative remedy,such availability is insufficient reason for deciding that an faa action should not proceed,at.
the browns argue that the district court should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction over the federal actions.they assert that the district court misapplied the abstention doctrine set forth in colorado river water conservation district united states,d.we apply a standard of review in abstention cases.although we review a district court abstention ruling for abuse of discretion,we review de novo whether the requirements of a particular abstention doctrine are satisfied.nationwide mut.ins.unauthorized practice of law,cir.
under the colorado river doctrine,a court may abstain from a case under exceptional circumstances.kelly,cont l common,cir there are six factors for determining whether exceptional circumstances exist assumption by either state or federal court over a res relative inconvenience of the fora avoidance of piecemeal litigation order in which jurisdiction was obtained by the concurrent fora extent federal law provides the rules of decision on the merits and adequacy of the state proceedings in protecting the rights of the party invoking federal jurisdiction.stewart,at see.river,at.moses cone,at.t he decision whether to dismiss a federal action because of parallel litigation does not rest on a mechanical checklist,but on a careful balancing of the important factors as they apply in a given case,with the balance heavily weighted in favor of the exercise of jurisdiction.moses cone,at.see black sea,united heritage,cir similar.
the browns sole argument in favor of abstention is that the state court may decide that the case against holt is not arbitrable after the district court decided that the claims against smith barney are arbitrable.they assert that the possibility of piecemeal litigation,the third factor in the abstention analysis,required the district court to abstain from the exercise of jurisdiction.we found a similar argument unconvincing in tools.in that case,the argued that abstention was appropriate where certain state defendants would not participate in the arbitration because they were neither parties to the federal actions nor the arbitration agreement.we expressed doubt that the state court would determine the issue of arbitrability differently from the federal court and also found that some piecemeal litigation is sometimes the inevitable result of a congressional policy strongly favoring arbitration.tools,at.
the browns attempt to distinguish this case from tools.they argue that abstention is warranted where the state court arbitrability determination may affect a party to the arbitration agreement,not a as in tools.they assert that moses cone only condones piecemeal litigation where one of the parties to the underlying dispute is not a party the arbitration agreement and that tools did not decide this issue differently.
abstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is the exception,not the rule.river,at.it is now that the faa declared a national policy in favor of arbitration.mun.energy agency of big rivers,cir.congress intent was to move the parties to an arbitrable dispute out of court and into arbitration as quickly and easily as possible.moses cone,at.allowing a federal court to order arbitration,even where a state court may construe an arbitration clause differently,is fully consistent with this established congressional intent.this conclusion is not altered simply because a state court arbitrability decision may involve a party to the arbitration agreement.see cohen,at stating that the desire to avoid litigating a single issue,including arbitrability,in multiple fora is insufficient to overcome the strong federal policy supporting arbitration.indeed,it would appear antithetical to the faa recognized purpose to require a district court to decline jurisdiction over a properly filed faa action simply because a party to an arbitrable contract can not be joined in the federal action.see safety casualty squibb,cir noting that,under moses cone,the possibility of piecemeal litigation must give way to the overriding federal policy to give effect to arbitration agreements.the browns provide no reasons in law or policy for favoring the distinction they propose,and we see no reason for carving out such a distinction in this case.
even if the district court properly exercised jurisdiction,the browns assert that the district court erred by compelling arbitration of their claims.they contend that their consent to arbitrate was vitiated by fraud and error and,furthermore,that the arbitration clause itself is a contract of adhesion we review the grant of a motion to compel arbitration de novo.webb investacorp,cir bailey,at.
in adjudicating a motion to compel arbitration under the faa,courts generally conduct a inquiry.webb,at.the court must first determine whether the parties agreed to arbitrate the dispute.id.at citing mitsubishi motors soler,d.this determination involves two considerations whether there is a valid agreement to arbitrate between the parties and whether the dispute in question falls within the scope of that arbitration agreement.id.the court then must determine if any legal constraints foreclose arbitration of those claims.mitsubishi motors,at.
on appeal,the browns challenge only the validity of their consent to arbitrate.challenges to the validity of arbitration agreements upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract can be divided into two types.buckeye check cashing,cardegna,d.the first challenges the validity of the arbitration agreement itself the second challenges the contract as a whole.id.a federal court decides challenges to the making of an agreement to arbitrate.prima paint flood conklin,d.conversely,a challenge to the validity of a contract as a whole,and not specifically to the arbitration clause,must go to the arbitrator.buckeye check cashing.at.
although the browns argue fraud and error,they do not distinguish between their attacks on the validity of the client agreements and the arbitration clauses themselves.they assert only that they would not have entered into the client agreements containing the arbitration clauses if holt had not misrepresented the terms of their investments.where claims of error,fraud,or unconscionability do not specifically address the arbitration agreement itself,they are properly addressed by the arbitrator,not a federal court.primerica life ins.brown,cir rojas tk commc n,cir.accordingly,we may not address whether fraud or error vitiates the browns contract.
we may,however,address the browns argument that the arbitration clauses themselves are contracts of adhesion and,therefore,unenforceable.the browns rely primarily upon sutton steel supply,bellsouth mobility,so d,and simpson grimes,so d.the louisiana supreme court has,however,recently abrogated sutton steel and simpson in aguillard auction management,so d.in aguillard,the court attempted to resolve a split among the circuits regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements contained within consumer standard form contracts under a contract of adhesion analysis id.at.it declared 
in summation,a contract is one of adhesion when either its form,print,or unequal terms call into question the consent of the party and it is demonstrated that the contract is unenforceable,due to lack of consent or error which vitiates consent.accordingly,even if a contract is standard in form and printed in small font,if it does not call into question the party consent and if it is not demonstrated that the party did not consent or his consent is vitiated by error,the contract is not a contract of adhesion.
id.at.applying these principles,the louisiana supreme court found no evidence that the plaintiff did not consent.the plaintiff in aguillard signed the document and,according to the court,a party who signs a written instrument is presumed to know its contents.id.at.the court also found no evidence that inequality in the parties respective bargaining positions vitiated consent because the plaintiff could have avoided arbitration and the contractual provisions as a whole by simply not signing the agreement.id.finally,the court examined the arbitration agreement itself and found that the lower court,in following sutton steel and simpson,erred as a matter of law in declaring the arbitration clause adhesionary because,inter alia,the print was not unreasonably small,the contract was only two pages,and the contract was mutually burdensome.id.at.
the arbitration clauses in the browns client agreements are not unconscionable and the district court did not err in finding them valid.as in aguillard,the browns were not forced to agree to the terms of those clauses.they could have avoided arbitration by not engaging smith barney services.there is nothing exceptional or burdensome about these clauses,and there is no reason to believe that the browns did not knowingly and willingly accept their terms.
provided the agreements are valid,the browns do not dispute the arbitrability of their claims against smith barney.they argue,however,that the district court erred by estopping the browns from asserting that the lack of a written arbitration agreement precluded arbitration of their claims against ge and pacific.we review for abuse of discretion the district court use of equitable estoppel.grigson creative artists agency,llc,cir.
although arbitration is a matter of contract that generally binds only signatories,a party to an arbitration agreement may be equitably estopped from litigating its claims against in court and may be ordered to arbitration.id.at citing ms dealer serv.franklin,cir in grigson,we held that a to an arbitration agreement can compel arbitration when the signatory to a written agreement containing an arbitration clause must rely on the terms of the written agreement in asserting its claims against a or when the signatory raises allegations of substantially interdependent and concerted misconduct by both the and one or more signatories to the contract.id.at.we reasoned that equity does not allow a party to seek to hold the liable pursuant to duties imposed by the agreement,which contains an arbitration provision,but,on the other hand,deny arbitration applicability because the defendant is a.id.at see.mut.fin.group,llc bailey,cir stating that a plaintiff should not be able to claim the benefit of a contract and simultaneously avoid its burdens.t he result in grigson and similar cases makes sense because the parties resisting arbitration had expressly agreed to arbitrate claims of the very type that they asserted against the nonsignatory.bridas gov t of,cir.
although close,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the browns were estopped under grigson second prong from asserting that a lack of a written arbitration agreement precluded arbitration.the district court finding that there was no way to bring actions against ge and pacific without considering the actions of smith barney and patrick holt,is not patently incorrect whether and how ge and pacific defrauded or breached duties owed to the browns depends,in some part,upon the nature of tortious acts allegedly committed by holt and smith that would be covered by the arbitration well as any tortious acts by ge and pacific.see hill ge power,cir finding no abuse of discretion where a plaintiff alleges interdependent and concerted misconduct,while denying that its claims are intertwined with an agreement containing an arbitration clause.as the browns fail to allege tortious acts by ge and pacific that are separate and apart from holt,we can only conclude that the complaint asserts concerted misconduct by all parties.to constitute an abuse of discretion,the district court decision must be either premised on an erroneous application of the law,or on an assessment of the evidence that is clearly erroneous.grigson,at.by this measure the district court did not abuse its discretion.hill,at.
for the reasons stated,we affirm the district court order staying proceedings and compelling arbitration of the browns disputes against smith barney,pacific,and ge.
