an indigent prisoner initiating a bona fide civil action has a right of meaningful access to the courts to prosecute the action.wantuch davis th,d wantuch.trial courts must therefore ensure indigent prisoner litigants are afforded meaningful access to the courts apollo gyaami th,d apollo.among the ways in which meaningful access may be secured is by conduct ing proceedings by telephone.ibid.in this case,we conclude that before a trial court may dismiss an action on the ground that an indigent prisoner has failed to appear telephonically at proceedings in the case,the trial court must find,based on facts in the record,that the prisoner has willfully failed to avail himself of the right to appear telephonically.
in the published portion of this opinion,we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing the action on the ground that jameson failed to appear telephonically at a case management conference and at a subsequent hearing on an order to show cause.the record clearly indicates that jameson notified the trial court on numerous occasions that prison personnel were not allowing him to communicate telephonically with the court,yet the record does not indicate that the trial court made any inquiry into jameson contentions.further,the record does not contain any facts demonstrating that jameson failure to appear telephonically at the hearings was willful.on the contrary,the record establishes that jameson repeatedly made clear his desire to participate in all court proceedings and informed the court that he was not being allowed to do so.under these circumstances,we conclude that the trial court erred in dismissing the action based on jameson failure to appear telephonically.
with respect to the remainder of jameson contentions,in the unpublished portions of this opinion,we conclude that the trial court did not err in failing to enter a default judgment against desta,setting aside a clerk default,granting desta leave to file a verified answer to jameson complaint,or refusing to grant jameson request to recover for paralegal fees as a cost on appeal stemming from jameson finally,jameson claim that the trial judge erred in failing to disqualify himself is not cognizable on appeal.
accordingly,we affirm both the trial court refusal to enter judgment in favor of jameson,and the trial court refusal to award jameson paralegal fees.we reverse the trial court dismissal of the action,and remand the matter for further proceedings.

governing law and standard of review 
a prisoner has a statutory right to initiate civil actions,subd.d.in the case of an indigent prisoner initiating a bona fide civil action,this statutory right carries with it a right of meaningful access to the courts to prosecute the action.wantuch,supra,th at,d.there are many ways by which a trial court may ensure that a prisoner has meaningful access to the courts,including conduct ing status and settlement conferences,hearings on motions and other pretrial proceedings by telephone wantuch,supra,th at,d.a trial court is to exercise its sound discretion in determining the appropriate method by which to ensure meaningful access to the court.id.at,d.the exercise of the trial court discretion will not be overturned on appeal unless it appears that there has been a miscarriage of justice.citation.ibid.
applying this law,the court of appeal in wantuch concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion in dismissing the action.the wantuch court reasoned 
wantuch failed to appear at a status conference of which he had notice.as a result of his nonappearance,the trial court ordered a further status conference and a hearing on an order to show cause for failure to prosecute.wantuch informed the trial court he was serving a lengthy state prison sentence and requested appointment of counsel or transfer to court.wantuch did not appear at the further status conference and hearing on the order to show cause.the trial court struck wantuch pleadings and entered judgment against him.
in this case,the trial court imposed terminating sanctions solely because of wantuch failure to appear at the status conference.wantuch nonappearance was not wil l ful,but was solely the result of his imprisonment.the status conference could have been conducted by written correspondence or by telephone.in all other respects,wantuch had diligently prosecuted the matter.he had timely filed and served the complaint,discussed settlement,answered the,sought entry of default where appropriate,filed motions,propounded discovery,moved to compel discovery and filed an memorandum.the case was little more than a year old.we conclude the trial court abused its discretion.wantuch,supra,th at,d.
the wantuch court reversed the judgment and remanded the matter.wantuch,supra,th at,d.the wantuch court stated that,although it appeared from the record that the appellant was indigent,and that the lawsuit constituted a bona fide action involving his property interests,the trial court was to definitively determine these issues on remand.ibid.assuming that the trial court were to make affirmative findings on these issues,the wantuch court ordered the trial court to determine the appropriate remedy or remedies to effectuate wantuch constitutional and statutory rights of meaningful access to the courts to prosecute his complaint ibid.
in apollo,supra,th,d,the court considered whether a trial court failed to ensure an incarcerated appellant right to meaningful access to the court prior to entering judgment against him.in apollo,the trial court held a hearing on the respondent summary judgment motion.the court of appeal described that hearing as follows 
the reporter transcript reflects that respondent attorney appeared in person on her behalf,and that a call was made to the prison so that appellant could appear telephonically.when the court asked whether appellant was on the telephone,an unidentified speaker from the department of corrections and rehabilitation advised that t he inmate is coming back from his housing unit with his documentation.the following exchange then occurred 
the court okay.well.we are going to proceed.it is now minutes after.and if he is late,that is not our fault.all right.there was a tentative ruling in this matter yesterday it is my understanding that there has not been any written opposition,proper written opposition filed to this motion is that correct 
respondent attorney that correct.
the court all right.the tentative ruling is adopted.the motion for summary judgment is granted on all three grounds.id.at,d.
applying wantuch,the apollo court concluded,t he trial court abused its discretion in granting respondent summary judgment motion and entering judgment in favor of all defendants without first ensuring that appellant right to meaningful court access to prosecute bona fide civil claims was being protected.apollo,supra,th at,d.as in wantuch,in remanding the matter,the apollo court stated,i f on remand the trial court determines that appellant is indigent and has a bona fide claim,the trial court must then consider what remedies are available to protect appellant right of meaningful access to the courts.apollo,supra,th at,d.
