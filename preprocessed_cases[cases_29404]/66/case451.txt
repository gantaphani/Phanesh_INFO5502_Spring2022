introduction 
plaintiff sued two doctors and a hospital for medical malpractice.the trial court granted separate motions for summary judgment in favor of one of the doctors,michael chin,and the hospital,tenet healthsystem heritage,dba rancho springs medical center tenet.the other defendant doctor,tien gu,is not a party to this appeal.
plaintiff appeals from the judgments entered in favor of chin and tenet.she contends that the trial court did not properly apply the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur in ruling on the motions for summary judgment.we affirm.
we conclude that both motions were properly granted.plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of material fact that the defendants were negligent,or caused her injuries.in this opinion we address the quantum of evidence necessary for a plaintiff to raise triable issues of material fact,in opposing a motion for summary judgment in a medical malpractice action,where the plaintiff relies on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.
facts and procedural history 
background 
on may,plaintiff was admitted to rancho springs medical center where she underwent certain procedures including anterior and posterior repair.gu performed the operation and chin assisted.tenet provided the operating room,surgical equipment,and surgical staff for the operation.
plaintiff alleged in her complaint that chin,gu,and tenet were negligent in the procedures performed,and caused her to sustain injuries and pain to her right elbow,right shoulder,right arm,and long thoracic nerve damage.tenet and chin filed separate motions for summary judgment.plaintiff argues that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies,because her upper extremity injuries could not have occurred but for the negligence of one of the defendants.
evidence on chin motion 
chin submitted the declaration of albert yellin,in support of his motion.yellin declaration was the sole supporting evidence for each of eight purported undisputed facts.
yellin stated that he was board certified in general surgery,and that he had reviewed plaintiff medical records.based on his review,he noted that plaintiff was a female at the time of the surgery,with chief complaints of frequent urination,nocturia,and bladder leakage with coughing,sneezing,and walking.she also complained of lower abdominal pain and urgency.she was unable to complete bowel movements and had anal incontinence at work or with any kind of activity.during the operation,plaintiff was placed in a lithotomy position.allen stirrups were utilized in the high position and both upper extremities were secured to an arm board.thereafter,gu,the operating surgeon,performed an anterior and posterior repair,dermis sling,bladder neck suspension,cystoscopy,suprapubic catheter insertion,anal sphincteroplasty,and perineoplasty.
yellin opined that upon review of the records,chin,as the assistant surgeon,performed his responsibilities in an appropriate fashion.he opined that chin conduct complied with the standard of care for assistant surgeons and that chin conduct did not cause injury or damage to plaintiff.
in opposition,plaintiff submitted her own declaration.she did not proffer any expert witness declarations or any other evidence.she stated that during the entire course of the surgery she was unconscious as a result of general anesthesia.she further stated that defendants had exclusive control and custody of her person and all instrumentalities used during and after the surgery.she awoke following the surgery with severe pain in her right elbow,right shoulder,and right arm.the pain became worse with time and spread to her neck,back,and hip.she further declared that p rior to the surgery by defendants,i had not previously suffered injury to,nor had i experienced any significant pain in my right shoulder or arm.
on this record,plaintiff argues that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies,thereby preventing entry of summary judgment in favor of chin.
evidence on tenet motion 
tenet submitted the declaration of evelyn fraser,in support of its motion.fraser indicated that she had reviewed plaintiff complaint and relevant medical records.she opined that the treatment rendered to plaintiff by tenet nursing and nonphysician staff was within the applicable standard of care.she further stated that no act or omission of the nursing and nonphysician staff caused or contributed to any claimed injury to the plaintiff.
in opposition,plaintiff relied on her previously filed declaration in opposition to chin motion.she also submitted the declaration of gregory rosen,who is board certified in obstetrics,gynecology,and infertility and reproductive endocrinology.rosen stated that he had reviewed the declarations of fraser and yellin.after setting forth his understanding as to the nature of the operation and his familiarity with it,rosen opined as follows 
i do not here opine whether,in fact,the plaintiff has actually sustained any injuries,when such injuries may have been sustained or what the source or cause of those injuries may be.
the purpose of this declaration is to render a medical opinion that the nature and type of injuries which the plaintiff claims to have experienced and which she alleges that she began to suffer immediately following the surgery,are not the type of injuries or complications normally expected or ordinarily considered to be risks related to or associated with the surgery that was performed.
in other words,surgery in the pelvic region including anterior and posterior repair as was performed in this case should have no impact upon the neck and shoulder area and should not involve potential injury or damage to the long thoracic nerve.
the simple fact is that the plaintiff patient was unconscious by a general anesthetic and suffered an injury that is of a type that would not normally occur as a result of the surgery performed unless there were some negligent conduct,substandard handling or treatment or some other intervening action or agent during the surgery or immediately prior to or thereafter at a time when the patient was in the exclusive custody,care,and control of the doctors and hospital staff.
in reply,tenet argued that plaintiff did not adequately address the elements of res ipsa loquitur and that plaintiff submitted no evidence that the injury was caused by an instrumentality within defendants exclusive control.tenet further argued that plaintiff did not establish that she suffered any injury or damage as a result of tenet negligence.
on this record,as in the record on chin motion,plaintiff argues that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur should be applied,thereby preventing entry of summary judgment in favor of tenet.
discussion 
standard of review 
first,and generally,from commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.a defendant bears the burden of persuasion that one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense thereto.citations.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.
second,and generally,the party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact a prima facie showing is one that is sufficient to support the position of the party in question.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
third,and generally,how the parties moving for,and opposing,summary judgment may each carry their burden of persuasion production depends on which would bear what burden of proof at trial thus,if a defendant moves for summary judgment against a plaintiff who would bear the burden of proof by a preponderance of evidence at trial,he must present evidence that would require a reasonable trier of fact not to find any underlying material fact more likely than,he would not be entitled to judgment as a matter of law,but would have to present his evidence to a trier of fact.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.
in determining the propriety of a summary judgment,the trial court is limited to facts shown by the evidentiary materials submitted,as well as those admitted and uncontested in the pleadings.citations.the court must consider all evidence set forth in the parties papers,and summary judgment is to be granted if all the papers submitted show there is no triable issue of material fact in the action,thereby entitling the moving party to judgment as a matter of law.citation.committee to save the beverly highlands homes beverly highlands homes th,d.s ummary judgment shall not be granted based on inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence,if contradicted by other inferences or evidence,which raise a triable issue as to any material fact.code civ,subd.c aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.

b.the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur 
the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur creates a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence,subd.b.a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence require s the trier of fact to assume the existence of the presumed fact unless the defendant introduces evidence to the contrary.citations.brown poway unified school dist.cal th,d,brown.where the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies,t he presumed fact is that a proximate cause of the plaintiff injury was some negligent conduct on the part of the defendant.ibid.
at trial,before the presumption arises,the plaintiff must present some substantial evidence of three conditions the injury must be the kind which ordinarily does not occur in the absence of someone negligence the injury was caused by an instrumentality in the exclusive control of the defendant and the injury was not due to any voluntary action or contribution on the part of the plaintiff.brown,supra,cal th at,d,kerr bock cal d.
as a general rule,res ipsa loquitur applies where the occurrence of the injury is of such a nature that it can be said,in the light of past experience,that it probably was the result of negligence by someone and that the defendant is probably the person who is responsible.in determining whether such probabilities exist with regard to a particular occurrence,the courts have relied both on common knowledge and on expert testimony.brown,supra,cal th at,d.
medical malpractice 
i n any medical malpractice action,the plaintiff must establish the duty of the professional to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the professional negligence.citation.hanson grode th,d.
the standard of care against which the acts of a physician are to be measured is a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of experts it presents the basic issue in a malpractice action and can only be proved by their testimony citations,unless the conduct required by the particular circumstances is within the common knowledge of the layman.citations.the common knowledge exception is principally limited to situations in which the plaintiff can invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur,when a layperson is able to say as a matter of common knowledge and observation that the consequences of professional treatment were not such as ordinarily would have followed if due care had been exercised.citations.the classic example,of course,is the revealing a scalpel left in the patient body following surgery.citation.otherwise,expert evidence is conclusive and can not be disregarded.citations.flowers torrance memorial hospital medical center cal th,d.
d.the elements of res ipsa loquitur were not shown on either summary judgment motion 
plaintiff contends that res ipsa loquitur,or a presumption of negligence causing injury,arose on both summary judgment motions.she argues that defendants expert witness declarations were insufficient to overcome the presumption of negligence.she notes that defendants experts did not explain the unusual result as required by case law and,in fact left in question the cause of the injury.therefore,she argues,the burden never shifted to her to produce evidence of a triable issue of material fact.we do not agree with plaintiff analysis.
chin and tenet met their initial burden of producing evidence that they did not breach the standard of care and did not cause plaintiff injuries.the burden then shifted to plaintiff to raise a triable issue of material fact on the issues of negligence and causation.plaintiff could have met this burden either by producing direct evidence of each defendant negligence and causation,or producing evidence of the three elements of res ipsa loquitur.
plaintiff did not attempt to produce direct evidence of negligence and causation.she also failed to produce evidence of the first and second elements of res ipsa loquitur,on either motion.
plaintiff contends that it is within common knowledge that a person should not develop injury to their neck and upper extremities as a result of an operation focused in the pelvic area.therefore,she argues,the evidence showed that at least one of the defendants must have been or probably was negligent and caused her injuries.we disagree.
this is not a case where a foreign object was left in plaintiff body following an operation,for which there is no explanation other than that someone failed to exercise due care.there can be numerous etiologies for plaintiff neck and upper extremity injuries which are totally unrelated to the surgery and which do not suggest the probability that one of the defendants or anyone else was negligent.therefore,the common knowledge exception does not apply.
plaintiff lay declaration,wherein she stated she awoke after the surgery with pain in her upper extremities,was therefore insufficient to establish either the first or the second element of res ipsa loquitur,on both motions.indeed,plaintiff declaration does not negate the presence of neck and upper extremity problems before the surgery.plaintiff merely declared,i had not previously experienced any significant pain in my right shoulder or arm.
additionally,assuming that plaintiff neck and upper extremity problems arose during the surgery,it does not suggest a probability that one or more of the defendants was negligent.many problems could have arisen during the surgery which were not the result of someone negligence.
on tenet motion,plaintiff submitted the declaration of rosen.rosen did not opine that plaintiff injuries were of a kind that do not ordinarily occur in the absence of someone negligence.nor did he opine that plaintiff injuries were caused by an agent or instrumentality in defendants exclusive control.
rosen said,the nature and type of injuries which the plaintiff claims to have experienced and which she alleges that she began to suffer immediately following the surgery,are not the type of injuries or complications normally expected or ordinarily considered to be risks related to or associated with the surgery that was performed.this statement merely indicates that plaintiff injuries were not a normal risk of the surgery that was performed.it does not suggest that plaintiff injuries do not ordinarily occur in the absence of someone negligence.
rosen also said,plaintiff suffered an injury that would not normally occur as a result of the surgery performed unless there were some negligent conduct,substandard handling or treatment or some other intervening action or agent during the surgery or immediately prior to or thereafter at a time when the plaint
