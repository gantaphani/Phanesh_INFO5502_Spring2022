petitioner,josphine gitau,appeals the board of immigration appeals bia march,order denying her motion to reopen and reconsider her removal proceedings and rescind the immigration judge ij in absentia removal order.this appeal contains a great deal of he said,she said as to why gitau did not appear at a february,removal hearing.applying our abuse of discretion standard to the bia denial,we find there was none.
background 
notice to appear 
gitau is a citizen of kenya who entered the united states on or about november,as a nonimmigrant visitor with authorization to remain in the united states until january.gitau did not depart on that date.on august,she married kenneth kurtz.kurtz filed an petition for alien relative on april,and gitau then filed an adjustment of status application.however,kurtz withdrew the application and thus the ins denied gitau adjustment of status application in september.immediately thereafter,the ins started removal proceedings against gitau,serving her with a notice to appear as an alien who remained for a time longer than permitted.on november,gitau,represented by former counsel samuel omwenga,appeared at a bond hearing in kansas city,missouri.
ij order of removal in absentia 
in april,kurtz filed a second on gitau behalf but kurtz died before it was adjudicated.thereafter,gitau appeared at two hearings may and september at which her attorney,omwenga,appeared telephonically.at the september hearing,gitau removal case was continued until february.gitau and omwenga were orally notified of the february,hearing date.before february,the pending petition was administratively closed due to kurtz death on june.gitau filed an widower petition on august,which was approved on march,however,gitau and omwenga both failed to appear at the february,merits hearing on her removal proceedings and the ij ordered gitau removed to kenya in absentia.
first motion to reopen before the ij 
through omwenga,gitau filed a timely motion to reopen removal proceedings with the ij on march,based on a claim of exceptional circumstances.in that motion,gitau claimed that neither she nor omwenga received written notice of the february,hearing,and,further,that the ins officer told gitau upon inquiry in december that her case was closed.gitau misunderstood the officer to mean her removal proceedings when,in fact,the officer likely conveyed to gitau that the pending case was closed following her husband death.further,gitau claimed in that motion that she also misunderstood a conversation she had with omwenga in december where he said not to worry.she claims this statement by omwenga also led her to believe that her removal proceedings were closed and that she need not attend the february,hearing.on may,the ij denied gitau motion to reopen,noting that regardless of any misunderstandings gitau had in december,both gitau and omwenga were orally notified of the february.
appeal to bia 
gitau retained new counsel and timely appealed the ij denial of her motion to reopen on june.there,gitau alleged that exceptional circumstances,namely omwenga ineffective assistance of counsel,caused her failure to appear at the february,removal hearing.in the affidavit in support of this appeal,gitau claimed that omwenga led her to believe that she did not have to attend the last removal hearing,and,in fact,told her not to go to the february,hearing.she also included a bar complaint that she filed against omwenga,as well as copies of bar complaints against omwenga filed by others.omwenga responded to these allegations by stating that he never told gitau not to attend the hearing and that,in fact,he waited for a call from the ij on february,but he was never contacted to appear telephonically.
on december,the bia dismissed gitau appeal,again emphasizing that both gitau and omwenga were given oral notice of the february hearing and that written notice was also sent to omwenga.the bia also noted that in the appeal,gitau inconsistently claimed that she misunderstood omwenga to say that she did not need to appear,and that he outright told her not to appear.the bia held that gitau failed to establish exceptional circumstances for her failure to appeal.
second motion to before the bia 
gitau filed a second motion to reopen and motion to reconsider on january,offering new evidence comprised of an affidavit by kathryn weber,an attorney who listened to tapes of gitau immigration hearings.weber surmised that the ij never said omwenga could appear telephonically at the february hearing,intimating that omwenga was ineffective for not appearing in person.the bia denied gitau motions on march,noting that while weber affidavit might show omwenga dereliction,there was still no evidence that omwenga advised gitau outright not to go to the hearing.
ii.discussion 
we review decisions denying motions to reopen or reconsider for an abuse of discretion.habchy gonzales,cir.an agency abuses its discretion when it makes a decision without rational explanation,departs from established policies,invidiously discriminates against a particular race or group,fails to consider all factors presented by the alien,or distorts important aspects of the claim.id.at.
on appeal,gitau places great emphasis on the precedential application of in re,bia.in,the bia held that a counsel erroneous instruction not to appear at a hearing could constitute exceptional circumstances for missing a hearing.id.at.the application of in this case,however,is limited by the bia determination that here,omwenga did not tell gitau not to attend the hearing,as gitau claims,but rather that gitau just misunderstood what omwenga was telling her.further,in,the petitioner former counsel,whose employee told the petitioner not to attend the hearing,affied to that very fact,unlike the current situation before this panel.id.at.we can not find that gitau was blatantly misled regarding her need to appear at the scheduled hearing,as was the alien in.id.
gitau further argues that the bia effectively made an adverse credibility finding against her,which is true.she claims this finding is not supported by specific and cogent reasons and is not anchored in the record.gitau may be correct about the fact that the bia did not provide many reasons why it rejected gitau version of the events,but it clearly held that gitau was inconsistent in her appeal documents as to why she missed the february hearing,which satisfactorily supports the bia determination.gitau reminds us that the initial affidavit stating that gitau misunderstood omwenga,and not that she was directed by omwenga not to attend the hearing,was submitted while omwenga was still gitau counsel,implying that omwenga fashioned a affidavit on gitau behalf.this may explain some of the inconsistencies.nonetheless,there are inconsistencies,and we can not say that the bia abused its discretion.further,as the bia pointed out,even though weber affidavit might support a conclusion that gitau attorney had many shortcomings,it does not establish that omwenga advised gitau to avoid the february hearing.regardless of how we interpret the evidence amassed by gitau before the bia,there is not enough to support a reversal in the face of the abuse of discretion standard.
iii.conclusion 
all in all,even if we conclude that omwenga failed to adequately represent gitau,we have no basis to find that the bia abused its discretion in upholding the ij in abstentia order.we therefore deny the petition.
i respectfully dissent.the board of immigration appeals bia did not give specific and cogent reasons for crediting lawyer samuel omwenga version of events and discrediting those provided by josphine gitau.see celaj gonzales,cir indicating adverse credibility determinations must be supported by specific and cogent reasons for disbelief.as such,the bia abused its discretion by failing to consider all factors presented by gitau,and distorting important aspects of her claim.see habchy gonzales,cir setting forth the circumstances under which this court may find the bia abused its discretion.
between the two versions of what transpired regarding gitau attendance at the hearing scheduled for february,she is more credible than is
