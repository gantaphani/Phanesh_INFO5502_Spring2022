in light of the florida supreme court decision in galen of florida.braniff,so d,does a physician predelivery notice to his or her patient of the plan and his or her participation in the plan satisfy the notice requirements of section,florida statutes,if the hospital where the delivery takes place fails to provide notice of any kind 
all children,so d at bayfront,so d at 
we answer the certified question in the negative and quash the second district decisions in both all children and bayfront.we hold that in order to satisfy the notice requirement of section,florida statutes,both participating physicians and hospitals with participating physicians on staff must provide obstetrical patients with notice of their participation in the plan 
background 
the florida neurological injury compensation plan nica or the plan was established by the florida legislature in as a means to alleviate the high costs of medical malpractice insurance for physicians practicing obstetrics.stat.the legislature found that obstetricians were among the most severely affected by the current malpractice problems and that the costs of neurological injury claims were extremely high.id.consequently,the legislature created the nica fund to provide compensation,on a basis,for neurological injuries.id.because nica remedies are limited,obstetric patients subject to limited compensation under nica are entitled to receive notice of their rights and limitations under the plan.stat.galen,so d at.additionally,in order to claim immunity from civil suits under nica,health care providers must provide notice to those patients.see galen,so d at bd.of regents athey,so d,dca.in particular,the notice provision provides 
each hospital with a participating physician on its staff and each participating physician,other than residents,assistant residents,and interns deemed to be participating physicians under c,under the florida neurological injury compensation plan shall provide notice to the obstetrical patients thereof as to the limited alternative for neurological injuries.such notice shall be provided on forms furnished by the association and shall include a clear and concise explanation of a patient rights and limitations under the plan.
stat.emphasis supplied.a participating physician is defined as 
a physician licensed in florida to practice medicine who practices obstetrics or performs obstetrical services either full time or part time and who had paid or was exempted from payment at the time of the injury the assessment required for participation in the neurological injury compensation plan for the year in which the injury occurred.
stat.hospital means any hospital licensed in florida.stat.
in the underlying cases,two infants,christopher kocher and courtney lynn glenn,suffered neurological injuries in unrelated incidents.
the kocher case 
in christopher kocher case,the delivering physician had timely provided notice of his participation in the plan,but bayfront medical center bayfront,the hospital where christopher was delivered,did not provide any notice.bayfront med.neurological injury comp.ass n,so d,dca,quashed,so d.christopher died as a result of his injuries,and christopher parents the kochers filed a medical malpractice action against bayfront.id.at.bayfront moved to abate the action,claiming that the kochers must pursue remedies under nica.id.at.the case was submitted to an administrative law judge alj,who concluded that the infant injuries were compensable under nica the physician supplied the required notice but the hospital did not the failure of the hospital to provide notice precluded the application of the exclusivity and immunity provisions of the plan and the kochers could either accept the plan benefits or pursue civil remedies.bayfront,so d at.on appeal,bayfront argued that the purpose of the notice requirement was satisfied and that,consequently,the kochers were limited to the remedies available through the plan,and bayfront was immune from any civil action.id.at.the kochers asserted that they were not limited by nica remedies,due to bayfront failure to fulfill the notice requirement.id.at.the second district agreed with bayfront relying on this court decision in galen,the second district concluded that the notice requirement had been satisfied and that the kochers did not have the right to reject nica remedies and pursue a civil action.bayfront,so d at.specifically,it concluded 
a physician predelivery notice of his participation in the plan satisfies the statutory notice requirement as defined by the florida supreme court in galen,so d.therefore,in the instant case,the statute was satisfied by the notice provided to kocher by her physician.moreover,we agree that a plain reading of the statute does not require notice from bayfront.the statute does not mandate that both the hospital and physician must give notice rather,the statute qualifies which hospitals must give notice.that is,the only hospitals that are statutorily required to give notice are those with a participating physician on staff.although the statute does not define this term,a plain reading of this language suggests that a hospital is required to provide such notice to an obstetrical patient if that patient delivering physician is a plan participant and is also an employee of the hospital,as opposed to a physician who merely enjoys staff privileges at the hospital.nothing in the instant alj amended final order indicates that bayfront is a hospital with a participating physician on staff or that kocher physician is an employee of bayfront.as such,we conclude that bayfront was not statutorily required to provide kocher with additional notice.
id.at.the second district acknowledged that its decision was based on an extension of this court reasoning in galen.therefore,the second district certified the question of great public importance at issue here.id.at.
the glenn case 
like christopher kocher,courtney glenn was born at bayfront medical center and suffered neurological injuries.all children,so d at.after her delivery,courtney received immediate resuscitation and other neonatal care administered by nurses provided to bayfront by all children hospital all children.id.at.courtney parents the glenns subsequently filed a civil suit against the delivering obstetrician personally,the professional partnership to which he belonged,and bayfront.id.at.the glenns settled out of court with the obstetrician,his partnership,and bayfront,and then filed a third amended complaint against all children,claiming that it was negligent in its administration of care.id.the civil action against all children was abated after the trial court determined that,before the suit could proceed,the glenns must obtain an administrative determination of whether courtney had suffered a neurological injury that was compensable under the plan.id.following an administrative hearing,an alj issued a final written order finding that,while the treating obstetrician gave the mother timely notice of his participation in the plan,bayfront did not.id.the alj further found that bayfront failure to give notice was not due to any medical emergency,which would have excused the failure.id.consequently,the alj concluded that,because bayfront failed to give the required statutory notice of its participation in the plan,neither the hospital,the participating physician,nor any other provider such as all children hospital may invoke nica exclusivity to defeat a civil claim.id.the second district reversed,finding that the disposition of the glenns case was controlled by its previous decision in bayfront.all children,so d at therefore,it concluded that 
the notice given by the delivering physician in this was not an employee of the hospital where the infant was sufficient to meet the notice requirements of t
