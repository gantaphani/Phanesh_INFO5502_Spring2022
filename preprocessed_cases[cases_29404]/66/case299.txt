we granted review to consider whether plaintiffs have viable claims as bystanders for negligent infliction of emotional distress arising out of alleged medical malpractice directed to their close relative.we conclude they do not.
facts and procedural background 
this is an action for wrongful death and negligent infliction of emotional distress nied based on medical malpractice.plaintiffs are the adult daughters of decedent nita bird.nita succumbed to cancer on january.defendants are the physicians who treated nita.the superior court granted summary judgment for defendants on both claims,but the court of appeal reversed.in granting review,we limited briefing and argument to the question whether defendants motion for summary judgment was properly granted on plaintiffs claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress.
the very general allegations of plaintiffs complaint do not identify the specific acts underlying their claim for nied.however,the evidence and arguments submitted in connection with the motion for summary judgment reveal that plaintiffs base the claim on the events of november.
on that date,plaintiff janice bird brought her mother nita to the hospital to undergo an outpatient surgical procedure.the goal of the procedure was to insert a venous catheter surgically implanted to facilitate the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents.nita was undergoing chemotherapy because she had six weeks earlier been diagnosed with metastatic ovarian cancer involving many of her internal organs and lymph nodes.nita was taken into the operating room about or janice expected the procedure to take about minutes.after an hour had elapsed,janice asked a hospital volunteer to see why the procedure was taking so long.over the loudspeaker system,janice heard the announcement,t horacic surgeon needed in surgery,stat.janice assumed the call related to nita because she believed all other surgeries had been completed.an hour to an hour and a half later,defendant scott eisenkop came to the waiting room to report to janice.janice remembers him saying that they had more trouble inserting the port a cath than they had anticipated,that when they went to insert it,they thought that they got a bubble in her vein,and they think that she might have had a mild stroke.janice telephoned her sister,plaintiff dayle edgmon,with this news and returned to the waiting room.about,someone told janice that nita was sleeping right now and should be going up to the fifth floor in about an hour.
soon thereafter,janice saw nita being rushed down the hallway to the presume she was going to the ccu critical care unit.she was bright blue.the angle of the bed was like this indicating.her feet were way up in the air,her head was almost touching the ground,there was all these doctors and nurses around there and they running down the hallway,down to that end of the hospital the medical personnel rushed nita into a room and closed the door behind them.janice,who was in the hallway,asked dowds what was happening.dowds went to check and returned with this news from what i can see,janice remembers him saying,i think they nicked an artery or a vein,and it looks like all the blood went into her chest.they going to have to insert a drainage tube into her chest to drain out the fluid,and they trying to pump as much fluids and blood into her to keep her alive until the vascular surgeon gets there.ten or minutes later,janice saw dowds running down the hall with multiple units of blood.
at this point dayle arrived.janice told her briefly what was happening.dowds then told dayle what he had already told janice,namely,that an artery or vein had been nicked and that major surgery would be necessary.shortly thereafter,janice and dayle saw nita being rushed down the hallway to surgery.in dayle words,all of a sudden i saw,i would say,approximately at least doctors and nurses running down the hall with my mother and i remember her head was towards the floor,her feet were up in the air and she was blue.janice description is essentially identical,with the addition that she understood her mother angle as intended to keep the blood moving to the heart.
those are the events on which plaintiffs base their claim for nied.soon thereafter,emergency surgery stopped nita internal bleeding.but plaintiffs do not claim that this subsequent procedure caused them to suffer actionable emotional distress.nita was discharged from the hospital days later,on january,and resumed chemotherapy the next month.
in pleading their nied claim,plaintiffs allege they were all present at the scene of the events at issue herein at the time when they occurred and that they were all aware that defendants,and each of them,were causing injury to their mother,nita bird.defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that the undisputed evidence showed plaintiffs had not been present in the operating room at the time nita artery was transected,had not observed the transection,and had learned about it from others only after it had occurred.plaintiff kim moran,moreover,had been out of the state.in support of their motion,defendants cited thing la chusa cal d,in which we held that a plaintiff may recover damages for emotional distress caused by observing the negligently inflicted injury of a third person if,but only if,the plaintiff satisfies three requirements,including the requirement that the plaintiff be present at the scene of the event at the time it occurs and be then aware that it is causing injury to the victim.id.at.
in their opposition to the motion for summary judgment,plaintiffs admitted they had not been present in the operating room when nita artery was transected.plaintiffs disagreed,however,with defendants definition of the relevant event as limited to the transection of nita artery.in plaintiffs view,the event also included defendants failure immediately to diagnose and treat the damaged artery.to raise a triable issue of fact on the issue,plaintiffs submitted the deposition testimony summarized above.plaintiffs janice bird and dayle edgmon also submitted declarations stating,in identical words,that,at the time dayle arrived at the hospital,b oth of us knew that our mother was severely injured and that the injury was continuing,and that,at the time nita was rolled through the hallway to surgery,both were aware that our mother was bleeding to death as we watched.
the superior court,as already noted,granted defendants motion for summary judgment.the court of appeal reversed.to the extent that the event includes the alleged negligent care and treatment of nita outside the operating room,the court reasoned,it remains a triable issue of fact as to whether appellants meet the test under thing.we granted review.
ii.discussion 
this case requires us to consider once again the circumstances under which bystanders to an event injuring a third party may sue the allegedly negligent actor for emotional distress.in amaya home ice,fuel supply cal d,we declined to recognize such claims,foreseeing if we did a fantastic realm of infinite liability.id.at.five years later,in dillon legg cal d,dillon,we reversed course.equating the duty to avoid causing emotional harm to bystanders with the foreseeability they might suffer such harm,we articulated a set of nonexclusive guidelines for assessing foreseeability,and thus duty,on a basis over the ensuing two decades we,and the lower courts,attempted to apply those guidelines.looking at that effort in retrospect,however,in thing la chusa,supra,cal d,thing,we discerned that dillon had produced arbitrary and conflicting results and ever widening circles of liability.thing,supra,at.recognizing this,we did not reverse course yet again,but we did make an important course correction.in place of dillon s nonexclusive guidelines,we set out three mandatory requirements that claims for nied must satisfy to be accepted as valid.specifically,we held that a plaintiff may recover damages for emotional distress caused by observing the negligently inflicted injury of a third person if,but only if,said plaintiff is closely related to the injury victim is present at the scene of the event at the time it occurs and is then aware that it is causing injury to the victim and as a result suffers serious emotional reaction beyond that which would be anticipated in a disinterested witness and which is not an abnormal response to the circumstances.thing,supra,at,fns.omitted,italics added.we emphasized the mandatory,exclusive nature of the new requirements by expressly rejecting the suggestion that liability for nied should be determined under the more general approach set out in rowland christian cal d,for identifying duties of care.see thing,supra,at,fn.
applying these requirements to the facts before us in thing,supra,cal d,we held that the plaintiff as a matter of law could not state a claim for nied.the plaintiff mother had been nearby when the defendant automobile struck and injured her minor child,but the plaintiff had not seen or heard the accident instead,she became aware of it only when someone told her it had occurred and she rushed to the scene and saw her child lying injured and unconscious on the road.under these facts,the plaintiff could not satisfy the requirement of having been present at the scene of the event at the time it occurred and of having then been aware that it was causing injury to the victim.we reinforced our conclusion by disapproving the suggestion in prior cases that a negligent actor is liable to all those persons who may have suffered emotional distress on viewing or learning about the injurious consequences of his conduct rather than on viewing the event,itself.id.at,italics added,disapproving nazaroff superior court d,and archibald braverman d,to the extent inconsistent with thing.
here,only the second thing requirement is at issue.defendants argue that plaintiffs,who admittedly did not perceive the transection of their mother artery,were not present at the scene of the event at the time it occurred and were not then aware that it was causing injury to the victim.
certainly defendants are correct that plaintiffs can not prevail on a claim for nied based solely on the transection of nita artery.the undisputed facts establish that no plaintiff was present in the operating room at the time that event occurred.indeed,plaintiffs assert that even the defendant physicians,who were present and actively involved in nita care,failed to diagnose the transection for some time.plaintiffs first learned an accident had taken place when they heard that news from a physician and saw some of the injurious consequences.the earlier call for a thoracic surgeon over the hospital loudspeaker system may seem full of portent in retrospect,but it carried no clear information to a bystander in a waiting room about the progress of a particular surgical procedure.to be sure,thing requirement that the plaintiff be contemporaneously aware of the event has not been interpreted as requiring visual perception of an impact on the victim.a plaintiff may recover based on an event perceived by other senses so long as the event is contemporaneously understood as causing injury to a close relative.wilks hom th,d plaintiff was in the living room speaking to her children in their bedrooms when she saw,heard and felt one bedroom explode from a gas leak.but this slight degree of flexibility in the second thing requirement does not aid plaintiffs here because they had no sensory perception whatsoever of the transection at the time it occurred.thus,defining the event as the transection,plaintiffs claim falls squarely within the category of cases the second thing requirement was intended to bar.
conceding the point at least implicitly,plaintiffs seek to redefine the event to include something of which they were contemporaneously aware.in their own words,w hile plaintiffs do not dispute that janice bird and dayle edgmon were not in the operating room at the time nita bird artery was transected,plaintiffs do contend that janice bird and dayle edgmon were aware that nita bird artery vein had been injured as a result of defendants conduct,that defendants failed to diagnose that injury and that defendants failed to treat that injury while it was occurring.
the problem with defining the event as defendants failure to diagnose and treat the damaged artery is that plaintiffs could not meaningfully have perceived any such failure.except in the most obvious cases,a misdiagnosis is beyond the awareness of lay bystanders.here,what plaintiffs actually saw and heard was a call for a thoracic surgeon,a report of nita suffering a possible stroke,nita in distress being rushed by numerous medical personnel to another room,a report of nita possibly having suffered a nicked artery or vein,a physician carrying units of blood and,finally,nita still in distress being rushed to surgery.even if plaintiffs believed,as they stated in their declarations,that their mother was bleeding to death,they had no reason to know that the care she was receiving to diagnose and correct the cause of the problem was inadequate.while they eventually became aware that one transected occurred,they had no basis for believing that another,subtler event was occurring in its wake.
in other nied cases decided after thing,supra,cal d,and based on alleged medical negligence,courts have not found a layperson observation of medical procedures to satisfy the requirement of contemporary awareness of the event.this is not to say that a layperson can never perceive medical negligence,or that one who does perceive it can not assert a valid claim for nied.to suggest an extreme example,a layperson who watched as a relative sound limb was amputated by mistake might well have a valid claim for nied against the surgeon.such an accident,and its effects,would not lie beyond the plaintiff understanding awareness.but the same can not be assumed of medical malpractice generally.
the leading case on point is golstein superior court d.golstein.there,the parents of a child with curable cancer watched as he underwent radiation therapy.that the child had been lethally overexposed was not discovered until later,when he developed symptoms of radiation poisoning.while the plaintiffs had observed the procedure that was later determined to have been an event,they were not then aware the treatment was causing injury.addressing the second requirement of thing,supra,cal d,the plaintiffs argued that since radiation is invisible its fatal dosage can not be seen,and it is unjust to deny them recovery based on rules having their origins in fact patterns involving visible events such as accidents.were it not for thing,the golstein court reasoned,the plaintiffs would have a compelling case.however,we interpret thing policy statement as a requirement that nied plaintiffs experience a contemporaneous sensory awareness of the causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury.as the supreme court stated the rule in thing,the plaintiff must be present at the scene of the event at the time it occurs and then aware that it is causing injury to the victim golstein,supra,at,fns.omitted,quoting thing,supra,at.
in a footnote,the court in golstein,supra,d,observed that it had repeatedly asked plaintiffs counsel at oral argument to present some analytical distinction between the case of radiation overexposure and the standard medical malpractice case,where the injury is typically witnessed by the plaintiff but the plaintiff does not see,or meaningfully comprehend,the actual event.counsel was unable to do so.we are reasonably certain the supreme court would not accept a conclusion which could apply nied recovery almost automatically to a medical malpractice plaintiff who observes only the suffering of the victim and not the actual event that causes that suffering.id.at,fn.
the courts in other cases decided after thing,supra,cal d,have reached similar conclusions.in wright city of los angeles d,a relative who watched a paramedic conduct a cursory medical examination that failed to detect signs of sickle cell shock was permitted to sue for wrongful death but not for nied.while the relative was present at the scene at the time the event occurred,there was no evidence he was then aware that the decedent was being injured by the paramedic negligent
