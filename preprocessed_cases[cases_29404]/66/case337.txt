introduction 
when a defendant in a personal injury action contends that a physician treatment of the plaintiff caused part or all of the plaintiff injuries,can the trier of fact find the physician comparatively at fault without evidence that the physician medical malpractice caused the plaintiff injuries we conclude the trier of fact can not make such a finding.in order to prevail on a defense of comparative negligence by a physician,the defendant must prove each of the elements of a claim for medical malpractice.
in this case,plaintiff katerina chakalis sustained personal injuries after the elevator in her apartment building malfunctioned and fell six floors.she filed a complaint for negligence and premises liability against four defendants elevator solutions,esi,the elevator maintenance company that serviced the malfunctioning elevator fountain springs manor home owners association fountain springs hoa,which owned or controlled the apartment building ross morgan company ross morgan,the property manager and karim merat,ross morgan agent.
the case went to trial and the jury returned a mixed verdict.although the jury awarded plaintiff damages,it found that esi was not liable to plaintiff.the jury instead found that fountain springs hoa was percent at fault ross morgan and karim merat were percent at fault plaintiff was percent at fault and a,james dahlgren,was percent at fault.the trial court entered judgment in accordance with the special verdict.
on appeal plaintiff main challenge to the judgment concerns the apportionment of fault to dahlgren.this challenge has merit.
in wilson ritto th,wilson,the court held that a medical doctor can not be found comparatively at fault in a personal injury action unless the defendant proves with expert testimony the doctor failed to meet the applicable standard of care.applying the logic and reasoning of wilson,we conclude that a medical doctor can not be found comparatively at fault unless the defendant proves all of the elements of medical malpractice.we also conclude that a jury can not find a medical doctor comparatively at fault for the plaintiff injuries unless the jury is instructed on the requirements of a medical malpractice claim.
here,defendants did not prove the elements of breach and causation against dahlgren with expert testimony,nor did they request jury instructions regarding medical malpractice.we therefore reverse the judgment with respect to fountain springs hoa,ross morgan and karim merat because the special verdict finding that dahlgren was percent at fault was contrary to law and not supported by substantial evidence 
the jury erroneous apportionment of fault to dahlgren,however,is unrelated to its finding that esi was not negligent or otherwise at fault for plaintiff injuries.in the unpublished portion of the opinion,we conclude that there was substantial evidence to support this finding.accordingly,we affirm the judgment with respect to esi.
factual and procedural background 
the accident 
plaintiff rented an apartment in west hollywood.before the accident plaintiff and esi warned fountain springs hoa,ross morgan and karim merat about potential safety problems with the elevator in plaintiff building.
on july,plaintiff came home after an evening socializing with friends.at about she took the elevator up toward her penthouse apartment,which was six levels above the bottom floor.when the elevator reached the top level,it began shaking and going up and down.the elevator then suddenly dropped six floors,crashed into the bottom level,bounced up about six feet,and then bounced several more times before finally coming to a rest.
the elevator ceiling came completely dislodged and fell on top of plaintiff,causing a three and centimeter laceration on her head.according to plaintiff,hydraulic oil spilled into the elevator and soaked her.
emergency paramedics arrived at the scene at plaintiff was taken to cedars sinai hospital,where she was admitted into the emergency room at 
plaintiff injuries 
emergency room treatment and exams 
when plaintiff arrived in the emergency room she was initially treated by sujal mandavia.plaintiff chief complaints were that she had a headache and left shoulder pain.mandavia found a laceration on plaintiff head.he also conducted respiratory,heart,abdominal,neurologic and other exams,each of which indicated plaintiff was in normal condition,except that plaintiff had some tenderness on the left side of her back.additionally,mandavia ordered and a ct scan,both which came back negative.
kenneth corre examined plaintiff from head to toe at about on the day of the accident.except for tenderness in plaintiff back and her laceration,corre did not find any injuries.after consulting with other medical professionals at the hospital,corre determined that plaintiff should be discharged and did not need to be admitted to the hospital.plaintiff and her family objected and urged that she remain at cedars sinai,but she was nevertheless discharged that day.
corre second exam 
on july,plaintiff went back to cedars sinai to have her stitches removed.coincidently,corre was on duty at the time and he was the physician who treated and examined her.plaintiff complained about a number of ailments,including a headache,left shoulder pain,low back pain,feeling dysphoric,meaning she just did not feel right,and hydraulic oil poisoning.in light of these complaints,corre conducted another head to toe physical exam.corre found that her laceration was healing well and that plaintiff was absolutely healthy and minimally symptomatic.
corre concluded that plaintiff had a concussion,neck and low back strain,and insomnia,and that her complaints were way out of proportion to his findings.according to corre,plaintiff expressed each one of her concerns as though it were severe and as if it were.with respect to plaintiff claim she was drenched with hydraulic oil on the day of the accident,corre opined this claim was impossible because none of the physicians,nurses or paramedics who treated and examined plaintiff on the day of the accident made any note of smelling or seeing abnormal fluid on her body,breath,or clothing.
dahlgren diagnosis and treatment 
on july,plaintiff was examined by james dahlgren.although dahlgren is not a board certified toxicologist,one of his fields of practice is toxicology and he has written papers on toxicology issues.before seeing plaintiff,dahlgren had not previously treated a patient with alleged hydraulic oil poisoning.
dahlgren diagnosed plaintiff with hydraulic oil poisoning and placed plaintiff on a detoxification treatment plan.this plan consisted of taking saunas times a day,which was meant to help plaintiff sweat out toxic metals found in the hydraulic oil taking glutathione,which dahlgren contended helps metabolize chemicals,including hydrocarbons found in hydraulic oil taking vitamin and mineral supplements and chelation,which is a method of removing heavy metals from the body by ingesting an agent that attaches to the metals.
to confirm his diagnosis,dahlgren sent plaintiff urine samples to a laboratory for testing.according to dahlgren,the tests indicated that plaintiff had elevated arsenic and mercury levels in her body.dahlgren conceded,however,that plaintiff could have had high levels of mercury in her body before the accident because she consumed large quantities of seafood.
after dahlgren placed plaintiff on his detoxification treatment plan,plaintiff brought to him a sample of the hydraulic oil she claimed spilled on her during the accident.dahlgren sent the sample to del ray analytic dra to determine whether there was mercury or arsenic in the hydraulic oil.the tests,however,did not detect either substance.nonetheless,dahlgren did not change his diagnosis because he believed dra tests had very high detection levels.unless there was mercury or arsenic in amounts greater than two parts per million,these substances would not be detected.in dahlgren view,arsenic and mercury could still have been in the hydraulic oil in an amount that was toxic.
while plaintiff was undergoing her detoxification treatment,including chelation therapy,dahlgren obtained a copy of the material safety data sheet msds for the hydraulic oil plaintiff claimed caused her poisoning.the msds is a document created by the hydraulic oil manufacturer.it indicated that prolonged exposure to the hydraulic oil could cause skin irritation but did not warn of any other significant health concerns.indeed,the msds specifically stated that the hydraulic oil was not expected to be harmful if swallowed and was not expected to be harmful to internal organs if it was absorbed through the skin.dahlgren did not talk to plaintiff about the msds,nor did he change his diagnosis in light of the statements made in the document.
plaintiff advised dahlgren about a number of health problems in addition to alleged hydraulic oil poisoning.dahlgren,however,did not treat her for other health problems,except that he prescribed vicodin a number of times in order to alleviate her pain.
plaintiff treatment by other health care professionals 
after plaintiff was discharged from cedars sinai hospital she was examined and treated by numerous health care professionals for a wide variety of physical and psychological ailments she contends resulted from the accident.one of the most significant of these ailments was the development of stevens johnson syndrome,which causes a severe rash on the skin.the parties vigorously dispute the nature and extent of plaintiff injuries and the causal link,if any,to defendants alleged negligence and dahlgren treatment.
according to plaintiff psychologist,craig snyder,plaintiff suffered from depression and stress disorder as a result of the accident.in snyder view,plaintiff physical problems,especially the onset of stevens johnson syndrome,had a tremendous negative effect on plaintiff psychological well being.plaintiff also reported to snyder that she feared dahlgren chelation therapy because the treatment was painful,fatiguing,and caused her anxiety.
because plaintiff was prescribed medication from a number of physicians,snyder referred plaintiff to lawrence miller,who served as plaintiff pain management physician.miller prescribed vicodin for plaintiff.in may,in light of the increased pain plaintiff was suffering from stevens johnson syndrome,miller increased plaintiff dosage to tablets of vicodin a day.
plaintiff alleged suicidal condition 
in october,plaintiff was taken by an ambulance to the cedars sinai psychiatric ward,where she stayed for two days.plaintiff friends had arranged for plaintiff to be taken to the psychiatric ward because they were concerned she was attempting to kill herself.plaintiff stated to her friends,i ca deal anymore and i wish i was dead.when she was asked at her whether she was attempting to commit suicide,plaintiff responded,not to my memory.
plaintiff liver failure 
on november,plaintiff was taken to the hospital at the university of california,los angeles ucla for acute liver failure.she received a liver transplant on november.a biopsy of her liver indicated plaintiff liver failure was caused by acetaminophen toxicity.according to the pathologist who examined the biopsy at ucla hospital,the liver failure was not the result of a chronic illness,but rather the result of rapid liver failure which occurred within a week.
it is undisputed that plaintiff was taking vicodin in the weeks and days before her liver failure.expert medical testimony established that regular strength vicodin contains milligrams of acetaminophen and extra strength vicodin contains milligrams.when plaintiff was admitted to ucla hospital,she had milligrams of acetaminophen in her system.
in may,plaintiff body rejected her liver.plaintiff was readmitted to ucla hospital for treatment.fortunately,the physicians there were able to stabilize plaintiff condition,and she was discharged without another liver transplant.
according to snyder,plaintiff psychological condition substantially worsened after her liver transplant and her body rejection of her liver.
the pleadings 
on october,plaintiff filed a complaint for premises liability and negligence defendants filed answers to the complaint generally denying plaintiff allegations.they also asserted numerous affirmative defenses,including comparative fault and intervening,superseding acts.
a.the cause and extent of plaintiff injuries 
the cause and extent of plaintiff injuries were vigorously disputed at trial.there was conflicting evidence on these issues.the principal witnesses defendants called were emergency room doctor kenneth corre,whose testimony we summarized ante,and defendants experts richard clark and martin levine.
clark was highly critical of dahlgren diagnosis and treatment of plaintiff.he opined that the tests conducted by dahlgren showed no or insignificant amounts of mercury and arsenic in plaintiff system and that the probability that plaintiff was exposed to mercury and arsenic as a result of the accident was very low.he further opined that dahlgren entire detoxification program,especially the chelation therapy,was unnecessary.clark is board certified in medical toxicology and emergency medicine.
clark also criticized dahlgren prescription of provigil,which he stated is pretty well known to have some bad rashes associated with it,possibly even stevens johnson syndrome.
at the end of clark testimony,one of defendants attorneys asked the following question in your review of the medical records in this case,and dahlgren records and his course of therapy with chakalis,have you come to an opinion regarding whether or not he met the standard of care for a treating toxicologist with respect to his treatment of her 
plaintiff attorney objected to this question as o utside the scope.he then requested a sidebar conference,which was granted.in this conference,the trial court asked why is it relevant,anyway let assume dahlgren is responsible for the mal because of malpractice,she has her injury.why is that relevant to her injury after further discussion,the objection was sustained.
martin levine,a board certified neurologist and a psychiatrist,was also a key witness for defendants.he had examined plaintiff in september,two months before her liver failure.
levine testified that at the examination,plaintiff stated she was suffering from the following ailments tingling and numbness in the hands and feet burning of the skin across her waist toenail pain on the left foot on her big toe confusion she could not determine whether an event was a dream or if it really happened to her headaches trouble concentrating loss of balance and vertigo pain down both legs trouble breathing anxiety blurred vision neck pain and hip pain at night and rashes and stevens johnson syndrome.levine opined that most,if not all,of plaintiff complaints had a very strong psychiatric basis to them,and that the nature and extent of her complaints exceeded reasonableness.
levine also opined that there was not one heavy metal test that was positive at a level that would be expected to cause disease in a human being.he further stated that was no evidence of neurological disease that could be attributed to the accident.
jury question to the court 
during deliberations the jury asked the trial court the following question regarding the special verdict form pertaining to question on the verdict form,there are blank spots can we assign a percentage of responsibility to a not listed as a defendant in this case the court responded,yes.
special verdict 
on june,the jury returned the verdict.the jury found that defendants fountain springs hoa,ross morgan and karim merat and plaintiff katerina chakalis were negligent,that the negligence of each of these parties was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff injuries,and that plaintiff sustained damages.it also found,however,that esi was not negligent.
the jury awarded the following damages in past medical expenses,in past loss,and in future loss.the jury apportioned fault as follows 
dahlgren name was by the jury and added to the list of defendants who were potentially at fault for plaintiff injuries.
post trial proceedings 
after the trial the court entered a judgment pursuant to the special verdict.subsequently,plaintiff filed a timely motion for a new trial,which the trial court denied.plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal of the judgment 
discussion 
the jury finding that dahlgren was percent at fault was contrary to the law and not supported by substantial evidence 
california system of comparative fault seeks to distribute tort damages proportionally among all who caused the harm.however,even after judicial adoption of the comparative fault system,every culpable tort defendant,regardless of his or her degree of fault,remained jointly and severally liable to pay any damages attributable to the fault of others who failed to contribute their proportionate share.this rule of joint and several liability applied not only to the injured person economic damages,such as medical costs and lost earnings,but to damages like emotional distress,pain,and suffering.dafonte up rights,cal th.
proposition,adopted in,created an exception to the general rule of joint and several liability.the exception is set forth in civil code section,subdivision a,which provides in any action for personal injury,property damage,or wrongful death,based upon principles of comparative fault,the liability of each defendant for damages shall be several only and shall not be joint.each defendant shall be liable only for the amount of damages allocated to that defendant in direct proportion to that defendant percentage of fault,and a separate judgment shall be rendered against that defendant for that amount.proposition also preserved the general presumption that joint tortfeasors are jointly liable,henry superior court th,henry.
in wilson,the court applied civil code section in circumstances very similar to this case.there,the defendant performed three surgeries on the plaintiff.subsequently,the plaintiff received medical treatment from metros.the plaintiff sued the defendant for medical malpractice,but did not sue metros.at trial,the defendant expert criticized metros treatment of the plaintiff but did not opine that metros violated the medical standard of care.wilson,supra,th at.after both sides rested,the defendant moved to add metros to the special verdict form as a joint tortfeasor.id.at.the trial court,however,denied the motion on the ground that there was insufficient evidence that metros violated the medical standard of care.ibid.
the court of appeal upheld the trial court ruling denying the plaintiff motion to add metros to the special verdict form.in so doing,the court considered what constitutes fault within the meaning of civil code section.wilson,supra,th at.the court concluded fault,although not the equivalent of liability,connotes wrongdoing and culpability.and wrongdoing or culpability in the context of medical treatment is measured by the standard of care within the medical community.mere error of judgment,in the absence of a want of reasonable care and skill in the application of his medical learning to the case presented,will not render a doctor responsible for untoward consequences in the treatment of his patient.
apportionment among doctors under civil code section requires evidence of medical malpractice,not only as to named defendants,but also as to nonparty doctors.the burden of proof in apportioning noneconomic damages among joint tortfeasors should not be contingent upon whether a joint tortfeasor is a named defendant.the same burden of proving fault applies regardless of whether a joint tortfeasor is a defendant or nonparty.wilson,supra,th at.
defendants attempt to distinguish wilson on the ground that it was a medical malpractice case,in contrast to this case where plaintiff did not assert a medical malpractice cause of action.for purposes of applying civil code section,however,it makes no difference that the nature of defendants alleged negligence was different from that of dahlgren.henry,supra,th at emergency room doctors could be comparatively at fault for purposes of civil code section in a premises liability case.
plaintiff is estopped from arguing that defendants failed to prove dahlgren breached the standard of care 
under wilson,the burden of apportioning fault to dahlgren fell squarely on defendants.defendants were required to prove that dahlgren breached the medical standard of care.further,the element of breach in a medical malpractice claim can generally only be proven with expert testimony.landeros flood cal d.it is undisputed that there was no expert testimony that dahlgren treatment of plaintiff fell below the standard of care.plaintiff thus contends there was insufficient evidence to find dahlgren at fault.we reject this argument,however,because plaintiff is estopped from pursuing it on appeal 
under the doctrine of invited error,a party may not object to the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding against him when the lack is the result of improper exclusion of evidence at his own instance.citations.a party who has prevented proof of a fact by his erroneous objection will not be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong,and a reviewing court will assume that the fact was duly proved.watenpaugh state teachers retirement cal d,accord brewer department of motor vehicles d.the doctrine of invited error is based on the principle of estoppel.norgart upjohn co.cal th.
here,plaintiff prevented defendants from proving that dahlgren failed to meet the standard of care by objecting to a question posed to defendants expert witness regarding that issue this objection was not well taken.contrary to the trial court ruling,whether dahlgren failed to meet the applicable standard of care was relevant to the issue of apportioning fault for plaintiff injuries to dahlgren.see wilson,supra,th at.plaintiff therefore is estopped from arguing on appeal that defendants failed to prove dahlgren did not meet the standard of care.
plaintiff argues that just because the question posed by defendants was objected to by plaintiff,and sustained by the court,defendants were in no way precluded from presenting evidence that dahlgren conduct fell below the applicable medical standard of care.this argument is primarily based on a statement made by fountain spring hoa attorney,paul ash.after the trial court sustained plaintiff objection,ash stated that he would rephrase the question.but ash never rephrased the question.plaintiff thus contends defendants could have,but did not prove that dahlgren failed to meet the standard of care.we disagree.
after ash stated he would rephrase his question,plaintiff counsel continued to argue about the matter but the trial court cut this argument short by stating,i sustained the objection,counsel.thus ash decision to not rephrase the question was reasonable in light of the trial court indication that the issue was resolved.moreover,the trial court did not sustain plaintiff objection on the ground that the question was improperly phrased.rather,it sustained the objection on the basis of relevancy.there is nothing in the record indicating the trial court would have changed its ruling had ash rephrased his question.plaintiff therefore can not escape the doctrine of invited error.
b.there was no substantial evidence showing dahlgren negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff injuries 
the elements of a cause of action for medical malpractice are a duty to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as other members of the profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of the duty a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the injury and resulting loss or damage.johnson superior court th.
wilson focused on the element of breach.it did not specifically address the other elements,including causation.in our view,the logic and reasoning of wilson should be applied to the other elements.if,for example,a doctor medical malpractice did not proximately cause any harm to the plaintiff,the trier of fact can not apportion fault to that doctor pursuant to civil code section.
the law is well settled that in a personal injury action causation must be proven within a reasonable medical probability based upon competent expert testimony.miranda bomel construction,th,accord jennings palomar pomerado health systems,cal.app th,same salasguevara wyeth laboratories,inc.d,medical causation can only be determined by expert medical testimony.defendants did not satisfy this requirement.
defendants contend that much of plaintiff physical pain and mental suffering were caused by dahlgren alleged medical malpractice.there was evidence that the chelation therapy prescribed by dahlgren was unnecessary and painful,and that plaintiff feared the therapy.there was also evidence that plaintiff belief she had hydraulic oil poisoning was confirmed by dahlgren diagnosis that this diagnosis was incorrect and that many of plaintiff health problems had a very strong psychiatric basis to them.
moreover,defendants argue,plaintiff suffering as a result of dahlgren alleged medical malpractice can be tied to her liver failure.plaintiff liver failure was caused by an overdose of acetaminophen just weeks after plaintiff was admitted to a psychiatric ward to be monitored for risk of suicide.in defendants view,the deterioration of plaintiff mental state can be traced to dahlgren alleged misdiagnosis.defendants also contend that dahlgren prescription of the medication provigil caused the onset of stevens johnson syndrome in plaintiff,which was the source of much of plaintiff physical and mental pain and suffering 
the fatal flaw with defendants argument is that there was no expert testimony regarding the element of causation.while defendants experts were critical of dahlgren treatment and discussed the dangers and risks associated with it,they did not actually offer an expert opinion that it was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff injuries within a reasonable medical probability.defendants therefore failed to meet their burden of showing dahlgren was comparatively at fault for plaintiff damages for purposes of civil code section.
c.a new trial is required 
a motion for a new trial should be granted if there is an insufficiency in the evidence to justify the verdict,or the verdict is against the law,and this error materially affects the substantial rights of the moving party.code civ.here,the verdict was not supported by substantial evidence and was against the law because the jury found dahlgren percent at fault without expert testimony establishing that dahlgren alleged medical malpractice was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff injuries.further,this error materially affected plaintiff rights because it reduced the amount of plaintiff recovery.the trial court thus erroneously denied plaintiff motion for a new trial.
on remand the jury should be instructed regarding medical malpractice 
it is the trial court duty to see that the jury is instructed about the applicable law regarding the major subjects raised by the evidence,including affirmative defenses.see paverud niagara machine tool works d,disapproved on other grounds in soule general motors cal th,lysick walcom d,witkin,cal.procedure ed.trial.in this case,the parties did not request instructions regarding the requirements of proving medical malpractice and the trial court did not give any.the jury thus was not informed about important controlling legal principles relating to dahlgren fault,if any,for plaintiff injuries.for example,the jury was not informed that in order to find dahlgren comparatively at fault it was required to find he did not meet the applicable standard of care,and that this finding must be based on expert testimony.see caci.on remand,if defendants contend dahlgren is comparatively at fault in a jury trial,the jury must be instructed on the requirements for proving a medical malpractice claim against him.
the trial court did not commit reversible error by giving the jury question of the special verdict 
plaintiff contends the trial court erroneously gave the jury question of the special verdict.although we need not reach this issue because we reverse the judgment for the reasons stated ante,we nonetheless address plaintiff arguments in order to provide the trial court with guidance upon remand.
the trial court used a special verdict form prepared by defendants.in the first eight questions,the jury was asked whether defendants and plaintiff were negligent and,if so,whether that negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff injuries.in question through,the jury was asked whether fountain springs hoa owned and controlled the property,whether this defendant was negligent in the use or maintenance of the property and,if so,whether that negligence was a substantial factor in causing plaintiff injuries.question asked whether plaintiff was damaged.
question and stated 
was the july,elevator accident a substantial factor in causing plaintiff liver failure 
if your answer to question is yes,include all economic and noneconomic loss suffered by plaintiff and answer question.if your answer to question is no,do not include any past or future economic or noneconomic loss caused by plaintiff liver failure,skip question and answer question.
was plaintiff intake of medication a superseding intervening cause of her liver failure 
the trial court overruled plaintiff objections to question and and presented them on the special verdict form to the jury.in response to question,the jury found that the accident was not a substantial factor in causing plaintiff liver failure.the jury thus did not respond to question.
plaintiff contends the trial court committed reversible error by giving the jury question of the special verdict over her objection.she asserts three arguments on this issue.first,she contends question improperly shifted the burden of proof on defendants superseding cause affirmative defense.we reject this argument.
the premise of plaintiff argument that question improperly shifted the burden of proof to plaintiff is that the jury found,or must have found,that dahlgren alleged malpractice was a superseding cause of plaintiff liver failure.the jury,however,made no such express finding.in fact,the record does not indicate why the jury determined the accident was not a substantial factor in causing plaintiff liver failure.the jury could have come to this conclusion for a variety of reasons.for example,the jury could have determined the connection between the accident and plaintiff liver failure which occurred months later was simply too tenuous or that plaintiff intentional conduct was the cause of her liver failure.we thus conclude question did not improperly shift the burden of proof to plaintiff.
next,plaintiff argues question led to inconsistent findings by the jury.plaintiff contends the jury award of in economic damages includes all medical expenses plaintiff incurred from the time of the accident through november,plus some of plaintiff medical expenses related to her liver failure.this award allegedly confirms the jury found defendants negligence caused plaintiff liver failure,which is inconsistent with the jury response to question.
the premise of this argument is that the jury calculated the economic damages award by including medical bills attributable to plaintiff liver failure.we do not know,however,how the jury arrived at its economic damages award.the record is silent on this issue.we can not,as plaintiff urges,make inferences in her favor in order to overturn the judgment.we must presume the judgment is correct and make all reasonable inferences in favor of it.denham superior court cal d.
finally,plaintiff argues question improperly isolated plaintiff liver failure from the other injuries she suffered as a result of the accident.we disagree.
in henry,the plaintiff larry reinink sued the defendants joe and judy henry for premises liability.at trial,the henrys sought to introduce evidence that medical malpractice by emergency room doctors at kaiser permanente kaiser,who were not parties to the action,aggravated the plaintiff injuries.the court of appeal reversed the trial court order excluding such evidence.henry,supra,th at.
in reaching this decision,the henry court made clear that the comparative fault principles of civil code section applied to cases where an original tortfeasor alleges a physician aggravated the plaintiff injuries.henry,supra,th at.the court further stated to the extent damages for reinink injured shoulder can in fact be di
