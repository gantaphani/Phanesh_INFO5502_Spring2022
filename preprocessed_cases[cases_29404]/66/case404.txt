in our youth and celebrity worshipping culture,the benefits and risks of plastic surgery are a hot topic.the number of people,especially women,who have had minimally invasive cosmetic surgery has grown exponentially in the past several years.
jonathan sykes,is a prominent professor and practitioner of plastic and reconstructive surgery at the university of california,davis,medical center uc davis medical center in sacramento.sykes performed a series of facial cosmetic procedures on georgette gilbert in february.gilbert was appalled at the results.she not only sued sykes for medical malpractice,but created a web site relating her experiences with sykes including before and after photos,as well as information and advice for those considering plastic surgery.
sykes filed a in the malpractice action,alleging he was defamed and suffered loss of business as a result of false and misleading statements appearing on gilbert web site.gilbert responded with a special motion to strike the.code civ.the trial court denied the motion,finding that sykes had established a probability of prevailing on his.
exercising our power of independent review,we shall reverse.while we agree with the trial court finding that the qualified for slapp treatment under the statute,we conclude,contrary to the trial court finding,that sykes was a limited purpose public figure and therefore had the burden of making a prima facie showing that the statements in the web site were both false and published with actual malice.because we find that sykes failed to carry that burden,we shall vacate the order with directions to grant gilbert motion.
factual background 
the surgery 
sykes is the director of facial plastic and reconstructive surgery at uc davis medical center in sacramento.sykes was profiled in a article in sacramento magazine entitled top doctors,which lauds him as a nationally recognized educator and leader in minimally invasive esthetic and laser surgery,who has performed over surgical procedures,is in otolaryngology and facial plastic surgery,and has published three books and over articles on facial plastic surgery.
gilbert became interested in plastic surgery after another doctor recommended that she might benefit from a brow lift.she approached sykes because she was acquainted with him and thought of him as a friend.after consulting with sykes,gilbert agreed to undergo five separate plastic surgical procedures to her face.sykes told her that the goal was to make her look natural after the surgery and that we did want to make too much change.the surgery was performed in february.
during an april visit,sykes told gilbert the results were very good and improving.gilbert did not agree.she was extremely unhappy with the results,asserting that she could not fully close her eyes,her eyebrows were higher than she expected,one eyebrow was higher than the other and she had a permanently surprised look on her face.beginning in late june gilbert underwent four revision surgeries,performed by other doctors,to correct her problems.
in may,gilbert brought a malpractice suit against sykes and the regents of the university of california the regents in connection with the surgery performed by sykes.
gilbert web site 
in late february or early march,gilbert established a web site with the address currently accessible as of hereafter web site.the web site contains five hyperlinks or links that take the reader to an additional page of information,which we discuss below 
at the home page of the web site,gilbert explains i started this web site so i can share my experience with plastic surgery.my hopes are to inform and educate because when i originally looked into cosmetic surgery on the internet there was very little information from a patients sic perspective,but a lot of information coming from the doctor perspective.i will share my experience with plastic surgery and show my original untouched before and after photos.if you still wish to pursue plastic surgery after reading my story,i hope you learn from the information i provide so you can make the best educated decision possible before going under the knife.i will give you information and links on how to check what your doctor is certified in,any past lawsuits,information on what to ask during your consult,and give you my take on what red flags to look out for.the home page also lists several malpractice lawsuits that have been filed or are pending against sykes.
the before and after photos link takes the viewer to two pairs of photographs taken before and after the surgery performed by full view of gilbert face and another of just her eyes.both after pictures are captioned approximately five months after surgery.the after photographs show gilbert with a surprised,look.above the eye photographs,gilbert inserted the following caption i was told by my doctor that this was a good i looked better after his do you think 
at the selecting a doctor link,a page of useful information features tips on selecting a plastic surgeon,advice which gilbert states is my own opinion after consulting with revision doctors all over the united states,having multiple revisional surgeries,and just researching as much as possible.
at the red flags link,gilbert discusses things to look out for with disclaimers describing certain traits under the heading,doctors i would be cautious of.
the final me link recounts gilbert experience with sykes.she said that sykes told her she would look natural after the surgery and she was under the impression the change would be subtle.instead,she wrote,the surgery was the biggest regret of my life.i did need five procedures and i had no idea what i was getting myself into.what i thought was going to be subtle turned into a nightmare.i spent over two years of my life meeting with doctors all over the united states and having revision surgeries in hopes to get back to how i once looked or at the very least look normal again.
litigation 
when gilbert did not submit to sykes request to close down her web site,sykes and the regents filed a for damages and injunctive relief based on publications appearing in the web site that were allegedly defamatory and caused sykes emotional distress and loss of business.the crucial charging accusations of the appear in paragraph,which states 
in late february or early march,gilbert established a web site at www.mysurgery nightmare.com web site.in this web site,gilbert after identifying sykes as the director of facial plastic and reconstructive surgery at uc davis medical center presents,inter alia,misleading before and after facial photographs in connection with the procedures performed by sykes photos that were taken after additional and significant cosmetic surgery procedures not performed by sykes,falsely indicates that sykes recommended and performed procedures that gilbert did not,misstates the content of communications between gilbert and sykes relating to the procedures performed by sykes,and falsely suggests that sykes was compensated for the procedures under the table.
sykes also alleged that gilbert obtained from google or possibly other search engines a sponsored link,such that a search for jonathan sykes would bring up a link to gilbert web site.
gilbert responded by filing a special motion to strike the see fn,ante.her moving papers claimed that the web site publications were protected by the first amendment,and that neither sykes nor the regents could establish an actionable claim for defamation or any other tort.
evidence was submitted by both sides and the trial court held a hearing on the matter.the court ultimately issued an order granting the special motion as to the regents but denying it as to sykes.while finding that section applied to the,the court also ruled that sykes was not a limited purpose public figure,which would have required a showing that gilbert statements were uttered with actual malice.stated the court the fact he has published articles and books on plastic surgery and appeared on television shows does not mean there is a public controversy relating to gilbert plastic surgery.finding that sykes had made the requisite prima facie showing that gilbert defamed him with respect to the before and after photos as well as statements appearing in the web site,the court denied the special motion to strike.
the regents have not appealed from the order dismissing them as.gilbert appeals from the order denying her special motion to strike as to sykes.
discussion 
general principles 
code of civil procedure section was enacted in to dismiss at an early stage nonmeritorious litigation meant to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition in connection with a public issue.citation.these meritless suits,referred to under the acronym slapp,are subject to a special motion to strike unless the person asserting that cause of action establishes by pleading and affidavit a probability that he or she will prevail.sipple foundation for nat.progress th,d sipple,fn.omitted,citing lafayette morehouse,chronicle publishing th,d and,subd.b.claims based on these acts are subject to a special motion to strike unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability of prevailing on the merits.ampex cargle th,d ampex.
if the defendant establishes a prima facie case,then the burden shifts to the plaintiff to establish a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,make a prima facie showing of facts which would,if proved at trial,support a judgment in plaintiff favor.dowling zimmerman th,d dowling.
the trial court ruling on a section motion is reviewed de novo.terry davis community church th,d terry.we exercise our independent judgment to determine not only whether the statute applies,but whether the complainant has established a reasonable probability of prevailing on the merits.ibid.
ii.whether section applies 
before reaching the merits of the order,we must address sykes initial contention that,contrary to the trial court ruling,section did not even apply to the 
a lawsuit qualifies for a special motion to strike under section if it arises from an act in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution.wilbanks wolk th,d wilbanks,quoting,subd.b.the statute defines acts in furtherance of free speech or petition as including statements that are made in a public forum and in connection with an issue of public interest.wilbanks,at,d,citing,subd.e.
while not contesting that the internet is a public forum,sykes maintains that the web site does not concern a matter of public interest.he points out that it is not enough that the statement refer to a subject of widespread public interest the statement must in some manner itself contribute to the public debate.wilbanks,supra,th at,d.sykes asserts that statements on the web site do not contribute to the public debate because they only concern gilbert interactions with him.he is wrong.
the public interest requirement of section,subdivision e must be construed broadly so as to encourage participation by all segments of our society in vigorous public debate related to issues of public interest.seelig infinity broadcasting th,d seelig.the legislature inserted the broad construction provision out of concern that judicial decisions were construing that element of the statute too narrowly.briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,briggs,citing stats,ch.
sykes does not dispute that plastic surgery is a subject of widespread public interest and discussion.indeed,a google tm search at as of using the words pros cons cosmetic and surgery returns a virtual deluge of articles and web sites devoted to the controversy surrounding plastic surgery.elective cosmetic surgery was the subject of the popular television series extreme makeover,in which it is portrayed as a positive,event.yet the widespread and indiscriminate use of plastic surgery by celebrities and the public has also generated a firestorm of negative publicity and comment.see,awful plastic good,bad,and ugly of celebrity plastic surgery as of kuczynski,beauty junkies inside our billion obsession with cosmetic surgery.
sykes is a widely known plastic surgeon,practicing at a prestigious medical institution,who has written numerous articles on plastic surgery,appeared in local television shows on the subject and advertised in the sacramento media market.
gilbert web site contributed toward the public debate about plastic surgery in at least two ways first,assertions that a prominent and plastic surgeon produced nightmare results that necessitated extensive revision surgery contributes toward public discussion about the benefits and risks of plastic surgery in general,and particularly among persons contemplating plastic surgery as a means of looking younger or improving their appearance.see terry,supra,th at,d allegations that a church leader engaged in an inappropriate relationship with a teenage minor in his congregation constituted a matter of public interest because it implicated society interest in protecting minors from predators,particularly in places such as church programs that are supposed to be safe annette sharon th,d annette charges of domestic abuse by a lesbian partner in a couple that had achieved national prominence through adoption litigation was an issue of public interest because it potentially affected a large number of children and adoptive parents beyond the direct participants sipple,supra,th at,d allegations against prominent political consultant raised issue of public interest,where he was able to capitalize on domestic violence issues in order to further his career.
second,a review of the entire web site shows that it is not limited to gilbert interactions with sykes.the web site contains advice,information and a contact page where readers can share their own experiences.at the selecting a doctor link,a page on useful information has tips on choosing a plastic surgeon,including references to other web sites and resources.a red flags link lists things to look out for or warning signs to look for when selecting a doctor to perform the surgery.a final me link features gilbert ruminations about plastic surgery in general,not all of it negative.clearly,the web site was not limited to attacking sykes,but contributed to the general debate over the pros and cons of undergoing cosmetic surgery.
for the foregoing reasons,we agree with the trial court finding that gilbert web site concerned a matter of public interest within the meaning of section.
iii.limited purpose public figure 
the most important question we face is whether sykes was a limited purpose public figure for purposes of his defamation claims.copp paxton th,d copp sets forth the elements that must be present in order to characterize a plaintiff as a limited purpose public figure.first,there must be a public controversy,which means the issue was debated publicly and had foreseeable and substantial ramifications for nonparticipants.second,the plaintiff must have undertaken some voluntary act through which he or she sought to influence resolution of the public issue.in this regard it is sufficient that the plaintiff attempts to thrust him or herself into the public eye.and finally,the alleged defamation must be germane to the plaintiff participation in the controversy.ampex,supra,th at,d.
contrary to the trial court ruling,sykes stands out as an archetypical example of a limited purpose or vortex public figure.annette,supra,th at,d.as we have explained,the relative merits of plastic surgery is a subject that has garnered national attention and is the focus of widespread public interest.gilbert produced evidence showing that sykes has thrust himself into that debate by appearing on local television shows as well as writing numerous articles in medical journals and beauty magazines,touting the virtues of cosmetic and reconstructive surgery.sykes has also testified as an expert witness on the subject and advertised his services in the local media.
these facts provide compelling proof that sykes undertook some voluntary act through which he seeks to influence the resolution of the public issues involved,and took affirmative actions to thrust himself into the forefront of a particular public controvers y.copp,supra,th at,d,quoting reader digest superior court cal d.it is not even necessary to show that sykes actually achieved prominence in the public debate.it is sufficient that he attempt ed to thrust himself into the public eye citation or to influence a public decision.copp,supra,at,d.
sykes attempts to avoid this conclusion by playing fast and loose with the definitions.sykes argues he was not a limited purpose public figure because there was no preexisting public controversy regarding the procedures performed by sykes on gilbert.italics added.this claim is at war with the concept of a limited purpose public figure.
a person becomes a limited public figure by injecting himself into the public debate about a topic that concerns a substantial number of people.once he places himself in the spotlight on a topic of public interest,his private words and conduct relating to that topic become fair game.sykes would turn this formulation on its head.he would require that the plaintiff generate a broad public controversy through private words or conduct before he could be deemed a public figure,an atrophic definition that would virtually eliminate all vortex public figure candidates.
if a complainant private conduct had to generate a public controversy before he could be deemed a public figure,those who exposed his controversial behavior in the first place would face defamation liability for inaccurate statements made in good faith,while those who joined in the discussion afterward would be immune from such claims unless it was shown that their statements were uttered with malice.that is not the law.indeed,defamation decisions finding the complainants to be vortex public figures have typically involved persons who claimed they were defamed for private conduct after they injected themselves into matters of general public discussion or controversy.see,terry,supra,th at,d sipple,supra,th at,d copp,supra,th at,d.
here,sykes prominence as an expert in and advocate for plastic surgery as a means of personal enhancement transformed him into a limited purpose public figure.as such,statements alleging that his surgical procedures resulted in disfigurement or required expensive multiple corrective surgeries are entitled to constitutional protection.
we conclude that sykes was a vortex public figure who invited public attention and comments regarding his surgical practice.thus,to prevail on a defamation claim,he was required to prove by clear and convincing evidence not only that gilbert claims were false,but that they were uttered with actual malice.annette,supra,th at,d.
having resolved these preliminary but important issues,we turn to the specific allegations of the and whether sykes met his burden of producing prima facie evidence to support his defamation claims.
iv.probability of success 
since gilbert established that she was sued after exercising her first amendment right to free speech in a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest,the burden shifted to sykes to establish that there is a probability he will prevail on his claims,subd.b evans unkow th,d.to meet this burden,sykes must demonstrate the cross complaint is legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citation.the burden on the plaintiff is similar to the standard used in determining motions for nonsuit,directed verdict,or summary judgment.seelig,supra,th at,d.the showing must be made through competent and admissible evidence.tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port dist.th,d tuchscher see also evans,supra,th at,d.thus,declarations that lack foundation or personal knowledge,or that are argumentative,speculative,impermissible opinion,hearsay,or conclusory are to be disregarded.see tuchscher,supra,at,d.
in deciding the question of potential merit,the trial court considers the pleadings and evidentiary submissions of both the plaintiff and the defendant,subd.b though the court does not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of competing evidence,it should grant the motion if,as a matter of law,the defendant evidence supporting the motion defeats the plaintiff attempt to establish evidentiary support for the claim.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d,wilson.
defamation is an invasion of the interest in reputation.the tort involves the intentional publication of a statement of fact which is false,unprivileged,and has a natural tendency to injure or which causes special damage.ringler associates maryland casualty th,d ringler.there can be no recovery for defamation without a falsehood.citation.thus,to state a defamation claim that survives a first amendment challenge,plaintiff must present evidence of a statement of fact that is provably false.milkovich lorain journal,d.statements do not imply a provably false factual assertion and thus can not form the basis of a defamation action if they can not reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual.citations.thus,rhetorical hyperbole,vigorous epithet s,lusty and imaginative expression s of contempt,and language used in a loose,figurative sense have all been accorded constitutional protection.citations.citations.the dispositive question after the milkovich case is whether a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that the published statements imply a provably false factual assertion.seelig,supra,th at,d,italics added.
sykes alleges that gilbert web site defamed him in four different ways presenting misleading before and after facial photographs in that the after photos were taken after additional and significant cosmetic surgery performed by others falsely indicating that sykes recommended and performed procedures that gilbert did not need or want misstating the content of communications relating to the procedures he performed and falsely suggesting that sykes was compensated for procedures under the table.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that sykes has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating the probable merit of a defamation claim based on any of these allegations.
before and after photographs 
gilbert posted two sets of before and after photographs on her web site with captions approximately one month before surgery and approximately two weeks before surgery,each paired with a photo captioned approximately five months after surgery.italics added.sykes alleged that the photographs were misleading in that the after photo was taken after gilbert had additional revision surgical procedures performed by other plastic surgeons.gilbert,however,debunked this accusation in an uncontradicted declaration,wherein she stated that the after photograph was taken after sykes procedures and before any revision surgery was done on her face.gilbert added that her facial muscles were at rest and her face in repose when the photographs were taken,thereby laying to rest any speculation that she tried to distort her natural appearance in order to cast the results of the surgery in a bad light.
in all cases of alleged defamation,the truth of the offensive statements or communication is a complete defense against civil liability,regardless of bad faith or malicious purpose.ringler,supra,th at,d.because gilbert submitted uncontradicted evidence the photographs were indeed what they purported to be,truth as a defense was established.
sykes responds by focusing on minute details that do not detract from the essential accuracy of the photographs.he seizes on gilbert admission in her deposition that her first revision surgery was performed on june,about four and months after her february surgery,and notes that at one time,gilbert web site claimed the after photo was taken five and months after the surgery.
the slight discrepancy in time frame does not provide sykes with an escape hatch from the truth defense.it is well settled that a defendant is not required in an action of libel to justify every word of the alleged defamatory matter it is sufficient if the substance,the gist,the sting of the libelous charge be justified,and if the gist of the charge be established by t
