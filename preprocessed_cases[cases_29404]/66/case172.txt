while performing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to remove nicki wipf gallbladder,lisa kowalski accidentally cut wipf common bile duct.as a result,wipf underwent various corrective procedures with painful side effects.wipf filed a diversity suit against kowalski and her employer,marshall clinic effingham,for medical malpractice,and a jury found kowalski had not breached the applicable standard of care.on appeal wipf argues the jury verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence,or alternatively,a new trial is warranted based on various erroneous evidentiary and other rulings by the district court.because the jury verdict is supported by the evidence and the district court did not abuse its discretion in its evidentiary and other rulings before and during trial,we affirm.
background 
in,nicki wipf went to her family doctor complaining of recurrent epigastric pain.wipf doctor referred her to a surgeon,lisa kowalski,who recommended an operation to remove wipf gallbladder.on may,kowalski performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy,for short,a procedure that involves transecting two structures the cystic artery and the cystic duct.kowalski,however,made a mistake and cut wipf common bile duct,having mistaken it for the cystic duct.she realized her error later in the procedure.
kowalski notified wipf family of the mistake and had wipf transported by ambulance to hospital in louis where another surgeon,linehan,performed a corrective operation the following day.that procedure involved cutting a section of wipf small bowel and using it to create a new bile duct.after this operation,wipf care was overseen by picus.when wipf later developed a duct blockage,picus performed a procedure to insert a catheter into wipf bile duct to drain bile and thereby avoid further blockage or damage.wipf subsequent treatment included dilating the reattachment site where the bile duct and the small bowel were sewn together,and catheter maintenance and replacement.around april almost one year after the went awry,wipf catheter was removed.
a year later,wipf filed a diversity action in federal court alleging medical negligence.a jury found for kowalski and the marshall clinic.wipf moved for judgment as a matter of law or,in the alternative,for a new trial.the motion was denied,and wipf timely appeal followed.
wipf argues,as she did in her posttrial motions,that the jury verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence she also raises several evidentiary and jury instruction issues.accordingly,a summary of the medical testimony pertaining to in general and wipf procedure in particular is in order.the medical experts testified that during a typical,the surgeon inserts three or four trocars narrow,small incisions in the patient abdomen.various tools,including a light source,clasps,retractors,a camera,and a cutting instrument,can then be passed through the trocars.the surgeon does not view the patient organs directly as he would during an open procedure instead,a camera is passed through one of the trocars which transmits a magnified image that the surgeon views on a screen or monitor.
using the screen images as a guide,the surgeon identifies the anatomy in the hepatobiliary region before transecting certain structures.the surgeon must transect two structures the cystic artery and the cystic duct.there are different methods for identifying the appropriate anatomical structures before proceeding,and this is where the expert testimony diverged.
kleier,a surgeon and wipf expert witness,explained that the gallbladder is generally encased in fatty tissue,and the surgeon must pull away this tissue in order to identify the two structures exiting the gallbladder that need to be transected.kleier opined that several methods of identifying biliary anatomy should be employed to avoid any mistaken identification if these methods are properly used,he testified,the surgeon should never transect the wrong duct.kleier testified that the surgeon must achieve the critical view a view of the area where both the artery and duct are visible coming directly out of and attached to the meticulous dissection.if the surgeon is still uncertain about the location or identity of structures after using this process,he should perform a cholangiogram,which involves a type of in which dye is injected through a catheter into the cystic duct to identify structures.alternatively,he testified,the surgeon should convert to a nonlaparoscopic or open procedure.
the standard of care,according to kleier,requires identification of the cystic duct with absolute certainty before transection,a standard kleier maintained kowalski breached.drawing upon guidelines issued by the society of american gastrointestinal and endoscopic surgeons,kleier testified that kowalski failed to meticulously dissect wipf anatomy and failed to properly achieve the critical view.kleier also testified that kowalski did not properly retract the gallbladder during the procedure,thus obscuring her view,and failed to either perform a confirmatory cholangiogram or convert to an open procedure.
scott peckler,a general surgeon and one of kowalski experts,disagreed with kleier conclusion that kowalski had breached the standard of care.peckler testified that no method of identification,including the critical view,is free of potential risks or errors.he explained that a surgeon is required to satisfy himself that he has correctly identified the relevant anatomical structures,and according to peckler,that is what kowalski did.she used three of four available identification techniques the infundibular technique,which involves stripping off tissue to identify the cystic duct the critical view,which peckler described as dissecting out an anatomical structure called the triangle of calot and dissecting the cystic duct in order to perceive it merging with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.in contrast to kleier position,peckler opined that the standard of care did not require kowalski to perform a procedure that he testified would have entailed its own risks.another surgeon and expert for the defense,abecassis,though primarily testifying about the corrective procedures wipf underwent,seconded peckler opinion that kowalski complied with the standard of care by using accepted procedures to satisfy herself it was the cystic duct that she was about to transect.
ii.discussion 
wipf primary argument on appeal is that the jury verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence and therefore she is entitled to a new trial.on appeal the trial court denial of wipf motion for a new trial is reviewed for abuse of discretion.davis.dep t of,cir neal newspaper holdings,cir latino kaizer,cir.wipf bears the heavy burden of showing the district court denial of her motion was unreasonable.see kapelanski johnson,cir smith ne,cir.we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and will uphold the jury verdict if a reasonable basis in the record supports it.kapelanski,at.
under illinois law,a plaintiff bringing a medical malpractice action has the burden of proving the proper standard of care for the defendant physicians an unskilled or negligent failure to comply with the appropriate standard and a resulting injury proximately caused by the physicians failure of skill or care.jinkins evangelical hosps,d,citing purtill hess,walski tiesenga.generally,these elements must be established through expert testimony.see addison whittenberg.in this case,wipf attempted to persuade the jury that the standard of care required absolute certainty in the identification of the biliary anatomy and that this standard is always violated when a surgeon misidentifies and cuts the wrong duct.the jury acceptance of kleier testimony was critical for her to prevail on these points he opined that all injuries like wipf result from negligence per se.
of course,kleier was not the only expert testimony about the standard of care that the jury heard.peckler agreed surgeons must be certain about anatomy identification but differed from kleier as to what certain meant in this context.peckler explained that a surgeon who uses accepted identification tech
