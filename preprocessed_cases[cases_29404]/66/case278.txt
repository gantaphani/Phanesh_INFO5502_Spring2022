background 
on september,plaintiff rick bradley was diagnosed with a fractured ventricular lead to his pacemaker after being admitted to a hospital emergency room with chest pain.this ventricular lead was implanted seventeen years earlier in as part of a pacemaker bradley received to treat a cardiac rhythm disturbance known as sick sinus syndrome.in,bradley experienced a problem with his pacemaker and consulted with defendant who was a member of the galichia medical group gmed,the other defendant in this case.bradley complained that his left arm was shaking and that his pacemaker jumped.as treatment,reprogrammed bradley pacemaker.
four years later,in september of,assisted by demosthenes klonis,another gmed physician,replaced bradley pacemaker but reused the ventricular leads from the old pacemaker.in august of,bradley again experienced problems with his pacemaker after being involved in a car accident.as treatment,klonis replaced the generator of bradley pacemaker but left the ventricular leads untouched.
in february of,bradley was admitted to a hospital emergency room complaining of heart palpitations,lightheadedness,and left arm numbness.no heart or pacemaker problem was diagnosed at that time.while bradley was soon released from the hospital,his symptoms continued.soon thereafter,in march of bradley consulted about his health problems with who diagnosed him as having an inner ear problem.this diagnosis was repeated by during visits with bradley in may and june of.following the june consultation,wrote that bradley pacemaker was perfectly adjusted and bradley symptoms of vertigo and partial paralysis were due to an inner ear problem and shingles.
on april,bradley testified before an administrative law judge in order to receive social security disability benefits.at that hearing,bradley testified that he suffered dizziness,numbness,and had been feeling generally poor.bradley also testified that in his opinion,his symptoms were caused by his pacemaker.one week later,bradley consulted with a cardiologist,candice morgan,who traced his symptoms potentially to his pacemaker and performed more programming adjustments.the next day,bradley reported to morgan that his symptoms abated and was told to return in six months for a pacemaker evaluation.
four months later,on september,bradley was admitted to the emergency room where it was determined that the ultimate cause of his illness was a fractured ventricular lead.on september,bradley filed suit against and gmed for medical malpractice and fraudulent concealment in the united states district court for the district of kansas,asserting diversity jurisdiction.
the district court order 
bradley asserted a medical malpractice and fraudulent concealment claim against,and the galichia medical group,on september,in his federal court suit.interpreting state law,the district court granted summary judgment on both of these claims based upon the two year statute of limitations on such claims.memorandum and order,d.in granting summary judgment on the medical malpractice claims,the district judge first noted that any cause of action bradley could assert against for acts occurring before september,was seemingly barred by kansas four year statute of repose.c.the district court,however,declined to grant summary judgment on that ground because of the possibility that had engaged in fraudulent concealment from to after september which would equitably estop from asserting the statute of repose.
the district court,however,found that the possibility of fraudulent concealment did not bar application of the statute of limitations because by may of,based upon information he received from morgan,bradley knew that his physical problems were due to his pacemaker and,therefore,that had misdiagnosed him.this knowledge,reasoned the district court,also served to render inoperative any concealment by.and,since the statute of limitations is triggered when the fact of injury becomes reasonably ascertainable,the district court held that the statute of limitations was triggered in may of.accordingly,as bradley did not file suit until september,more then two years after may of,his medical malpractice claims were barred.
the district court granted summary judgment on the fraudulent concealment claims on virtually identical grounds as the medical malpractice claims.the district court first noted that fraudulent concealment claims are governed by a statute of limitations identical to that for medical two year statute of limitations that is triggered when the fact of injury becomes reasonably ascertainable.the district court then reasoned that since bradley became aware of his misdiagnosis by in may of,he also became aware of any attempt by to conceal this fact.accordingly,the district court held that the statute of limitations was triggered in may of and bradley fraudulent concealment claims were barred.
in addition to granting summary judgment for,the district court denied bradley motion to amend his complaint to add a direct negligence claim against gmed in the creation and management of bradley records.the district court so ruled because the claims which bradley sought to bring against gmed resulted in the same injuries as those from the medical malpractice claims brought against and,therefore,would be barred by the statute of limitations for the same reasons.bradley now appeals.
