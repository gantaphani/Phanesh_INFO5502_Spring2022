the,charles leatherbury,appeals from final judgments entered by the superior court that dismissed his complaint as to all defendants on the basis that it was barred by the applicable statute of limitations.the superior court rejected leatherbury contention that he had tolled the statute of limitations by complying with the notice of intent to investigate provisions of title,section of the delaware code.the superior court ruled that leatherbury efforts at complying with the statute had failed because he sent those notices of intent via federal express rather than by certified mail,return receipt requested.we have concluded that the judgments of the superior court must be affirmed.
this negligence action arises from medical care that was provided to leatherbury,by the,christiana care health services,cchs,bertram greenspun and brian sarter.leatherbury was a patient in christiana hospital from april,through may.on april,leatherbury underwent a coronary angiography procedure.he was subsequently diagnosed with a resulting right pseudoaneurysm.leatherbury had cardiac bypass surgery on april.he was transferred to the wilmington hospital rehabilitation facility christiana rehabilitation facility on may.
leatherbury was discharged from that facility on may.after his release,the pseudoaneurysm redeveloped and leatherbury was admitted to christiana hospital for treatment.his treatment included a resection in the operating room.the complaint alleges the defendants were negligent in failing to instruct leatherbury regarding care and maintenance of the site of the catheterization in the event that the condition redeveloped,so as to avoid future complications.
on april,leatherbury attorney sent defendants greenspun,cchs and sarter,by federal express notice of intent to investigate.the letters constituting the notice of intent stated 
please be advised we have been retained by leatherbury to investigate possible medical negligence with respect to complications from a cardiac catheterization and subsequent lower extremity nerve damage performed on or about april.the purpose of this letter is to provide you with notice of intent to investigate these claims pursuant to.

statute of limitations 
the applicable statute of limitations in this medical malpractice action is two years an injured party may toll the statute of limitations for ninety days,however,if he or she complies with section of the delaware code which relevantly provides 
a plaintiff may toll the above statutes of limitations for a period of time up to days from the applicable limitations contained in this section by sending a notice of intent to investigate to each potential defendant s by certified mail,return receipt requested,at the defendant s regular place of business.the notice shall state the name of the potential defendant s,the potential plaintiff and give a brief description of the issue being investigated by plaintiff counsel.the days shall run from the last day of the applicable statute of limitations contained in this section.the notice shall not be filed with the court.if suit is filed after the applicable statute of limitations in this section,but before the day period in this section expires,a copy of the notice shall be attached to the complaint to prove compliance with the statute of limitations 
the superior court dismissed leatherbury complaint,as time barred,because he did not send his notices of intent to investigate in strict accordance with the statute.
issue on appeal 
the question that must be answered in this appeal is whether section permits compliance by sending a notice of intent to investigate via a means other than certified mail,return receipt requested.leatherbury contends that section is a remedial statute and,therefore,should be construed liberally.accordingly,leatherbury argues,his failure to comply with the statute by sending a notice of intent to investigate by federal express instead of by registered mail should have tolled the statute of limitations.therefore,his complaint should not have been dismissed as untimely.the argue that the statute is not subject to judicial interpretation because it is unambiguous.
this court reviews a final judgment granting a motion to dismiss de novo this court also reviews statutory construction rulings de novo to determine whether the superior court erred as a matter of law in formulating or applying legal precepts 
statutory construction generally 
it is that unambiguous statutes are not subject to judicial interpretation if the statute as a whole is unambiguous and there is no reasonable doubt as to the meaning of the words used,the court role is limited to an application of the literal meaning of those words.accordingly,the first step in any statutory construction requires us to examine the text of the statute to determine if it is ambiguous under delaware law,a statute is ambiguous if first,it is reasonably susceptible to different conclusions or interpretations or second,a literal interpretation of the words of the statute would lead to an absurd or unreasonable result that could not have been intended by the legislature 
certified meaning 
title,section of the delaware code requires the use of certified mail,return receipt requested.the general assembly has decreed that words and phrases in statutes shall be read in context,and be construed according to the common and approved usage of the english language.we have determined that the term certified mail has a common usage with only one meaning that does not include delivery by federal express.
the term certified mail,as defined by the dictionary,means first class mail for which proof of delivery is secured but no indemnity value is claimed.the term mail refers to letters,packages,sent or delivered by the postal service.the term postal service,in turn,refers to the post office,which is defined as an office or station of a governmental postal system at which mail is received and sorted,from which it is dispatched and distributed.
we hold,in this case,that the applicable statutory provision is not reasonably susceptible to different conclusions or interpretations the ability to toll the statute of limitations is limited and that limited method for tolling is clearly set forth in section.a plaintiff may toll the running of the statute of limitations for ninety days by sending a notice of intent to investigate only by certified mail,return receipt requested.we further hold that the term certified mail does not include delivery through private carriers,such as delivery by federal express 
legislature intended result 
if a statute is not reasonably susceptible to different conclusions or interpretations,courts must apply the words as written,unless the result of such a literal application could not have been intended by the legislature this court has recognized that the main reason for the passage of the delaware medical malpractice act was the concern over the law extant at the time of its passage and the rising costs of malpractice liability insurance as this court noted in christiana hospital fattori 
prior to the enactment of the medical malpractice act of the act,medical malpractice actions were governed by chapter of title,pertaining to personal actions.the delaware general assembly adopted the act in response to increasing costs of insurance coverage for health care providers and out of concern for the potentially period of limitations established in this court decision in layton allen.citations omitted.included in the act was section of title,which reimposes a definite statute of limitations upon medical malpractice actions with only two limited exceptions 
the preamble of the medical malpractice act of is also instructive,and provides 
whereas,the general assembly determined it is necessary to make certain modifications to its current legal system as it relates to health care malpractice claims if the citizens of delaware are to cont
