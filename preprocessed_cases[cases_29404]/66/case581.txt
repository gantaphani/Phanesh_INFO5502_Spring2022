background 
the proceedings below were conducted in the context of the following legal principles.in an action for legal malpractice the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant attorney owed the plaintiff a duty of due care arising from the relationship that the defendant breached that duty and that as a proximate result,the plaintiff suffered injury sexton smith,in the form of actual damages eastman messner.even if negligence on the part of the attorney is established,no action will lie against the attorney unless that negligence proximately caused damage to the client.northern illinois emergency physicians landau,omahana kopka.
in cases involving litigation,no legal malpractice exists unless the attorney negligence resulted in the loss of an underlying cause of action.accordingly,the burden of pleading and proving actual damages requires establishing that but for the attorney negligence,the client would have been successful in the underlying suit.see sheppard krol,d,claire associates pontikes,d,bartholomew crockett,d.in a legal malpractice action alleging that an attorney failed to perfect an appeal,the client must prove that he or she would have been successful on appeal if the appeal had properly been perfected.see environmental control systems,long,d,gillion tieman,d,to succeed in her malpractice claim,plaintiff would have been required to prove damages caused by the defendant failure to file a timely notice of appeal.to prove damages,she would have to show that an appeal would have been successful accord jones psimos,cir same applying indiana law.thus,a legal malpractice plaintiff must litigate a case within a case.see eastman,at,collecting authorities.these principles provide the lens through which we view the following pertinent facts.
underlying case the automobile accident 
the trial of the underlying case adduced the following pertinent facts.galena road has two lanes and runs generally.in,the county assumed authority over galena road,commissioned a preconstruction profile of the road,and developed an improvement plan.the county resurfaced the road and striped the center of the road with a,or broken yellow line,indicating that passing vehicles is permissible.
expert testimony established that the placement of the broken yellow line conformed with guidelines on adequate sight distances mandated by the illinois manual on uniform traffic control devices illinois manual formerly codified at.et,now published as illinois department of transportation,illinois manual on uniform traffic control devices.pursuant to these guidelines,passing vehicles is permissible only where sight distances are adequate.if an engineering study concludes that sight distances are inadequate,a zone must be installed.in,the illinois manual lowered the minimal sight distance.this reduction rendered inadequate the sight distance on that portion of galena road where the accident subsequently occurred.in,the county resurfaced galena road and restriped the center of the road with the same broken yellow line that it had placed in.
on a november evening in,sandra wittenmyer was driving westbound on galena road.aaron gesell was driving eastbound.as gesell was passing another eastbound vehicle,he collided with wittenmyer in the westbound lane.gesell and wittenmyer automobiles collided at the apex of a rise in galena road.gesell was traveling at a speed significantly higher than the posted speed limit.gesell stated that he passed the eastbound vehicle ahead of him because he knew that a broken yellow line indicated that passing vehicles was permissible.also,according to gesell,he was not aware that the rise in galena road would have obstructed his view of oncoming traffic.as a result of the collision,wittenmyer suffered severe and permanent injuries.
in january,sandra and her husband filed a lawsuit against gesell.in october,the wittenmyers added the county as a defendant and gesell brought a contribution action against the county.between november and june,gie,the county insurer,retained the dickson defendants and the judge defendants to represent the county.
through its attorneys,the county moved for summary judgment,contending that section of the local governmental and governmental employees tort immunity act tort immunity act ilcs west immunized the county from liability.the trial court denied the county motion for summary judgment,and the case proceeded to a jury trial.on october,the jury returned a verdict in favor of the wittenmyers.the jury awarded million in damages to sandra against gesell and the county,apportioning of the fault to gesell and of the fault to the county.the jury also awarded in damages to sandra husband.on gesell counterclaim against the county,the jury found the county at fault.
on november,the county filed a posttrial motion.the county also moved to file a supplemental posttrial motion,alleging that its attorneys had only very recently received the report of proceedings.on december,the trial court denied both of the county motions.
on december,the county filed a notice of appeal from the judgment entered on the jury verdict and from the trial court denial of its posttrial motions.on the same day,the county also presented to the trial court an emergency motion for leave to file a supplemental posttrial motion.the emergency motion was premised on the impending appeal deadline of january,days after the trial court december,denial of the county posttrial motions.the county alleged that,based on this deadline,it was necessary for the county to seek leave to file a supplemental posttrial motion,which contained five additional grounds for reversal based upon trial errors.the trial court granted the motion in an order stating final orders not having been entered in this cause,the time for filing notice of appeal in this matter is hereby extended until a final order is entered.
on january,the county filed an amended supplemental posttrial motion.on february,the trial court denied the motion,ruling that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion and,alternatively,that the motion was denied as a matter of substance.on march,the county filed a motion with the appellate court,second district,seeking leave to amend its notice of appeal to include the trial court february order denying the county supplemental posttrial motion.the appellate court initially granted the motion,but on may,the appellate court vacated that order and struck the county march amended notice of appeal.the appellate court also denied wittenmyer and gesell motions to dismiss the appeal,finding that the county december,notice of appeal preserved the grounds raised in the county first posttrial motion.
on july,gesell filed a motion in the appellate court,contending that the county december,notice of appeal was prematurely filed and the county never filed a new notice of appeal.on december,the appellate court,in an unpublished order,reversed its prior ruling that the december,notice of appeal was timely.wittenmyer gesell,d,december,unpublished order under supreme court rule.in its order,the appellate court stated that the county was required to withdraw its december,notice of appeal when it simultaneously filed its supplemental posttrial motion.the appellate court observed that,after the trial court denied the county amended supplemental posttrial motion on february,the county failed to file a timely notice of appeal.therefore,the appellate court held that the county original notice of appeal was premature and ineffectual.consequently,according to the appellate court,the county march,motion to amend its notice of appeal was also without effect.the appellate court denied the county request for reconsideration,and this court denied the county petition for leave to appeal.wittenmyer gesell,table.
malpractice action 
gie and the county brought this legal malpractice action against judge individually and his law firm and successor law firm,and dickson individually and her law firm.in their ultimate complaint,plaintiffs pled the requisite elements.plaintiffs pled the element of duty.plaintiffs alleged that they had an relationship with defendants regarding the underlying case,whereby defendants had a duty to represent plaintiffs with the reasonable care,skill and diligence possessed by attorneys who,in the case of defendants,held themselves out to the public as having specialized experience in the handling of trial,matters and appeal of civil cases such as the underlying case.plaintiffs also alleged that defendants agreed to continue representing the interests of plaintiffs including,but not limited to,taking the steps necessary to overturn the adverse judgment in wittenmyer including,but not limited to,pursuing an appeal on the merits.
plaintiffs pled breach of the duty.plaintiffs alleged that,for the reasons expressed by the appellate court in its december,rule order,defendants breached their duties owed to plaintiffs and failed to properly preserve kendall county appellate rights concerning the adverse judgment in the underlying case.further,defendants conduct constituted a breach of defendants duty to exercise reasonable care,skill and diligence on behalf of plaintiffs.
plaintiffs pled the elements of proximate cause and damages.plaintiffs alleged but for the negligence of defendants,the appeal in wittenmyer would have been successful,and the judgment against kendall county would have been overturned.plaintiffs also alleged that as a result of defendants negligence,plaintiffs sustained damages including payment of the judgment and accrued interest entered against the county,the lost time and value of the monies paid by plaintiffs in satisfaction of the judgment,and plaintiffs legal expenses for preparation of an appeal that the county was denied the opportunity to pursue.according to plaintiffs,the damages they had sustained were proximately caused by the breach of duties by defendants,as set forth above.
discovery ensued.in an interrogatory,defendants asked plaintiffs to state the legal grounds plaintiffs were alleging that the appellate court would have reversed the judgment against the county in the underlying case.plaintiffs answered that,had the underlying appeal been perfected,the meritorious ground for reversal would have been what defendant judge had advised plaintiffs,governmental tort immunity pursuant to several sections of the tort immunity act.
plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on the issues of duty and breach of duty.plaintiffs contended that the circuit court could determine defendants breach of duty as a matter of law based solely on the appellate court order in wittenmyer gesell,d,december,unpublished order under supreme court rule.defendants responded and filed a joint for summary judgment,contending that the issue of breach of duty was one of fact for the jury,which must generally be established through expert testimony.at the close of a hearing on march,the circuit court found that the record in the underlying case,including the appellate court dismissal of the underlying appeal in wittenmyer gesell,d,december,unpublished order under supreme court rule,established the factual record upon which the court could rule.the circuit court granted plaintiffs motion for partial summary judgment and denied defendants for summary judgment.the court found that defendants owed plaintiffs a duty to perfect the appeal and that defendants failure to do so constituted a breach of that duty.the court then scheduled further proceedings on the issues of proximate cause and damages.
defendants subsequently filed a joint motion for summary judgment on the issues of proximate cause and damages.defendants contended that,regardless of whether they had perfected the appeal in the underlying case,the appeal would not have been successful.defendants argued that,had the appellate court in the underlying case reviewed the county appeal on the merits,the court would not have reversed the judgment in the underlying case.defendants also contended that the circuit court,and not a jury,should decide the question of whether the appeal of the underlying case would have been successful.opposing the motion for summary judgment,plaintiffs contended that the tort immunity arguments defendants asserted on behalf of the county in the underlying case were correct and,had defendants competently perfected the underlying appeal,the appellate court would have reversed the judgment entered against the county.plaintiffs also contended that the circuit court should deny defendants motion for summary judgment because the question of the hypothetical outcome of the county dismissed appeal was a question of fact for a jury.
at the close of a hearing,the circuit court ruled that the issue of proximate cause in an appellate legal malpractice action is a question of law that should be decided by the court.the parties then agreed that the circuit court would set the case for an oral argument,and that the circuit court would confine its review to the trial court record and the appellate briefs in the underlying case.
the circuit court held a hearing in which the parties argued the governmental tort immunity issue that was briefed to the appellate court in the underlying case.in a written order,the circuit court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,finding that the appellate court in the underlying case would not have reversed the judgment based on the immunity issue.the circuit court analysis focused on section of the tort immunity act ilcs west.the circuit court interpreted section as immunizing only the failure to initially provide traffic control devices,and not the incorrect placement of those devices.the court reasoned that if the county had failed to stripe galena road at all,it would have been immunized under section.however,according to the circuit court,the county initially acted by installing the zone in.further,when the county restriped the road in,the county was obliged to do so in compliance with the illinois manual but failed to do so.therefore,according to the circuit court,the trial court in the underlying case was correct to deny the county motion for summary judgment based on section immunity.consequently,the circuit court concluded that the appellate court would have affirmed the trial court decision regarding governmental tort immunity and would not have reversed the judgment against the county in the underlying case.
plaintiffs appealed the circuit court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on the proximate cause issue.the judge defendants and the dickson defendants not only defended the summary judgment on the issue of proximate cause,but also raised alternative grounds for affirming the judgment.a divided panel of the appellate court affirmed the circuit court grant of summary judgment to the defendants on the issue of proximate cause.d.initially,the appellate court held that the proximate cause issue was an issue of law for a court to decide and not a question of fact for a jury.d at.the court next held that section of the tort immunity act did not immunize the county in the underlying case.the court reasoned that the restriping of galena road did not constitute an initial failure to place a traffic control device,which section immunizes,but rather an improper placement of a traffic control device,which section does not immunize.consequently,the appellate court agreed with the circuit court that,in the underlying case,the trial court correctly rejected the county assertion of section immunity,and the appellate court would have affirmed the judgment.therefore,in the legal malpractice action,the appellate court upheld the circuit court grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants on the issue of proximate cause.d at.
presiding justice cook dissented solely on the issue of section immunity.d at,cook,dissenting.the dissenting justice disagreed with the majority characterization of the county action as the improper placement of a passing zone.rather,the dissenting justice viewed the county action as failing to initially provide a zone.presiding justice cook reasoned 
it is incorrect to say that a broken yellow line is a passing zone.rather,the absence of a solid yellow line is a passing zone.even a roadway without a centerline is a passing zone.the absence of the solid yellow line does not interfere with the integrity of the broken yellow line.d at,cook,dissenting.
the dissenting justice opined that the failure to initially place this traffic roadway marking,the solid yellow line,was immunized under section.d at,cook,dissenting.neither the appellate court majority nor the dissent mentioned defendants alternative grounds for affirming the circuit court judgment.
we allowed gie and the county petition for leave to appeal.a.we subsequently granted leave to the following to file amicus curiae briefs in support of gie and the county illinois association of county engineers,intergovernmental risk management agency,property casualty insurers association of america,and cook county.we also granted leave to the illinois trial lawyers association to file an amicus curiae brief in support of defendants.see.additional pertinent background will be discussed in the context of our analysis of the issues.
ii.analysis 
before this court,plaintiffs assign error to the two holdings of the appellate court the proximate cause issue was an issue of law for the court to decide,and section of the tort immunity act did not immunize the county in the underlying case.not limiting their contentions to a defense of the appellate court reasoning,defendants offer an alternative ground for affirming the summary judgment in their favor.further,solely if this court overturns the summary judgment in their favor,defendants request,as,that we reverse the partial summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs on the issues of duty and breach of duty.however,a court may assume,arguendo,the existence of a duty and its breach to address the issue of proximate cause.abrams city of chicago.because our review of the two issues that the appellate court addressed is sufficient to resolve this appeal,we need not and do not discuss defendants alternative contentions.see,abrams,at.
proximate cause question of law or fact 
prior to granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on the issue of proximate cause,the circuit court ruled that the issue of proximate cause in an appellate legal malpractice action is a question of law for the court to decide and not a question of fact for a jury.the appellate court upheld this ruling.d at.
generally,the issue of what is the proximate cause of an injury is a question of fact for a jury to determine based on its consideration of all of the evidence.kalata,quoting davis marathon oil,quoting neering illinois central.specifically the issue of proximate causation in a legal malpractice setting is generally considered a factual issue to be decided by the trier of fact.renshaw black,d,and cases cited therein.this court has explained that issues that could cause reasonable persons to reach different results should never be determined as questions of law.the debatable qualities of issues such as proximate cause,the fact that persons might reach different conclusions,emphasize the appropriateness of leaving such issues to a body,the jury.ney yellow cab.
in the present case,plaintiffs contend that the issue of whether defendants appellate legal malpractice proximately caused plaintiffs injury was likewise a question of fact for a jury to determine.plaintiffs argue that the appellate court holding in the present case distinguishes attorneys who commit appellate malpractice from other negligent professionals,and insulates negligent appellate attorneys from a jury determination of whether their negligence caused injury.plaintiffs go so far as to argue that this result violates the right to a jury trial as guaranteed by the illinois constitution.const,art.i.we can not accept plaintiffs contention.
it is quite settled that t he interpretation of a statute is a matter of law for the court and appropriate for summary judgment.county of knox ex rel.masterson v.the highlands,collecting cases.this principle does not usurp the role of a jury,but rather reflects the constitutionally recognized role of the court to interpret and declare the law.the illinois constitution places the state judicial power in the courts.const,art.vi.the application of principles of law is inherently a judicial function.wright central du page hospital ass n,see environmental control systems,d at,stating that the judicial power includes the power to determine and analyze the applicable law.
in this appellate legal malpractice action,the negligence that plaintiffs alleged defendants committed was the failure to perfect the appeal to the appellate court in the underlying case.accordingly,for plaintiffs to prevail,they must prove that,but for defendants failure,the appellate court in the underlying case would have held that the tort immunity act immunized the county from liability.in other words if the county should not have been afforded protection from the verdict under the tort immunity act,then defendants failure to perfect the appeal was not the proximate cause of the county damages.d at.thus,the success of plaintiffs legal malpractice action rests upon the question of how the appellate court in the underlying case would have interpreted the tort immunity act.this was a question of law for the circuit court.
the circuit court determination of the correct interpretation of the tort immunity act and whether the county should be immune thereunder does not turn on questions of fact.we agree with the appellate court that whether defendants told plaintiffs prior to the appeal of the underlying traffic accident case that the appellate court was likely to reverse based upon tort immunity and whether such statement was truthful does not affect the proper application of the tort immunity act.d at.
although this case presents an issue of statutory interpretation,which is clearly an issue of law for the court,we do not see how the issue of proximate cause in an appellate legal malpractice action could be a question of fact for a jury.the issue of proximate cause in an appellate legal malpractice action must be made by the trial judge as an issue of law,based on review of the transcript and record of the underlying action,the argument of counsel,and subject to the same rules of review as should have been applied to the underlying appeal.mallen smith,legal malpractice,at.
indeed,the vast majority of courts that have addressed this issue have concluded that the issue of proximate cause in an appellate legal malpractice action presents a question of law for the court and not a question of fact for a jury.in addition to the appellate court panel in the present case,the appellate court in environmental control systems,d at,so held.other decisions so holding include richards knuchel,discussing cases,steeves bernstein,shur,sawyer nelson,me agreeing with n umerous courts that have recognized rule,sturgis skokos,agreeing with majority rule,millhouse wiesenthal,collecting cases,daugert pappas,collecting cases,tinelli redl,cir collecting cases applying new york law,and jones psimos,cir applying indiana law.the rationale for these decisions is clear.the overall inquiry is whether the client would have been successful if the attorney had timely filed the appeal.underlying the broad inquiry,however,are
