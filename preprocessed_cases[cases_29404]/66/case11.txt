haddad motor group hmg,a car dealership in pittsfield,massachusetts,sued its former accounting firm,karp,ackerman,skabowski hogan,kash,and one of the partners,peter hogan hogan,over allegedly negligent tax advice.hmg recovered damages and attorneys fees.the accountants appeal is now before us.we summarize the background events and the proceedings,drawing primarily from the opinion of the district court and a report by the magistrate judge 
george haddad,the owner of hmg,retained kash as hmg accountant in december.just over six months before,hmg had executed a transaction to finance the purchase of a second car dealership.at the time,hmg owned shares of bankboston stock then worth almost to make use of the stock without immediately incurring a capital gains tax by selling it,hmg borrowed an equivalent amount of the same stock from painewebber paying interest for this privilege and pledging to replace the borrowed shares with its own shares at a later date.
hmg then sold the borrowed shares to finance the purchase of the dealership.this effectively deferred capital gains taxes on its own shares until the transaction was closed out by a later transfer of hmg shares to painewebber to replace the borrowed ones that had been sold.thus,eventually hmg had to relinquish its shares and realize the gains,and the cost of delaying this realization was the rent that it had to pay painewebber until the shares it had loaned hmg were replaced by hmg own shares.
in late and during,haddad and hogan had discussions on the tax position of haddad and his dealerships,the possible closing of the transaction,the conversion of hmg from a subchapter c to a subchapter s corporation,and the use of losses of the new dealership to offset gains to hmg.a subchapter c corporation pays taxes on its income a subchapter s corporation does not its income is attributed to its shareholders,who report that income and pay taxes on it personally.see chesterton,chesterton,cir.
in december,george haddad and hmg controller,desiree croteau,met with kash hogan both sides agree that at this meeting they discussed whether hmg should the transaction and whether hmg should convert to a subchapter s corporation.just what advice was given was disputed at blamed kash for misadvising him on these is not critical to this appeal because the accountants were found liable because of the timing of tax payments,not because of the transactions themselves.
on february,hmg closed out the transaction,realizing a capital gain of approximately on its bankboston stock.on march,hmg converted to a subchapter s corporation retroactive to january.although normally a subchapter s corporation is not a entity,hmg became liable for a tax of approximately on the gains because hmg had converted from subchapter c to subchapter s status and the stock dated from when hmg was a subchapter c corporation.the tax could have been avoided if hmg had converted to subchapter s status and kept the transaction open for years 
the transaction was closed in the first quarter of,which meant hmg should have estimated its tax liability at that time and begun making or increasing quarterly installment payments to the irs based on that estimate hmg failed to make such payments,giving rise to additional liability for underpayment.in december,kash informed george haddad that hmg was liable for the tax and recommended that hmg delay filing its taxes from march to september,the given reason being an audit of hmg tax return by the irs.
subsequently,on march,kash filed a form with the irs to extend the deadline for filing hmg taxes until september.the extension form required an estimate of the tentative tax due and payment of that amount,but kash omitted any reference to the large tax that was due and instead listed the tentative tax as only.hmg did not pay the much larger tax until october,making itself potentially liable for penalties and interest.
the outcome was that the irs imposed a penalty of on hmg for failing to make estimated quarterly payments on the tax in and imposed interest of for delaying payment in from march until october it abated any penalty for the delay in payment in after a new accountant blamed this delay on kash.massachusetts,which apparently received some estimated payments but not enough,imposed a penalty of and interest of for the delay in payment of the balance of the tax in.
in december,hmg sued kash in massachusetts state court,and kash removed the suit to the federal district court based on diversity jurisdiction.the complaint focused on two charges that kash gave faulty advice in recommending that hmg the transaction and convert to a subchapter s corporation and that in an attempt to delay facing up to the adverse tax consequences of those transactions,kash caused hmg to incur unnecessary penalties and interest.hmg claims,as finally presented,asserted negligence and a violation of chapter.law.ch.
the jury found that kash had been negligent as to the failures to make timely payments,but the damages awarded were solely for federal and state interest and penalties incurred from march,the date on which hmg tentative taxes were due until october,when the tax was paid.the jury awarded nothing for the other penalties the irs imposed on hmg for failing to make quarterly installment payments in.
the jury also awarded nothing on the claim that kash negligently advised hmg on the subchapter s conversion and closing the transaction.the jury could have thought kash advice on these transactions or that hmg suffered no damages as it was unlikely to have kept the transaction open for years while continuing to pay rent on the borrowed stock.in all events,hmg does not challenge the jury verdict so far as it was adverse to hmg.
on the chapter claim,the jury gave an advisory verdict rejecting any award,possibly concluding that the underpayment on the extension was mere negligence and did not reach the chapter threshold of wrongdoing but the trial trier of fact as to this for hmg,concluding that kash had violated section of chapter by deceiving hmg as to the required payments and had knowingly misstated hmg tentative tax due on the extension form in march.
further,the trial judge expanded the damage award.although the jury awarded only the amount of interest and penalties imposed on hmg after march,date on which hmg tentative taxes were judge added to that amount for a total of based on the irs penalty imposed on hmg for not making quarterly estimated payments in after the transaction had been closed.the trial judge then trebled the total to,as chapter permits,based on a further finding of a willful or knowing violation by kash.laws ch.further adjustments for interest,and then for a recalculation of interest,led to a final damage award of.
then,after proceedings before and a recommendation by a magistrate judge,the district court awarded hmg in attorneys fees and in costs.unlike the exemplary double or triple damages permitted by section,an award of attorneys fees for the prevailing plaintiff is mandatory for a chapter violation.laws ch.kash has now appealed from both the judgment imposing damage liability and the later award of attorneys fees and costs,and we have consolidated the two appeals.
in this court kash adopts a kitchen sink approach,challenging numerous district court rulings on multiple grounds but the main attacks are directed against the court chapter findings,which undergird the treble damages and attorneys fees awards,and against the calculation of attorneys fees.this being a diversity case,massachusetts substantive law applies.gasperini ctr.for humanities,d.the standard of review varies with the individual claim of error.
kash first argues that the district judge underlying his chapter verdict was clearly erroneous and warrants reversal,focusing on three subsidiary findings.two of the district judge statements challenged by kash concern the tax consequences of closing the transaction and converting to a subchapter s corporation read carefully,neither statement is inaccurate one does hinge on the possibility that,had haddad fully understood the tax consequences,he would have kept the transaction open for more years,but the judge made no finding on the point.
anyway,neither supposed error matters because chapter liability was not imposed with respect to kash advice to hmg on these transactions rather,chapter liability was imposed because of kash allegedly deceptive conduct in concealing the tax liability from hmg by not advising hmg of the need to make quarterly tax payments in and by filing in march an extension form listing the wrong amount of tentative tax.an error on either of the points kash raises would not undercut the award based on this other conduct by kash.
the third and more pertinent subsidiary finding attacked by kash is the finding that the accountants were responsible for hmg failure to pay the tentative tax due by march.kash claims hmg understood its liability for the extra tax and deliberately underpaid in order to conserve cash.there was conflict on this point and some of the evidence was helpful to kash position,but the trial judge position was supported by detailed findings and is not clearly erroneous.we need not repeat his explanation because kash attack is itself defective.
it is of no use for kash to cite to or even describe evidence in its favor without also discussing the evidence the other way and showing by analysis why no reasonable judge or jury could decide the issue against it.united states mccarthy,cir,cert.denied,d,d.importantly,kash does not explain its own patent understatement of the taxes due when it filed an extension form.the jury and the trial judge agreed that kash was at fault for that although not to the same degree.
kash alternatively argues that its conduct did not rise to the level of rascality needed to establish a chapter violation,damon sun,cir,but this seriously partly on the premise that hmg was properly advised as to the need to make its tentative tax payment in march and chose to conserve cash.the trial judge found that kash failed to give proper advice so as to conceal the adverse tax consequences of its earlier advice and,further,found that kash knowingly provided false information to the irs about the tax due when filing the extension form.this is enough,whatever the standard of appellate review governing the rascality label 
kash next claims that the judge erred by meeting with the jury,after the jury rendered its own verdict,to ask them about their advisory verdict on the chapter claim.kash theory is not that the jury verdict should be overturned on this basis,but that this conversation influenced the judge chapter decision.the district judge,however,told the parties that he would speak with the jurors and kash did not object,leaving kash dependant on showing plain error.united states,cir,cert.denied,d.
kash claims it did not object because it did not expect the district judge to talk to the jury about its deliberations,but the judge told counsel that he was going to talk to the jury and then advise you counsel as to what the jury says about negligence damages if kash wanted specific limitations on what was discussed or objected to any discussion,it should have said so then.kash says that the discussion was harmful to it but it gives no persuasive reason for thinking that the discussion altered the result and,whatever the advisability of the judge consultation,the demanding standard of plain error has not been met.see united states olano,d 
relatedly,kash says the district court erred in denying kash later requests for admissions as to what the judge told the parties about his communications with the jury.kash argument is hard to decipher,but the point is subsumed by our prior discussion.kash did not object beforehand,and an inquiry after the event,about a judge and jury discussion to which it did not object and that can not be undone,comes too late save,perhaps,in extraordinary circumstances not here present.
a more serious claim is kash attack on the calculation of damages,homing in on the fact that the delay in paying its taxes gave hmg the use of the money in the meantime.there was evidence at trial not seriously disputed by hmg that hmg earned about percent on the withheld funds kash says both that hmg deliberately intended to underpay its taxes and that,anyway,the benefits to hmg of not paying offset any interest and penalties imposed by the irs and state tax authorities.the first point was a disputed issue resolved by both jury and judge against kash and is not seriously developed.
the second point might be a basis for reducing damages if a remand for that purpose was what kash now sought.the jury seemingly allowed no offset and the judge even more clearly did not do so.whether an offset should be allowed could be regarded as a policy choice,restatement second of torts cmt.b collateral source rule,but the massachusetts case neither party well favor such an offset hmg does not attempt to explain why,given the testimony as to hmg use of an interest paying account for spare cash and evidence about the rate paid,there should be no offset.
however,kash has not asked for a recalculation that reduces damages,but rather for a determination that there were no net damages,and even a percent return on withheld payments would not show that.whether the tax authorities imposition is regarded as interest,a penalty,or some combination of the two,the total paid by hmg appears to exceed what it could have earned in interest.the gap is not bridged by speculation by kash that hmg benefitted in some unspecified amount because withholding payment made its capital position better at least in appearance.
kash gambit is understandable.a remand might marginally reduce the damages,although not by much because under chapter the offset might be made only after the gross loss was computed and trebled litigating on remand to achieve a minor reduction would cost kash money and might add to attorneys fees for hmg,and kash would still owe the huge attorneys fees already awarded,unless it could get them reduced or nullified on independent grounds.anyway,kash has not sought a remand to recalculate damages so these issues need not be pursued.
kash next argues that the district court erred in assessing in damages before trebling instead of the only in damages awarded by the jury.it claims that the additional in damages added by the trial judge accrued prior to kash march,filing for an extension of time to submit hmg taxes,and that march,was the first day on which a chapter violation could have occurred given the jury finding that kash did not act negligently prior to this date.
the district judge,however,explained that the represent ed the separate penalties imposed on hmg by the irs because hmg failed due to the unfair and deceptive act of kash to make quarterly payments on its liability for the gains tax for tax year.the tax resulted from a transaction and,as already discussed,hmg should have made quarterly installment payments on that amount in.kash nowhere shows that this finding is clear error,nor does kash explain why the jury verdict should foreclose the judge conclusion 
this brings us to the treble damage award.the first argument is that kash chapter violation was not willful or threshold requirement for trebling.laws ch.but the trial judge found that kash had deceived hmg by not telling it to make quarterly installment payments in and further deceived hmg and effectively the irs as well by not revealing the tax liability on the march extension form.kash argument,cursorily made,does not show clear error by the judge.
a more serious objection to the treble damages exists.under section of chapter 
the respondent may tender with his answer in any such action a written offer of settlement for single damages.if such tender or settlement is rejected by the petitioner,and if the court finds that the relief tendered was reasonable in relation to the injury actually suffered by the petitioner,then the court shall not award more than single damages.
laws ch.pertinently,in october and prior to its answer,kash made an offer to settle the case for.ultimately,the single damages ignoring interest kash was found to owe amounted to only,so it says the was a reasonable offer and cuts off treble damages.
