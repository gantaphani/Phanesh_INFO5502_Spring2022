in a previous opinion muller daniel freeman hospitals,wl nonpub.opn,we reversed a jury verdict in favor of university medical center in fresno,which is now known as the fresno community hospital and medical center fch,james davis and sanagaram shantharam,who were defendants in that case.the case was tried again to a jury and again resulted in a jury verdict for fch and shantharam,davis having been dismissed prior to the second trial.the trial court granted the motion for new trial made by plaintiffs manfred muller and rose shoshana.the trial court concluded that it had erred in not allowing plaintiffs to call james london as a rebuttal witness.fch and shantharam appeal from this order.
after the trial court granted the motion for a new trial,the plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions based on alleged discovery abuses on the part of the defendants that were connected with plaintiffs failed attempt to call london as a rebuttal witness.the trial court denied the motion and plaintiffs appeal from that order.
we ordered the two appeals to be consolidated for purposes of record,oral argument and decision.
we affirm the orders granting the new trial and denying the motion for sanctions.
background 
muller,a sculptor living in santa monica,was severely injured on october,when the car he was driving to san francisco went off interstate route and rolled over twice.he was first taken to fch,where he was under the care of davis and shantharam.after days,muller was transferred to daniel freeman hospital in los angeles for rehabilitation.at daniel freeman hospital,muller came under the care of the neurology and rehabilitation medical group nrmg,howard chew and jeffrey bogosian.after a few days,muller was transferred to the ucla medical center,where his left arm between the elbow and wrist was amputated.as we relate below,the fact that the amputation was below the elbow became pivotally important to the second trial.
muller and his wife,rose shoshana,filed an action wherein they sued fch,daniel freeman hospital,nrmg,and davis,shantharam,bogosian and chew.the core of the complaint was that the defendants alleged medical negligence resulted in the amputation of muller arm.rose shoshana sued for loss of consortium.
the case was tried to a jury.evidence was presented from march,to april.the trial court granted directed verdicts to nrmg and chew.the jury returned its special verdict on april,and found that fch and davis,shantharam and bogosian had not been negligent in their diagnosis,care and treatment of muller.the case against daniel freeman hospital was predicated on the theory that bogosian was daniel freeman hospital agent the verdict for bogosian exonerated the hospital.
our previous opinion affirmed the judgment as to daniel freeman hospital and bogosian but reversed as to the remaining defendants,fch and davis and shantharam.in substantial part,our previous opinion was based on our conclusion that the trial court erred in precluding the plaintiffs from calling more than one expert per issue.we found that,under the facts of the case,plaintiffs should have been allowed to call experts retained by defendants daniel freeman hospital,nrmg,and chew and bogosian who would have testified,in agreement with plaintiffs theory of the case,that muller had sustained irreversible injury while hospitalized at fch.according to plaintiffs theory of their case,the injury was caused by a compartment syndrome,a condition that we explained in our previous opinion 
plaintiffs claim against fch and shantharam was based on the theory that muller acquired the compartment syndrome while hospitalized at fch and while he was under shantharam care at that facility.specifically,when he arrived at fch from the accident scene,all four bones in muller left hand were broken.among other treatment,splint dressing was applied to the left hand.according to moulton johnson,plaintiffs expert,danger signals indicating compartment syndrome began appearing on october,muller was admitted on october and intensified through november,
london,who played a pivotal role in the second trial,was also the subject of our previous opinion.the aspect of london role in our previous opinion that is germane to this appeal is that it is clear that london was an expert who had been designated as such by chew 
the second trial 
all experts from both sides agreed that the failure to timely diagnose a compartment syndrome in a hospital setting with a conscious patient is below the standard of care.it was also generally agreed that a tight cast can cause or aggravate an existing compartment syndrome.the question therefore was whether muller sustained such an undiagnosed injury while at fch.according to the plaintiffs experts,the answer was yes.the defense experts,on the other hand,opined that the injury to muller left hand and arm occurred during the crash when he sustained a crush injury.
london,who had been chew expert in the first trial,appeared as one of muller experts in the second trial london,a orthopedic surgeon,testified that muller sustained a compartment syndrome at fch and that if this condition is not treated within six to hours,it results in the death of the muscles in the affected compartment.according to london,shantharam performance was below the standard of care because he failed to diagnose and treat muller compartment syndrome.london did not think that muller had sustained a crush injury.
stuart kushner and clark davis,who had been experts for daniel freeman hospital and nrmg in the first trial,both testified in the second trial that muller sustained a compartment syndrome while at fch.they were joined in this opinion by luther cobb,a general surgeon,clark davis,an orthopedic surgeon specializing in hand surgery,and bogosian not all of these experts found that shantharam fell below the standard of care as an example,clark davis had no opinion on this subject.
four physicians at ucla medical center,including roy meals,the treating orthopedist at ucla medical center,were of the opinion that muller sustained a compartment syndrome.
the first witness called by the plaintiffs testified on august.thereafter,plaintiffs witnesses testified on three successive trial days,on august,august and august.on the fifth trial day,august,the defense called its first witness out of order.on the next day,august,the plaintiffs called one witness and the defense called two witnesses,including michael botte,whose testimony we summarize below.
the testimony that is central to both appeals took place on the next to the last day of testimony,on september.after that day,only muller spouse testified on september.all parties rested after she concluded her short testimony on september.
according to botte testimony given on august,muller never sustained a compartment syndrome but rather a crush injury due to severe trauma to the left arm and wrist.botte also thought that muller had developed a secondary infection at daniel freeman hospital.botte concluded that both shantharam and james davis davis the chief of surgical critical care at fch,complied with the standard of care and that they could have done nothing to alter the sad course of events for muller.
the testimony on september,began with the defense calling davis.davis testified on direct examination that muller never had a compartment syndrome but that he had a dead hand and arm from the crush injury.on,he was asked to explain how it was that muller was allowed to leave fch in fresno without any notation in his medical record that he had a dead hand and arm.davis attempts to answer were not satisfactory and he was asked yet again how it was that muller ended up with a dead hand and arm.this question he answered by stating that i t the natural physiology of the injury.
counsel did really allow him to explain what he meant by this.so,on redirect,counsel for fch asked davis to expand on why you think the natural physiology of the injury muller sustained in the car accident evolved the way it did.after a lengthy preface,davis came to the point o ne of the features of compartment syndrome is it kills what in the compartment from the origin of the muscle all the way down to where the muscle inserts the other bony structure t he muscle in that whole compartment is in the same sheath so it exposed to all the same pressure.so,when you get a compartment syndrome,the muscle in the whole compartment dies.so you do save the leg below the knee,you have to take it off at the knee or do an above knee amputation,and the kid do sic pitch high school ball.if you get it in the upper extremity,then you lose the arm at the elbow or even above the elbow.you do have viable muscle below the elbow to close over the bony stump.that what i meant by the natural history of the disease.and it can take several weeks to slowly progress.
neither counsel nor davis was finished with this topic.after davis noted that muller had a below the elbow amputation,which meant that there was viable muscle below the elbow joint,counsel asked explain that.why does the fact that he has a below elbow amputation rule out a compartment syndrome davis answered at some length that in a compartment syndrome,all the muscle in the compartment dies but that if muller had living muscle to close over the bone,that was dead from a compartment syndrome.counsel asked muller had quite a bit of muscle below the elbow joint that survived,did he a davis i do know.i have seen his operative note.i noticed that he does,in fact,have an elbow joint.he does seem to have some below the elbow.so i would say he had enough muscle to close over the bone.q and have you ruled out a compartment syndrome in his case a yes,sir,i believe so.q and how strongly do you believe that a that what i believe.
still on friday,september,the next to testify was fch expert,michael kulick.kulick testified that muller did not have a compartment syndrome but that he had a crush injury.he reiterated the point that in a compartment syndrome,all the muscle in the compartment dies.kulick noted that the operative report from ucla medical center,where the amputation was done,stated that there was muscle on the forearm to cover up the stump.this was consistent with a crush injury and not consistent with a compartment syndrome.
the last to testify on september was shantharam.he had been previously called by the plaintiffs under evidence code section but the subject that we have covered above did not come up in his prior testimony.at the end of his direct examination by his counsel,the following transpired q shantharam counsel now,we heard testimony earlier today that,if there had been a compartment syndrome,you would expect the entire muscle throughout the compartment to have died a shantharam correct.q and you understand now that the entire muscle in muller compartment did not die a it did not die.and one would be going through an amputation above the elbow if it is a compartment syndrome.weiss shantharam counsel that all i have,your honor.thank you.
plaintiffs counsel did not these three witnesses on the topic of the amputation nor did counsel object to any of this testimony.after testimony was concluded on september,plaintiffs counsel stated that plaintiffs counsel had been in touch over the lunch hour with london who going to be here first thing in the morning to rebut some of the new evidence that we heard today.shantharam lawyer immediately objected to the extent he london going to be expressing opinions,because that improper rebuttal.when the trial court asked for an offer of proof,plaintiff counsel stated your honor,today for the first time,despite all of the experts who have testified in three weeks,today was the first day that the defendants put on experts who said that,whether or not the amputation was below elbow or above,was somehow indicative of whether this was a compartment syndrome.this was new.they did ask botte.they did ask any of the other experts about this.we intend to call london back to simply say that,whether or not it a below elbow or an above elbow amputation,is not indicative of whether or not this was a compartment syndrome.plain and simple.the court requested authorities on the subject by next tuesday morning,when the trial would reconvene.
on tuesday,september,shantharam counsel filed a written memorandum,which stated that defense expert kulick had testified that in a compartment syndrome all of the muscle in the compartment dies and that plaintiffs wanted to present the contrary testimony of london.the memorandum stated that london had read kulick deposition and that he was therefore aware of his opinions but that plaintiffs had not covered this subject when they had examined london during their case in chief.the memorandum also contended that code of civil procedure section,subdivision b foreclosed plaintiffs from calling london in rebuttal.
during the hearing on this matter held on tuesday morning fch counsel stated that kulick had testified in his deposition that in a compartment syndrome all of the muscle in the compartment dies.counsel read the following question and answer from kulick deposition question and what was inconsistent with a compartment syndrome at the time of amputation answer most of the compartment syndromes i have been involved with,the entire compartment is involved.reading the reports from,i believe,meals from ucla medical center,he had the proximal portion of his forearm completely spared which for me is more consistent with what i think happened with a crushed component.
after listening to argument by both sides,the trial court concluded,clearly referring to code of civil procedure section,subdivision b see fn,ante,that what i think you plaintiffs offering here is rebuttal evidence.under the law what you allowed to do is add foundational fact,not contrary evidence.i not going to allow you to call london at this time.
in its verdict,the jury specifically found that muller did not have a compartment syndrome while at fch.
the order granting a new trial 
the trial court granted the motion for new trial on the ground that an error of law had been committed.code civ.we set forth the court minute order 
london rebuttal testimony was improperly excluded.he should have been permitted to testify on the issue of whether the below the elbow amputation ruled out the existence of the compartment syndrome.the court ruling was based upon ccp section b sic.this section applied only to expert witnesses.london was a properly designated expert therefore,this section did not apply to his proposed rebuttal testimony.the defendants presented no evidence to this court to show that they had at any time before this trial informed the plaintiff that they would be presenting expert testimony showing that the location of the amputation was a factor in determining the existence of a compartment syndrome.the plaintiff then,did not present evidence on this issue during their case in chief and they were unable to cross examine botte,a key defense expert,on this issue.the exclusion of london proposed rebuttal testimony was prejudicial.the defense argued to the jury that the location of the amputation was significant in showing the of a compartment syndrome.since the plaintiff was precluded from introducing contrary expert opinion they were placed in an unfair position.this evidence was likely to have affected the outcome of the trial.
discussion 
the appeals from the order granting a new trial 
the appeal from the order denying the motion for sanctions 
the motion for a new trial was granted on december.on january,plaintiffs filed a motion for sanctions against shantharam and fch.the motion was predicated on the defendants failure to disclose in a timely fashion the theory that the location of the amputation below the elbow ruled out a compartment syndrome.
the trial court denied the motion for sanctions on march.the court found that there was no evidence that the defendants were sandbagging and no evidence that the defendants knowingly and intentionally concealed kulick opinion.the court also found that the defendants conduct in this case did not come close to the misconduct in sherman kinetic concepts,th,d,the case on which plaintiffs motion relied.
the order denying the motion for sanctions is appealable as a collateral order 
relying principally on wells properties popkin th,d,shantharam filed a motion to dismiss the appeal from the order denying plaintiffs motion for sanctions.we denied the motion before the briefs were filed but indicated that we were prepared to reconsider the issue when the briefing was completed.
the question whether the denial of a motion for sanctions is appealable is far from settled.wells properties popkin is authority for the negative while shelton rancho mortgage investment th,d and in re marriage of dupre th,d stand for the affirmative of the proposition.
in the context of this case,the only theory under which the order of denial would be appealable is the collateral order doctrine.because there is no judgment in this case,the order granting a new trial having been entered,which we affirm,the denial order can not be appealable under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a appeal may be taken from an order made after a judgment appealable under subd.a of.this eliminates shelton rancho mortgage investment,a case in which the denial of a motion for sanctions occurred after the entry of a judgment and when the appellate court,after close analysis of what constitutes an appealable postjudgment order,concluded that the denial of sanctions was appealable as such a postjudgment order.shelton rancho mortgage investment,supra,th at,d.
a necessary exception to the one final judgment rule is recognized where there is a final determination of some collateral matter distinct and severable from the general subject of the litigation.if,this determination requires the aggrieved party immediately to pay money or perform some other act,he is entitled to appeal even though litigation of the main issues continues.the determination is substantially the same as a final judgment in an independent proceeding.yeboah progeny ventures,supra,th,fn,d,citing what is now witkin,cal.procedure,supra,appeal.witkin notes that the early cases on the collateral order doctrine applied the doctrine only when the order in question directed the payment of money or the performance of some other act.witkin,supra,appeal.in later decisions,this limitation was not always observed,perhaps partly because more than one theory of appealability was loosely invoked and discussed.ibid.among the cases digested by witkin that have disregarded this limitation is in re marriage of dupre,supra,th at,d.other texts have also noted that the courts of appeal have been divided on this question,some holding that these limitations apply and others ignoring them entirely.eisenberg et,cal.practice guide civil appeals and writs the rutter group,to d appellate review,fn.accompanying text.
relying on the cases that require the collateral order to direct the payment of money or the performance of an act,shantharam contends that because the order denying the motion for sanctions required neither act,the order is not appealable.we agree that the order in question did not require the payment of money or the performance of an act.thus,we must address the question whether these limitations actually apply to the collateral order doctrine.
one reason for the disagreement among the courts of appeal is that the supreme court has at different times endorsed these limitations and at other times has disregarded them.thus,in the frequently cited opinion in sjoberg hastorf cal d,the court,after noting the existence of the collateral order doctrine emphatically went on to state it is not sufficient that the order determine finally for the purposes of further proceedings in the trial court some distinct issue in the case it must direct the payment of money by appellant or the performance of an act by or against him.
seven years later,in meehan hopps cal d,meehan,the court disregarded the limitations on the collateral order doctrine that the order must require the payment of money or the performance of an act.hopps,the defendant,moved to enjoin the plaintiffs lawyers from participating in the case or disclosing confidential information that these lawyers had learned while,in a previous case,they had represented hopps.the motion was denied and the sole issue was whether the order denying the motion was appealable.the supreme court gave two reasons why the order was appealable.first,hopps could have brought an independent action with the same objectives as the motion,in which event the denial of an injunction would have presented an appealable order.id.at.second,the disqualification of counsel was unquestionably collateral to the merits of the case id.at,and b ecause the trial court order denying hopps motion left nothing further of a judicial nature for a final determination of his rights regarding opposing counsel,the order was final for purposes of appeal id.at.the supreme court made no mention of the limitations on the collateral order doctrine that the order must direct the payment of money or the performance of an act.the omission to refer to these limitations is understandable as an order disqualifying an attorney simply does not involve the payment of money or the performance of an act.
a review of some of the decisions of the supreme court handed down after meehan suggests,at first blush,that the court has not been consistent in dealing with the limitations that the order must call for the payment of money or the performance of an act.
in southern pacific oppenheimer cal d,the court set forth the collateral order doctrine without reference to the foregoing limitations the court held that orders regarding discovery are not collateral orders.in takehara muddox cal d,the court held,citing inter alia mcclearen superior court cal d,that an order granting or denying a lien under code of civil procedure former section was appealable as a collateral order.no mention was made of the limitation that a collateral order must also involve the payment of money or the performance of an act.indeed,it is difficult to see how an order granting or denying a lien could involve either one of these limitations.
in in re marriage of skelley cal d,where the appeal was from an order modifying spousal support,the court stated the collateral order doctrine in its form and held the order to be appealable.bauguess paine cal d,footnote,was a case when an order directing an attorney to personally pay in sanctions was held appealable as a final order on a collateral matter directing the payment of money.and in weinrot son,jackson cal d,the trial court sustained a demurrer,the plaintiff sought and was denied reconsideration and the defendant moved for and was awarded in sanctions.the supreme court held the order awarding sanctions to be appealable as a final order on a collateral matter directing the payment of money.
the apparent inconsistency in the supreme court treatment of the limitations on the collateral order doctrine have caused some appellate courts to declare themselves firmly in the,the sjoberg hastorf,camp.thus,in efron kalmanovitz d,the court of appeal stated that a careful reading of the meehan decision convinces us that as to the second ground upon which the court found appealability,it was concerned only with the question of collaterality and finality t here is nothing in the opinion in meehan indicating an intent to delimit or overrule sjoberg and its own decisions cited in sjoberg to the effect that not only must the order of a collateral issue be final to be appealable,but that it must also direct the payment of money by appellant or the performance of an act by or against him.
we find that it is somewhat misleading to state that meehan was only concerned with collaterality and finality the question in the case was whether the order denying disqualification was a final order on a collateral matter and therefore appealable,and the answer was yes.thus,the fact remains that meehan held the order to be a collateral,appealable order without reference to any limitations.
conservatorship of rich th,d,contains a particularly strong endorsement of sjoberg hastorf and the limitations on the collateral order doctrine,as well as a vote of confidence in efron kalmanovitz conservatorship of rich also states that the supreme court has consistently limited the collateral order doctrine to situations where a trial judge orders either payment of money or the performance of some act see fn,a conclusion that is refuted by meehan,southern pac.oppenheimer,takehara muddox,and mcclearen superior court.
as we have noted,we do not think that meehan can be dismissed,as the court did in efron kalmanovitz,because it was only concerned with collaterality and finality.whether the order was final and collateral and therefore appealable was in fact the issue that was decided in that case.but meehan is not only authoritative,this decision also answers,albeit indirectly,the question what role the limitations of a payment of money or the performance of an act play in the collateral order doctrine.
an order disqualifying or denying the disqualification of counsel,the latter being the order on appeal in meehan,stands alone it does not require the payment of money or the performance of an act.there are other collateral orders that have been held to be appealable that do not involve a payment of money or the performance of an act.an order granting a creditor lien upon a cause of action bandy diablo unified sch.dist.d,an order denying a request for pendente lite attorney fees askew askew th,d,and an order approving a receiver accounting schreiber ditch road investors d,fn.are examples of such orders.
the apparent inconsistency in the supreme court opinions evaporates when the focus is on the nature of the order,on whether the order itself does or does not require a payment of money or the performance of an act.when the order does not require a payment of money or the performance of an act,the supreme court will find the order appealable without reference to these limitations,as long as the court is satisfied that the order is truly collateral.see meehan,supra,cal d,takehara muddox,supra,cal d,mcclearen superior court,supra,cal d.
this suggests that the supposed limitations of a payment of money and the performance of an act are in actuality indications that the order in question is collateral to the main action.in other words,when the order directs the payment of money or the performance of an act,it is likely that the matter addressed in the order is collateral to the main action.viewed from this perspective,it is logical that orders awarding pendente lite attorney fees in re marriage of skelley,supra,cal d at,orders directing the parties to share in the payment of discovery costs san diego unified port dist.douglas barnhart,th,d,and an order unsealing court records the performance of an act in re providian credit card cases th,d are orders that are collateral to the main action.
a good illustration of the unnecessary strain that the payment of money or performance of an act limitations place on the collateral order doctrine is machado superior court th,d.in that decision,the court of appeal expressed a doubt that an order denying a disqualification motion is a collateral order because such an order does not require the payment of money or the performance of an act on the other hand,according to the court in machado,an order granting a disqualification motion compels the hiring of a new attorney,which satisfies the limitation of the performance of an act.id.at,d.but an order disposing of a motion to disqualify an attorney either is,or is not,collateral to the main action the better view,without a doubt,is that it is collateral.this conclusion results from an analysis of the relationship of the order of disqualification to the main action and it is not based on whether an order is granted or denied.all the same,if machado is to be followed,an order denying a disqualification motion is not appealable while an order granting the motion is appealable.this does not make sense.
the artificiality of these supposed limitations is also made apparent by the holding that w here,as here,the notice order is neither final nor collateral,the fact that it directs payment of money or the performance of an act is immaterial.steen fremont cemetery th,d.in other words,the real test is whether the order is collateral and final as to the collateral matter,not whether the order has the effect of requiring payment of money or the performance of an act.
it is surely of some significance that the rather considerable body of federal law on the collateral order doctrine that begins with cohen beneficial indus.loan,makes absolutely no mention of the limitations on the collateral order doctrine that we have discussed.wright et,federal practice procedure jurisdiction.in other words,the collateral order doctrine has functioned in the federal courts without these limitations since its inception in.
the fact is that these supposed limitations on the collateral order doctrine do not really speak to the fundamental concepts behind this doctrine.the reason for the one judgment rule is that piecemeal disposition and multiple appeals in a single action would be oppressive and costly,and a review of intermediate rulings should await the final disposition of the case.knodel knodel cal d,citing what is now witkin,cal.procedure,supra,appeal.in union oil reconstruction oil cal d,the court stated that the test is whether an order is important and essential to the correct determination of the main issue.if the order is a necessary step to that end,it is not collateral.steen fremont cemetery,supra,th at,d.thus,the essence of the collateral order doctrine is that the matter concluded by the order should be truly distinct and severable from the general subject of the litigation,to use witkin phrase.witkin,supra,appeal.it is only then that a piecemeal disposition and multiple appeals in a single action will be avoided.
but this is not all there is.an aspect of the collateral order doctrine that has received relatively little attention in california cases are the reasons for the doctrine.as the united states supreme court has put it,the collateral order doctrine in federal courts must involve a claim of right too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.cohen beneficial indus.loan,supra,at.the interest that is served by the collateral order doctrine is the expeditious completion of appellate review,when that can be accomplished without implicating the merits of the underlying controversy.the collateral order doctrine also preserves appellate review when,without the invocation of this doctrine,appellate review would be foreclosed.
this case illustrates both of the principal reasons for the invocation of the collateral order doctrine.
first.the matter of sanctions to be awarded for the defendants alleged misconduct during and prior to the second trial of this case is of no relevance to the proceedings that will take place upon the remand of this case.if the order denying sanctions is to be reviewed on appeal,there is no reason to defer that review to the appeal from the eventual judgment,even assuming that review can in fact be deferred to that point in the future see text,post.the sanctions are too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.cohen beneficial indus.loan,supra,at.the principle that is served here is that it is preferable to resolve controversies whenever it is possible to do so rather than defer a matter that is in all respects ripe for resolution.
second.there is also the very real question whether the order denying sanctions would be reviewable from a judgment following a third trial in this case,assuming that there is a third trial the order denying sanctions will not be a part of the trial proceedings of the third trial and there is therefore a question whether an eventual judgment following the third trial could properly incorporate the order denying the motion for sanction entered on march.and if there is no third trial and no judgment,even the possibility of incorporating the order denying sanctions into a judgment,assuming such incorporation would be proper,would disappear.we think that the denial of sanctions is a matter too important to be denied review.cohen beneficial i
