factual and procedural background 
underlying facts 
on july,boghosian visited defendants in the hopes of correcting his vision such that he would no longer require corrective lenses.boghosian underwent a thorough eye examination.defendants informed him that he suffered from an astigmatism and myopia and was a good candidate for lasik surgery 
on august,boghosian underwent lasik surgery on both eyes.the surgery was performed by garabet.
prior to having surgery,boghosian signed a consent form disclosing the potential complications of the surgery.among other risks of the surgery,the consent form notified boghosian that there was no guarantee his vision would be corrected he might experience halo rings around light he could become or in one or both eyes he might experience sensitivity to sunlight there was a possibility that fluctuations or variations in vision could occur and additional surgery might be needed if he suffered any of the potential vision difficulties.
within weeks after surgery,boghosian began to experience a number of symptoms,including,cloudy vision,dryness,double vision,and loss of visual acuity and sharpness in both eyes.over time,many of these problems remained constant or worsened.boghosian told defendants of these problems.defendants at times told boghosian there was nothing to be concerned about,many lasik patients experienced similar symptoms,and the symptoms were normal.based on these assurances,boghosian was of the impression that his procedure was not successful.
boghosian continued to receive treatment from defendants for more than two and years after the surgery.defendants prescribed artificial tears and placed plugs in boghosian tear ducts.at the last visit on april,boghosian elected to forgo additional surgery and defendants prescribed corrective lenses.
boghosian did not again seek treatment for his vision problems until the summer of.during july,boghosian consulted phillip wren at excel laser vision.boghosian reported that his vision had taken a turn for the worse in the prior year.wren,a former employee of defendants and a friend of boghosian told boghosian that his astigmatism could be worsening.wren recommended contact lenses and a procedure to improve boghosian vision.boghosian was fitted with contact lenses,but stopped using them because they caused him extreme discomfort.he reverted to glasses.boghosian returned to wren to discuss the recommended procedure.wren recommended boghosian see a specialist.
boghosian was under the impression that his astigmatism was at the heart of his visual symptoms.he did not attribute any of the visual problems he was experiencing to be the result of any wrongdoing on defendants part.furthermore,it was his understanding that if his visual problems had resulted from the lasik procedure,the patient consent form identified them as potential complications of the lasik procedure,and he had agreed and acknowledged that he was willing to go forward with the procedure in light of those risks.
on july,boghosian consulted james saltz.saltz informed boghosian that his vision problems were caused by the surgery.saltz told boghosian that because of the shape of his cornea,boghosian should not have been considered a candidate for the lasik procedure additionally,saltz indicated that boghosian should first undergo a procedure wherein intacs are placed or implanted into each eye to stabilize the cornea.he indicated that corneal transplants for both eyes would be the next step if the intacs were unsuccessful.
the complaint 
on october,boghosian served defendants with a letter of intent to sue.code civ.
on january,boghosian filed a complaint seeking recovery for medical malpractice.boghosian alleged in part that he had consulted with defendants specifically for the purpose of obtaining defendants professional advice regarding his medical care and treatment.defendants recommended and carried out treatment boghosian relied upon the advice and representations,or lack thereof,of defendants all to his detriment.boghosian also alleged that defendants did negligently and carelessly examine,diagnose,advise,care,treat and administer to him.in their examination,diagnosis,advice,care,treatment and administration of medical care,defendants failed to exercise that degree of skill and care commonly possessed and exercised by physicians,surgeons,medical doctors,specialists,nurses,technicians,medical facilities and medical practitioners who perform the same and similar treatment and diagnostic procedures in the area and areas where defendants practice.
with regard to the statute of limitations,boghosian alleged that a period of one calendar year had not yet elapsed from the date he first learned or reasonably should have known the fact that his injuries and damages complained of were a legal result of the negligent acts or omissions on the part of defendants and,further,that a period of three years has not yet elapsed since the manifestation of this injury,which occurred on or about july.
the summary judgment motion 
each defendant filed a motion for summary judgment.defendants contended the and the statute of limitations specified in code of civil procedure section had expired.defendants argued that the provision had expired because boghosian had not commenced his lawsuit within three years of the date of injury and the provision had expired because boghosian had not commenced the lawsuit within one year of the date he discovered,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the injury.in support of their arguments,defendants noted that boghosian had begun to experience problems within weeks of his august,surgery,yet he had not filed his lawsuit until january.
in opposing the motions,boghosian argued there were triable issues of fact with regard to his claim that defendants erred in failing to tell him he was not a candidate for the lasik procedure.boghosian asserted that the symptoms that developed soon after the surgery did not trigger the statute because they consisted of complications disclosed prior to surgery.he contended the action accrued on july,the date he consulted with saltz and discovered the negligent cause of his injury.boghosian argued that only the manifestation of an undisclosed complication will trigger the limitation period under california code of civil procedure,section.
in denying the motions for summary judgment,the trial court concluded that boghosian had provided facts sufficient to establish triable issues of material fact as to the date the action accrued.the trial court ruled,in part boghosian has presented sufficient responsive evidence of a triable issue of material fact as to the date of injury for the statute of limitations under code of civil procedure section.the issue of material fact is raised by the symptoms boghosian experienced in association with his astigmatism and the advice he received from his treating physicians 
defendants filed in this court a petition for writ of mandate seeking an order directing the trial court to vacate its order denying their motions for summary judgment and instead to grant the motions.defendants contended the statute of limitations contained in code of civil procedure section expired before boghosian lawsuit was filed.we issued an order directing the parties to address the issues and to appear for oral argument.
discussion 
standard of review 
summary judgment is granted only when the moving party establishes the right to entry of judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a moving defendant seeking summary judgment has the initial burden of showing there are no triable issues of material fact and the action has no merit.in order to meet the burden,a moving defendant must provide supporting documentation which establishes either a complete defense to the plaintiff action or demonstrates an absence of an essential element of the plaintiff case.thompson halvonik th,d.

the statute of limitations in medical malpractice lawsuits 
code of civil procedure section establishes the statute of limitations in medical malpractice lawsuits.it reads in part in an action for injury or death against a health care provider based upon such person alleged professional negligence,the time for the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the injury,whichever occurs first.in no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed three years unless tolled for any of the following upon proof of fraud,intentional concealment,or the presence of a foreign body,which has no therapeutic or diagnostic purpose or effect,in the person of the injured person.
the provision begins when the plaintiff suspects or should suspect that his or her injury was caused by wrongdoing jolly eli lilly cal d.with regard to the limitation provision,the issue on appeal usually is whether the plaintiff actually suspected,or a reasonable person would have suspected,that the injury was caused by wrongdoing.kitzig nordquist th,d.
the maximum limitations period for a medical malpractice action is three years from the date of injury,tolled for fraud,intentional concealment,or the presence of nontherapeutic and nondiagnostic foreign bodies only.code civ.
for purposes of the statute,t he word injury signifies both the negligent cause and the damaging effect of the alleged wrongful act and not the act itself.larcher wanless cal d,fn.steketee lintz,williams rothberg cal d.there must be some manifestation of appreciable harm.brown bleiberg cal d,fn.the date of injury could be much later than the date of the wrongful act where the plaintiff suffers no physical harm until months or years after the wrongful act.citation.steketee lintz,williams rothberg,supra,at.however,once there is a manifestation of the injury in some significant way,the limitations period begins to accrue.mcnall summers th,d mcnall.
by establishing a maximum length of time in which plaintiffs have to bring their medical malpractice lawsuits,the legislature had as a primary goal the reduction of the cost of medical malpractice insurance.however,this goal was to be accomplished in a reasonable manner t he statute appears to have been a compromise between concern over the extended exposure of medical practitioners to malpractice liability and a desire not to bar potentially worthy plaintiffs from court before they have a fair chance to bring suit citation.steketee lintz,williams rothberg,supra,cal d at.
hills aronsohn d.hills provides an illustration.in hills,aronsohn injected silicone into the breasts of the plaintiff between april and june.in,the plaintiff began to notice lumps and experience soreness.in march,kaufman ordered a mammogram,which was performed by a third doctor.the third doctor reported that the mammogram showed nodular densities typical of that seen following silicone injections.id.at.on april,a fourth physician reported there were no changes from the prior year.there was a second mammogram and report from an april,physical examination conducted by worton.worton diagnosed the plaintiff as suffering from silicone granulomatosis due to silicone injections and recommended surgery.ibid.in january,worton examined the plaintiff.the lump in her right breast had gotten larger and become more uncomfortable.id.at.worton recommended two surgeries.the first,a bilateral subcutaneous mastectomy,was performed on february.the second,a reconstruction,was performed four days later.the plaintiff filed suit against aronsohn on march.id.at.
hills,supra,d,affirmed the lower court granting of summary judgment in favor of aronsohn.the appellate court held there was a triable issue of fact with regard to the statute of limitations as to when plaintiff reasonably could have discovered the negligent cause of her injury.id.at.however,the period had expired.hills stated,we agree that in the instant case the term injury does not refer to the date of the alleged time in when aronsohn gave hills the silicone injections t he term injury is not synonymous with the alleged wrongful act.however,we reject plaintiff conclusion that she did not experience injury until she suffered her ultimate harm in the form of the subcutaneous mastectomy.the mastectomy was an operation designed to cure the injury,and not the injury itself.it follows that the event which activates the limitations period is the moment the plaintiff discovers the harm caused by the alleged negligence.or,in the words of the court in larcher wanless,supra,cal d,the period is activated on the date of the damaging effect of the wrongful act rather than on the date of the act itself.id.at.once the damaging effect of the alleged wrongful act is apparent,the statute is activated.this event may occur even without the knowledge that negligence was the cause of the injury.here the plaintiff admits she experienced soreness and noticed lumps in her breasts in march of,four years before filing suit.this condition caused her to consult kaufman later that month.this admission is sufficient to show that she suffered the damaging effect of the alleged malpractice on that date.where reasonable minds can draw only one conclusion the question becomes a matter of law.citation.the inescapable conclusion is that she suffered the damaging effects of the malpractice more than three years before filing suit.accordingly,the motion for summary judgment was properly granted.hills,supra,at,fn.omitted.
another example is mcnall,supra,th,d,in which a directed verdict in favor of two psychiatrists was upheld on appeal.in mcnall,the plaintiff,a nurse and nursing instructor,was being treated for depression.in,she began treatment with hall.when he was on vacation,she saw summers and then continued to be treated by summers.id.at,d.pitts agreed with summers recommendation that plaintiff should undergo electroconvulsive therapy ect.after the plaintiff gave her informed consent,she began her ect treatment in november.ibid.the plaintiff reported that she experienced severe confusion and memory loss,but thereafter continued to receive treatments.summers advised the plaintiff that her memory would return and provided her with an article he had coauthored in which it was stated that memory deficits and confusion were characteristic side effects of ect.id.at,d.when the plaintiff memory did not improve,summers told her that the problems were a result of her depression and that she would need a psychiatrist for the rest of her life.ibid.from to the plaintiff complained about her depression,inability to recall,and disorientation to a colleague,to a man she was dating,and to a friend and neighbor.ibid.in a may,session,summers had sex with the plaintiff.id.at,d.in july,the plaintiff terminated her therapy with summers and resumed treatment with hall.the plaintiff told hall about the sexual encounter with summers and about her continuing memory loss.hall prescribed medication and treated the plaintiff until the end of.ibid.the plaintiff filed her complaint against summers on october,alleging medical malpractice based on sexual abuse.in november,a neuropsychologist concluded the plaintiff had suffered an injury to the left side of her brain.a magnetic resonance image test mri ordered by cummings revealed a probable stroke.the plaintiff amended her complaint to add pitts as a defendant and to add a cause of
