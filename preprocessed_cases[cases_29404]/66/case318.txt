holyoke homes,mhh,and darla jones collectively plaintiffs challenge the granting of a motion to compel arbitration and the denial of their motion to vacate the arbitration award in a legal malpractice action against jeffer mangels butler mitchell,llp jmbm and john bowman defendants.they contend an arbitration provision in the parties legal services agreement is unenforceable because it was not adequately disclosed or explained to them the arbitrator failed to timely disclose his prior relationship with a partner in jmbm,so the award must be vacated and the trial court erred by overruling their objections to the arbitrator declaration filed in opposition to their petition to vacate the award.
we conclude that the arbitration agreement is enforceable and the trial court properly compelled arbitration.we also conclude that the fact that the arbitrator had listed a partner in jmbm as a reference on his resume reasonably could cause an objective observer to doubt his impartiality as an arbitrator,and his failure to timely disclose that fact compels the conclusion that the arbitration award must be vacated.we therefore will reverse the judgment with directions to vacate the arbitration award.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
jones and her late husband formed mhh for the purpose of developing real property in pacific palisades.they retained reznik and reznik in to represent them in connection with an application for subdivision of the property.their legal services agreement contained no provision requiring the arbitration of disputes.john bowman was the attorney primarily responsible for handling the matter.benjamin reznik was another attorney with the same firm.
benjamin reznik and bowman joined jmbm in.jones signed a legal services agreement with jmbm in october.paragraph of the agreement stated in bold capital letters 
arbitration and waiver of jury trial.any dispute based upon or arising out of our engagement,this letter agreement the performance or failure to perform services including,without limit,claims of breach of duty or professional negligence shall be subject to binding arbitration to be held in los angeles or san francisco county,california whichever county is the one in which the firm office is located which performed more of the services in question before a retired california superior court judge.judgment on the arbitrator award shall be final and binding,and may be entered in any competent court.as a practical matter,by agreeing to arbitrate all parties are waiving jury trial.
paragraph of the legal services agreement with jmbm stated,in part,we are not advising you with respect to this letter because we would have a conflict of interest in doing so.if you wish advice,you should consult independent counsel of your choice.the agreement also provided that the prevailing party in any arbitration or litigation was entitled to recover its attorney fees,expert fees and costs.the agreement stated above the signature line for jones 
the undersigned has read and understood this agreement.the undersigned acknowledges that this letter agreement is subject to binding arbitration as provided in paragraph above.the foregoing accurately sets forth all the terms of your engagement,and is approved and accepted on oct.
the city of los angeles denied an application for a preliminary parcel map and a coastal development permit in april.mhh and the joneses filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court challenging the denial.the court granted the petition and issued a peremptory writ of mandate in december directing the city to vacate its decision and reconsider the application.after extensive negotiations,mhh agreed to reduce the scope of development and accept conditions of approval,and the city approved the revised proposal in april.
a neighbor appealed the city approval to the california coastal commission commission.the commission scheduled a public hearing for july,to determine whether the appeal presented a substantial issue.the city failed to provide the administrative record of its proceedings to the commission by that date.on the date of the hearing,the commission opened and continued the hearing without determining whether the appeal presented a substantial issue.jmbm obtained the record and provided it to the commission by march.the commission held a hearing on may,in which it determined that the appeal presented a substantial issue and therefore should proceed.the commission reviewed the subdivision application de novo and denied the application on june.
mhh and the joneses filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court in july challenging the commission decision.they argued for the first time that the commission lost jurisdiction to decide the matter when it failed to find that the appeal presented a substantial issue within days after the appeal was filed with the commission.the court granted the petition on that ground and issued a peremptory writ of mandate in november ordering the commission to set aside its disapproval of a parcel map and a coastal development permit and dismiss the appeal.
the commission appealed the trial court decision to the court of appeal.division seven of the second appellate district held that after litigating the matter to completion before the commission without challenging its jurisdiction,mhh and jones were estopped from challenging the commission jurisdiction.the court of appeal therefore reversed the judgment by the trial court,leaving the commission denial of the application as the final decision.holyoke homes,lp california coastal com.th.
complaint and arbitration 
mhh,jones and scott adler filed a complaint for legal malpractice against jmbm and bowman in january they allege that defendants failure to timely challenge the commission jurisdiction was negligent and that a timely challenge would have resulted in an approved final parcel map and a coastal development permit.
defendants filed a petition to compel arbitration pursuant to the arbitration provision in the legal services agreement.plaintiffs opposed the petition.the trial court granted the petition in may,issued an order compelling arbitration and stayed the trial court proceedings.
the parties initially selected a retired superior court judge,patricia collins,as the arbitrator,but jones later objected to judge collins after she disclosed a prior relationship with defendants counsel.the parties then selected another retired superior court judge,eli chernow,as the arbitrator.judge chernow disclosed that defendants counsel had represented a party to a mediation before him within the past five years,but stated that he was not aware of any relationship with any party or attorney involved in this matter that would impair his ability to act fairly and impartially.judge chernow later disclosed that he had known benjamin reznik for many years.he also disclosed that he had conducted an arbitration and a mediation involving adler more than five years earlier.the parties agreed to his appointment as arbitrator despite these disclosures.jmbm filed a in arbitration against plaintiffs and adler seeking to recover unpaid legal fees.
judge chernow issued an interlocutory decision in january finding that,in light of the state of the law at the time regarding the day rule,defendants had satisfied their duty of care.he also found that it was likely that the commission would have established a basis to exercise jurisdiction even if the defense were timely asserted,and therefore concluded that plaintiffs had failed to establish causation.judge chernow concluded that plaintiffs were entitled to no relief on their claims and that jmbm was entitled to recover its unpaid legal fees for services provided and its reasonable attorney fees incurred in connection with the arbitration.he adopted the interlocutory decision as his final award in march,awarding jmbm in unpaid legal fees,in attorney fees incurred in connection with the arbitration,and over in costs.
petitions to vacate and to confirm the arbitration award 
the arbitration award prompted jones to search the internet for evidence of the arbitrator bias.she discovered for the first time a previously undisclosed resume in which judge chernow had named robert mangels,a name partner in jmbm,as a reference.she found a link to the resume on the internet site of the national academy of distinguished neutrals.mangels was the first of three references listed on the resume.plaintiffs and adler filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award in april arguing that the award must be vacated because of judge chernow failure to disclose his relationship with jmbm through mangels.defendants opposed the petition and filed a petition to confirm the award.defendants filed declarations by judge chernow and mangels in support of their opposition.
the chernow declaration stated,i have no relationship with mangels other than as a neutral involved in mediation,adjudication,and discovery and other reference proceedings.the cases in which mangels appeared before me occurred in the and early.he stated that his contacts with mangels did not prevent him from acting impartially in this matter,nor was such contact a required disclosure under california law.he also stated that he had listed mangels as a reference only because mangels was a and litigator who was familiar with his abilities as a neutral,that he had prepared the resume approximately years earlier and that he had never discussed with mangels naming his as a reference.
the mangels declaration stated that he had appeared before judge chernow as a judge,mediator and arbitrator,but not within the past five years,and that the two had no professional or personal relationship.he stated that he had never discussed acting as a reference for judge chernow.
plaintiffs objected to the chernow declaration on the grounds that he had no jurisdiction in this case after issuing a final arbitration award and that the existence or nonexistence of actual bias was irrelevant.
the trial court granted defendants petition to confirm the arbitration award and denied plaintiffs petition to vacate the award.the order stated from the declarations of judge chernow and mangels,it is clear that the parties have virtually no relationship beyond mangels having appeared before judge chernow in the past.simply listing mangels,amongst other named partners,on a year old resume is insufficient to trigger code of civil procedure section a.further,the court finds that a person aware of the facts would not entertain a doubt as to the impartiality of the arbitrator.
judgment and appeal 
the trial court entered a judgment in july awarding plaintiffs no relief on their complaint and awarding defendants the amounts awarded in the arbitration award,plus interest.the judgment also states that defendants are entitled to recover their attorney fees incurred in this action.the court later awarded jmbm in attorney fees on jmbm motion for attorney fees.plaintiffs timely appealed the judgment.
contentions 
plaintiffs contend the arbitration provision is unenforceable because it was not adequately disclosed or explained to them the arbitrator failed to timely disclose his prior relationship with mangels,so the award must be vacated and the trial court erred by overruling their objections to the chernow declaration.
discussion 
the trial court properly compelled arbitration 
the california arbitration act code civ,et compels the enforcement of valid arbitration agreements.armendariz foundation health psychcare services,cal th,armendariz.section states a written agreement to submit to arbitration an existing controversy or a controversy thereafter arising is valid,enforceable and irrevocable,save upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of any contract.the statutory scheme reflects a strong public policy in favor of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution.citation.haworth superior court cal th,haworth.

the arbitration provision here unambiguously states that any dispute arising out of the firm engagement as counsel,specifically including claims of professional negligence,is subject to binding arbitration.the last paragraph before the signature line further states that jones,as the undersigned,has read the agreement and acknowledges that it is subject to binding arbitration.plaintiffs do not argue that the arbitration provision is inconspicuous or procedurally unconscionable in any way.nor do they argue that the provision is or substantively unconscionable.instead,they argue that defendants had a duty to disclose and explain the significance of the arbitration provision and the failure to satisfy such duty invalidates the arbitration agreement.this is a claim of fraud in the execution,also known as fraud in the inception.
a contract is void for fraud in the execution if the promisor was deceived as to the nature of his or her act and did not know what he or she was signing or never intended to enter into a contract.rosenthal,supra,cal th at.for example,a misrepresentation as to the character or essential terms of a proposed contract can render the promisor assent ineffective.id.at.if the parties were in a fiduciary relationship in which the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty to explain the terms of a proposed contract between them,a breach of that duty may constitute constructive fraud and establish fraud in the execution.brown wells fargo bank,th.the scope of a fiduciary duty depends on the particular facts.rosenthal,supra,at brown,supra,at.the existence and scope of a duty is a question of law for the court to decide,so our review is de novo.castaneda olsher cal th.
desert outdoor advertising superior court th desert outdoor rejected essentially the same argument asserted here in similar circumstances.the plaintiffs in desert outdoor initially signed an attorney fee agreement with no arbitration provision.when their attorney changed firms,the plaintiffs signed a new fee agreement containing a provision requiring binding arbitration of any dispute between the parties.the plaintiffs later sued the attorney for legal malpractice,and the attorney successfully petitioned to compel arbitration.id.at.the plaintiffs argued that the attorney had a duty to disclose and explain the arbitration provision in the new fee agreement and that the arbitration agreement was invalid because he failed to do so.the court of appeal concluded that the attorney had no such duty.id.at.desert outdoor stated that the arbitration provision was clearly set forth in the fee agreement signed by the clients,who were knowledgeable business persons,they were advised to consult separate counsel before signing the agreement,and the agreement was not a contract of adhesion.id.at.
similarly here,the arbitration provision was clear and explicit.jones had hired reznik and reznik in to obtain development approvals,litigated the matter against the city in the trial court,and then negotiated with the city for several years.she had substantial experience with litigation and legal representation before signing the legal services agreement with jmbm in.the agreement expressly advised jones to consult independent counsel if she wished to be advised on the agreement,and plaintiffs have not shown that the agreement was a contract of adhesion.we conclude that,in these circumstances,defendants had no duty to point out the existence of the arbitration provision or to explain its significance,and their failure to do so does not invalidate the arbitration contract.
lawrence walzer gabrielson d lawrence and powers dickson,carlson campillo th powers,cited by plaintiffs,are not on point.lawrence concluded that an arbitration provision in a retainer agreement was limited to fee disputes and other financial matters and did not extend to legal malpractice claims.lawrence,supra,at.the agreem
