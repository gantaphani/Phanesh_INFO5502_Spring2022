an nurse at the veterans affairs medical center in the leeds section of northampton,massachusetts the leeds vamc was convicted of murdering four patients and attempting to murder three others between august and february by injecting them with epinephrine,a stimulant that in large doses can trigger heart attacks.see skwira united states,cir describing the conviction in the context of another case united states gilbert,cir interlocutory appeal from the nurse trial.an extensive federal criminal investigation starting in february had led to the nurse indictment on november.some of the estates of her alleged victims have since sued the united states for wrongful death under the federal torts claims act ftca,et.see skwira,at cutting united states,d.
the cases have raised the issue,under the ftca discovery rule,of when the estate,through the family members,discovered,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the factual basis for the cause of action.gonzalez united states,cir.the ftca requires a plaintiff to file an administrative claim with the appropriate federal agency within two years after that point.b skwira,at.in skwira,this court concluded that the plaintiffs october,administrative claim for the wrongful death of leeds vamc patient edward skwira on february,was not timely.at.
the instant case was brought by the estate of another patient,michele cascone,who died on january.the theory of the case is that the nurse,kristen gilbert,wrongfully caused cascone heart attack and eventual death by injecting him with epinephrine.here,the administrative claim was filed on november.applying the principles of skwira to the different facts of this case,we conclude that the administrative claim was timely because it accrued on or after november.see b.
there are at least two salient differences from skwira that lead us to our conclusion.first,there was nothing inherently suspicious in cascone reported death of an apparent heart attack because cascone had a long history of heart disease,including congestive heart failure,and at the time of admission to the hospital showed heart irregularities.indeed,the death certificate said he died of,inter alia,c hronic atrial fibrillation emphasis added.second,the considerable publicity,of which the cascones were not in fact aware,about the investigation at the leeds vamc focused on other patient deaths that were identified as inherently suspicious because those patients had no preexisting heart conditions,and no one from the government or the media publicly drew a connection between the nurse misdeeds and cascone death before the november,date.government investigators never contacted cascone family and never sought to exhume cascone body for further testing,and gilbert was never indicted for cascone murder.we reverse the dismissal of the plaintiff claim.
the following facts,presented in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,are drawn from the complaint and materials submitted to the district court on the motion to dismiss.see mcintyre united states,cir united states,cir.
on january,michele cascone,age,was admitted to the leeds vamc with a case of pneumonia.he was placed in the unit,ward c.the hospital records indicate that he had a medical history significant for atrial fibrillation,wide complex tachycardia,and congestive heart failure and that he suffered from insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and multiple cerebrovascular accidents.upon his admission to the hospital,a physical examination showed that his h eart was irregular,with a soft systolic murmur,and a heart monitor revealed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.the treating physician also noted that cascone heart rate had increased because of his hypoxemia and general condition.
two days later,during the evening of january,cascone suffered a series of heart attacks and died.he was pronounced dead at.the death certificate listed ventricular tachycardia,bilateral pneumonia,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,and chronic atrial fibrillation as the causes of death.none of cascone family members was at the hospital when he died,as best we can tell from the record.cascone daughter,janice kenyon,called the hospital that afternoon,learned of cascone first heart attack,and relayed the message to his wife nancy cascone.a leeds vamc doctor then called nancy and said that her husband had had another heart attack.he called again later in the evening to say that her husband had passed away.the doctor asked if nancy wanted an autopsy done.he did not state any reason why she might want one,and nancy said that she did not.michele cascone was survived by nancy,three sons leonard,michael,and william,two daughters sandra herk and janice kenyon,a sister romilda dow,and a brother joseph collectively,the cascones.at the time,none of the cascones inquired further into the cause of michele cascone death.
from cascone death until november,the date for accrual,the cascones lived in various towns in massachusetts.although the estate,through nancy cascone as executrix,is the only plaintiff,the location of various family members is pertinent.nancy lived in rowe leonard moved a lot but identified his hometown as greenfield michael lived in shelburne falls william was incarcerated at a state prison in the city of norfolk sandra herk lived in athol janice kenyon lived in leominster romilda dow lived in newburyport from june to december and in florida for the other months of the year and joseph,who passed away in december,lived in north andover.the cascones appear to be in communication with one another.michael and william said in their depositions that they corresponded regularly with nancy,and deposition testimony indicated that several of the others had communicated with nancy both after cascone death and after nancy received a telephone call from a reporter on april,raising the possibility that gilbert might have killed cascone.
the government argument on appeal is not that the cascones actually knew of any information or read any news coverage before november,that would have given them a reasonable basis to suspect that the government was responsible for cascone death.nancy,william,sandra,janice,leonard,and romilda testified in their depositions that they had not read any of the articles or seen any of the television coverage relied upon by the government.michael testified that his mother phone call to him after she spoke with the reporter on april,was the first that he had heard of the leeds vamc investigation.joseph was not deposed because he passed away in december.the government contention is instead that before november,the cascones should have,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,suspected a causal link between cascone death and government misconduct based on the quantity of news coverage.for present purposes,we assume arguendo the validity of the government approach that a plaintiff who wishes to pursue an ftca claim may not remain in total ignorance of the pertinent press and media reports.we therefore examine several factors the geographical scope of the coverage the family members,the content of the stories,and the degree of press and media saturation.
in june and july of,articles began to appear in various newspapers reporting that a federal investigation had been launched by the va inspector general office after an internal probe at the leeds vamc revealed an unusually high number of heart attack deaths at the hospital.several reported that suspicious deaths had occurred between late and early and that investigators had discovered discrepancies in the inventory of epinephrine,a stimulant that could cause cardiac arrest in high doses.in august of,the story broke that the investigation had led to a grand jury probe focusing on kristen gilbert,a nurse who worked the to shift on ward c,the unit.some sporadic coverage of the story continued through.
the story regained some prominence in january when gilbert stood trial for allegedly calling in a bomb threat to the leeds vamc to retaliate against and a former boyfriend who worked at the hospital for their participation in the investigation,and again in april when she was convicted of that crime.united states gilbert,cir affirming gilbert conviction on appeal.the articles covering the bomb threat story often mentioned the string of suspicious heart attacks at the leeds vamc but tended to provide few details about them,such as the time frame or the ward in which they occurred.
most of the articles upon which the government relies appeared in the daily hampshire gazette and the daily edition of the springfield union news,two western massachusetts newspapers.none of the cascones subscribe to either newspaper.from to,of households in franklin county,where nancy,leonard,and michael lived,bought the daily edition of the springfield union news and bought the daily hampshire gazette less than of households in areas where the remaining cascones lived bought those papers.the two newspapers published over fifty articles between and on the investigation into the rash of heart attacks at the leeds vamc,at least fifteen of which were on the front page none specifically mentioned michele cascone.one july,article in the daily hampshire gazette purported to list all deaths by cardiac or cardiopulmonary arrest at the leeds vamc between january and february,but the list had no entry matching cascone description.many of the articles that discussed individual patient deaths focused on those without any history of heart problems,such as henry hudon,a schizophrenic veteran admitted with symptoms.
the daily hampshire gazette,however,did publish two articles in september reporting that an ftca suit had been filed over the december death of rita morel at the leeds vamc.both articles noted that morel had preexisting heart problems,with one pointing to a history of congestive heart failure,and the other noting that she had struggled for years with hypertension,strokes,and diabetes.additionally,the newspaper published a july,article stating that federal investigators had exhumed the body of stanley jagodowski,who died at the leeds vamc in august after suffering for several years from coronary artery disease and severe peripheral vascular disease.
the athol daily news,to which sandra herk cascone daughter and her husband arthur herk subscribed at all relevant times ran four articles,all between august and november of,on the investigation into suspicious heart attack deaths at the leeds vamc none of the articles identified ward c or the unit as the place where the suspicious deaths occurred.and none mentioned cascone by name or described as suspicious the deaths of other patients who had a history of heart ailments.in fact,henry hudon was the only individual patient whose death was discussed.the two articles discussing hudon death reported that he was years old and quoted his sister as saying h e never had a heart problem,never,never.
the greenfield recorder,which was bought at that time by about of households in the greenfield city zone where leonard lived,by about of households in the surrounding rural areas in franklin county where nancy and michael lived,and by less than of people in the other cascones hometowns,ran five articles on the investigation,all of which were published between september and november of again,none singled out ward c or the unit.and none mentioned cascone or reported suspicious deaths involving patients with preexisting heart problems.hudon and skwira were the only individual patients whose deaths were discussed no medical history was given for skwira,and it was emphasized that hudon had no history of heart problems.
the boston globe published a lengthy article on the investigation as the cover story to its april,sunday magazine at the time,the sunday edition of the newspaper which includes the magazine was read by around of households in essex county where cascone brother joseph lived of those in norfolk county where cascone son william was incarcerated,of those in worcester county where cascone daughters sandra and janice lived,and in franklin county where nancy and cascone sons leonard and michael lived.cascone daughter janice said in her deposition that she often buy s the sunday edition of the boston globe.the article,which discussed numerous individual patient deaths,did not mention cascone and focused primarily on patients without a history of heart troubles,such as hudon.the article did,however,describe the death of rita morel,who was identified as having a history of congestive heart failure.the article reported that morel brother had filed an ftca claim with the va over her death.
the daily edition of the boston globe,which janice cascone daughter sometimes read and which was purchased at the time by around of those in norfolk county where cascone son william was incarcerated,of households in essex county where cascone brother joseph and sister romilda lived,and less than of those in the other cascones hometowns,also ran eleven articles on the investigation between august and august none mentioned cascone.but one short article,published on july,at page,did describe a suspicious death involving a patient with past heart troubles.the story reported that federal investigators had exhumed the body of stanley jagodowski,who died at the leeds vamc in august after suffer ing from coronary artery disease and other vascular problems for several years.
the boston herald,which was read by around of households in essex county at the time and which arthur herk and william cascone occasionally read,ran six articles on the investigation between august and april none mentioned cascone or other deaths involving patients with a history of heart problems.
in addition to the press coverage,channel television news ran four broadcasts between july and september of on the investigation although none of the cascones live in boston,cascone two daughters sandra herk and janice kenyon said in their depositions that they sometimes watched channel news and his sister romilda dow said that she occasionally watched the local news on television stations.cascone was again not mentioned.the only individual death discussed was that of henry hudon,whom the relevant story described as having no history of heart problems.
the cascones stated in their depositions that between cascone death in january and the november,date for accrual,no one contacted them with suspicions about cascone death.they were not contacted by reporters,any of the other eight families bringing ftca suits against the va,the va inspector general office,or the state police,which had been enlisted to help with the federal investigation.
nor were they contacted by the united states attorney office,even though an august,article in the springfield union news quoted william welch,the ausa handling the case,as saying,we going to contact anyone and everyone who may have relevant information about the deaths at the leeds vamc.the paper noted that welch statement includ ed patient families.in november,april,and july,three families were contacted for permission to exhume bodies of patients who had died at the leeds vamc,according to a july,springfield union news article.but cascone family was not one of them.
meanwhile,the va inspector general office announced that details of the federal investigation would be kept secret until it was complete.a july,springfield union news article quoted jon wooditch,a spokesman at the va office of inspector general,as saying b ecause it an ongoing inquiry,it not in the best interests of anybody to make comment.both the daily hampshire gazette and springfield union news reported on july,that veterans agents from various local towns had a private meeting with officials at the leeds vamc but were unsuccessful in discovering any additional information.the newspapers also reported that ausa welch repeatedly refused to confirm that gilbert was a suspect in the grand jury investigation,to disclose how many deaths were being investigated,or to make public the results of the analysis of several bodies that had been exhumed.on september,the district court,at the request of both welch and gilbert attorney,sealed hearings related to the grand jury investigation.as late as april,the boston globe reported that some families that had brought suit were having trouble uncovering facts about the deaths because of the ongoing criminal investigation.
on november,a federal grand jury indicted gilbert for murder of four leeds vamc patients and the attempted murder of three others.at this point,the november,date for accrual of cascone claims had already passed.the indictment did not allege cascone to be one of gilbert victims.
then,on april,the springfield union news reported that gilbert may have murdered a fifth veteran at the leeds vamc,michele cascone.as best we can tell,this was the first mention of cascone death in the press or television news coverage surrounding the deaths at the leeds vamc.the story said that although gilbert had not been charged with cascone murder,the prosecution had moved in proceedings to be given permission to introduce evidence about his murder to the jury to demonstrate a pattern to gilbert killings.the article noted that d etails relating to cascone death,previously contained in sealed documents,were revealed in a pretrial hearing emphasis added.in particular,the article reported that,according to ausa ariane vuono,a had observed gilbert carrying a vial of epinephrine between cascone third and fourth heart attacks and that gilbert had jokingly asked the,want some epi 
later that day,fred contrada,who had authored the article,called nancy cascone for comment on her husband and the gilbert trial.according to nancy cascone deposition testimony,she replied,i do know any gilbert trial.contrada then told her that gilbert was charged with killing four patients at the leeds vamc and that her husband may have been the fifth.contrada asked nancy whether anyone had called her from the va or the hospital,and she said no.the cascones say that this was the first time that any of them had heard of gilbert or her possible role in michele cascone death.after the call,nancy bought a copy of the springfield union news and read contrada article.she then notified the rest of the family and asked william to write a letter on her behalf contacting an attorney.
on november,david mech,nancy cascone attorney and special administrator of michele cascone estate,filed a claim for wrongful death and personal injury with the department of veterans affairs.the claim stated,cascone was in the care of one kristen gilbert when he was injected with a lethal dose of epinephrine which put him in cardiac arrest and caused his death.the hospital,its servants,agents,and employees were negligent in the care of cascone and gilbert supervision.on april,the va denied the claim as untimely.
in due course,on june,mech,as special administrator of the estate,filed suit in federal district court against the united states under the ftca,claiming negligence,conscious pain and suffering,wrongful death,and reckless conduct.see b allowing six months from the denial of the administrative claim to file suit.the complaint alleged that the united states had violated its duty of care to cascone by failing to provide the medical care required for his health and recovery and by failing to take reasonable action to protect him from harm.the complaint was later amended on november,to substitute nancy cascone as the executrix of the estate.
on march,the united states moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,arguing that the administrative claim had not been timely filed.on july,after a hearing and a review of the exhibits submitted by the defendants,which included deposition transcripts and copies of various stories in the press and television news,the district court granted the motion.the court reasoned that even assuming the plaintiff was subjectively ignorant of any investigation at the vamc,the accrual standard is objective.the court found that cascone sudden death after being admitted with a threatening medical ailment put the plaintiff on notice of the injury.the court further determined that media reports from july of onwards would have put a reasonable person on notice before november,of a causal connection between possible government wrongdoing and cascone death.nancy cascone,as executrix of cascone estate,timely appealed.
the ftca provides,in relevant part,that a tort claim against the united states shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after such claim accrues.b.because the ftca is a waiver of sovereign immunity,it is strictly construed.skwira,at.timely filing of an administrative claim is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit.id.at.
although normally a tort claim accrues at the time of injury,the supreme court in united states kubrick,d,created a discovery rule exception for ftca claims involving medical malpractice.see mcintyre,at skwira,at.the court held that such claims accrue when a plaintiff has factual knowledge of both the existence and the cause of his injury.kubrick,at.the plaintiff need not,however,know that the acts legally constitute medical malpractice.id.at.the rationale is that once a plaintiff knows the fact of the injury and the identity of the parties who caused it,he can find out if he was a victim of malpractice by consulting doctors or lawyers.id.this court has extended kubrick discovery rule to ftca claims for wrongful death in settings involving deliberate acts,where the prospects of any claim against the government were so hidden that a reasonable plaintiff would not have been alerted to their existence.skwira,at boudin,concurring see also mcintyre,at.
under the discovery rule,the test is whether plaintiff knows,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known,the factual basis of the cause of action,including the fact of the injury and the injury causal connection to the government.mcintyre,at skwira,at a medical malpractice claim has accrued once a plaintiff knows of the injury and its probable cause.quoting gonzalez,at.whether a plaintiff should,in the exercise of reasonable diligence,have discovered necessary facts is an objective inquiry.mcintyre,at.nonetheless,the particular circumstances of individual plaintiffs can be relevant to the outcome.the issue is whether a reasonable person similarly situated to the plaintiff would have known the necessary facts.id.at.where the plaintiff resides can be a factor when information about the underlying facts is limited to certain geographical areas.id.at.this is often true,for example,when notice is based on local television or press reports.id.how often a plaintiff communicates with other family members who have access to more information can also be relevant.id.
here,the government,relying on press and media reports,argues that the estate objectively should have been alerted to the fact that cascone seemingly natural death was suspicious.the government contends that the reports should have prompted the estate to conduct a reasonable investigation and eventually to have concluded that there was a reasonable basis to believe that gilbert,and hence the government,wrongfully caused the death.we hold that a similarly situated person would not have had an objective basis before november,to think that cascone seemingly natural death was suspicious.thus,no duty to investigate further was triggered before then.
we focus our analysis on the facts available to a reasonable person in nancy cascone position because she is the named plaintiff,as the executrix of the estate.because she communicates regularly with the other cascones,and there is no evidence that the cascones are estranged from one another,we also look to information available to the other cascones,to the extent that such information might reasonably be expected to have been communicated to nancy.
at the time of cascone death in january,none of the cascones had a reasonable basis to suspect foul play the question is whether media reports after cascone death were sufficient to trigger a duty to inquire before november,into the circumstances of cascone death.most of the news coverage in this case appears to have been in springfield and hampshire county newspapers.but none of the cascones lived in either place,and during the relevant times the springfield union news and the daily hampshire gazette were bough
