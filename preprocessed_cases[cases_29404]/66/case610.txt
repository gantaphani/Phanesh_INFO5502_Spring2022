this is the third time that this case has come before the appellate court.plaintiff jane petre plaintiff,the special administrator of the estate of james petre petre,filed this medical malpractice action against defendants cardiovascular consultants,cardiovascular medical associates,cma,vincent kucich,robert applebaum,hershel wix,david looyenga,robert prentice,george gustafson,hickory cardiology associates,and francis hospital and health center.plaintiff sought recovery for injuries sustained by petre following coronary artery bypass surgery performed by kucich at francis hospital and health center in blue island,illinois.after the surgery,petre developed a postoperative wound infection,which ultimately led to the removal of petre sternum.prior to the first trial in,plaintiff entered into a settlement with francis hospital and voluntarily dismissed applebaum,looyenga,prentice,gustafson,and wix from the case.
following a third trial,the jury returned a verdict in favor of kucich but against cma,and awarded plaintiff.cma now appeals,contending that the trial court abused its discretion in striking portions of cma reply in support of its posttrial motion and all of cma arguments should be considered by this court on appeal it is entitled to a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence against any employee or agent of cma it is entitled to a judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the jury verdict is not supported by the evidence and because plaintiff failed to present any affirmative evidence of negligence it is entitled to a new trial because the trial court erred in permitting plaintiff to go beyond the scope of defendants examination of kucich in defendants to present defendants theory of liability and the jury verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.for the following reasons,we reverse the trial court judgment and remand for a fourth trial.
the record discloses the following facts and procedural history relevant to this appeal.in their second amended complaint,plaintiff alleged the following general facts.plaintiff was admitted to francis hospital on november.several days later,on november,kucich,who was a member of the cma practice,performed coronary artery bypass surgery on petre.while he was under the care of kucich and cma,petre developed a bacterial infection.nevertheless,petre was discharged from francis hospital on december.ultimately,in january,petre underwent a second surgery to correct and cure the infection.
plaintiff raised counts against all of the defendants involved,two of which were against cma.in count i,plaintiff raised a medical malpractice claim against cma based on a theory of vicarious liability.plaintiff alleged that cma,acting by and through its agents,employees,and medical staff,including but not limited to kucich and applebaum or others,committed medical malpractice by 
a carelessly and negligently failing to provide appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis for the cardiac surgery performed of sic james petre 
b carelessly and negligently prescribed and utilized excessive and unnecessary amounts of corticosteroids which predispose to infection 
c carelessly and negligently failed to recognize a sternal wound infection prior to the discharge of james petre from francis hospital and health center on december,
d carelessly and negligently failed to respond appropriately to cultures which identified the sternal wound infection and 
e carelessly and negligently failed to provide responsible surgical after discharge on december.
as a result,plaintiff alleged that petre suffered great pain and mental anguish,disability,and disfigurement,which rendered him unable to pursue his occupation and resulting in loss of income.in count xi,plaintiff alleged that as a result of petre injury,plaintiff was deprived of petre companionship,valuable services,and normal family relations.kucich and cma filed an answer denying misconduct.
the case was tried for the first time in.as noted above,prior to that trial,plaintiff settled with francis hospital and voluntarily dismissed applebaum,looyenga,prentice,gustafson,and wix from the case.the jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff in the amount of against kucich and cma.defendants appealed,and this court reversed,holding that the trial court erred as a matter of law both in precluding evidence of the dismissed hickory physicians conduct and in refusing to give the appropriate jury instruction,thereby denying defendants a fair trial.petre kucich,d.we then remanded the case for a second trial.
the second trial occurred in.in that instance,the jury returned a verdict in favor of kucich and cma.plaintiff appealed,and this court reversed,holding that the trial court was required to give the jury instruction on sole proximate cause to explain to the jury the impact of the evidence of negligence on defendants negligence.petre kucich,d.we thus remanded the case again.
the case then proceeded to trial in.however,because two of plaintiff witnesses were unavailable,the court declared a mistrial.
the case was subsequently tried for the third time,and that trial is the subject of this appeal.at that trial,plaintiff and petre younger sister,diane prindle,testified that petre suffered a heart attack on november.eight days later,petre underwent coronary artery bypass surgery.petre was subsequently discharged from the hospital on december.
roughly a month later,on december,plaintiff removed petre bandages to clean his wound and discovered a yellow blister larger than a quarter.several days later,they learned that petre had a severe infection.a plastic surgeon subsequently removed petre sternum and performed reconstructive surgery of the area using petre pectoralis muscles.petre ultimately died in december of unrelated liver cancer.
plaintiff offered the testimony of two expert physicians.an infectious disease expert opined that petre suffered from a likely sternal osteomyelitis,or an infection of the sternum bone,which was due to a staphylococcus epidermidis mrse infection that seeded at the time of petre bypass surgery.a cardiothoracic surgery expert opined that petre should have been prophylactically administered an antibiotic called vancomycin,which is effective against bacteria.
plaintiff also examined defendant vincent kucich as an adverse witness.kucich testified that he was a cardiothoracic surgeon and performed petre bypass surgery and explained the procedure and care.in particular,care for petre surgical wound was done according to a protocol.kucich would also check petre wound daily.on december,petre had a small amount of serous,or clear,fluid draining from his surgical wound.kucich explained that clear fluid drainage is common and usually not a sign of infection.if there were no other signs of infection,such as fever,redness,or tenderness,kucich would not do anything further.depending on the nature of the fluid,kucich would obtain a culture on it.
plaintiff counsel then confronted kucich with the testimony he gave at his deposition in.at that time,kucich stated that serous fluid drainage would be cultured routinely.he further stated that if he saw such drainage,he would order a culture.he admitted in his deposition that he followed this procedure with petre and ordered the culture just prior to petre discharge.however,in his testimony at trial,kucich questioned whether he had done so,observing that if he had ordered a culture of petre surgical wound drainage,petre medical chart would have contained a notation that he ordered a culture,and the medical chart contained no such order.he also stated that he did not remember giving the order for the culture or directing that a nurse do it.he added that often,nurses will order a culture on their own and tell the doctor later.he did not explain when a nurse would order a culture or when a doctor would or when the nurse would tell the doctor of the results.
nevertheless,kucich admitted that somebody obtained a culture of petre surgical wound drainage.however,whether kucich was the individual to follow up on the culture would have depended on the circumstances.kucich did not elaborate on these circumstances.he did state that he did not personally check every culture because there are so many taken.generally,he would only follow up if the drainage was purulent or if the patient had other symptoms of infection.
the culture in this case was positive for mrse.however,kucich did not learn this until sometime before his deposition in.had he known,he would have followed up with petre.rather,wix,petre cardiologist in kankakee,had the responsibility to follow up on the culture.this was because petre chose not to continue his care in blue island.a note in petre medical record,which was admitted into evidence,confirms that petre would continue his care with wix in kankakee due to the distance.it further indicated that petre would call cma office if he had any problems.the note was written by one of cma secretaries.
the individuals on kucich staff who would have checked on the culture result were marilyn kamak,physician assistant ian timms,or nurse sue wesensten.however,none of them checked the result.kucich never explained how or when any of these individuals would notify him of a culture result.
petre was discharged from francis hospital on december.cma sent a letter to wix confirming that petre would continue his postoperative care with wix.subsequently,kucich learned that petre suffered from an mrse infection,which resulted in the surgical removal of petre sternum by another doctor.
after plaintiff rested,defendants read the evidence deposition of hershel wix,petre cardiologist,into the record.wix began treating petre after his heart attack.he also treated petre following his discharge from the hospital.he saw petre on december,and he seemed quite stable at that time.wix saw petre again on december.at that time,he noted that petre surgical wound was still draining and that in some small areas,the drainage was causing mild breakdown,or deterioration,of the skin around the incision.these findings were not atypical.however,wix saw petre again on december and,and he appeared normal on those dates.wix saw petre again on january,and at that time,his surgical wound showed two areas of deterioration.wix then suspected an infection and referred petre to david dreyfuss,a plastic surgeon,for further care.
defendants then read the evidence deposition of plaintiff infectious disease expert into the record.in that testimony,that doctor opined that prophylactic use of vancomycin would have caused an increased risk of a sternal wound infection.a cardiothoracic surgeon also testified as an expert for the defense.he opined that it would not have been proper to administer vancomycin to petre prior to his surgery and concluded that kucich complied with the standard of care in caring for petre.
defendants then called kucich to testify for the second time.he testified again about the bypass surgery and what steps he took to guard against infection.he also added that he did not see petre after he was discharged from the hospital on december.referring to petre medical chart,kucich cited the note by his secretary that petre would continue his care with wix in kankakee due to the distance.
on,kucich admitted that whether or not he ordered a culture or he knew about it,he knew that there was a culture taken on december.he also reiterated that he noticed serous drainage from the surgical wound for the first time on december,but that such drainage was very common and not considered a complication.kucich then admitted that sometimes culture results were not always delivered to the person to whom they were addressed.accordingly,if a culture was ordered by his team personally,and not the hospital,then his team would follow up on it.however,they would not follow up on it unless his team name was on the report.
kucich also admitted that we always get cultures on every fluid,and that a culture was taken on petre according to standard procedure.plaintiff counsel then asked kucich whether it would be a breach of the standard of care if someone in his office knew about the culture result but did nothing.plaintiff counsel did not specify whether he was referring to the standard of care for a cardiothoracic surgeon or to some other standard of care.
plaintiff counsel then confronted kucich with his deposition testimony.at that time,when asked whether he attempted to obtain and look at the culture report within a week of it being ordered,kucich responded that he personally did not,but someone on his staff may have.when asked if he knew for sure whether anyone did,kucich responded that s omebody obviously did because the result was noted.
based on his deposition,kucich then testified at trial that he did not know about the culture result at the time,but only learned of it afterward.however,he admitted that i f my office knew and did tell someone,then yeah,there a breach of standard of care.he also admitted that cma,his office,was also a defendant in the case and that nurse sue wesensten was working under his direction.
on redirect examination,kucich examined petre medical records.an entry dated january,indicated that a culture was done on january,which had been ordered by wix.the notes contain no entry from the week of december.kucich added that his deposition testimony did not mention when cma received the results of the culture report from december.other than kucich secretary note from december,which indicated that petre would continue his care with wix in kankakee due to the distance,and the cma letter from december,which confirmed that petre would continue his care with wix,there are no notations from december in petre medical record.
following closing arguments,the jury was given various instructions.the only instruction given to the jury on how to determine the standard of care pertained to a medical doctor.that instruction provided 
a medical doctor who holds himself out as a specialist and provides service in his specialty must possess and apply the knowledge and use the skill and care ordinarily used by a reasonably well qualified specialist under circumstances similar to those shown by the evidence.a failure to do so is professional negligence.
the only way in which you may decide whether a defendant possessed and applied the knowledge and used the skill and care which the law required of him is from expert testimony presented in the trial.
you must not attempt to determine this question from any personal knowledge you have.
this instruction is based on the illinois pattern jury instruction for professional negligence.illinois pattern jury instructions,civil,hereinafter ipi.the jury was not given any specific instructions on standard of care for any other type of medical personnel.however,the jury was given an instruction on vicarious liability,which provided that cma was a corporation and could only act through its officers and employees.the vicarious liability instruction further provided that kucich was the agent of cma therefore,any act or omission of kucich was an act or omission of cma.the instruction did not refer to any other employees of cma.
the jury ultimately returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff against cma in the amount of and in favor of kucich.cma then filed a timely posttrial motion raising three issues.first,cma argued that plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence because there was no evidence of any breach or that such a breach proximately caused petre injury.second,cma argued that it was entitled to a new trial because the trial court abused its discretion in permitting plaintiff to kucich using his deposition testimony.third,cma argued that the jury verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.
in response,plaintiff asserted,inter alia,that it had established all of the elements of its prima facie case of negligence against cma.regarding the first element,duty or standard of care,plaintiff cited kucich testimony on where he admitted that if someone in his office knew of the result of the december,culture and did nothing,then that would be a breach of the standard of care.
in reply,cma asserted for the first time that plaintiff could not rely on the testimony of kucich from his during defendants as evidence of the standard of care.thereafter,plaintiff filed a motion to strike the portions of cma posttrial motion which raised these objections to kucich testimony with respect to the duty element of negligence for the first time arguing that these arguments had been waived.following a hearing,the trial court agreed and struck those sections from cma reply in support of its posttrial motion.
ultimately,the court denied cma posttrial motion on april.cma filed a notice of appeal on april.however,plaintiff subsequently filed a motion for rule sanctions on may.the court denied plaintiff motion for rule sanctions on june,and cma filed a new notice of appeal on june.
all of the issues that cma raises in this appeal turn on whether it was appropriate for plaintiff to rely on kucich testimony on during defendants to establish the elements of plaintiff prima facie case of negligence against cma.in this regard,cma contends that the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict because plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of negligence against it.cma specifically claims that kucich response to a hypothetical question on was insufficient evidence of the standard of care for a employee of cma.cma also claims that the jury verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence for similar reasons.
however,we must initially address whether cma waived this issue by failing to raise it prior to its reply in support of its posttrial motion,at which point the trial court struck the argument for failure to raise it sooner.it is that an issue is waived on appeal unless a party makes an objection at the time of a purported error and specifically raises the issue in a written posttrial motion.kapsouris rivera,d.
here,because cma failed to object to the of kucich on these grounds until its reply brief in support of its posttrial motion,the issue is waived.kapsouris,d at,at.nevertheless,because waiver is a limitation on the parties,and not on the court,we may consider an issue not raised in the trial court if the issue is one of law and is fully briefed by the parties.committee for educational rights edgar.based on this principle,and because we find,for the reasons that follow,that the trial court erred in denying cma motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,we decline to apply waiver.
a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should be granted only when all of the evidence,when viewed in the light most favorable to the opponent,so overwhelmingly favors a movant that no contrary verdict based on that evidence could ever stand.york.luke medical center,quoting pedrick peoria eastern.put another way,a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict presents a question of law as to whether,when all of the evidence is considered,together with all reasonable inferences from it in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiffs,there is a total failure or lack of evidence to prove any necessary element of the plaintiff case.york,at,at,quoting merlo public service.we review a trial court decision to deny a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict de novo.york,at,at.when the trial court has erroneously denied a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict,we will reverse the verdict without a remand.see maple gustafson.
our supreme court has articulated a different standard for the granting of a new trial because the evidentiary situation that would require a new trial differs from a situation that would justify the entry of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.maple,at,at.a motion for a new trial should be granted where the jury verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.maple,at,at.a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence where the opposite conclusion is clearly evident or where the findings of the jury are unreasonable,arbitrary,and not based on any of the evidence.maple,at,at.because the decision whether to grant a new trial is a matter of the trial court discretion,we will not reverse its ruling on such a motion absent an abuse of that discretion.maple,at,at.
in a negligence medical malpractice case,a plaintiff must prove the proper standard of care against which the defendant conduct is measured an unskilled or negligent failure to comply with the applicable standard and a resulting injury proximately caused by the defendants want of skill or care.sullivan edward hospital.unless the negligence is so grossly apparent or the treatment so common as to be within the everyday knowledge of a layperson,expert medical testimony is required to establish the standard of care.garley columbia lagrange memorial hospital,d.
here,plaintiff theory of negligence is based on what kucich staff,a nurse or otherwise,should have communicated to him.this type of negligence is not the type of negligence that would be so grossly apparent that it would speak for itself,nor could a layperson be expected to know what a doctor would have expected his nurse to have communicated to him and when.therefore,we find that expert testimony was required to establish the standard of care in this case.see,wingo rockford memorial hospital,d,using expert testimony to determine the standard of care pertinent to communications between a physician and a nurse.
the supreme court in purtill hess,articulated a process for determining whether an expert is competent to testify regarding the standard of care in a particular case.alm loyola university medical center,d.initially,plaintiff proffered expert must satisfy two foundational requirements.alm,d at,at.first,the expert must be licensed in the defendant given school of medicine.sullivan,at,at garley,d at,at.second,the proffered expert must also show that he is familiar with the methods,procedures and treatments ordinarily observed by others in the defendant community or a similar community.sullivan,at,at garley,d at,at.if the proffered expert fails to satisfy either of these two foundational requirements,the inquiry ends there,and the trial court must disallow the expert testimony.sullivan,at,at,quoting jones,see also alm,d at,at.if the proffered expert satisfies the two foundational requirements,the analysis proceeds to the third step,in which the trial court exercises its discretion to determine if the proffered expert is competent to testify in the particular case before the court.alm,d at,at.
regarding the first of the two purtill foundational requirements,both the supreme court and the legislature have recognized nursing as unique school of medicine.garley,d at,at.in addition,a defendant is entitled to have his conduct tested by the standards of his own school of medicine otherwise,a higher standard of care could be unfairly imposed on a defendant who does not belong to the same school of medicine as the proffered expert.sullivan,at,at discussing dolan galluzzo.thus,the supreme court held in sullivan that a physician can not testify to the standard of care for nursing procedures.sullivan,at,at.however,the supreme court recognized a limited exception to the licensing requirement,which was first articulated in wingo rockford memorial hospital,d.see sullivan,at,at distinguishing wingo,d at,at.
in wingo,this court held that where the allegations of negligence do not concern a nursing procedure but,rather,relate to what a nurse is required to communicate to a physician,the licensing requirement of the purtill test does not apply.wingo,d at,at.this is because the problem of imposing a higher standard of care on a defendant is not present where there is no different standard between the proffered expert school of medicine and the school of medicine to which the defendant belongs.wingo,d at,at.
moreover,as the wingo court recognized,w hether the expert is qualified to testify is not dependent on whether he is a member of the same specialty or subspecialty as the defendant but,rather,whether the allegations of negligence concern matters within his knowledge and observation.jones,at,at.thus,in wingo,although the proffered experts,obstetricians,were not licensed nurses,it was established that the allegations of negligence were well within the testifyin
