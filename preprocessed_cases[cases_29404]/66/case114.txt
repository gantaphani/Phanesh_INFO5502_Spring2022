plaintiff latarsha creekmore sued defendant maryview hospital maryview alleging that its negligent care following the caesarean section delivery of her baby injured her.after a bench trial,the district court found maryview liable for medical malpractice and entered a judgment awarding creekmore nine hundred thousand dollars in damages.
maryview appeals,arguing that the district court abused its discretion by allowing an ob gyn to testify as an expert regarding the standard of care for a nurse postpartum monitoring of a patient with preeclampsia.maryview maintains that creekmore failed to make her prima facie case for negligence because the testimony of the ob gyn did not meet the expert testimony requirements of virginia code.because neither the statute nor virginia case law precludes the expert testimony in question,we find no abuse of discretion and affirm.
on february,creekmore was admitted to maryview labor and delivery unit for the delivery of her fourth child.she had a history of high blood pressure,known as severe preeclampsia.around,creekmore gave birth to a baby boy via a caesarean section performed by sidath jayanetti,an ob gyn.she was then taken to a recovery room and attached to a machine that automatically monitored and recorded her blood pressure and heart rate every ten minutes.
sandra sutliff,an obstetrics nurse,was assigned to attend to creekmore,who was the only patient in sutliff care for the night.jayanetti gave sutliff orders to check creekmore incision site and uterus for bleeding initially every and then every hour.hospital records and testimony from creekmore partner,whitt johnson,indicate that over the next several hours,creekmore blood pressure and heart rate were erratic,and that her urine output and general physical condition declined.according to richard stokes,creekmore expert ob gyn,these three symptoms falling blood pressure,rising pulse rate,and lack of urine output are classic signs of blood loss shock,which can be a result of excessive bleeding,a significant and risk to patients with preeclampsia such as creekmore.
around midnight,johnson noticed that creekmore had begun to have hot flashes and to sweat he paged the nurse twice but got no response.sutliff checked on creekmore at and recorded only that she was resting comfortably,despite readings from the monitors showing low blood pressure and a high heart rate.over the next hour and a half,creekmore blood pressure continued to drop,and her heart rate increased gradually.johnson paged the nurse again,still with no answer.
at,in response to a significant difference between creekmore systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures,or pulse pressure,nurse christine weber directed sutliff to administer a large quantity of intravenous fluid,or bolus,to raise creekmore low diastolic pressure.however,less than twenty minutes later,at,an alarm on creekmore monitor sounded when her blood pressure descended precipitously.sutliff responded to the alarm and recorded that creekmore was clammy and unresponsive,sweating profusely,and had gone into hypovolemic shock from low blood volume.sutliff also noted that creekmore urine output had dropped dramatically.she administered another bolus.
three minutes later,at,weber called jayanetti to inform him of creekmore blood pressure and urine output.another nurse called jayanetti again at,and sutliff called him at and told him that was unresponsive.on jayanetti instructions,sutliff summoned the house resident,who arrived in creekmore room at.at that point,johnson recalled being awoken and asked to move out of the way,as he watched several people come into the room,move creekmore into another bed,and wheel her out.he noticed a significant amount of blood on creekmore sheets and gown.
creekmore was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit at upon evaluation,it was determined that she had lost approximately half of her blood volume,causing oxygen deprivation to the brain and a massive stroke.stokes testified that he believed creekmore had suffered from hemolyses low platelets hellp syndrome,a severe form of preeclampsia that can result in a loss of the ability to clot one blood,or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy dic.creekmore underwent additional surgery as well as transfusions of clotting factors and blood.
as a result of her stroke,creekmore suffered severe and painful physical and cognitive impairments that continue to impact her life today.on february,creekmore filed a complaint against,among others,maryview,seeking three million five hundred thousand dollars.following dismissal of the united states as a party,creekmore filed a motion to remand the remaining claims against maryview to state court in virginia.on november,the district court denied that motion and retained jurisdiction pursuant to its discretionary authority under c,identifying convenience and fairness to the parties and considerations of judicial economy as the key factors in its decision.the matter proceeded to a bench trial on december,and,and the district court entered judgment in favor of creekmore on january.maryview appealed.
on appeal,maryview contends that the district court should have barred stokes,an ob gyn,from testifying as an expert with respect to the standard of care for a nurse postpartum monitoring of a patient with preeclampsia.we review the trial court determination of this issue for abuse of discretion.see united states grimmond,cir a district court evidentiary rulings are reviewed under the narrow abuse of discretion standard.hinkley koehler,a scertaining whether a proffered witness is qualified to testify as an expert is a determination lying within the sound discretion of the trial court that will not be reversed unless it appears clearly that the expert was not qualified in the field in which he gives evidence.quoting swersky higgins.
it is worthwhile to point out that because this case was heard by a federal district court,the federal rules of evidence would generally control the admissibility of expert witness testimony.see,bryte ex rel.bryte am.household,cir noting that in diversity cases,federal evidentiary law governs the procedural question of the admissibility of expert testimony,while state law controls substantive matters concerning the sufficiency of evidence.
nevertheless,because the testimony at issue here was required for a medical malpractice claim under virginia law,the sufficiency of its substance to meet plaintiff prima facie case is governed by state law.see hottle beech aircraft,cir t here are circumstances in which a question of admissibility of evidence is so intertwined with a state substantive rule that the state rule will be followed in order to give full effect to the state substantive policy.internal quotation marks omitted quoting diantonio northampton accomack mem l,cir.
under either the federal rules of evidence or the virginia rules of evidence,the district court decision to allow stokes to testify as an expert was discretionary and is reviewed as such.thus,our analysis and conclusion remain the same regardless of which evidentiary rules control.
in an action for medical malpractice under virginia law,
the standard of care by which the acts or omissions are to be judged shall be that degree of skill and diligence practiced by a reasonably prudent practitioner in the field of practice or specialty in this commonwealth,and the testimony of an expert witness,otherwise qualified,as to such standard of care,shall be admitted.
a emphasis added.a witness shall be qualified as an expert in the applicable standard of care 
if he demonstrates expert knowledge of the standards of the defendant specialty and of what conduct conforms or fails to conform to those standards and if he has had active clinical practice in either the defendant specialty or a related field of medicine within one year of the date of the alleged act or omission forming the basis of the action.
id.both requirements the knowledge requirement and the active clinical practice requirement must be satisfied before an expert may testify regarding the standard of care.hinkley,at,at.
the knowledge requirement does not demand an identical
