introduction 
after plaintiff and appellant jessica chan mother died from internal hemorrhaging related to coumadin use following heart surgery,chan successfully sued defendant and respondent peter curran for medical malpractice.neither the sufficiency of the evidence to support the malpractice verdict,nor any other issue associated with the trial and the rendition of the jury verdict,is before us.rather,the sole issue on appeal is the trial court postverdict reduction of the million noneconomic damages award to,as required by the medical injury compensation reform act of micra stats,ch,pp.chan attacks the micra cap on multiple constitutional grounds as violating equal protection,due process and the right to jury trial.all of her arguments,however,are ultimately grounded on the assertion she is entitled to seek noneconomic damages sufficient to cover attorney fees.no california court has ever endorsed such a proposition,and,as we discuss,it is contrary to many legal principles.
since micra enactment in,the cap on noneconomic damages has been before the california supreme court many times.in,the high court upheld the cap against equal protection and due process challenges.fein permanente cal d,fein.in,the court ruled the cap also applies to actions for partial indemnity,voicing no criticism of the statute and reiterating micra reflects a strong public policy to contain the costs of medical malpractice insurance by controlling or redistributing liability for damages,thereby maximizing the availability of medical services to meet the state health care needs.western steamship lines,san pedro peninsula hospital cal th,d,western steamship.in,the court explained how the damages cap interacts with micra provision for periodic payments,stating the cap is an attempt to control and reduce medical malpractice insurance costs by placing a predictable,uniform limit on the defendant liability for noneconomic damages.salgado county of los angeles cal th,d,salgado.the following year,in,the court held the cap applies to claims under the federal emergency medical treatment and active labor act,discerning congress incorporated state damages law to preserve damages limitations and to respond to concerns raised about the federal statute impact on the medical malpractice insurance problem.barris county of los angeles cal th,d,barris.most recently,in,the court ruled the cap can not be further diminished by setoffs for settlements attributable to noneconomic damages.the legislature focus in enacting the statute,the court stated,was to address the problem of unpredictable jury awards,the impact on settlements being only indirect.rashidi moser cal th,d,rashidi.although asked to do so,the court declined to grant review in rashidi on the continuing constitutional validity of the damages cap.
chan nevertheless maintains fein,which rejected equal protection and due process challenges,is no longer controlling,claiming she has shown there no longer is a medical malpractice insurance crisis and therefore the rationale for the cap indeed,for all of micra no longer exists.thus,according to chan,the time is ripe to the constitutionality of section under a changed circumstances analysis.she further contends the supreme court has never considered her claim the cap infringes on the right to jury trial.
as we explain,the courts are extremely chary of invalidating legislative acts that have previously been held constitutional.our supreme court has done so only on rare occasion,and we conclude chan has not shown there is no reasonably plausible purpose presently advanced by section.the high court has also considered and rejected variations of chan right to jury trial argument,and,in any case,statutes defining the measure or limit of legally recoverable damages do not constitutionally interfere with the fundamental province of a jury.we therefore conclude the legitimate debate over the wisdom of micra noneconomic damages cap remains a matter for the legislature and state electorate 
ii.discussion 
in may,the governor citing serious problems that had arisen throughout the state as a result of a rapid increase in medical malpractice insurance premiums convened the legislature in extraordinary session to consider measures aimed at remedying the situation.in response,the legislature enacted the medical injury compensation reform act of micra,a lengthy statute which attacked the problem on several fronts.american bank trust community hospital cal d,american bank.in broad outline,the act attempted to reduce the incidence and severity of medical malpractice injuries by strengthening governmental oversight of education,licensing and discipline of physicians and health care providers,sought to curtail unwarranted insurance premium increases by authorizing alternative insurance coverage programs and by establishing new procedures to review substantial rate increases,and attempted to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of medical malpractice litigation by revising a number of legal rules applicable to such litigation.id.at pp.
in the legislature view,t he continuing availability of adequate medical care depends directly on the availability of adequate insurance coverage,which in turn operates as a function of costs associated with medical malpractice litigation.western steamship,supra,cal th at.accordingly,micra includes a variety of provisions all of which are calculated to reduce the cost of insurance by limiting the amount and timing of recovery in cases of professional negligence.see bus,limiting contingency fees in medical malpractice actions,admitting evidence of collateral source payments and precluding subrogation on behalf of collateral sources code civ,authorizing periodic payments for future damages in excess of,with termination of benefits in the event of death.western steamship,at.
the cap on noneconomic damages set forth in section is one of these provisions the legislature has enacted a comprehensive,multifaceted scheme designed to address a perceived threat to our state health care system by reducing the cost of medical malpractice insurance.section constitutes a key component of this program.western steamship,supra,cal th at.
during the,the supreme court upheld many of micra provisions against constitutional challenges,including section.fein,supra,cal d at upholding roa lodi medical group,cal d,roa upholding bus,limiting contingency fees barme wood cal d,barme upholding,limiting collateral source recovery from malpractice defendants american bank,supra,cal d at upholding code civ,governing periodic payouts of and imposing some limits on future damages.as noted at the outset,the court has also subsequently addressed the noneconomic damages cap numerous times,without criticism of the statute and reiterating micra public policy underpinnings.rashidi,supra,cal th at barris,supra,cal th at pp.salgado,supra,cal th at pp.western steamship,supra,cal th at.
as to section,specifically,the supreme court has observed,o ne of the problems identified in the legislative hearings was the unpredictability of the size of large noneconomic damage awards,resulting from the inherent difficulties in valuing such damages and the great disparity in the price tag which different juries placed on such losses.the legislature could reasonably have determined that an limit would provide a more stable base on which to calculate insurance rates.western steamship,supra,cal th at,quoting fein,supra,cal d at.the court further noted,s ubjecting health care providers to unlimited liability for noneconomic damages in third party suits can only thwart the goal of containing insurance costs by eliminating the statutory constraint on litigation expenses.western steamship,at see also salgado,supra,cal th at cap is an attempt to control and reduce medical malpractice insurance costs by placing a predictable,uniform limit on the defendant liability for noneconomic damages.
showing with respect to changed circumstances 
chan showing 
chan acknowledges the cases discussed above,but contends the medical malpractice climate is profoundly different today than it was in when micra was enacted and in the when the supreme court passed on the constitutionality of its provisions.
in the trial court,chan offered evidence that,since,inflation has caused a roughly devaluation of the dollar.thus,adjusted for inflation,the noneconomic damages cap enacted in was worth million in dollars.or,flipped around,in dollars equaled only in dollars.chan also offered the declaration of phillip allman,an economist,who observed there has been an approximately increase in the cost of legal services since and opined the noneconomic damages cap discourages lawyers from taking many malpractice cases.government statistics proffered by chan also showed a precipitous increase in the cost of medical services and medical experts hourly fees.
chan additionally offered declarations from current california attorneys who take personal injury cases on a contingency basis.however,because of micra,they either refuse to consider medical malpractice cases altogether,or take only those cases that appear strong and involve large economic damages,so the total amount of recoverable damages is likely to exceed million.these attorneys declared they turn away from to over percent of facially meritorious malpractice claims.thus,according to these attorneys,cases involving severe injury or death to the elderly and unemployed often do not reach the courts because economic damages are likely to be small,since lost wages are usually nonexistent and,if the victim is deceased,there are no future medical costs.
these attorneys also discussed their view that there are serious imbalances in the resources plaintiffs and defendants are able to bring to bear in contingency fee cases,claiming lawyers can far outspend and cases because their clients pay by the hour and micra does not limit the amount of collectable fees.as did chan economist,these attorneys pointed out the high cost of investigating and proving medical malpractice given the ever rising costs of litigation,including the cost of expert witnesses.some also noted the additional risk that doctors,aware of the noneconomic damages cap,will invoke another provision of micra allowing them to unilaterally reject settlement offers an insurer might otherwise accept,further driving up litigation costs.
chan also pointed to empirical studies of lawyers across the country,recounted in legal periodicals,confirming the anecdotal evidence provided by the attorney declarations that damages caps appear to reduce contingency fee lawyers interest in taking medical malpractice cases with limited noneconomic damages and encourage them to focus on cases with high economic damages.across all states,most attorneys rejected more than percent of the medical malpractice cases brought to them.about percent of time this was because the damages expected from a victory were viewed as insufficient to make the case worth the attorney time.on the whole,if a lawyer perceived a percent chance of success,the lawyer would want a case worth a percent chance of success,a case worth and a percent chance of success,a case worth million.
as for this case,specifically,chan attorney submitted declarations outlining how the costs incurred approximately and legal fees approximately,if based on hourly rates between and an hour far exceeded the total jury award after the adjustment under micra net award,let alone the maximum allowable contingency fee thereon 
finally,chan asserted proposition,passed by the voters in,has so completely solved the problem of high medical malpractice insurance rates there is no further need for micra noneconomic damages cap.proposition prohibits the insurance commissioner from approving rates that are excessive,inadequate,or unfairly discriminatory,and from allowing such rates to remain in effect.chan submitted the declaration of an actuary stating that between micra enactment in,and proposition enactment in,medical malpractice insurance premiums rose an average of percent per year,but since,premiums have increased an average of only percent per year.during both periods,there were years in which premiums spiked by more than percent,but that occurred far more often in the period.the actuary further opined california medical malpractice insurers are enjoying a period of high profits,both in the abstract and in comparison to their counterparts nationwide.
curran showing 
curran did not submit evidence rebutting chan claims of inflation and rising litigation costs.instead,he submitted a declaration from james hurley,an actuary,who discussed the past and continuing efficacy of micra in holding the line on medical malpractice insurance costs.he opined the noneconomic damages cap has succeeded in having,from on,an ongoing downward influence on the cost of medical malpractice insurance and that without the cap,it would be reasonable to expect increases in rates.according to hurley,eliminating the cap could destabilize the insurance market because of likely increases in claim costs and potential reduced willing underwriting capacity.in support of this opinion,hurley cited figures showing various annual rate changes in the were lower in california than in other states.he also noted figures associated with others states laws and with texas to a cap.hurley further opined california insurers are not,despite micra,profiting more than their nationwide counterparts once a unique situation in new york is removed from the calculus,nor are they keeping reserves or surpluses out of line with those counterparts.
curran also submitted a declaration from his attorney asserting curran,contrary to chan accusations concerning an imbalance in resources,used fewer and less expensive resources than chan in litigating the case.a declaration from curran insurer confirmed the partner rate paid to curran attorney was typical of such cases.
equal protection 
where,as here,a disputed statutory disparity implicates no suspect class or fundamental right,equal protection of the law is denied only where there is no rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental purpose.johnson of justice cal th,d,johnson,quoting people turnage cal th,d,turnage.
chan does not dispute that the rational relationship test applies to her equal protection challenge to micra noneconomic damages cap.see fein,supra,cal d at,rational relationship test applicable to equal protection challenge to section.she points out,however,the supreme court observed in fein a reviewing court must conduct a serious and genuine judicial inquiry into the correspondence between the challenged classification and the legislative goals.fein,at.
this has never been interpreted to mean,however,that the courts may properly strike down a statute simply because they disagree with the wisdom of the law or because they believe that there is a fairer method for dealing with the problem.citation.the court in fein explained that in that case,as well as in the court earlier micra decisions,it had conducted the serious and genuine judicial inquiry by finding that the statutory classifications are rationally related to the realistically conceivable legislative purpose s of micra,and by declining to invent fictitious purposes that could not have been within the contemplation of the legislature warden state bar cal th,d,warden rejecting argument court had made rational relationship standard more stringent.
the basic and conventional standard for reviewing economic and social welfare legislation that draws nonsuspect classifications and does not impinge on fundamental rights invests legislation involving such differentiated treatment with a presumption of constitutionality and requir es merely that distinctions drawn bear some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate state purpose.citation.warden,supra,cal th at,quoting bd.of medical examiners cal d,disapproved on other grounds in woodland hills residents,city council of los angeles cal d.thus,under the rational relationship test,w here there are plausible reasons for the classification our inquiry is at an end.warden,supra,at accord,johnson,supra,cal th at.
this standard of rationality does not depend upon whether lawmakers ever actually articulated the purpose they sought to achieve.nor must the underlying rationale be empirically substantiated.heller doe,d.while the realities of the subject matter can not be completely ignored id.at,a court may engage in rational speculation as to the justifications for the legislative choice id.at.it is immaterial for rational basis review whether or not any such speculation has a foundation in the record.turnage,at pp.johnson,supra,cal th at accord,warden,supra,cal th at a legislative choice is not subject to courtroom factfinding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data.w hen there is a reasonably conceivable justification for a classification,i t is constitutionally irrelevant whether the reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision citations,or whether the conceived reason for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature.warden,supra,cal th at.
while parties challenging legislation under the equal protection clause may introduce evidence supporting their claim that the legislation is irrational,they can not prevail if it is evident that the question is at least debatable.stinett tam th,d stinett,quoting minnesota clover leaf creamery,d.thus,t o mount a successful rational basis challenge,a party must negative every conceivable basis that might support the disputed statutory disparity.heller,supra,at see turnage,supra,cal th at.if a plausible basis exists for the disparity,courts may not its wisdom,fairness,or logic.heller,at see turnage,at.johnson,supra,cal th at.
as we have discussed,during the,the supreme court upheld numerous provisions of micra against equal protection challenges,including the noneconomic damages cap.fein,supra,cal d upholding roa,supra,cal d upholding bus,capping the recovery of contingency fees in medical malpractice cases barme,supra,cal d upholding,limiting collateral source recovery from malpractice defendants american bank,supra,cal d at upholding code civ,governing payout of,and limiting some,future damages.
the court readily concluded the damages cap was rationally related to the legislature declared purpose of responding to an insurance crisis.fein,supra,cal d at.it appears obvious that this section by placing a ceiling of on the recovery of noneconomic damages is rationally related to the objective of reducing the costs of malpractice defendants and their insurers.id.at.
given that the supreme court has already rejected an equal protection challenge to micra noneconomic damages cap,chan relies on a changed circumstances argument claiming a there no longer is a medical malpractice insurance crisis,b proposition,under which the california insurance commissioner now sets medical malpractice insurance rates,has stabilized the insurance market,and c the ravages of inflation have decimated the economic significance of in recoverable noneconomic damages.chan thus asserts micra damages cap is no longer rationally defensible.
the role of changed circumstances in constitutional analysis is fraught with institutional tension and analytical difficulties.it is not easy for courts to step in and say that what was rational in the past has been made irrational by the passage of time,change of circumstances,or the availability of new knowledge.nor should it be.too many issues of line drawing make such judicial decisions hazardous.precisely at what point does a court say that what once made sense no longer has any rational basis what degree of legislative action,or of conscious inaction,is needed when that uncertain point is reached these difficulties and many others counsel restraint,and do so powerfully.united states v.then cir,con.opn.of calabresi,see generally changed circumstances and judicial review.
the maxims that govern rational basis review further contribute to the difficulties of a changed circumstances analysis,including that classifications may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data and are permissible if rationally related to any realistically conceivable legislative purpose and regardless of whether the conceived reason actually motivated the legislature.warden,supra,cal th at pp,italics omitted.moreover,courts may engage in rational speculation as to the justification for a legislative choice,and it is immaterial whether or not any such speculation has a foundation in the record.turnage,supra,cal th at pp.johnson,supra,cal th at santa monica beach,superior court cal th,fn.d,santa monica beach noting in discussing changed circumstances that court has more closely examined legislative factfinding where fundamental rights are at stake.
thus,g enerally,modification or repeal of a statute made obsolete by virtue of changed conditions is a legislative,not a judicial,prerogative.stinnett,supra,th at.
nevertheless,the courts have,on rare occasion,concluded changed circumstances can transform a statute into an irrational one and invalidated antiquated statutes on equal protection grounds.burlington northern railroad department of public service regulation cir,fn.further noting w here courts have invalidated archaic statutes,there is often an independent constitutional basis for so doing,a belated recognition that the statutes were unconstitutional as written see also santa monica beach,supra,cal th at the circumstances for such invalidation are quite narrow.
chan relies on brown merlo cal d brown,in which the supreme court employed a changed circumstances analysis to invalidate portions of california venerable guest statute,which had been enacted in and barred nonpaying passengers from suing negligent host drivers.the statute also had a series of limiting statutory loopholes,that created an absurd and illogical pattern which completely drain ed the statute of any rationality it might conceivably claim.id.at.the court articulated the applicable analytical framework as follows a classification which once was rational because of a given set of circumstances may lose its rationality if the relevant factual premise is totally altered.id.at,italics added.
the court identified the two justifications traditionally advanced to support the guest statute classification scheme as the promotion of hospitality by insulating generous drivers from lawsuits instigated by ungrateful guests and the elimination of collusive suits,in which a host fraudulently confesses negligence so as to permit his guest to collect from the host insurance.brown,supra,cal d at.it then concluded two pivotal developments wholly undermined the first justification the expansion of the duty of due care in rowland christian cal d,and the widespread prevalence of automobile liability insurance.brown,at pp.fn.in,california tort law imposed duty of due care only on business invitees and a lesser standard of care to licensees,including social guests,fn.in late automobile liability insurance was the exception rather than the rule.in short,it was now irrational to assume that if a recipient of generosity is permitted recovery for negligent injuries,the cause of ingratitude will be served or the cause of hospitality will be plundered.id.at.the court similarly dispensed with the collusive justification recent cases invalidating the entire range of intrafamilial immunities,establish ed that it is unreasonable to eliminate causes of action of an entire class of persons simply because some undefined portion of the designated class may file fraudulent lawsuits.id.at.the constitutional vice with the guest statute as to this justification,said the court,was that it was so grossly over inclusive prohibiting all guests from bringing any negligence claims against a driver as to defy notions of fairness or reasonableness.id.at.
in sum,brown concluded that given sea changes in the common law of torts and the availability of automobile liability insurance,along with the statutory exceptions further undermining any conceivable rationality for the statute,there was no remaining rational underpinning for the challenged provisions of california archaic guest statute.the court also observed,at the end of its opinion,that f rom their very inception,automobile guest statutes have been the subject of severe criticism,both academic and judicial.in our view,the widespread antipathy to such statutes is in large part a reflection of the irrationality and unfairness of these legislative schemes,which strip the single class of automobile guests of any protection from negligently inflicted injuries.brown,supra,cal d at pp,fn.omitted.subsequently,in cooper bray cal d,cooper,the court invalidated another provision of the guest statute,barring from suing permissive drivers,for reasons similar to those it identified in brown.
in in re paris air crash cir,the ninth circuit,in rejecting an equal protection challenge to california bar against punitive damages in wrongful death cases in contrast to their availability in survival actions,distinguished brown and cooper as dealing with long repudiated guest statues.the guest statutes,said the circuit court,were more burdensome and anomalous than other limitations on recovery for four reasons.in re paris air crash,supra,at.first,the guest statutes had denied a large class of persons any compensation at all for grievous physical injury.ibid.second,the guest statutes were not based on any contemporary justification but rather on vestigial analogies to the law of bailments.ibid.third,guest statutes were generally thought to be irrational and vestigial.ibid.and,fourth,the guest statutes pertained to common law tort actions,in which the courts played a more active role.ibid.accordingly,the ninth circuit did not consider brown and cooper particularly apposite.in re paris air crash,at.
three of these reasons apply here.first,micra noneconomic damages cap does not wholly deny compensation to medical malpractice plaintiffs there is no limitation on the recovery of actual damages,medical costs and lost wages and there is only a partial limitation on the recovery of noneconomic damages.second,micra is not based on vestigial analogies to archaic law.and third,while there is significant debate about the wisdom and efficacy of damages caps in controlling medical malpractice insurance costs,it is a matter of legitimate debate.see fein,supra,cal d at pp.accordingly,micra is not afflicted with the peculiar characteristics of the antiquated guest statutes that colored the equal protection analyses in brown and cooper.
we also think it is significant that when the supreme court decided fein the majority disregarded two objections by the dissent which lie at the heart of the equal protection challenge chan now advances.see fein,supra,cal d at acknowledging and responding to dissent.first,the dissent maintained the malpractice insurance crisis was fading into the past and therefore the stated rationale for micra no longer existed.fein,at dsn.opn.of bird.second,the dissent was concerned inflation would inevitably reduce the value of the fixed cap.id.at dsn.opn.of bird,even this small figure will gradually decline as inflation erodes the real value of the allowable compensation.thus,the very circumstances that underlie chan purported changed circumstances argument were already emergent and rejected when the court decided fein.accordingly,we do not view this as a situation where the relevant context is totally altered.brown,supra,cal d at.
nor does the evidentiary showing chan made demonstrate that the relevant factual premise for micra noneconomic damages cap and all the other provisions of micra is totally altered.
chan insists proposition insures there will never again be a malpractice insurance crisis.but this measure does not prohibit rate increases or require low rates.rather,it provides that insurance rates shall be maintained at fair levels by requiring insurers to justify all future increases.insurance rates,regulation,commissioner,cal.legis.serv.west.thus,proposition focuses on a fair return given economic realities,an insurance company projected income and losses.fogel farmers group,th,d fogel regs.tit.while proposition may prevent insurers from unilaterally raising rates without administrative oversight,it does not prohibit rate increases that are fairly related to costs.see fogel,supra,th at regs.tit.proposition,then,is concerned with actual costs,but there is nothing in the proposition,itself,that is a check on such costs.accordingly,the measure provides no assurance medical malpractice rates would stay in check should micra noneconomic damages cap be removed.curran actuary,moreover,opined the damages cap has,all along,exerted a downward influence on the cost of medical malpractice insurance and,without the cap,it would be reasonable to expect increases in rates.
chan also has not shown that the underlying circumstances that gave rise to the medical malpractice insurance problem that reached crisis proportions in the no longer exist.see american bank,supra,cal d at pp.identifying some of the m any factors contributing to the problems that had arisen in the medical malpractice field.the situation,as we see it,is akin to attacking a rent control ordinance on the ground rents have stabilized there would no longer be,under chan theory,a crisis in the rental housing market and thus no justification for rent control.however,the crisis only truly abates if the factors that caused it,a greater demand for housing than there is supply to meet it no longer exist.see santa monica beach,supra,cal th at pp.denying a takings challenge to rent control,stating t he modern view is that a legitimate and rational goal of price or rate regulation is the protection of consumer welfare irrespective of the existence of an emergency and asking rhetorically h ow long would a court,or a litigant,have to wait to give the law a fair chance to work before declaring that it is a failure and therefore unconstitutional,italics added san remo hotel city and county of san francisco cal th,d,m aintaining the availability of housing supply is a reasonable means of addressing san franciscans housing needs,italics added.
in fact,in american bank,the supreme court rejected an argument that micra periodic payment provision was unconstitutional because,after passage of the legislation,overall medical costs continued to rise.the court pointed out that the act was focused on reducing the cost of malpractice insurance and alleviating the myriad problems that caused,not on medical costs overall.it further observed,indeed,in this respect insurance costs,statistics suggest that micra was in fact successful.american bank,supra,cal d at.the court did not begin to suggest that the act apparent success rendered it,at the same time,unconstitutional.furthermore,the legislative declared in the preamble to micra that the statutory remedy herein provided is intended to provide an adequate and reasonable remedy within the limits of what the foregoing public health and safety considerations permit now and into the foreseeable future.stats,ch,italics added.
other than her reliance on proposition,which we have concluded is not the palliative she claims,chan has not demonstrated that the fundamentals of our health care system and its interface with our tort and insurance systems that gave rise to the declared insurance crisis,no longer exist,rendering micra provisions of no plausible utility.see warden,supra,cal th at.until such a showing can be made,the debate over the wisdom and efficacy of micra noneconomic damages cap remains within the province of the legislature and the voters of this state.see salgado,supra,cal th at whatever their merits,plaintiff arguments that periodic payments of future noneconomic damages unfairly deprived him of needed compensation and resources to pay costs and attorney fees,are more appropriately addressed to the legislature see also quackenbush superior court th,d quackenbush while plaintiff leveled legitimate criticism s of statute prohibiting drunk and uninsured motorists from recovering any noneconomic damages in negligence actions,any change to the classifications was a legislative task,not one to be performed by the judiciary.
our view is not altered by the united state supreme court recent opinion in shelby county holder,d shelby county,to which chan also cites.in that case,the supreme court,in light of changed circumstances,invalidated the reauthorization of the voting rights act coverage formula,which incorporated the formula originally enacted in.shelby county,at pp.the court viewed the act as a sharp departure from the constitutional norms dictated by the equal sovereignty of the states and federal government,which had been justified for a number of years only by exceptional conditions.id.at.nearly years later,however,things had changed dramatically.while there was no doubt voter participation had improved because of the act id.at pp,this did not make the specifics of the challenged formula immune from scrutiny.id.at.the problem,according to the court,was that the formula was based on data and eradicated practices specifically,low voter turnout in the and early and literacy tests that had long been abolished.id.at,italics added.the court refused to sanction an extraordinary departure from the traditional course of relations between the states and the federal government id.at,quoting presley etowah county comm,on the basis of historic facts that indisputably no longer existed and had no logical relation to the present day.shelby county,supra,at.
while there is no doubt micra is a significant legislative enactment,it is not a federal law,and does not impact the fundamental constitutional compact between the states and the federal government.thus,the extreme reticence to infringe on state sovereign power that drove the analysis in shelby county does not drive us here.rather,micra is of the same class as other state statutes controlling the measure and recovery of damages.see jenkins county of los angeles th,d upholding,barring felons from recovering any noneconomic damages in negligence cases quackenbush,supra,th at,upholding,barring drunk drivers and uninsured motorists from recovering any noneconomic damages in negligence case see also stout turney cal d,discussing evolution of and legislature decision to adopt the more restrictive measure of damages for real estate fraud werner southern california associated newspapers cal d,werner upholding imposing limitations on libel and slander damages and largely limiting recovery to special damages cadlo metalclad insulation th,d cadlo describing survival statute,code civ,barring recovery of pain and suffering damages,as effectively impos ing a limit on the types of recoverable damages when the plaintiff dies before judgment in re paris air crash,supra,at pp.upholding california statutes and case law precluding the recovery of punitive damages in wrongful death cases.
furthermore,unlike the formula specifics at issue in shelby county that were demonstrably and irrefutably nonexistent when congress reauthorized the formula in,there is no evidence in the record here that the factors that precipitated the medical malpractice insurance crisis addressed by micra no longer exist and the act in no plausible way continues to advance the legislature purpose in enacting it.
chan observes courts in some other states have ruled damages caps bear no rational relationship to controlling insurance costs.see stinnett,supra,th at,fn.summarizing cases estate of mccall united states so d,mccall reports have failed to establish a direct correlation between damages caps and reduced malpractice premiums arbino johnson johnson ohio,damages caps violated rational basis test because they imposed the cost of the intended benefit to the public solely upon those most severely injured.
however,courts in many other states have upheld damages caps.see,macdonald city hospital,the legislature could have rationally believed that decreasing the cap on noneconomic damages would reduce rising medical malpractice premiums and,in turn,prevent physicians from leaving the state thereby increasing the quality of,and access to,healthcare for west virginia residents.judd drezga utah,the legislature determination that it needed to respond to the perceived medical malpractice crisis was logically followed by action designed to control costs.mccall,supra,so d at dsn.opn.of polston,listing cases.
moreover,in fein,the supreme court acknowledged some other courts had invalidated damages limitations in medical malpractice cases.fein,supra,cal d at.with one exception,observed the court,these all involved limitations on both actual and noneconomic damages.ibid.in any event,the court continued,no principle of california or federal constitutional law prohibits the legislature from limiting the recovery of damages in a particular setting in order to further a legitimate state interest.ibid.we therefore conclude fein remains the controlling authority as to the constitutional validity of micra noneconomic damages cap on equal protection grounds and reject chan equal protection challenge to section.
due process 
the due process claim that has historically been advanced against micra damages provisions is that the act curtails or imposes new constraints on what was historically recoverable in medical malpractice actions without providing plaintiffs an adequate quid pro quo,fein,supra,cal d at pp.challenge to noneconomic damages cap american bank,supra,cal d at pp.challenge to provisions allowing periodic payment of future damages and limiting some of those damages on the plaintiff death.
the supreme court rejected this argument,explaining it is well established that a plaintiff has no vested property right in a particular measure of damages,and that the legislature possesses broad authority to modify the scope and nature of such damages.citations.since the demise of the substantive due process analysis of lochner new york,it has been clear that the constitutionality of measures affecting such economic rights under the due process clause does not depend on a judicial assessment of the justifications for the legislation or of the wisdom or fairness of the enactment,the adequacy of the quid pro quo.so long as the measure is rationally related to a legitimate state interest,policy determinations as to the need for,and the desirability of,the enactment are for the legislature.american bank,supra,cal d.fein,supra,cal d at pp,italics omitted.
the court also pointed out past cases had made clear that the legislature retains broad control over the measure,as well as the timing,of damages that a defendant is obligated to pay and a plaintiff is entitled to receive,and that the legislature may expand or limit recoverable damages so long as its action is rationally related to a legitimate state interest.in werner,supra,cal d,for example,our court applied the rational relationship standard in dismissing a due process attack on a statute civil code section which permitted a plaintiff who brought a libel or slander action against a newspaper generally to obtain only special damages,largely eliminating the traditional right to obtain general damages that such a plaintiff had enjoyed before the statute.fein,supra,cal d at,italics omitted.
it was obvious to the court that section by placing a ceiling of on the recovery of noneconomic damages w as rationally related to the objective of reducing the costs of malpractice defendants and their insurers.fein,supra,cal d at.the provision was therefore not constitutionally infirm under the due process clause.
it was also worth noting,said the court,that in seeking a means of lowering malpractice costs,the legislature placed no limits whatsoever on a plaintiff right to recover for all of the economic,pecuniary damages such as medical expenses or lost earnings resulting from the injury,but instead confined the statutory limitations to the recovery of noneconomic damages,and even then permitted up to a award for such damages.thoughtful jurists and legal scholars have for some time raised serious questions as to the wisdom of awarding damages for pain and suffering in any negligence case,noting,inter alia,the inherent difficulties in placing a monetary value on such losses,the fact that money damages are at best only imperfect compensation for such intangible injuries and that such damages are generally passed on to,and borne by,innocent consumers.this is fn.in the opinion.while the general propriety of such damages is,of course,firmly imbedded in our common law jurisprudence see,capelouto kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,no california case of which we are aware has ever suggested that the right to recover for such noneconomic injuries is constitutionally immune from legislative limitation or revision.fein,supra,cal d at pp,italics omitted.
in this case,chan is advancing a different due process argument one grounded on the right of access to the courts for all persons.payne superior court cal d,fn,payne.chan theory in this regard is as follows medical malpractice claims can not realistically be pursued without legal representation.attorneys almost always take medical malpractice cases on a contingency fee basis.in many cases,as in the instant one,the largest component of the verdict is noneconomic damages.thus,the noneconomic damages verdict is the most significant monetary pool for attorney fees.in today dollars,however,does not yield enough in contingency fees to make prosecuting most medical malpractice claims economically feasible,effectively denying most malpractice victims access to the courts.
this is essentially the same due process argument that was advanced in roa,supra,cal d at pages,one of the panoply of cases,along with fein and american bank,initially challenging micra.roa,however,involved a challenge to micra attorney fees provision limiting contingency percentages bus,not to the act damages provisions.even assuming statutory fee limitations are generally permissible the supreme court pointed out in roa the law is replete with statutory limitations on fee recoveries roa,at,the plaintiffs maintained micra contingency restrictions resulted in fees so low that in practice the statute will make it impossible for injured persons to retain an attorney to represent them.roa,at.because the plaintiffs made no showing that was true and because the micra limitations were in line with other statutory contingency limits,the court concluded the fee statute was not unconstitutional on its face.roa,at.
our initial concern with chan due process argument,seemingly borrowed from roa which involved micra contingency fee statute,is that it is misdirected in the context of a challenge to one of micra damages statutes.what chan insists is constitutionally required is that noneconomic damages be potentially sufficient to cover attorney fees.this is difficult to reconcile with the fact california ascribes to the american rule under which parties must bear their own attorney fees unless a statute or contract expressly provides for such.see salgado,supra,cal th at.indeed,in salgado,the supreme court reversed a malpractice judgment that,among other things,attempted to lessen the impact of the noneconomic damages cap by requiring the defendant to pay the plaintiff attorney fees.ibid.the court also rejected the argument micra periodic payment provision is flawed because a award allows for the payment of attorney fees and court costs.id.at.plaintiff arguments,whatever their merits,are more appropriately addressed to the legislature.id.at.
chan position is also difficult to reconcile with the fact there is a sharp demarcation in the law between damages and costs incurred in brining suit,including attorney fees.see code civ.damages,including noneconomic damages,are specifically defined in california law and do not include the attorney fees incurred in prosecuting the lawsuit to recover them.see generally,et,et,et see also code civ,except as attorney fees are specifically provided for by statute,the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement,express or implied,of the parties but parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to their costs,as hereinafter provided.simke,chodos,silberfeld anteau,athans th,d generally,damages do not include attorney fees incurred and sought in the present litigation caci describing types of damages,instructing jury not to award attorney fees as damages.
accordingly,in spelling out a measure of damages,or in limiting or excluding certain types of damages,we are hard pressed to see why the legislature must,as a matter of constitutional due process,take into account the recovery of attorney fees.indeed,the ramifications of such a mandate would be startling,given the number of contexts in which recoverable damages have been limited.see,fein,supra,cal d at pp.discussing cases involving limits on recoverable damages and explaining there is no vested right in particular measure of damages werner,supra,cal d at pp.cadlo,supra,th at jenkins,supra,th at pp.quackenbush,supra,th at,in re paris air crash,supra,at pp.the legislature,moreover,could only guess at what reasonable attorney fees might be in prosecuting a case in any given context,not to mention would need to be prescient about inflationary pressures.
we suspect that is why no case cited by the parties has ever suggested the constitutionality of a damages statute depends,in part,on whether it allows for a recovery sufficient to cover reasonable attorney fees.moreover,the only case of which we are aware that has addressed such an argument dismissed it out of hand.quackenbush,supra,th at a t most,plaintiff denial of access argument casts doubt on the wisdom of the measure,not its constitutionality.
we also can not reconcile chan argument with the general rule that there is no due process right to counsel in civil cases.walker state bar cal d,walker people madeyski th,d see also jara municipal court cal d,indigent civil litigants do not have right to language interpreters at public expense and noting cases have refused to require counties to provide indigent civil litigants with counsel or with appellate transcripts iraheta superior court th,d the right to counsel has been recognized to exist only where the litigant may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation county of fresno superior court d.our independent review of the authorities in this and other states has failed to turn up a single case wherein a court has held that an indigent civil litigant is entitled to court appointed counsel at public expense.
chan reliance on boddie connecticut d.boddie,is misplaced.in boddie,the united states supreme court held indigents could not be forced to pay a state court filing fee in order to dissolve their marriage.given the state monopoly on granting divorce through a judicial proceeding,such a proceeding became the only effective means of resolving the dispute at hand and denial of a defendant full access to that process raises grave problems for its legitimacy.id.at.the court went on to emphasize,however,that its conclusion regarding divorce was not a holding that access for all individuals to the courts is a right that is,in all circumstances,guaranteed by due process.id.at pp.rather,a divorce proceeding is uniquely the exclusive precondition to the adjustment of a fundamental human relationship.ibid.
in contrast,in united states kras,d.kras,the supreme court upheld a requirement that those seeking bankruptcy protection,including an indigent debtor,must pay a filing fee which bears a rational basis to having the bankruptcy court system sustained by those who use it.id.at pp.kras alleged interest in the elimination of his debt burden,and in obtaining his desired new start in life,although important and so recognized by the enactment of the bankruptcy act,does not rise to the same constitutional level as the marriage interests in boddie.kras,at.if kras is not discharged in bankruptcy,his position will not be materially altered in any constitutional sense.gaining or not gaining a discharge will effect no change with respect to basic necessities.ibid.not only did the supreme court view kras economic interest in a bankruptcy discharge as not fundamental,it also concluded the government lacked a monopoly over the establishment,enforcement,or dissolution of debts.ibid.in contrast with divorce,bankruptcy is not the only method available to a debtor for the adjustment of his legal relationship with his creditors.the utter exclusiveness of court access and court remedy was a potent factor in boddie.but w ithout a prior judicial imprimatur,individuals may freely enter into and rescind commer
