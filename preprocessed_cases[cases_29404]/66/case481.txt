background 
the vahles sued silverado country club and resort silverado for damages allegedly resulting from a slip and fall by richa vahle on silverado property.barwick represented the vahles.silverado prevailed at trial and the court ordered the vahles to pay over in costs and attorney fees to silverado.
the vahles appealed from the judgment against them in the personal injury lawsuit.while barwick pursued the appeal,the vahles retained another attorney,edward mccutchan,and asked him to attempt to settle the matter with silverado.mccutchan was able to negotiate a settlement in which the vahles agreed to dismiss their appeal and pay to silverado.in return,silverado agreed to file a satisfaction of judgment and release abstracts of judgment it had recorded on property owned by the vahles.
the settlement was recorded in a written settlement agreement and mutual release the release agreement.the only parties to the release agreement were the vahles and silverado.one of the introductory recitals in the release agreement states each party now desires to enter into the agreement as a full compromise,release,settlement,satisfaction and discharge of any and all claims that it has or may have against the other in connection with this litigation.
but section of the release agreement broadly provides for and in consideration of the terms set forth hereinafter,silverado as to vahle,and vahle as to silverado,or their successors,assigns,heirs,executors,administrators,beneficiaries,and any and all persons taking by and through them shall,each as to the other,hereby fully,completely,and forever release and forever discharge each other party,their agents,servants,assigns,employees,successors,principals,and all other persons,firms or corporations,of and from any and all past,present or future claims,demands,obligations,actions,or causes of action regarding or related to this litigation.italics added.

barwick name does not appear in the terms of the release agreement,and a line for her signature approving the document as to content and form is blank.the vahles signed and dated the release agreement on september.
the vahles retained a third attorney and on november,filed their complaint for damages for professional malpractice against barwick.they alleged,inter alia,that barwick failed to give them an opportunity to accept settlement offers in the amounts of and.
barwick answered the complaint and filed a to recover costs she had advanced on behalf of the vahles in the personal injury lawsuit.in her answer,she asserted the release agreement as an affirmative defense.she then moved for summary judgment on the ground that the release agreement discharged and released her from liability in connection with the personal injury lawsuit.she supported her motion with the release agreement,court documents from the personal injury lawsuit,and copies of correspondence between the vahles and mccutchan.
in opposition to the summary judgment motion,the vahles argued that barwick was not a party to the release agreement and that they never intended to release her from liability for malpractice.richa vahle provided a declaration in which she stated that at no time was it her intent to relieve barwick from any future claims for malpractice.
the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment,finding no ambiguity in the phrase forever release and forever discharge each other party,their agents,servants,assigns,employees,successors,principals,and all other persons,firms or corporations,of and from any and all past,present or future claims,demands,obligations,actions,or causes of action regarding or related to this litigation.the court also found the declaration of richa vahle and a declaration from the vahles counsel were not competent evidence to demonstrate ambiguity in the phrase.
the vahles moved for reconsideration of the trial court ruling.they supported their motion with transcript excerpts from a deposition of the judge who presided over the personal injury lawsuit,and declarations from mccutchan and the attorney who represented silverado.the general tenor of the judge testimony was that barwick representation of the vahles fell below the standard of care for a competent attorney.mccutchan and silverado attorney both declared it was not their intent to release barwick from liability when they negotiated the settlement and drafted the release agreement.
the trial court denied the motion for reconsideration,ruling the vahles had not demonstrated new or different facts,circumstances or law.the matter proceeded on barwick.when barwick voluntarily dismissed her complaint without prejudice,the trial court entered a final judgment.
discussion 
we independently review the record to determine whether barwick was entitled to summary judgment.see saelzler advanced group cal th,d.
a moving party is entitled to summary judgment when there is no triable issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.a defendant moving for summary judgment based on an affirmative defense has the initial burden to show that undisputed facts support each element of the affirmative defense.consumer cause,smilecare th,d.the plaintiff need not produce any evidence until the defendant has established every element of his or her defense.id.at,d.
barwick was not a party to the release agreement therefore,she can benefit from the agreement only if she was an intended third party beneficiary of the agreement.the vahles contend that whether barwick was an intended third party beneficiary of the release agreement is a triable issue of fact.
a release agreement containing boilerplate language that purports to excuse everyone in the world from liability can be enforced by persons who are not parties to the agreement.lama comcast cablevision th,d general motors superior court th,d.but as explained in a thorough and opinion from division three of this court,neverkovec fredericks th,d neverkovec,the burden is on the third party to prove the parties to the release agreement intended to benefit the third party.
release agreements are governed by the generally applicable law of contracts.neverkovec,supra,th at,d.a third party right to enforce covenants of a contract is predicated on the contracting parties intent to benefit the third party.ibid.it is not enough that a literal interpretation of the contract would result in a benefit to the third party.ibid.
