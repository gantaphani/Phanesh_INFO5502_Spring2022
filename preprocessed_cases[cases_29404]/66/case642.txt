shakiya sturgis,as next friend of darnaya sturgis,appellant,alleged that,appellee mackie banks along with other assistants negligently delivered and injured darnaya with excess traction pulling on the baby head in january.after a jury trial,the jury found for the defendants.sturgis appeal focuses on two pretrial rulings on two motions in limine by sturgis and by the defendants.in the first motion,sturgis asked the trial judge to bar the defendants expert from testifying that darnaya injury could have occurred under three utero,in the birth canal,and by excess traction.the trial judge ruled that the defense expert could testify that two reasonably certain causes of darnaya injury utero and by excess traction.based on that ruling by the trial judge,sturgis expert then sought to opine that in utero and by excess traction were the only two possible causes of darnaya injury.in the second motion in limine,the defendants moved to bar sturgis expert from testifying that they were the only two possible causes.the defendants argued that other,unknown,causes of darnaya injury were possible.the trial judge ruled that,even though only two reasonably certain causes exist for expert testimony purposes,other less certain and potential causes of darnaya did exist.thus,the trial judge barred sturgis expert from testifying that in utero and excess traction were the only two possible causes of darnaya injury.
sturgis argues on appeal that the trial judge improperly limited her expert testimony about the only two possible causes of darnaya injury.however,sturgis never introduced any scientific evidence that supported her expert opinion that in utero and the use of excess traction were the only two causes.sturgis can not simply rely on the trial judge ruling that limited the defendants expert testimony.in order for her expert to testify that there are only two possible causes of darnaya injury,that expert must have proffered reliable verifiable scientific evidence supporting the claim that in utero and the use of excess traction were the only two possible causes of her injury.in the absence of any evidence supporting that theory,the trial judge properly excluded sturgis expert testimony.therefore,we affirm.
shakiya gave birth to darnaya in january.during delivery,some unexpected complications arose.as banks attempted to deliver darnaya,banks discovered that one of darnaya shoulders lodged against her mother pubic bone,a complication known as shoulder dystocia.this rare complication jeopardized darnaya life.if banks did not deliver darnaya within five to seven minutes,darnaya would be deprived of oxygen for a long enough period of time to damage her vital organs.
although banks needed to act quickly,she still needed to proceed with great care.in order to free darnaya for delivery,banks needed to ensure that she did not apply undue force,known as excess traction,on darnaya head.if the applied excess traction,she might separate the nerves in darnaya shoulder and cause a brachial plexus injury.a brachial plexus injury could potentially limit darnaya use of her arm for the rest of her life.
to reduce excess traction,obstetricians have developed a number of procedures to dislodge the baby from the pubic bone for delivery and to minimize the likelihood of a brachial plexus injury.according to the medical literature,when the discovers shoulder dystocia,she could apply suprapubic pressure,push above the mother pubic bone,in an attempt to dislodge the baby without pulling on her head.the might follow that by performing the mcroberts maneuver,where,with the help of an assistant,the positions the mother legs to maximize the potential opening for the baby to pass through.finally,the could apply the woods corkscrew maneuver to reposition the baby and potentially free her for delivery.these procedures attempt to eliminate excessive traction or pressure on the baby head and limit the possibility of a brachial plexus injury.
after darnaya delivery,her mother,shakiya,discovered that darnaya had suffered a brachial plexus injury.shakiya,as next friend of darnaya,sued the hospital and brown and alleged that brown had negligently breached her duty of care by applying excess traction on darnaya head during delivery.
both plaintiff and defendants sought to introduce expert testimony on the delivery of darnaya and brachial plexus injuries.
the defendants expert,johnson,sought to opine that brachial plexus injuries could occur under three circumstances.johnson,in her deposition,testified that brachial plexus injuries could occur in utero,during the descent through the birth canal,or during delivery.johnson also testified at her deposition that she ruled out any possibility of an in utero brachial plexus injury in this case.darnaya attorney filed a motion in limine to preclude johnson from testifying at trial that brachial plexus injuries could occur during the descent through the birth canal.
the plaintiff expert witness,mollick,sought to testify that only two possible cause of brachial plexus injuries exist,in utero and as a result of excess traction during delivery.further,the plaintiff wanted mollick to testify,based on johnson finding that the injury did not occur in utero,that the brachial plexus injury must have been the result of excess traction applied by banks during delivery.
the trial judge considered the motion and ruled that 
with regard to johnson,who is the defendant expert,i find the theory that the injury might have occurred in the birth canal is indeed a possibility.it not a theory which can be expressed to a reasonable degree of medical probability,at least not at this time,and therefore,that opinion does not comply with daubert.i do,however,think that johnson can testify that there was no excess traction,and she can state the basis for her opinion.
the trial judge also ruled 
my ruling with regard to mollick is that he may testify as to why he believes there has been medical negligence and that must be based on what happened or did not happen,whether there were certain maneuvers that were properly performed or other maneuvers which perhaps should not sic have been performed.i am not going to permit him to opine that it either must be an opinion sic or it must be excess traction.i do think that supported by current literature,and he certainly did support that unequivocally in the literature based upon roseman representation.the current literature is somewhat equivocal on that.and i do think he needs to express that opinion in order for a plaintiff to establish a prima facia case.
at trial,johnson testified that brown performed all of the appropriate maneuvers and opined that even when all of the techniques are applied correctly during delivery i t is that the squeeze can just be too tight for the baby,and there,you know,with all the caution in the world,you ca always avoid that,a brachial plexus injury.
mollick testified that brown did not attempt the correct delivery procedures,that she violated the applicable professional standard of care,and that her negligence caused darnaya brachial plexus injury.on,mollick testified that he believed that a brachial plexus injury could only occur as a result of excess traction.the jury deliberated and returned a verdict for the defendants.
after the jury verdict,sturgis filed a motion for a new trial asserting that the trial judge should have admitted mollick testimony that excess traction was the only possible cause of darnaya injury.the trial judge denied that motion based on her ruling.sturgis appeals the trial judge rulings.
