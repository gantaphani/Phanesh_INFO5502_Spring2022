plaintiffs arleen freeman and james alexander appeal from a judgment entered after the trial court granted defendant alexander schack special motion to strike their complaint under code of civil procedure section plaintiffs sued schack for breach of contract,professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty based on allegations that he had entered into a contract by which he assumed duties toward plaintiffs but abandoned them in order to represent adverse interests in the same and different litigation,thus breaching the contract as well as the fiduciary duties owed them.the trial court granted schack special motion to strike as to all causes of action on grounds plaintiffs causes of action stemmed from petitioning activity and plaintiffs did not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on their causes of action because the doctrine provided a complete defense.
plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in granting the special motion to strike because schack did not meet his burden of proving his constitute violations of state bar rules of professional constitutionally protected plaintiffs satisfied their burden of showing a likelihood of prevailing on the merits and the doctrine does not apply and can not provide schack with a defense.we conclude section does not apply to plaintiffs causes of action and on that basis reverse the judgment with directions that the trial court deny the special motion to strike.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiffs are real estate agents in san diego county who were represented by attorney david barry in filing lawsuits against sandicor and other entities for alleged violations of california antitrust laws and other assertedly unlawful acts.see freeman san diego ass of realtors th,d california ass of realtors barry,may,wl nonpub.opn.sandicor operated a real estate sales multiple listing service in san diego county.freeman,th at,d.in march,plaintiffs succeeded in reversing a summary judgment on appeal in the ninth circuit in a federal district court case,freeman et san diego county board of realtors,et,united states district court,case tw jah hereafter freeman ii on the day the ninth circuit filed its decision,schack telephoned barry and asked if barry could use his help in prosecuting the case.schack described himself as a class action attorney who did antitrust litigation and explained his credentials in detail.barry accepted schack offer,telling schack about the arrangement he had with other attorneys and explaining the division of contingent fees in the event of success.during the course of several conversations that day,barry and schack discussed the overall strategy of plaintiffs case,including matters such as getting plaintiffs certified as class representatives and an early trial on damages.
the next week,barry drafted a fee agreement for the attorneys who would represent plaintiffs in what he referred to as phase of the case the legal proceedings following the ninth circuit decision.those attorneys were barry,schack,attorney richard johnson and occasionally ken frost.barry sent schack a copy of an earlier fee agreement and,over several revisions,barry,johnson and schack negotiated over the language for the phase fee agreement.the versions of that fee agreement confirmed that the phase attorneys had duties to plaintiffs.
in april,barry,johnson and schack signed an attorney association and fee sharing agreement the fee sharing agreement relating to the pending freeman ii litigation.the fee sharing agreement contains provisions addressing the legal relationship between and respective responsibilities of barry and the other phase attorneys.in particular,the fee sharing agreement stated that the phase attorneys were not parties to the existing relationships between barry and plaintiffs,but agree they will take no action which would breach any obligation owed to any client s and acknowledge that,in undertaking the services covered by this agreement,they are subject to all responsibilities and obligations owed by attorneys to their clients under applicable law as to each and every client who is or hereafter becomes a plaintiff in freeman ii,and for whom a signed written agreement is provided by barry,to the extent each respective phase attorney provides services hereunder.
at various times during march,april and may,barry and schack communicated by telephone,and letter about various matters concerning the case,including class certification,damages proof and a proposed damages expert,pending motions and settlement strategies on june,schack emailed barry and johnson concerning his involvement in the cases.he wrote in signing the agreement to split fees,it was intended that all clients would give their written consent before the agreement was effective.before that consent was obtained,i deemed it necessary to withdraw from the agreement based on certain confidential circumstances.i will continue to assist you in any way necessary to benefit my client and the class,and look for a successful resolution of these matters.
barry and schack continued their communications through april.in april,schack and attorney dan mogin,with whom schack frequently worked,filed a motion on behalf of proposed plaintiff alan hemphill to have hemphill intervene as a representative of the proposed class in freeman ii.in part,schack and mogin argued hemphill,a purchaser and of multiple listing services in san diego who was acting independently of the freeman plaintiffs,satisfied typicality and other requirements to represent the class unlike plaintiffs,who were inadequate representatives.
in may,freeman,schack,barry,and mogin participated in a mediation planning session in los angeles.at the mediation,schack and mogin began proposing that freeman ii should be settled for coupons to the class members valued at approximately or less.the settlement would not provide for real estate agents who had dropped out of the industry since.it would provide for a million payment to schack and mogin.freeman and barry expressed their opposition to the idea.after the mediation,barry ceased conveying privileged or confidential information and work product to schack because barry believed schack was representing interests adverse to plaintiffs.
in june,barry attended a judicial settlement conference at which mogin and schack appeared representing hemphill.before they addressed the court,mogin and schack told barry and freeman that an agreement in principle had been worked out by which the defendants would provide class members free use of sandicor services for four consecutive januarys,but members who left real estate without using that opportunity would forfeit those usage rights.the settlement did not provide for members who left the real estate business.mogin and schack stated they expected attorney fees to be about million to be paid in cash.moments later,the magistrate judge presiding over the settlement conference confirmed that an agreement in principle had been reached with the freeman ii defendants.barry and freeman advised the court they were strongly against such a settlement barry described the assets available to the freeman ii defendants with which they could fund a fair settlement.
several days after the settlement conference,barry wrote to schack demanding that he and his client immediately withdraw from freeman ii or barry would move to disqualify them from the lawsuit based on current conflicts of interest in their representation of hemphill,freeman and alexander.barry eventually unsuccessfully brought a disqualification motion.schack and mogin filed a new federal court action on hemphill behalf and obtained preliminary approval of a settlement class that excluded freeman and alexander.freeman and alexander settled and dismissed their action in november.
in january,plaintiffs,on behalf of themselves and a putative class,sued schack,mogin and other entities for breach of contract,professional negligence and breach of fiduciary duty.they alleged schack had assumed duties to plaintiffs in march,executed a written agreement in april reflecting his assumption of such duties and pledging,among other things,to use his best efforts to obtain a full recovery of damages to the class,but breached the agreement by representing hemphill,filing a new lawsuit on hemphill behalf,and concluding the hemphill litigation.
schack moved to strike the complaint under section and joined in mogin own section motion.he argued plaintiffs causes of action were based on written or oral statements or writings made before a judicial proceeding,written or oral statements or writings made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body,or other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition.subds.e,e e.on this prong,schack argued that all of the conduct alleged in the complaint arose out of petitioning activity,it all relates to the two underlying class actions.turning to the second inquiry under section,schack further argued plaintiffs could not demonstrate a probability of prevailing because the claims having as its gravamen constitutionally protected a complete defense and immunity for schack conduct relating to the prosecution of freeman ii and the hemphill litigation,in particular,his decision to accept an offer of settlement.schack also demurred to the complaint.schack filed a joint opposition to the demurrers and section motions to strike 
the court initially sustained the demurrers and deemed the section motions moot.on reconsideration,however,it granted the section motion on grounds plaintiffs causes of action stem from the two underlying federal class actions and thus constituted petitioning activity,and plaintiffs did not demonstrate a probability of prevailing on their causes of action because the doctrine provided a complete defense.plaintiffs filed the present appeal.
discussion 
section appellate standard of review 
s ection,the statute,provides in relevant part a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.citation.under this statute,the party moving to strike a cause of action has the initial burden to show that the cause of action aris es from an act in furtherance of the moving party right of petition or free speech.citations.once that burden is met,the burden shifts to the opposing party to demonstrate the probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.citations.to satisfy this prong,the plaintiff must state and substantiate a legally sufficient claim.citation.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.zamos stroud cal th,d.
we review de novo the court order granting schack section special motion to strike.soukup law offices of herbert hafif cal th,fn,d.we consider the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits upon which the liability or defense is based.citation.however,we neither weigh credibility nor compare the weight of the evidence.rather,we accept as true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff citation and evaluate the defendant evidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of law.ibid.
ii.schack threshold prima facie burden 
speaking to the first prong,the california supreme court explains that t he statutory phrase cause of action arising from means simply that the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citation.t he critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action itself was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.citations.a defendant meets this burden by demonstrating that the act underlying the plaintiff cause fits one of the categories spelled out in section,subdivision e city of cotati cashman cal th,d.it is the principal thrust or gravamen of the plaintiff cause of action that determines whether the statute applies citation,and when the allegations referring to arguably protected activity are only incidental to a cause of action based essentially on nonprotected activity,collateral allusions to protected activity should not subject the cause of action to the statute.martinez metabolife,th,d.
plaintiffs contend that by accepting responsibilities toward freeman and alexander,and also by representing hemphill,schack violated rule c of the state bar rules of professional conduct,providing that an attorney shall not,without the informed written consent of each client a ccept or continue representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the clients actually conflict see flatt superior court cal th,d.plaintiffs argue alternatively that schack actions violated rule e of the rules of professional conduct,which prohibits consecutive representations adverse to a former client they rely upon kajima engineering and,city of los angeles th,d,jespersen th,d jespersen,and benasra mitchell silberberg,knupp llp th,d benasra to argue that schack actions in representing hemphill in litigation were not constitutionally protected because one of their core claims is that schack represented conflicting interests in the same cases and doing so,went beyond mere petitioning activity by sharing confidential information,advising hemphill and representing him.
the allegations of plaintiffs complaint assist us in determining whether the principal thrust or gravamen of the causes of action is protected petitioning activity.in their background allegations,plaintiffs allege that after signing the fee sharing agreement,schack assisted barry in defending against requests for rehearing,a petition for certiorari,and efforts to obtain summary judgment in freeman ii after the ninth circuit remanded the case.they allege that over the course of a year,barry had communicated their confidential and privileged information to schack,divulging confidential client information and work product on various matters including a draft complaint against other defendants,an effort to file a motion to stay the ninth circuit mandate,a fee application in the ninth circuit,settlement strategy and future handling of the case,proposed damages proof,and the plaintiffs proposed damages experts.they allege that u nbeknownst to plaintiffs,mogin schack recruited an individual,alan hemphill,to act as a class representative who had no interest in obtaining any real benefits for the class.defendants initially announced their representation of hemphill but gave no indication that hemphill and defendants interests were adverse to plaintiffs interests.plaintiffs discovered the adversity of hemphill in approximately may of,when defendants espoused,on hemphill behalf,a settlement plan that was wholly adverse to the settlement plan that plaintiffs had long advocated.plaintiffs allege they had never consented in writing to schack representation of adverse interests.
plaintiffs further allege that in july,schack secretly filed a class action suit in the same federal court on hemphill behalf,about which plaintiffs did not learn until later,and also secretly settled the hemphill case,and secretly obtained preliminary court approval of class certification of hemphill as class representative.plaintiffs continue,defendants breached their agreement by which they agreed to act as attorneys to aid plaintiffs in obtaining cash and sandicor sic for the benefit of the class.plaintiffs never authorized defendants to conclude the hemphill settlement.plaintiffs set out allegations explaining how schack representation of hemphill was adverse plaintiffs wanted a substantial recovery and yet schack settled the hemphill case for only about percent of the recovery plaintiffs sought schack actively campaigned for hemphill,rather than plaintiffs,as a class representative defendants settlement contained no protection agai
