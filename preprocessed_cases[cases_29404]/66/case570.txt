this is an interlocutory appeal in a lawsuit against wichita falls state hospital for violations of the patient bill of rights,which is codified at chapter of the texas health and safety code.we must determine whether the legislature intended to waive the state sovereign immunity by enacting section of the code.we conclude that it did not.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and dismiss taylor claims for want of jurisdiction.
background 
terry lynn taylor was involuntarily committed to wichita falls state hospital for severe mental illness.taylor was discharged four days later,after being treated by peter fadow,a psychiatrist at the hospital.taylor returned home and committed suicide that same day.taylor wife,deborah taylor,sued the hospital and fadow under texas health and safety code section,asserting claims for wrongful death and survival.civ.prac.she alleged that taylor death was proximately caused by the negligence of the doctor and hospital in failing to properly diagnose and treat his mental illness,and that the defendants acts and omissions violated the patient bill of rights.see.admin.code.
the hospital moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity in her response,deborah taylor argued that the legislature unambiguously waived the hospital immunity by enacting texas health and safety code section,which provides that a person who has been harmed by a violation of the patient bill of rights may sue for damages.the trial court denied the hospital jurisdictional plea and the hospital appealed.a divided court of appeals affirmed,holding that the legislature clearly and unambiguously waived immunity from suit against state mental health facilities for violations of the patient bill of rights.we granted the hospital petition for review to consider this issue of first impression 
discussiona.sovereign immunity 
in,this court held that no state can be sued in her own courts without her consent,and then only in the manner indicated by that consent.hosner de young.the court did not cite the origin of that declaration,but it appears to be rooted in an early understanding of sovereignty 
it is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.this is the general sense and the general practice of mankind and the exemption,as one of the attributes of sovereignty,is now enjoyed by the government of every state in the union.
the federalist,at alexander hamilton clinton rossiter,dismissing fears that adopting the new constitution would abrogate states sovereign immunity.although sometimes associated in the united states with the feudal fiction that the king can do no wrong,sovereign immunity is an established principle of jurisprudence in all civilized nations.beers arkansas,how.
most sovereigns have long since abandoned the fiction that governments and their officials can do no wrong.to varying degrees,states and the federal government have voluntarily relinquished the privilege of absolute immunity by waiving immunity in certain contexts.see,b.civ.prac.invariably,however,they have retained a significant measure of immunity to protect the public treasury.see fed.sign,enoch,dissenting elizabeth hocking,federal facility violations of the resource conservation and recovery act and the questionable role of sovereign immunity,admin,louis jaffe,suits against governments and officers sovereign immunity,harv,glen majure et,the governmental immunity doctrine in analysis and some proposed changes,sw.
waiver of immunity 
because consent is pivotal to a waiver of sovereign immunity,it is important to consider the manner in which a sovereign conveys its consent to be sued.under our form of government,the state derives its authority from the people.const.art.i,stating that a ll political power is inherent in the people,and all free governments are founded on their authority,and instituted for their benefit see also alden maine,d noting that the federal constitution began with the principle that sovereignty rests with the people.in texas,the people will is expressed in the constitution and laws of the state.see cramer sheppard.boll weevil eradication,lewellen.consequently,to waive immunity,consent to suit must ordinarily be found in a constitutional provision or legislative enactment.
courts in other jurisdictions have occasionally abrogated sovereign immunity by judicial decree we have held,however,that the legislature is better suited to balance the conflicting policy issues associated with waiving immunity.see.natural res.conservation comm,guillory port of houston,duhart state,lowe.tech.but see.dep t of criminal justice miller,hecht,concurring noting that judicial abolition of immunity may be necessary to prompt legislature to enact reasoned system for determining government responsibility for its torts.although we have not absolutely foreclosed the possibility that the judiciary may abrogate immunity by modifying the common law,we have no occasion to consider that possibility today.
when considering immunity in texas,we address not only whether the state has consented to suit,but also whether the state has accepted liability.fed.sign,at.immunity from suit prohibits suits against the state unless the state expressly consents to the suit.id.thus,even if the state acknowledges liability on a claim,immunity from suit bars a remedy until the legislature consents to suit.id.immunity from liability protects the state from judgments even after the state has consented to suit.id.accordingly,even if the legislature has authorized a claimant to sue,the state immunity is retained until it acknowledges liability.id.unlike immunity from suit,immunity from liability does not affect a court jurisdiction to hear a case and can not be raised in a plea to the jurisdiction.see.dep t of transp.jones.
it is settled in texas that for the legislature to waive the state sovereign immunity,a statute or resolution must contain a clear and unambiguous expression of the legislature waiver of immunity.fed.sign,at of.med.branch at galveston york,duhart,at.in,the legislature ratified this approach by adding section to the code construction act.that section provides in order to preserve the legislature interest in managing state fiscal matters through the appropriations process,a statute shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign immunity unless the waiver is effected by clear and unambiguous language.gov t code.
some statutes leave no doubt about the legislature intent to waive immunity.when the legislature pronounces,for example,that s overeign immunity to liability is waived and abolished to the extent of liability created by this chapter,we have had little difficulty recognizing a waiver of immunity from liability but this case presents no such explicit language waiving immunity from liability.and because the state can not properly assert immunity from liability in a plea to the jurisdiction,we have no occasion to decide the extent to which immunity from liability is implicated here.jones,at.
similarly,we have little difficulty recognizing the legislature intent to waive immunity from suit when a statute provides that a state entity may be sued or that sovereign immunity to suit is waived.this case,however,does not contain the sort of language the legislature generally uses to confirm its intent to waive immunity from suit.accordingly,we examine factors we have employed to determine whether a statute that is less explicit may nevertheless waive the state immunity from suit.
we have on rare occasions found waiver of sovereign immunity absent magic words,such as the state sovereign immunity to suit and liability is waived.although it is more difficult to discern legislative consent under those circumstances,we have employed several aids to help guide our analysis in determining whether the legislature has clearly and unambiguously waived sovereign immunity.first,a statute that waives the state immunity must do so beyond doubt,even though we do not insist that the statute be a model of perfect clarity.city of laporte barfield.for example,we have found waiver when the provision in question would be meaningless unless immunity were waived.kerrville state hosp.fernandez,holding that the statute had no meaning absent waiver of sovereign immunity.
second,when construing a statute that purportedly waives sovereign immunity,we generally resolve ambiguities by retaining immunity.see,travis county pelzel,at guillory,at duhart,at see also magnolia petroleum walker,ambiguities in the terms of a legislative grant of a right or a privilege must be construed in favor of the state.in this respect,our methodology resembles that of the united states supreme court when it considers a purported waiver of the federal government sovereign immunity.see united states williams,d when confronted with purported waiver of federal government sovereign immunity,court will constru e ambiguities in favor of immunity.if the text and history of the statute leave room to doubt whether the legislature intended to waive sovereign immunity,we are less likely to find a waiver.
third,if the legislature requires that the state be joined in a lawsuit for which immunity would otherwise attach,the legislature has intentionally waived the state sovereign immunity.educ.agency leeper,holding that,by authorizing declaratory judgment actions to construe the legislative enactments of governmental entities and authorizing awards of attorneys fees,the declaratory judgments act necessarily waives governmental immunity for such awards.
finally,we are cognizant that,when waiving immunity by explicit language,the legislature often enacts simultaneous measures to insulate public resources from the reach of judgment creditors.see.civ.prac.gov t code.therefore,when deciding whether the legislature intended to waive sovereign immunity and permit monetary damages against the state,one factor to consider is whether the statute also provides an objective limitation on the state potential liability.see,at noting that s ubjecting the government to liability may hamper governmental functions by shifting tax resources away from their intended purposes toward defending lawsuits and paying judgments fed.sign,at hecht,concurring noting that even if the court were to abolish governmental immunity from contract suits,successful plaintiffs still could not be paid without legislative appropriation see also barfield,at stating that the rules for waiver of sovereign immunity apply to both the existence and extent of the waiver.
with these principles in mind,we will examine the statute to determine whether the legislature waived immunity by adopting section of the patient bill of rights.
c.the patient bill of rights 
in,texas enacted a patient bill of rights.health safety code.section requires that the texas department of mental health and mental retardation and the texas commission on alcohol and drug abuse protect the health,safety,and rights of a patient receiving voluntary or involuntary mental health,chemical dependency,or comprehensive medical rehabilitation services in an inpatient facility.id.section permits a person harmed by a mental health facility violation of the patient bill of rights to sue for injunctive relief,damages,or both.id.b.a plaintiff who prevails under section may recover actual damages,exemplary damages,and attorney fees.id.c,d 
taylor contends that the legislature expressly waived the hospital sovereign immunity by providing that a patient may sue a mental health facility for damages and other relief caused by those violations.section provides in part 
a a treatment facility or mental health facility that violates a provision of,or a rule adopted under,this chapter is liable to a person receiving care or treatment in or from the facility who is harmed as a result of the violation.
b a person who has been harmed by a violation may sue for injunctive relief,damages,or both.
id.a,b emphasis added.nowhere does this section expressly authorize suit against the state of texas.therefore,we must examine whether the statute waives the state immunity by necessary implication.
taylor argues that immunity is waived because the term mental health facility includes the texas department of mental health and mental retardation.taylor acknowledges that the term mental health facility is not expressly defined in the statute.she observes,however,that section definitional section of chapter that mental health facility has the meaning assigned by section.see id.accordingly,we turn to section to determine if it contains an unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity.
section,enacted as part of the texas mental health code two years before chapter enactment,refers expressly to governmental agencies or facilities.specifically,section defines mental health facility as 
a an inpatient or outpatient mental health facility operated by the department,a federal agency,a political subdivision,or any person 
b a community center or a facility operated by a community center or 
c that identifiable part of a general hospital in which diagnosis,treatment,and care for persons with mental illness is provided.
id.a c emphasis added.department is defined as the texas department of mental health and mental retardation.id.taylor argues that,by incorporating the prior definition of mental health facility into the provision of section,the legislature clearly and unambiguously meant to waive the state immunity from suit.
while the definition of mental health facility includes facilities,it does not contain the sort of explicit language the legislature generally uses to confirm its intent to waive sovereign immunity thus,we must determine whether this incorporated definition is the functional equivalent of an explicit legislative directive waiving the state immunity.
lower courts have split on whether section definition,read in conjunction with section b,is a clear and unambiguous statement of the legislature intent to waive sovereign immunity in refusing to find a waiver of sovereign immunity,one court of appeals noted that,although the statute authorizes actions against private facilities licensed by state health care regulatory agencies,it does not clearly express an intent to waive immunity by authorizing actions against governmental entities.dep t of mental health mental retardation lee,worth,pet.filed.the court applied our decisions in city of laporte barfield and duhart state to hold that mere incorporation of section definition of mental health facility,which includes public facilities,into the patient bill of rights does not by itself manifest a clear legislative intent to waive immunity.lee,at accord barfield,at duhart,at.
the court of appeals here,however,followed another court of appeals,which held that b ecause the care facilities are mental health facilities as defined in section,the legislature has consented in section b to their being sued for alleged violations of section a.at quoting cent.counties ctr.for mental health mental retardation servs.rodriguez,pet.filed.the court of appeals reasoned that the statutory scheme at issue in barfield was not comparable to chapter because it dealt with incorporation of subsequently enacted legislation,while chapter incorporation of mental health facility occurred simultaneously with passage of that statute.rodriguez,at.concluding that barfield did not control,the court of appeals held that the legislature waived sovereign immunity and that any other interpretation would render the statute language meaningless.id.at.
the interpretation adopted by the court of appeals in this case,however,overlooks the fact that section creates a meaningful cause of action against private mental health care facilities,a claim that remains viable even if suit against the government is barred.as noted above,the fact that the act remains viable despite the retention of immunity is one indication that the legislature did not intend to waive immunity by implication.none of the authorities cited by the court of appeals persuades us otherwise.
in barfield,we found a clear and unambiguous waiver of immunity for claims of wrongful discharge against municipalities because the statute had no purpose if immunity had not been waived.at.unlike the statute in barfield,the patient bill of rig
