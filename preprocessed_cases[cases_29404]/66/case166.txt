the plaintiff,a bariatric surgeon who lives and practices in new jersey,brought this diversity suit in the federal district court in chicago.he claims to have been defamed by the defendant,another bariatric surgeon,who practices in new york.the district judge dismissed the suit without prejudice,on the ground that venue in chicago was improper,and the plaintiff appeals.the defendant,claiming that the dismissal of the suit should have been with prejudice because the suit is.the is the plaintiff challenge to it and his request for sanctions for the filing of the is frivolous and itself it seeks relief beyond what the defendant obtained from the district court.greenlaw united states,d stone container hartford steam boiler inspection ins,cir abbs sullivan,cir.
the plaintiff had testified against the defendant in a malpractice suit in new york,and the defendant had to the plaintiff mailing a defamatory letter on or about march,to the american college of surgeons,which is located in chicago.the defendant had on that day mailed what the plaintiff believes to be an identical or nearly identical letter of complaint about the plaintiff testimony to the american society of bariatric surgeons now the american society for metabolic and bariatric surgery,in florida.that letter is in the record,but the letter to the american college of surgeons if there is such a letter is not,and the plaintiff has seen neither the original nor a copy.on april,however,he received a letter from an official of the american college of surgeons,notifying him that the college had received a complaint about his testimony as an expert witness in the new york malpractice suit against the defendant.but the letter did not identify the complainant.
the college disciplinary committee assigned three bariatric surgeons to investigate the complaint.in october the college sent the plaintiff a letter charging him with unprofessional conduct.but in march of the following year,after he had informed the college that the defendant had been sued for malpractice times,the college wrote the plaintiff that its disciplinary committee had voted to take no further action with regard to this matter.
the plaintiff claims not to have known that the defendant was the source of complaints against him until june,when at a convention in california a bariatric surgeon told him about the florida letter.after that he put two and two together and concluded that the defendant must have been the author of the complaint to the college.his previous ignorance of the putative source of the complaint is a little hard to credit,since the college had told him that the complaint concerned his conduct in the malpractice suit against the defendant.but we assume it has to be,or his goose is cooked,because he did file this suit until june.that was more than a year after the alleged defamation by the two letters but just under a year after the conversation in california and the illinois statute of limitations,which the plaintiff contends is applicable to his suit the defendant disagrees,and their disagreement is the principal issue in the appeals,requires that a suit for defamation be brought within a year of the publication of the defamatory statement,ilcs davis cook county,cir unless the plaintiff could not have discovered the defamation within that period.tom olesker exciting world of fashion,dun bradstreet,goodman harbor market,d,schweihs burdick,cir illinois law.
we begin our analysis with the issue of the missing letter to the american college of surgeons.to proceed in a libel suit without the statement that is alleged to be defamatory is unconventional,though there are a few such cases.trail boys girls clubs of northwest indiana,for example,was a libel suit by a disgruntled former employee against his supervisors complaining about a biased report that cast him in a negative light.he had not seen the report,and the court ordered the suit dismissed,explaining that without the statement the court can not actually determine if the statement is legally defamatory.we have found a case in which such a suit was successful,but we do think there is or should be an absolute rule that without the corpus delicti,as it were,a libel suit must fail.the allegedly libelous document might have disappeared through no fault of the plaintiff and there might be evidence of its existence and contents,such as testimony by persons who had read as key evidence in a slander case,because slander is oral,is the testimony of persons who heard it.robison lescrenier,cir simon shearson lehman brothers,cir gasbarra,israel travel advisory service israel identity tours,wl,affirmed,cir.
the plaintiff contends that he asked the college for the letter and the college would give it to,would neither admit nor deny the existence of such a letter.he had joined the college as a defendant and in its motion to dismiss which was granted the college argued that if there was such a letter it was privileged by the illinois medical studies act,ilcs all information,interviews,reports,statements,memoranda,recommendations,letters of reference or other third party confidential assessments of a health care practitioner professional competence,or other data of the illinois state medical society,or allied medical societies used in the course of internal quality control for improving patient care shall be privileged and strictly confidential jenkins wu,austin american association of neurological surgeons,cir illinois law by the status of the college as a body,illinois college of optometry labombarda,and by the common law privilege for a communication that the defendant had a duty to make and did not disseminate any further than necessary.kuwik starmark star marketing administration,in re himmel,smock nolan,cir illinois law edwards podany,cir same jones western southern life ins,cir same.a professional,including a doctor see american medical association,code of medical ethics,opinion reporting impaired,incompetent,or unethical colleagues,june,www.ama org ama pub physician resources medical ethics.shtml visited,has a duty to notify the proper public or private authorities of unprofessional conduct,which he observes,by a fellow professional.
the plaintiff made no effort to obtain the supposed letter to the american college of surgeons by compulsory process and seems to have had no plans to do so.as we see,he apparently did not realize that he could obtain it,however unwilling the college was to divulge it,by subpoena under rule of the civil rules unless the college prevailed on one of its claims of privilege.
in light of the plaintiff failure to obtain the letter,the claim based on it is probably going nowhere even if the letter exists and is not privileged.indeed the claim may have been dismissed on the merits,rather than for improper venue.the district judge termed the plaintiff assertion that he could not identify the alleged defamatory statement made by the defendant because this information is solely in the college possession meritless,given his discovery rights.later the judge described the plaintiff complaint as insufficient to the extent kamelgard claims macura made unidentified defamatory statements to american college of surgeons and therefore there presently appears to be no venue in this court for kamelgard claims against macura.unless kamelgard remedies this situation within days,his entire complaint shall be dismissed without prejudice for lack of venue.presumably the judge thought that if the plaintiff could obtain the letter on which he based his claim against the college of surgeons,the claim had no merit and therefore illinois where the college headquarters are located had no connection to the suit a new jersey resident would be suing in illinois a new york resident over a letter mailed to florida from new york certainly not from illinois.
