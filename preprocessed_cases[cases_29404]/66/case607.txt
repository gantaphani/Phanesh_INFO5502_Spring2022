in this medical malpractice case,plaintiff betty kunz appeals the judgment on the jury verdict in her favor of arguing that the circuit court erred by failing to admit her expert testimony regarding damages and failing to give the jury her proffered jury instructions regarding damages defendant little company of mary hospital and health care centers lcmh,arguing that the circuit erred by failing to grant its motion for judgment and that it is entitled to a new trial.these appeals have been consolidated.we affirm in part,reverse in part and remand for further proceedings regarding past and future medical expenses only.
on june,plaintiff,age at the time,was admitted to lcmh for possible further right knee surgery and evaluation of an infection.plaintiff infection had developed following total right knee replacement surgery two weeks before.plaintiff had developed a staff aureus mrsa infection a type of staph infection that is resistant to most antibiotics in her right knee.an infectious disease specialist,david beezhold,initially prescribed three antibiotics to treat plaintiff vancomycin,rifampin,and gentamicin.the gentamicin was to be a treatment because of the drug potentially harmful effects on the kidneys.beezhold ordered a creatinine test which showed that plaintiff kidneys were functioning within normal limits.beezhold plan for gentamicin was to be discontinued prior to plaintiff discharge from lcmh.his orders read,okay for discharge on iv.orally rifampin from infectious disease standpoint.
plaintiff was discharged on june,at about to manor care nursing home accompanied by a lcmh patient transfer form,a history,a physical exam report,and some lab reports of plaintiff.contrary to beezhold plan,the transfer form listed gentamicin milligrams,iv piggyback every hours,next dose,today.the transfer form also identified beezhold as plaintiff infectious disease physician,included his phone number,and in accordance with russell petrak telephone discharge order,requested that manor care call beezhold on june to set up an appointment.
lcmh nurse halina ciezkowski testified that she drafted the portion of plaintiff transfer form that listed the various medications including the gentamicin.she spoke with petrak on the telephone on june,to obtain discharge orders for plaintiff.doctor petrak was beezhold infectious disease partner and was contacted because beezhold was on vacation.although nurse ciezkowski could not remember the particular conversation with petrak,she testified that the custom and practice would have been for petrak to ask her for the information contained in the patient chart.she would convey the information contained in the chart to petrak.she then would have written the order exactly as petrak gave it to her and would have read it back to him for verification.nurse ciezkowski knew that manor care would have been guided by the transfer form.
cheryl vajdik,plaintiff nursing expert,and nurse noreen buchthal,manor care director of nursing,testified that they would expect a reasonably nurse to know that gentamicin is a nephrotoxic drug,that is,it can be damaging to the kidneys.nurse vajdik testified that nurse ciezkowski deviated from the standard of care by listing gentamicin on plaintiff patient transfer form because beezhold plan did not call for it.she further stated that if nurse ciezkowski told petrak that beezhold plan called for plaintiff to be placed on gentamicin,that was also a deviation from the standard of care.nurse buchthal testified that the transfer form provides a continuity of care between the hospital and the nursing home.she has never seen a medication listed on a transfer form that had previously been discontinued at the hospital before transfer.
manor care nursing home nurse donna van gampler testified that she relied on the medications listed on the transfer form to prepare her own physician order form for medications to be given to plaintiff.based on the transfer form,she believed plaintiff was to receive gentamicin without any discontinuation.
russell petrak testified that,contrary to beezhold plan,the transfer order stated that plaintiff was to be discharged to manor care on iv vancomycin and gentamicin.petrak testified that he could not specifically recall the conversation he had with nurse ciezkowski on the telephone on june,regarding plaintiff but that it was his custom and practice to have the nurse convey to him over the telephone the plan put into the chart by his partner.he relied on nurses to provide him with accurate information from the chart.petrak wanted to follow beezhold plan because beezhold was familiar with plaintiff course of treatment and condition.however,the discharge order calling for continued treatment with gentamicin did not match beezhold plan,which called for a discontinuation of gentamicin.petrak testified that he would only have ordered gentamicin for plaintiff if he had been told over the phone that gentamicin was a part of beezhold plan.he stated that he must have been misinformed.
petrak testified that manor care nursing home was dependent on getting accurate information from lcmh as to what care plaintiff should get after she was transferred.based on the way transfer forms are used,petrak testified that he would expect the manor care staff to continue to give plaintiff gentamicin based on the transfer form prepared by nurse ciezkowski.
tang,the attending physician at manor care nursing home,testified that he received his first call regarding plaintiff on the night she was transferred on june,at about tang testified that the transfer form purpose is to give the doctor in the nursing home a guidance how to continue treating the patients but it does not,itself,authorize treatment.the transfer form provided the only information on how to treat plaintiff.tang testified that it was up to him to determine whether the medications listed on the transfer form were reasonable and should be continued while the patient was at manor care.because the medications listed on plaintiff transfer form were initially prescribed at the hospital she was transferred from and appeared reasonable,he prescribed the same medication to her,including gentamicin,on june.tang interpreted the transfer form as calling for continued treatment with gentamicin and he relied on the transfer form and prescribed iv gentamicin to plaintiff when she arrived.plaintiff continued to receive gentamicin until the afternoon of june.tang did not order blood tests to check plaintiff kidneys for two days,did not see plaintiff for three days,and did not contact beezhold or petrak for three days.manor care nursing home did not typically order daily blood tests to check kidney function unless the patient had some known prior history of kidney problems.
tang testified that on the morning of june,he was told that plaintiff was having trouble urinating.tang examined plaintiff but did not stop the gentamicin because he was concerned about plaintiff infection he ordered a creatinine test.plaintiff continued to receive gentamicin that day and the next day even though plaintiff continued to have trouble urinating and her bladder was distended.on june,plaintiff creatinine test came back abnormally high.tang gave an order for another creatinine test but did not stop the gentamicin.the following day showed an even higher creatinine level and tang then ordered the gentamicin stopped.that day,june,tang diagnosed plaintiff with acute renal failure a sudden decrease in kidney function.although plaintiff reported having trouble urinating,tang did not stop the gentamicin earlier because he was concerned about plaintiff mrsa infection,the diagnosis contained on the transfer form,and the possibility that the mrsa infection may cause plaintiff to lose a limb or her life.he relied on the fact that,according to the transfer form,plaintiff had been prescribed gentamicin and had been discharged from lcmh while still being administered gentamicin.tang believed that lcmh transferred a stable patient to his care and that a plan had been put in place which included gentamicin.
plaintiff kidney expert,vincent peteras,testified that as a result of this prolonged treatment of gentamicin,plaintiff suffered permanent kidney failure and would require dialysis for the rest of her life.
keith armitage,an expert in internal medicine and infectious diseases,testified that if nurse ciezkowski failed to accurately communicate beezhold plan to petrak,she fell below the standard of care for communications.armitage corroborated peteras opinion,testifying that plaintiff suffered from permanent kidney failure and would require dialysis for the rest of her life.he further testified that each dose of gentamicin had cumulative effects and that each dose harmed plaintiff,stating each dose in a case like this causes renal failure.then as you continue to give the drug,you get higher and higher levels in your system and that makes the renal failure worse.
plaintiff mrsa infection resolved favorably and she returned to living at home,but she now has permanent kidney damage and requires dialysis three times a week for the remainder of her life.
the only defendant found liable was lcmh based on nurse ciezkowski negligently informing petrak that the antibiotic plan of beezhold included gentamicin and then included gentamicin on the medication portion of the patient transfer form that accompanied plaintiff from lcmh to manor care.the jury did not find tang negligent.the jury awarded plaintiff.
in its,lcmh argues that the trial court erred by denying its motion for judgment because plaintiff failed to prove that nurse ciezkowski was the proximate cause of plaintiff injuries.
v erdicts ought to be directed and judgments entered only in those cases in which all of the evidence,when viewed in its aspect most favorable to the opponent,so overwhelmingly favors a movant that no contrary verdict based on that evidence could ever stand.pedrick peoria eastern.in other words,directed verdicts or a judgment should not be granted if reasonable minds might differ as to inferences or conclusions to be drawn from the facts presented.york.luke medical center,quoting pasquale speed products engineering.in making this determination,a reviewing court must not substitute its judgment for the jury,and may not reweigh the evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses.moller lipov,d.as in other negligence cases,the question of whether a healthcare worker conduct was a proximate cause of the plaintiff injury is a question of fact for the jury.mansmith hameeduddin,d.our review of this issue is de novo.mansmith,d at.
to establish proximate cause,a plaintiff must prove both cause in fact and legal cause.young bryco arms.cause in fact exists where there is reasonable certainty that a defendant acts caused the injury or damage.citation.legal cause,by contrast,is essentially a question of foreseeability.citation.proximate cause is not established,however,where the causal connection is contingent,speculative,or merely possible.citations.mengelson ingalls health ventures,d.
lcmh contends that plaintiff failed to prove that nurse ciezkowski misreading of beezhold plan to petrak was the cause in fact of plaintiff injury.lcmh argues that this was never established with reasonable certainty.
defendant fails to recognize that reasonable certainty need not be shown by direct evidence rather,it may be established by inference from circumstantial evidence.mann producer chemical,d.the circumstantial evidence does not need to exclude all other possible inferences or support only one logical conclusion rather,liability may be established when the facts and circumstances,in the light of ordinary experience,reasonably suggest that the defendant negligence produced the injury.mann,d at.
in this case,it was undisputed that beezhold,plaintiff infectious disease specialist,did not want plaintiff to receive gentamicin after discharge.however,gentamicin was included on plaintiff transfer form prepared by nurse ciezkowski.although she prepared it after a conversation and at the direction of petrak,petrak testified that as a matter of custom and practice he gave orders after a nurse read beezhold previous orders.if he ordered gentamicin,it was because he had been misinformed.nurse ciezkowski testimony did not contradict petrak testimony.she testified that as a matter of custom and practice,she would read the patient information to petrak over the phone and then write down his orders.here,given this circumstantial evidence,a reasonable juror could have found with reasonable certainty that,but for nurse ciezkowski misinforming petrak,plaintiff would not have been prescribed gentamicin while at manor care and would not have suffered kidney damage as a result.
lcmh cites mann producer chemical,d,and gyllin college craft enterprises,d,to support its position.however,these cases are factually distinguishable from the case at bar.in mann,the defendant argued that the plaintiff crossed the street only after a truck driver waived him across.however,there was no evidence supporting that theory.in contrast to mann,in this case,there is ample evidence to support the theory that nurse ciezkowski incorrectly read beezhold previous order to petrak or incorrectly transcribed petrak subsequent order.unlike mann,plaintiff in this case produced evidence which,if believed by a reasonable jury,proved that an incorrect entry in plaintiff patient transfer form caused plaintiff injury.nurse ciezkowski admitted as a matter of custom and practice to writing this entry and petrak testified that he would not have ordered gentamicin in the absence of nurse ciezkowski telling him that beezhold most recent plan called for the drug.further,the jury found tang not liable for plaintiff injury.therefore,mann is not controlling here.
similarly,in gyllin,the plaintiff produced no evidence to support her theory of causation and no facts were in dispute.in this case,plaintiff presented ample evidence for the jury to find that nurse ciezkowski was the cause in fact of plaintiff injuries.
lcmh also contends that plaintiff failed to prove that it was the legal cause of her injuries because plaintiff proved only that nurse ciezkowski furnished merely a condition for the injury which was caused by the subsequent,independent act of a third.tang.lcmh notes that plaintiff own expert witness testified that tang caused plaintiff injuries by failing to monitor plaintiff kidney function,failing to contact beezhold or petrak,and failing to stop the gentamicin at the first sign of urinary problems.
we are reminded that a defendant may be held liable if the defendant conduct contributed in whole or in part to the injury.elliott williams,d.in this case,there is ample evidence that nurse ciezkowski negligence was a legal cause of plaintiff kidney damage and that tang conduct was foreseeable under the circumstances.the proper inquiry regarding legal cause involves an assessment of foreseeability,in which we ask whether the injury is of a type that a reasonable person would see as a likely result of his conduct.young.at.regarding a acts,the subsequent act of a does not break the causal connection between a defendant negligence and a plaintiff injury if the subsequent act was probable and foreseeable.roeseke pryor,d.to avoid liability,a defendant must show that the act was unforeseeable as a matter of law.roeseke,d at.
lcmh ignores the fact that there was contradicting testimony from tang expert,who testified that none of these failures caused plaintiff injuries.apparently the jury,who was charged with weighing the evidence and resolving any conflicts in testimony,found that tang was free from negligence and was free to believe tang expert witness.the same jury determined that nurse ciezkowski was the sole cause of plaintiff injury.in making this determination,we must not substitute our judgment for the jury,and may not reweigh the evidence or determine the credibility of witnesses.moller,d at.
further,the testimony established that a transfer form that accompanies a patient to a nursing home is a guide for continuing treatment.petrak testified that he would expect the doctors at the nursing home to continue administering gentamicin based on the transfer form that accompanied plaintiff.
