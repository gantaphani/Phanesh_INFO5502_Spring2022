plaintiff dennis powell powell sued defendants alan kleinman,roy levin,and clovis urgent care medical center for medical malpractice arising from injuries he sustained when defendants failed to promptly diagnose and treat an injury to his spinal cord.kleinman brought a motion for summary judgment supported by his and another expert declarations that he met the applicable standard of care and did not cause powell injuries.the trial court granted the motion after sustaining kleinman evidentiary objections to the expert declaration powell submitted in opposition to the motion.
on appeal,powell asserts his expert witness declaration opposing summary judgment was improperly excluded from evidence and the declaration establishes triable issues of material fact on whether kleinman breached the standard of care and causation.as we shall explain,we agree and will reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
on september,kleinman,a general practice physician who independently contracted with the clovis urgent care medical center center as a general practitioner,was the physician on duty when powell came to the center.powell patient registration form lists his reason for the visit as pain in back,chest and stomach.kleinman performed a physical examination and found no evidence of radiation,referred pain,spinal cord compression or radiculopathy.he noted that powell sensation and strength were intact and straight leg raising testing was normal.of powell chest and left ribs were taken,which showed no evidence of fracture or abnormality other than an incidental anomaly on one rib.kleinman diagnosed powell with posterior rib pain due to a probable old back strain,and prescribed pain medication and a muscle relaxant.kleinman advised powell to return in one week to be rechecked,and powell was given a appointment for september.
on september,powell returned to the center and was seen by roy levin,with no change in diagnosis.levin ordered an intramuscular injection,home rest,physical therapy and a mri scan of the thoracic spine,and advised powell to return to the center on september for his scheduled appointment with kleinman.
on sunday,september,powell returned to the center and was seen by kleinman.based on powell new and different complaints,kleinman suspected he had a possible spinal cord compression.in order to rule out spinal cord compression,kleinman arranged for powell to be transferred to a hospital emergency room that had a neurosurgeon on duty on a sunday for purposes of evaluation,management and.kleinman telephoned clovis community hospital and was told there was no neurosurgeon available or on duty that day,but a neurosurgeon was on call at fresno community hospital fch.kleinman telephoned fch and spoke with a triage nurse,to whom he described powell condition and said he was transferring powell to fch specifically to rule out spinal cord compression.kleinman also filled out a written transfer form to the fch emergency department,to the triage nurse attention,which stated the transfer was to rule out spinal cord compression and powell was being referred for evaluation,management and.after making the referral,kleinman did not receive a report or information from anyone at fch indicating powell was experiencing either spinal cord compression or anything other than a back sprain.accordingly,kleinman assumed staff at fch had ruled out spinal cord compression on september,in accordance with his written transfer form.
kleinman next saw powell at the center on october,at.the mri levin had ordered had been performed on september.according to kleinman,while he was aware the mri had been performed,the mri report was not available to him and he did not have any information regarding the results that day.powell still was experiencing back pain and other symptoms.kleinman advised powell to take his prescribed medications and return to the center in one week for a recheck.while the radiologist had interpreted the mri on september,the report was not transcribed until september and signed by the radiologist on october at.the report did not arrive at the center until about on october,as shown by the fax date stamp,which was after the center closed at 
kleinman did not work at the center again until october,as he was not scheduled to work until then.other physicians,however,were on duty or on call at the center between october and october.on october,powell came to the center at for of the mri results,at which time kleinman first became aware of the mri report,which reflected a mass or herniated nucleas pulposis at.kleinman immediately referred powell to an orthopedist,timothy watson.powell sought no care or treatment from kleinman after the october visit.
this lawsuit 
powell thereafter sued kleinman and levin,as well as the center,alleging they undertook employment to diagnose and provide powell treatment and proper medical care,but they lacked the necessary knowledge and skill to properly care for his condition and were negligent and unskillful in the diagnosis,treatment and prescription procedures used in treating his condition.the complaint specifically alleges that defendants negligently diagnosed,failed to diagnose and failed to treat an injury to his spine so as to cause him permanent injury and damage.
the summary judgment motion 
kleinman moved for summary judgment based on powell inability to establish he breached the standard of care and caused or contributed to his injuries.in support of the motion,he presented his own declaration,as well as the declaration of lawrence dardick,a family practice physician.kleinman related in his declaration the facts regarding powell care and treatment at the center from his first visit on september,through his final visit on october,some of which are set forth above.kleinman opined that based on the facts and his professional education,training and experience,the care and treatment he provided to powell at all times met the applicable standard of care,the diagnoses he made were correct and reasonable given the history provided,and he undertook and implemented timely and appropriate steps for consultation request or referral to fch on september,and to a back specialist on october.he further opined that the care and treatment he rendered powell did not cause or contribute to powell alleged injuries or damages.
dardick,who reviewed the medical records,declarations,and depositions in the case,summarized the facts disclosed by the medical records.dardick opined that kleinman chart and progress notes appeared to reflect adequate documentation of powell september,visit,and based on powell chief complaint,history and physical examination,his diagnosis and treatment plan were reasonable.dardick further opined that it was a reasonable treatment plan to refer powell to fch to rule out spinal cord compression on september.with respect to kleinman october,examination of powell,dardick opined kleinman management of powell was appropriate.finally,dardick opined it was reasonable for kleinman to immediately refer powell to watson on october.dardick concluded that based on the facts,his review of the medical records and deposition transcripts,and his professional education,training and experience,in his opinion kleinman care and treatment of powell at all times met the applicable standard of care,and there were no facts in the documents he reviewed that indicated kleinman violated the standard of care or caused powell alleged injuries.
powell opposition to the motion 
in opposition to the motion,powell presented the declaration of daniel meub,a neurosurgeon who stated he was familiar with the applicable standard of care.meub explained the applicable standard of care in paragraph the standard of care dictates that,when a patient presents with symptoms of weakness,the physician should have a high suspicion of the spinal cord being compromised.the standard of care further dictates that when spinal cord compression is suspected an mri must be ordered on an emergent basis,stat.being ordered stat,the mri must be performed,read and the results thereof must be acted upon immediately.a physician with knowledge of an mri having been ordered with powell symptoms must for timely results of the mri and must act on its with immediate referral to a neurosurgeon for surgical intervention.when a spinal cord is compromised,such as powell was,surgical intervention is mandated by the standard of care.
based on his review of the medical records,declarations,and depositions in this case,meub opined that kleinman breached the standard of care in three different ways.first,he opined in paragraph it is my opinion that kleinman fell below the standard of care in his care and treatment of powell.the record clearly indicates that by september,powell needed help walking which is indicative of the beginning stages of weakness due to spinal compromise.in all medical probability,powell also had indicators of weakness on september,when kleinman first saw him,that kleinman did not test for weakness,did not discover weakness,or failed to note findings of weakness as a part of his of which was below the standard of care.
second,meub opined in paragraph on october,powell presented to kleinman.in that visit,kleinman was aware that powell had an mri on september,and that he had no information concerning the results of the mri when he saw powell on that date.it was below the standard of care for kleinman not to have taken any steps to ascertain the results of the mri on october,when powell presented with continuing symptoms.
lastly,meub opined in paragraph it was below the standard of care for kleinman to assume that the staff at fresno community hospital had tested for cord compromise without any confirmation thereof.meub concluded in paragraph it is medically probable that kleinman care and treatment caused injury to powell that powell would not have sustained if his condition had been 
kleinman reply 
along with his reply brief,kleinman filed written objections to meub declaration.kleinman objected to meub opinions in paragraphs through that kleinman breached the standard of care,on various grounds,including hearsay,lack of foundation,speculation,contrary to proof and failure to cite admissible supporting evidence.in addition,kleinman submitted portions of the depositions of powell,kleinman and levin,and a september,note from powell chart which was an exhibit to kleinman deposition,to show they contradicted assertions made in meub declaration.
the trial court ruling 
at the end of the hearing on kleinman motion,the court adopted its tentative ruling granting the motion for summary judgment as its order.the court sustained kleinman objections to meub declaration.specifically,with respect to paragraph,the court found meub assumption that powell was suffering from weakness on september was without foundation in fact and contrary to the evidence before the court.the court pointed out that since the only admissible evidence regarding powell strength on september,namely kleinman declaration,showed powell was not suffering weakness on september,as kleinman stated that powell sensation and strength were intact on that date,the facts did not support meub assumption.the court further found that meub opinions in paragraph were also based on the flawed assumption that powell had symptoms of weakness on september,and therefore kleinman should have suspected spinal cord compromise.since the assumption was not supported by the evidence,the court found the conclusions in paragraph were inadmissible speculation.
with respect to meub opinion in paragraph that it was below the standard of care for kleinman not to have taken any steps to ascertain the mri results on october,the court stated the evidence meub relied on did not support this fact.instead,the court noted the evidence was silent as to what kleinman did or did not do to learn the results of the mri.the court concluded thus,it appears that meub has speculated that kleinman did not make any effort to obtain the mri results.again,speculation is not a valid basis for an expert opinion.therefore,the court intends to sustain kleinman objections to paragraph of meub declaration.
the court also sustained kleinman objection to paragraph of meub declaration,in which he stated it was below the standard of care for kleinman to assume fch had tested for spinal cord compromise.the court noted that meub did not explain why this was below the standard of care and instead simply made the assertion without any supporting reasoning or facts.finally,with respect to paragraph,in which meub stated kleinman care and treatment caused powell injury,the court explained that this conclusion is unsupported,as it relies upon the other conclusions in meub declaration that are without factual or logical support.on that basis,the court stated it was sustaining kleinman objections to that paragraph.the court reasoned that without the opinions expressed in paragraphs through of meub declaration,powell had not submitted any evidence showing kleinman treatment fell below the standard of care or caused him injury,and therefore kleinman was entitled to summary judgment.
in october powell filed a notice of appeal,but his appeal was from the nonappealable order granting the summary judgment motion.see jordan malone th,d modica merin d.for this reason,we advised the parties we were considering dismissing the appeal without prejudice to either party right to procure a judgment.a judgment was filed with this court on march,along with the parties stipulation that the judgment be added to record on appeal.upon receipt of the judgment,we deem the notice of appeal as taken from the judgment.prison law office koenig d,fn.summary judgment see cal.rules of court,rule e.

standard of review 
we review an order granting summary judgment de novo.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.we independently review the record and apply the same rules and standards as the trial court.zavala arce th,d.the trial court must grant the motion if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.
in performing our independent review of a defendant summary judgment motion,we apply the rules pertaining to summary judgment procedure.a defendant moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of showing that a cause of action lacks merit because one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or there is an affirmative defense to that cause of action.code civ,subd.o aguilar,cal th at,d.if the defendant fails to make this initial showing,it is unnecessary to examine the plaintiff opposing evidence,and the motion must be denied.however,if the moving papers make a prima facie showing that justifies a judgment in the defendant favor,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact.code civ,subd.p aguilar,cal th at,d.
in determining whether the parties have met their respective burdens,the court must consider all of the evidence and all of the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom,and must view such evidence citation and such inferences citations in the light most favorable to the opposing party.aguilar,cal th.at,d.there is a triable issue of fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.id.at,d,fn.omitted.consequently,a defendant moving for summary judgment must present evidence that would require a trier of fact not to find any underlying material fact more likely than not.id.at,d.

ii.medical malpractice 
medical providers must exercise that degree of skill,knowledge,and care ordinarily possessed and exercised by members of their profession under similar circumstances.barris county of los angeles cal th,fn,d.thus,in any medical malpractice action,the plaintiff must establish the duty of the professional to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the professional negligence.citation.hanson grode th,d hanson.
here,kleinman moved for summary judgment on the grounds that powell could not establish either that he breached the duty of care or caused powell injury.the trial court concluded that in moving for summary judgment,kleinman satisfied his initial burden of production on these issues,which powell does not challenge on appeal.thus,the burden shifted to powell to raise a triable issue of material fact.powell attempted to do this by presenting the declaration of meub,who opined that kleinman breached the standard of care and caused powell injury by failing to test for weakness,discover weakness or note findings of weakness in powell chart on september,failing to take steps to ascertain the mri results on october,when powell presented with continuing symptoms,and assuming the staff at fch had tested for cord compromise without confirming it had done so.because the court sustained kleinman evidentiary objections and excluded meub declaration,we review the court ruling for abuse of discretion.in evaluating the court ruling,we take guidance from cases analyzing the sufficiency of medical experts summary judgment declarations.
expert evidence requirements 
whenever the plaintiff claims negligence in the medical context,the plaintiff must present evidence from an expert that the defendant breached his or her duty to the plaintiff and that the breach caused the injury to the plaintiff.munro regents of university of california d.california courts have incorporated the expert evidence requirement into their standard for summary judgment in medical malpractice cases.when a defendant moves for summary judgment and supports his motion with expert declarations that his conduct fell within the community standard of care,he is entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff comes forward with conflicting expert evidence.id.at.
cases dismissing expert declarations in connection with summary judgment motions do so on the basis that the declarations established that the opinions were either speculative,lacked foundation,or were stated without sufficient certainty.citations.it is sufficient,if an expert declaration establishes the matters relied upon in expressing the opinion,that the opinion rests on matters of a type reasonably relied upon,and the bases for the opinion.citation.sanchez hillerich bradsby th,d sanchez.an expert opinion,however,may not be based on assumptions of fact that are without evidentiary support or based on factors that are speculative or conjectural,for then the opinion has no evidentiary value and does not assist the trier of fact.citation.moreover,an expert opinion rendered without a reasoned explanation of why the underlying facts lead to the ultimate conclusion has no evidentiary value because an expert opinion is worth no more than the reasons and facts on which it is based.citations.bushling fremont medical center th,d bushling.
simply because the defendant doctor provides an unopposed declaration by an expert does not necessarily mean the court should grant summary judgment.in kelley trunk th,d kelley,division seven of the second district court of appeal held that a defendant doctor is not entitled to obtain summary judgment based on a conclusory expert declaration which states the opinion that no malpractice has occurred,but does not explain the basis for the opinion.id.at,d.in that case,the plaintiff received treatment in an emergency room for a laceration to his arm.the following day,the plaintiff friend spoke on the telephone with a doctor who was for the plaintiff primary care physician,and told him the plaintiff had run out of pain medication and was in pain.the doctor ordered a refill of the pain medication and suggested the plaintiff see his primary care physician when the physician returned in three or four days.eventually,the plaintiff saw his primary care physician,who referred him to an orthopedic specialist,who in turn performed surgery.the plaintiff sued both the doctor and his primary care physician for malpractice.ibid.
the doctor brought a summary judgment motion supported by an expert declaration from another doctor,in which the expert listed his credentials and the medical records he reviewed,recited the facts of the case,and stated his opinion that the defendant at all times acted within the standard of care.kelley,supra,th at,d.on appeal from the trial court grant of summary judgment,the appellate court concluded the declaration was insufficient to carry the defendant burden in moving for summary judgment.id.at,d.in so concluding,the court noted that an opinion unsupported by reasons or explanations does not establish the absence of a material fact issue for trial,as required for summary judgment,and an expert opinion is worth no more than the reasons upon which it rests.ibid.since the expert declaration did not address what the court viewed to be the crucial issues in the case,which included why surgery was necessary,whether a reasonable doctor would have recognized the possibility of severe complications when the plaintiff friend spoke with the doctor,and whether earlier intervention would have mitigated the plaintiff injury,the court concluded that w ithout illuminating explanation,it was insufficient to carry the doctor burden in moving for summary judgment.ibid.as the court explained,i t is not our intent to disparage either the summary judgment procedure,or its appropriate use in malpractice cases.the procedure is a and important part of our civil system.summary judgment is appropriate in every case where the statutory standard is met,and the absence of material issues for trial established.however,that standard is not satisfied by laconic expert declarations which provide only an ultimate opinion,unsupported by reasoned explanation.id.at,d.
subsequently,division one of the second district court of appeal,in hanson,supra,th,d,reversed a summary judgment in favor of the defendant surgeons because it found the declaration of the plaintiff expert was sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact as to breach of duty and causation.id.at,d.the plaintiff alleged he had suffered nerve damage as a result of spinal cord surgery.the appellate court concluded plaintiff expert declaration,which the trial court found lacked a factual basis,was more than adequate to satisfy the plaintiff burden on summary judgment.id.at,d.the court explained that specific factual breaches of duty were clearly asserted in the plaintiff expert declaration,such as the defendants failed to investigate bleeding at the time of the surgery,which investigation may have led them to perform a laminectomy defendants failed to return the plaintiff to surgery after he was in the recovery room to determine why he had symptoms of nerve injury and defendants failure to diagnose epidural hematoma prior to discharge from the hospital fell below the applicable standard of care.ibid.the court concluded these factual breaches of duty were sufficient to raise triable issues on the element of breach of duty.ibid.
with respect to causation,the hanson court noted the plaintiff expert declaration stated the plaintiff suffered nerve damage during the surgery and that the care defendants provided was a cause of his injuries.although the style of the expert declaration is at times a bit obtuse,the plaintiff is entitled to all favorable inferences that may reasonably be derived from that declaration.these inferences include a reading of the declaration to state that the nerve damage the plaintiff suffered during surgery was caused by the conduct of the defendants,which conduct fell below the applicable standard of care.nothing more was needed.hanson,supra,th at,d.in so concluding,the hanson court expressly declined to use kelley,which it characterized as suggesting that even on summary judgment,an expert declaration must set forth in excruciating detail the factual basis
