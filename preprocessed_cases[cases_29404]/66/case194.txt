this appeal concerns the way in which the district court handled what began as an attorney discipline matter.the central actors are eric troutt,the attorney,and district judge michael reagan.briefly put,judge reagan concluded that troutt had failed to live up to his obligations to the bar of the southern district of illinois,and,even worse,had conducted himself in a way that amounted to criminal contempt of court.troutt has appealed from the district court order of november,finding him in criminal contempt and suspending him from practicing law in the district court for five years.although we by no means condone the behavior that troutt displayed before the district court,we conclude that the procedures the court followed do not pass muster,and we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.
the imbroglio began when,on september,troutt filed an affidavit of resignation from the bar of the state of oklahoma,pending disciplinary proceedings that were then before the oklahoma supreme court.that court accepted his resignation and struck his name from its roll of attorneys.troutt was ineligible to file an application for reinstatement to practice in oklahoma for a period.
some months later,in february of,troutt sought and won admission to practice in the united states district court for the southern district of illinois.on may,however,upon receiving a copy of the oklahoma supreme court order approving troutt resignation from the state bar pending disciplinary proceedings,the district court sent a notice to troutt pursuant to local rule c of the district court for the southern district of illinois.the notice informed troutt that he had days in which to inform the court why the imposition of similar discipline by th e court,consisting of disbarment from practice in this court,would be unwarranted.on may,troutt responded in a detailed letter,claiming that he had neither consented to disbarment in oklahoma nor resigned to avoid discipline.instead,he asserted,the allegations against him in oklahoma were dismissed and never proven and no discipline was imposed against him.accordingly,he argued,because he had never been disciplined by any bar,there was no basis for this court to impose discipline.the judges in the southern district of illinois saw matters differently,and in an order dated june,they suspended troutt from practice in that district.
on july,troutt filed a motion to alter the june order.his motion largely rehashed the arguments he had made in his original letter about the circumstances surrounding his resignation from the oklahoma bar.in response,the court set a status conference for july,to address whether it was necessary to have a hearing on troutt motion.at the status conference,the court directed troutt to file an affidavit providing the details about his resignation from the oklahoma bar,including relevant documents from that proceeding,and it informed troutt that it would issue a written order upon receipt of this affidavit.troutt complied,and after reviewing the affidavit and the documents,the court issued an order on august rescinding the earlier order suspending him from practice and directing the clerk to reinstate his name to the roll of attorneys.importantly for what was to come,the reinstatement order was not an unqualified vindication of troutt it included the following critical observations 
the undersigned judge consulted with each of the judges who signed the june,order suspending troutt.they accept the undersigned judge recommendation that the suspension be lifted.however,in conferring with the other judges,it became clear that troutt performance in the district court has been less than stellar.indeed he was more than minutes late for the status conference in the instant case.the court cautions troutt that further misconduct may result in imposition of the same discipline this order vacates,or worse.
judge michael reagan,to whom the matter had been assigned randomly,signed this order.
believing that the august order disparage d his character and malign ed his performance before the court,troutt filed a response to court order.his response took exception to the characterization of his work as less than stellar and objected that the court had failed to give him notice and an opportunity to respond to its accusations of misconduct.he went on to complain that the whole matter had come about in retaliation for his reporting a former law partner,terry sharp,for fraudulent billing practices it was sharp,troutt believed,who had sent the oklahoma court order to courts all around the country.the next day,troutt filed a motion to alter or amend order,in which he asked the court to strike the last three sentences of its august order and,if the court thought that troutt had committed misconduct of any kind,to proceed under local rule d disciplinary rule for professional conduct,which assures notice and an opportunity to be heard for an attorney accused of misconduct.troutt motion contained harsh language about the court itself,claiming that rather than following the rules of due process,the court takes its secret information and imposes discipline by public reprimand and admonishment without giving respondent his due process rights under rule d.he also accused the court of relying on illusory references to unknown information obtained by conferring with other judges.
on august,judge reagan issued a rule to show cause order directing troutt to explain why the court should not hold him in criminal contempt for his vitriolic response to the court order reinstating him to practice.the court gave three reasons for its order,which we reproduce in full to give a sense of the escalating problem 
first,the federal rules of civil procedure provide no procedural vehicle for an attorney who is dissatisfied with a court order to excoriate the judge issuing that order.in appropriate circumstances,motions may be filed but lawyers may not engage in mordacious attacks on the court via diatribes labeled as a responses sic to orders.
second,the substantive contents of the response warrant issuance of a show cause order.troutt pointedly accuses the undersigned judge of disparaging his character and maligning his performance.troutt claims that the judge has found him guilty of misconduct without providing troutt notice and an opportunity to be heard.in fact,the august order did no such thing.the order did mention that other district judges had expressed concerns regarding troutt performance in past cases in this district,and the order did caution troutt about being late for court appearances.but the order granted troutt motion and reinstated him to the rank of lawyers authorized to practice before this court.
third,troutt response not only constitutes an unbridled attack on the undersigned judge authority,troutt also appears to be using this court electronic case filing system as a bully pulpit from which to belittle his former business partner,attorney terry sharp.the response accuses sharp of fraudulently billing clients for a long time and snidely quips that sharp has had quite the rico operation going.troutt then challenges this court to meet its obligation to discipline sharp for such gross violations.
emphasis in original footnote omitted.the order went on to invite troutt to file a judicial misconduct complaint against the judge with chief circuit judge flaum,or to report attorney sharp to the illinois attorney registration and disciplinary commission,if he really thought either step was warranted.last,it set october,as the date for a hearing at which troutt was instructed to appear and show cause why he ought not be held in criminal contempt for filing his august,response to court order.
in response to this order,troutt faxed judge reagan a,ex parte letter on august,in which he said that he wanted to resolve his dispute with the court informally.the letter began by reviewing the history of his suspension and his complaints about the reinstatement process where he called the judge disingenuous for using his tardiness as an excuse for reprimand,then listed five errors that the court had committed,set forth troutt theory about what was
