michael massey,an inmate at the federal correctional institution in pekin,illinois,filed a medical malpractice suit against the united states under the federal tort claims act ftca.the district court granted the united states motion for summary judgment,and massey now appeals from that ruling.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
massey was incarcerated at from march,to june.during the summer of,while incarcerated at the marion county jail,massey had begun experiencing pain in his abdominal region and had noticed a lump protruding from his navel.once massey arrived at,he began to complain about abdominal pain.on july,his attorney wrote david helman,warden,a letter stating that massey had a hernia for which he may need surgery and that the prison response to massey condition had been unsatisfactory,ex.the letter complained that,although the prison medical staff instructed massey to avoid heavy lifting,such a warning was hardly an adequate response to a hernia.id.according to his attorney,massey was really in pain and in need of medical attention.id.at.massey testified that he received a copy of this letter.
on july,john otten,an staff physician,examined massey with respect to his abdominal pain.otten told massey that he suffered from an umbilical hernia and that the hernia required surgery soon.otten also informed massey that he would put the paperwork in to get the surgery scheduled,ex at.according to massey,he believed,on the basis of his conversation with otten,that the hernia required immediate treatment.on august,otten placed massey name on a wait list for inmates in need of surgery however,on august,ferdinand samalio,a health services administrator at,removed massey name from the list.
over the next four months,massey hernia grew and his pain increased greatly.by october or november of,massey was becoming very uncomfortable he testified that he could no longer sleep on his stomach and that he had trouble with bowel movements.because of the increased pain and massey belief that he needed to stay on top of the prison treatment of his condition,massey spoke to otten,health services administrator samalio,nurses and his attorney about obtaining the surgery promptly.id.at.massey believed that the prison was delaying his surgery indeed,he registered numerous complaints with a prison review committee,but nothing came of his efforts.
when began,the surgery still had not taken place.massey testified that,by this point,the hernia caused him pain on a daily basis,and he believed that his requests for an operation were being completely ignored.on january of that year,massey attorney wrote a second letter to warden.he stated that massey hernia keeps growing,with no surgery scheduled and that massey repeated phone calls to him caused serious concern on his part as to whether is violating massey constitutional rights,in addition to placing his life in serious jeopardy because of inattention to his medical needs,ex.in the same letter,massey attorney also threatened to sue in order to remedy the situation.massey testified that he received a copy of this letter and agreed with its accusations.on december,john stephen marshall,a surgeon with the peoria surgical group,examined massey pursuant to a consultation contract with.marshall diagnosed massey as suffering from a freely reducible hernia,which did not require immediate surgery massey complained that his pain was increasing,and,consequently,marshall recommended and performed massey hernia operation on january.marshall testified that massey recovery was unremarkable,with no complications.after surgery,marshall ordered massey to refrain from heavy lifting.he also recommended that the prison administer vicodin to massey for pain relief as needed.
when massey returned to,prison officials placed him in his cell and administered tylenol with codeine also known as tylenol instead of vicodin.rather than bring massey his tylenol,prison officials required him to walk from his cell to the infirmary to get his prescription.they also required massey to walk from his cell to the dining hall for meals.
following this allegedly improper treatment,massey filed an administrative tort claim,which the bureau of prisons bop received on february.on november,massey filed a medical malpractice suit against the united states pursuant to the ftca.
district court proceedings 
massey raised two claims before the district court.first,massey claimed that the prison was negligent in its delay in providing him with the surgical repair of his hernia.second,massey claimed that the prison was negligent in failing to follow orders directing that he receive vicodin and be placed in the prison observation unit for two days.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the united states on both claims.
the district court held that massey claim of negligent delay of surgery was because he failed to present the claim to the bop within two years after the claim accrued.the district court determined that there is no doubt that massey believed the hernia to be serious by january,and that,since he discovered his injury the increased pain and its probable cause the prison delay no later than january,the statute of limitations for his ftca suit began to accrue on that not before.at.the district court further held that massey claim for failure to follow orders was timely but unsupported by medical evidence.
discussiona.negligent delay claim 
massey claims that he was injured by negligent delay in performing his hernia operation.the district court held that massey claim was because he failed to present the claim to the bop within two years after the claim accrued.on appeal,massey submits that his claim is not and that the district court incorrectly determined the date upon which his claim accrued.massey argues essentially that he suffered no injury until delay in getting him the surgery was negligent,a departure from the accepted standard of medical care,and that this negligence did not occur outside of the window.appellant br.at.the government,on the other hand,submits that the district court correctly determined that massey claim accrued no later than january,and therefore is barred by the statute of limitations 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see city of new albany,cir.summary judgment is properly granted on the basis of a statute of limitations defense if the statute of limitations has run,thereby barring the plaintiff claim as a matter of law,and there exist no genuine issues of material fact regarding the time at which plaintiff claim has accrued and the application of the statute to plaintiff claim which may be resolved in plaintiff favor.green united states,cir quoting yorger pittsburgh corning,cir.in this case,the statute of limitations has run,and there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute as to when massey claim accrued.
the ftca provides that a tort claim against the united states shall be forever barred unless it is presented in writing to the appropriate federal agency within two years after such claim accrues.b.in united states kubrick,d,the supreme court established the basic rule with respect to the accrual of an action for medical malpractice under the ftca.in that case,the court reversed a court of appeals holding that a medical malpractice claim under the ftca did not accrue until the plaintiff knew or should have known that the physician who caused the injury was legally blameworthy.see id.at.in doing so,the court held that a claim under the ftca accrues when the plaintiff knows both the existence and cause of his injury,and not at a later time when he also knows that the acts inflicting the injury may constitute medical malpractice.see id.at.the court stated that,for statute of limitations purposes,a plaintiff ignorance of his legal rights and his ignorance of the fact of the injury or its cause should not receive equal treatment.see id.at.the court further stated that to excuse a plaintiff from properly seeking advice in the medical and legal community by postponing the accrual of his claim would undermine the purpose of the limitations statute,which is to require the reasonably diligent presentation of tort claims against the government.id.at.
adhering to the supreme court directive,we have held consistently that m edical malpractice claims under the ftca accrue when a plaintiff has discovered his injury and its probable cause even though he may be ignorant of his legal rights.green,at see also drazan united states,cir jastremski united states,cir.the statute of limitations does not await the plaintiff knowledge that his injury was caused by negligence or reckless conduct.green,at.once armed with knowledge that he has been injured and by whom,the potential malpractice plaintiff has reason to believe that he may have a legal claim and he then has the statutory period in which to conduct the necessary investigation and prepare and file a suit.goodhand united states,cir.
in this case,the district court correctly applied the kubrick standard and determined that,even when all reasonable inferences are drawn in massey favor,it is apparent that any claims based on the delay in scheduling his hernia operation are.at.the district court further indicated that,although it was inclined to believe that massey claim accrued sometime during the last three months of,it held that the claim certainly accrued no later than january,because there was no doubt that massey had discovered both his injury the increased pain and its probable cause the prison delay in performing the operation by that date.
massey now challenges the district court conclusion that his claim accrued no later than january.massey admits that,under kubrick,a medical malpractice claim accrues when the plaintiff has discovered his injury and its probable cause.nevertheless,massey contends that the district court misapplied this rule to the facts of his case.first,massey submits that he could suffer no injury until delay in getting him the surgery was negligent,a departure from the accepted standard of medical care.appellant br.at.it is impossible to discern from massey brief the precise date upon which he believes the prison delay became negligent it is clear,however,that he believes that negligence did not occur before february.second,massey submits that any injury he suffered before february,was de minimis and therefore did not trigger the statute of limitations.finally,massey submits that the discovery rule should be applied liberally in cases such as his,in which the plaintiff claim is premised on the defendant failure to treat or diagnose.we shall examine each of these contentions in turn.
with respect to massey first argument,to the extent that he is arguing that the statute of limitations did not begin to run until he was aware that the delay in scheduling his surgery amounted to negligence,the supreme court decision in kubrick precludes such a contention.kubrick stands for the proposition that a claim accrues when the plaintiff knows both the existence and probable cause of his injury and not at a later time when he also knows that the acts inflicting the injury may constitute medical malpractice.as the supreme court stated,the accrual of a claim does not await awareness by the plaintiff that his injury was negligently inflicted.kubrick,at.
to the extent that massey contends that there is insufficient evidence to establish that he knew of his injury and the cause of that injury no later than january,the record does not support such an argument.massey testified that he consulted otten about the hernia in the summer of and that,after speaking to the physician,he believed that the hernia required immediate treatment.at the same time,massey testified that the hernia was growing in size and that otten informed him that surgery would be scheduled,because t his thing is going to get worse and worse and it dangerous if it keeps going,ex at.massey also knew that he was going to get put on a waiting list and that he had to stay on top of this.id.at.he was concerned about the hernia and wanted the surgery promptly.over the course of the next three or four months approximately october through december the hernia continued to grow quite a bit,and began to really bother massey.id.at.when asked how the hernia was affecting him,massey replied i could sleep on my stomach.when i went over it hurt.i did dare try to lift anything heavy.it hurt.sometimes when i had a bowel movement it hurt.i knew it was there,whereas before like it hurt a little bit when i got to but not bad.id.at.
massey voiced his complaints to otten,samalio and nurses.massey also complained to his attorney,who in turn sent two letters to the prison warden.the first letter,dated july,stated that massey had developed a hernia for which he may need surgery,that the prison advice do lift anything was hardly an adequate response,that the problem was serious,that he was really in pain and in need of the medical attention,and that his medical needs are not being adequately met,ex.the second letter,dated january,stated that massey had been told by physicians that he suffers from a hernia which needs surgery,that his hernia keeps growing,that his life was in serious jeopardy,and that,despite these facts,no surgery had been scheduled,ex.
the record clearly establishes that massey was experiencing increased pain between october and january as a result of the prison delay in performing the operation.massey,of course,knew that he did not receive an operation during this time.the facts further demonstrate that massey believed he was in need of prompt,if not immediate,surgery and that the surgery was delayed because the prison had not scheduled it.see goodhand,at t he statute of limitations begins to run on the date when the plaintiff discovers that he has been injured by an act or omission attributable to the defendant.the plaintiff then has the statutory period to determine whether the act or omission was negligent,and to proceed from there.
massey next submits that his claim did not accrue outside of the statute of limitations because any injury he suffered before february,was de minimis and therefore did not trigger the statute of limitations.in support of this argument,massey relies on goodhand.in goodhand,the court affirmed the general rule from kubrick that the plaintiff cause of action accrues once the plaintiff is armed with knowledge that he has been injured and by whom.goodhand,at.the court went on to state that t he statute of limitations begins to run upon the discovery of the injury,even if the full extent of the injury is not discovered until much later.id.the court explained that w ere it not for this rule,the statute of limitations might be extended even to death,since until then it is always possible that the plaintiff injury will worsen.id.having set forth the general rule,the court then noted that an exception exists for the case in which at first the injury reasonably seems trivial,and only much later is it discovered to be serious enough to warrant the expense of a precomplaint investigation.id.at.
the record in this case simply will not support this characterization.massey,both personally and through his attorney,made clear that he believed the failure to schedule the surgery was a serious deprivation that gravely jeopardized his health and was a matter.in the letter dated january,massey counsel informed of his concern 
mike massey has been told by your prison physicians that he has a hernia which needs surgery his hernia keeps growing,with no surgery scheduled 
when i wrote to you on july,over six months ago,i advised you that i had telephoned the institution repeatedly attempting to talk with someone in the medical department but was unable to get a single person to return my phone call.nor have i received any response from you or anyone on your staff to my july,letter.i will not write to you again.i trust that you will address immediately mike medical problems i will not stand by and watch mike serious medical needs go unattended his sentence does not require that he die in prison because medical doctors working for the federal bureau of prisons choose to ignore his medical needs.
