background 
on march,laouiti,a dental assistant,stepped on a wire connected to an sensor that was in easterby mouth easterby head jerked to one side,she felt pain on the right side of her neck,and she later went to the emergency room where a physician prescribed pain medication.over the next months,easterby felt pain in her neck,back,and shoulders and numbness in her left hand.both her family practitioner and her internist prescribed pain medication and regular physical therapy.neither treatment alleviated her pain.
easterby internist referred her to john regan,an orthopedic surgeon.regan determined that easterby suffered from a degenerative condition of the cervical spine and that she had compressed spinal nerves and herniated disks.regan performed surgery to reduce the nerve compression.a year later,easterby reported that she was doing very well despite occasional muscle spasms.easterby and her husband sued laouiti,his employer spring dental group,and easterby dentist deledonne for dental malpractice,general negligence,and loss of consortium.
in september,defendants deposed regan.during the deposition,defense counsel asked regan t his is our one opportunity to take your deposition as a designated medical legal expert.have you formulated opinions on the subject of causation as it pertains to denise easterby and the alleged events of march,regan replied i have not been asked to do that.defense counsel further asked and doctor,you can not state to a reasonable degree of medical probability that as a result of the alleged event on march,that this patient required surgery,correct regan replied correct.plaintiffs counsel followed up with do you know what caused the surgical procedure,a trauma or something else regan replied i do know what caused it.
in january,approximately three months before the start of trial,plaintiffs sent defendants the following correspondence this is to advise you that john regan,has read his deposition taken on september,and will not make any changes.this is also to advise you that subsequent to his deposition,regan received a letter dated september,from greta wanyik,said letter confirms that reference to an automobile accident involving plaintiff denise easterby in march of,was a mistake and that plaintiff does not have a history of an automobile accident in march of consequently,regan will testify at trial that to a reasonable degree of medical probability the event of march,led to plaintiff surgery.italics added.defendants did not depose regan after receiving this letter.
a week before the start of trial,defendants,citing kennemur state of california d.kennemur sought in limine order limit ing the trial testimony of plaintiff expert s to those opinions and conclusions specifically articulated at the time of their depositions,and preclud ing plaintiff from providing them with additional information,available but not provided at the time of their depositions.plaintiffs did not oppose the motion.
during direct examination at trial,regan testified at length about the nature of easterby condition and how surgery alleviated much of the pain she felt in her neck,back,and shoulders.at one point,plaintiffs counsel implied through a question that the dental incident caused easterby to have a pinched nerve.the trial court sustained defense counsel objection,and plaintiffs counsel followed up with what is the cause of that why did you do the surgery what did it happen sic to cause the surgery regan answered well,the patient,denise,had a degenerative condition of the cervical spine.she had a condition of aging of the cervical spine that had bone spurs the question really is,did this incident produce a problem that then requires surgery that would not get better without surgery and my feeling is that she had an injury.she went to the emergency room,complaining of neck pain.she had conservative treatment.the treatment did not help her,and this is what eventually led to her needing surgery.defense counsel did not object to the question or move to strike regan answer.
during,regan testified that he had not reviewed easterby patient history,medical records,or predating march.defense counsel showed regan various excerpts of easterby medical history in which she complained of pain,compression,and injury in her neck and back stemming from multiple automobile accidents and a predating march.defense counsel then asked can you state to a reasonable degree of medical probability,based on all that you seen,that this woman surgery that you performed was necessitated because of the event of march,regan replied no.counsel followed up with and you do know,doctor,whether the pathology that you addressed at your march,surgery was preexistent to that march,event is that right regan replied yes.
court reconvened after lunch,and on redirect examination,regan backed off from the testimony he provided during.he explained that because he was not able to view the actual that were taken of easterby vertebral column before march,the only information he could rely on was easterby description of her pain.easterby reported to regan that she was asymptomatic before the dental incident.after the dental incident,easterby reported to regan that she felt extreme pain,pain that could only be alleviated through surgery.based on this report,regan opined that it was a medical probability that the dental incident was a cause of her eventual surgery.
regan further testified that he did not provide an opinion on causation at his deposition because he was confused about why defense counsel kept referring to a dental chair accident.regan explained that at the time of his deposition,he believed easterby had been involved in a vehicle accident in march based on erroneous information in her medical records.once easterby internist corrected the error and clarified that regan sought treatment because of pain from the dental incident,and not from an automobile accident,regan believed he could offer an opinion on causation at trial.
on the next day of trial,defendants moved to strike all of regan testimony on causation,citing kennemur,supra,d,and the in limine order restricting regan trial testimony to the opinions he offered at his deposition.the trial court granted defendants motion and indicated that it would instruct the jury to disregard regan testimony that the dental incident caused injury and surgery.based on this ruling,defendants moved for nonsuit,which the trial court granted.
after trial,defendants filed their memorandum of costs,which included expert witness fees pursuant to code of civil procedure section plaintiffs filed a motion to tax the expert witness fees,which the trial court granted.plaintiffs timely appealed from the final judgment,and defendants timely appealed from the court order.
discussion 
exclusion of regan testimony 
plaintiffs contend the trial court committed reversible error in striking regan testimony on causation.according to plaintiffs,they fulfilled their requirement to notify defendants about the nature of regan expected testimony through the january letter in which they stated that regan would testify at trial that to a reasonable degree of medical probability the event of march,led to plaintiff surgery.defendants contend that an expert may not offer an opinion on causation at trial if he declines to offer one during his deposition.we agree with plaintiffs contentions and conclude the trial court erred by striking regan causation testimony we turn first to the legal framework and then to our analysis.
legal framework 
w e review the trial court ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony for an abuse of discretion.mateel environmental justice foundation edmund gray th,d.
under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,any party may demand the exchange of expert witness information in this exchange,a party may provide either a list setting forth the name and address of any person whose expert opinion that party expects to offer in evidence at the trial or a statement that the party does not presently intend to offer the testimony of any expert witness,subds.b.section and the case law require that the general substance of the testimony which the witness is expected to give must be disclosed upon proper request.as interpreted by the california courts,this requires a party to disclose the substance of the facts and the opinions to which the expert will testify,either in his witness exchange list,or in his deposition,or both.citation.williams volkswagenwerk aktiengesellschaft d.williams.the issue of whether an expert testimony at trial may diverge from his deposition testimony has been explored by several courts before.
in kennemur,supra,d,the plaintiff attempted to call an expert to testify about causation at trial.in three depositions prior to trial,however,the expert testified that he had no opinion to offer on causation.id.at.the trial court did not permit the expert to testify,and the court of appeal affirmed,holding 
when appropriate demand is made for exchange of expert witness lists,the party is required to disclose not only the name,address and qualifications of the witness but the general substance of the testimony the witness is expected to give at trial.in our view,this means the party must disclose either in his witness exchange list or at his expert deposition,if the expert is asked,the substance of the facts and the opinions which the expert will testify to at trial.id.at.
the court reasoned that o nly by such a disclosure will the opposing party have reasonable notice of the specific areas of investigation by the expert,the opinions he has reached and the reasons supporting the opinions,to the end the opposing party can prepare for and rebuttal of the expert testimony.ibid.the court was careful to note that the defendant was entitled to rely on the expert disclaimer that he would not testify on causation until such time as appellant disclosed that the expert had conducted a further investigation and had reached additional opinions in a new area of inquiry.italics added.id.at.
in jones moore th,d jones,the plaintiff sued her former attorney for legal malpractice after her stopped paying marital support.at the plaintiff expert deposition,the expert testified that he believed the defendant conduct fell below the standard of care when he negotiated the underlying divorce settlement and judgment.when asked whether he believed the defendant conduct fell below the standard of care in other areas of his representation,the expert testified not that i prepared to testify to at this time.id.at,d.when asked whether he anticipated arriving at any other opinions,the expert testified,no,but if i do,you will be notified well in advance,so as to be able to properly exercise your discovery rights.id.at,d.at trial,the expert testified that the defendant conduct fell below the standard of care when he failed to properly secure the source of plaintiff marital support income,a task unrelated to his negotiation of the underlying settlement and judgment.the trial court excluded this opinion,and the court of appeal affirmed,holding 
under these circumstances,exclusion of testimony going beyond the opinions he expressed during his deposition was justified when an expert deponent testifies as to specific opinions and affirmatively states those are the only opinions he intends to offer at trial,it would be grossly unfair and prejudicial to permit the expert to offer additional opinions at trial.id.at,d.
the appellate court reasoned that the expert was in effect not made available for deposition as to the further opinions he offered at trial he promised to notify defendant if he later formulated such opinions but did not do so.id.at,d 
in bonds roy cal th,d,bonds,a medical malpractice case,the defendant stated in his expert witness declaration that his expert would testify only on the issue of damages.at the expert deposition,the expert specifically confirmed he did not expect to be giving any testimony or any opinion concerning the standard of care issues that might be involved in this case.id.at,d.at trial,during the afternoon recess of the last day of testimony,defense counsel sought to expand the scope of the expert testimony to include the applicable standard of care.the trial court denied the request on two grounds first,the plaintiff had expected the expert to testify only as to damages and because the expert was the last defense witness,there was not enough time to adjourn and take his deposition second,expanding the scope of the expert testimony at that point would be unfair,prejudicial,and a surprise to the plaintiff.ibid.the supreme court affirmed,explaining the very purpose of the expert witness discovery statute is to give fair notice of what an expert will say at trial.this allows the parties to assess whether to take the expert deposition,to fully explore the relevant subject area at any such deposition,and to select an expert who can respond with a competing opinion on that subject area.id.at,d.the court continued,w hen an expert is permitted to testify at trial on a wholly undisclosed subject area,opposing parties similarly lack a fair opportunity to prepare for or rebuttal.id.at,d.
the overarching principle in kennemur,jones,and bonds is clear a party expert may not offer testimony at trial that exceeds the scope of his deposition testimony if the opposing party has no notice or expectation that the expert will offer the new testimony,or if notice of the new testimony comes at a time when deposing the expert is unreasonably difficult.the present case differs from kennemur,jones,and bonds in one salient respect defendants learned approximately three months before trial that regan would go beyond his original deposition testimony and offer a causation opinion at trial.specifically,plaintiffs informed defendants that regan would testify at trial that to a reasonable degree of medical probability the event of march,led to plaintiff surgery.thus,unlike the defendants in kennemur and jones,and the plaintiff in bonds,who had no reason to believe that the opposing party expert would offer an opinion at trial not offered in his deposition,defendants in this case were explicitly notified that regan would offer an opinion that was different from the opinion he offered in this deposition.and unlike the defendants in kennemur,jones,and bonds,defendants in this case had the opportunity to take regan deposition in light of his changed opinion and prepare for and rebuttal of his testimony.the elements of unfair surprise and prejudice present in kennemur,jones,and bonds are entirely absent in this case.
defendants do not contend that they did not receive plaintiffs correspondence.nor do they contend that it was unreasonably difficult or onerous to depose regan for a second time before trial started.rather,spring dental group and laouiti contend in their respondents brief that s uch notification provided no support for appellants counsel assertion that regan would testify that surgery was necessitated by the dental chair incident.similarly,deledonne contends in his respondent brief that there was no such notice to respondents that regan would testify on causation at trial.these bare contentions are simply puzzling.as quoted above,the correspondence explicitly notified defendants that regan would testify at trial that the dental incident caused easterby to have surgery.
laying aside the fact that they were explicitly notified of regan intention to testify about causation at trial,defendant
