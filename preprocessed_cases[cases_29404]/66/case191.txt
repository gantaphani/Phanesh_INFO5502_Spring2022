nasd manual,rule b.
avello contracted to work as a finop for hudson knight securities,hks and remained in that position from until.during that period the nasd became aware that hks was experiencing difficulty meeting its required level of net capital and began monitoring hks.eventually the nasd determined that the firm had improperly accounted for certain items in its focus reports which,if properly accounted for,would have shown that the firm had conducted business while below its required level of net capital.when the nasd or its department of enforcement believes that an associated person has violated rules,regulations,or securities laws,it may request authorization from the office of disciplinary affairs to file a complaint,procedural rule.if alleged to have violated a statute or certain nasd rules,a respondent may propose that the nasd chief hearing officer select a market regulation committee panelist for a hearing panel,procedural rule a.and that what happened here.in the department filed a complaint against jonathan webb,the chairman and of hks,and avello but did not name the firm itself that was later vetted before a hearing panel.
the complaint alleged ten causes,only three of which implicated avello.the charges against webb alone included allegations that hks,acting through him,effected securities transactions on days when it failed to maintain the minimum required net capital failed to maintain the level of net capital webb agreed to with the commission violated rules and regulations requiring the accurate maintenance and submission of books,records,and reports and conducted business without employing properly qualified principals required by nasd rules.the causes involving avello concerned only the financial reporting obligations the complaint alleged that hks,acting through both webb and avello,had failed to maintain its required level of net capital,had kept inaccurate books and records,and had filed inaccurate focus reports.those causes were based on the firm violation of five rules exchange act rules,and,and nasd conduct rules and.exchange act rule is the net capital rule.rule requires brokers and dealers to keep various books and records current,while rule requires them to file the focus reports.see.nasd rule requires members to observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principals of trade,while rule is the nasd counterpart to the exchange act rule regarding the proper keeping of books and records.the complaint did not charge avello with violating nasd membership and registration rule b the nasd provision specific to finops.
before any hearings were conducted,avello stipulated that five items were not accounted for properly in hks books,records,and reports.the first is a debt hks owed to american express for charges incurred by hks officers.at the time,avello believed that the underlying charges were personal to the officers and thus did not record the unpaid balance as a firm liability,though he acknowledged that the account agreement with american he did not read until all charges the responsibility of the firm as well as the individual cardholders.second is a loan that avello initially recorded as a liability,but later removed from hks books on webb word that it had been paid,even though it had not.the third item is a lease agreement for office furniture and equipment.instead of reading the agreement and recognizing that the lease should have been capitalized and the future payments recorded as a liability,avello treated it as a rental contract and recorded the monthly payments as rent based on a bank debit memorandum with that notation.fourth,avello included certain receivables,technically called receivables,owed to hks by another as allowable assets on the firm focus reports,even though he stipulated that they should not have been treated as allowable assets.finally,avello failed to account for debts hks owed various vendors and delivery services because the firm would not provide him with complete and accurate information.when submitting the firm focus report to the nasd,avello highlighted these last debts in a letter,stating that he had not been able to review any of the underlying documents and was unable to verify the accuracy of the amounts reported.
avello also stipulated to three more accounting errors made as a consequence of webb unsuccessful attempt to increase hks net capital.the first is a note executed by webb on behalf of hks that was paid down to by january.webb never disclosed the note to avello,so avello never recorded it as a firm liability from late through when webb replaced the note with a revolving line of credit.avello also booked as good capital a check drawn on webb personal checking account and deposited into hks checking account,even though at the time avello booked the check webb lacked sufficient funds in his checking account to cover it.third is a account at smith barney that avello booked as good capital even though it was not because it was encumbered by a officer authority to withdraw funds from the account.
although avello stipulated to the improper accounting,he denied responsibility for the resulting rules violations on the ground that he had adequately performed his role as finop.the hearing panel disagreed and held him liable for all the accounting errors except those pertaining to the note,the american express debt,and the account at smith barney.with respect to the net capital rule,the hearing panel concluded that avello errors made him responsible for four of the days when hks conducted
