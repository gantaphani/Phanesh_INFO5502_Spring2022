in this settle and sue case alexander namikas sued his former attorneys,paul miller and the law offices of lowthorp,richards,mcmillan,miller templeman collectively respondents,for negligently recommending he pay his permanent spousal support of per month.he alleged the settlement was excessive because respondents improperly calculated his permanent support obligation based upon dissomaster guidelines instead of a forensic marital standard of living analysis.family code section requires trial courts to consider the marital standard of living,along with numerous other factors,in assessing the need for permanent spousal support.
the trial court granted summary judgment for respondents.it determined namikas had failed to establish a triable issue of material fact as to whether,in the absence of the alleged negligence,he would have obtained a more favorable judgment or settlement.we affirm.
facts and procedural background 
namikas married joanne in.he was a dentist and she a pharmacist.joanne worked part time while their children were growing up,allowing namikas to concentrate on his dental practice.
joanne petitioned for dissolution in,after nearly years of marriage.at that time,namikas annual income was.joanne income was.namikas agreed to pay joanne temporary spousal support of per month.joanne continued to work part time until,when she entered the betty ford clinic for substance abuse treatment.she successfully completed the program,but did not immediately resume working.
respondents represented namikas in the dissolution proceeding.joanne was represented by richard taylor.in june,after extensive negotiations,the parties stipulated to entry of judgment based upon a marital settlement agreement msa.pertinent to this action,namikas received the family home and his dental practice,which generated monthly income of over.joanne received the parties second home,plus two properties with combined monthly rental income of.
the msa also provided for permanent spousal support to joanne of per month,less than the temporary support payment.the amount was calculated through the dissomaster program based on namikas compromise monthly income of and joanne imputed income of.a copy of the dissomaster calculation was attached to the msa.
prior to recommending the settlement,miller informed namikas the marital standard of living is a factor courts consider in awarding spousal support,but did not suggest that namikas obtain a forensic marital standard of living analysis.namikas grudgingly accepted the settlement,in part,because it imputed in income to joanne even though she was unemployed,ended the costly dissolution proceeding and resulted in support payments of per month.joanne agreed to pay her own attorney fees.
over the next few years,namikas periodically asked respondents about modifying support.he was told it was too soon to seek modification.in,namikas consulted with another attorney,who recommended an analysis of joanne monthly needs based on the marital standard of living.at namikas request,respondents retained a forensic accountant,william scott mowrey,to perform the analysis.using the date of separation claimed by joanne,mowrey determined joanne had monthly support needs of to maintain her marital standard of living.based on that analysis,namikas concluded joanne needed in monthly spousal support to supplement the she was receiving in rental income and imputed income.
subsequently,namikas retained a different law firm to request modification of spousal support.judge william liebmann granted the request in.rejecting mowrey calculations as outdated,judge liebmann accepted joanne evidence regarding the amount of her reasonable needs,and found that a net disposable income from all sources of approximately was sufficient for all her needs.he recognized joanne could meet these needs if she worked as a pharmacist,but was not convinced from the evidence presented that she is capable of working that schedule at this time,nor that she would have been capable of doing so if she had made additional efforts since the entry of the judgment.
weighing the factors enumerated in section,judge liebmann found that t he balance of hardships is clearly in favor of joanne.he determined that if she works hours per week,a monthly spousal support payment of,along with her other sources of income,will meet her needs of.judge liebmann ordered namikas to pay per month for two years to give joanne time to increase her work schedule to fully support herself.he reduced support to zero at the end of that period.
namikas filed a complaint for legal malpractice against respondents,claiming their negligence caused him to pay excessive spousal support.he alleged they negligently failed to conduct a marital standard of living analysis prior to recommending settlement and had improperly used the dissomaster program to calculate permanent support.respondents moved for summary judgment,contending they were not negligent and that even if they were,namikas could not prove that joanne would have settled for less than per month or that he would have obtained a better outcome at trial.respondents submitted a declaration from taylor that stated,inter alia,that even if he had received mowrey calculations at the time of the settlement negotiations,he still would not have agreed to a settlement of the spousal support issue for less than monthly.
namikas responded with a declaration from roslyn soudry,an experienced family law attorney,who opined that respondents failure to strongly recommend that namikas obtain a forensic marital standard of living analysis fell below the standard of care for attorneys practicing family law in southern california.soudry offered her expert opinion,based on her experience,that the fact that permanent spousal support was based on a dissomaster analysis resulted in a higher level of spousal support than would have been obtained based on an actual trial of the factors set forth in s ection.
the trial court granted the summary judgment motion.it determined a triable issue of material fact exists as to breach of the duty of professional care,but not as to causation and damages.the court concluded joanne would not have accepted a settlement of less than per month even if a forensic standard of living analysis had been prepared.it stated reasonable minds can not differ as to the legal effect of this evidence plaintiff could not have obtained a more favorable settlement.as for what plaintiff might have obtained at trial,respondents point out that plaintiff said he did know whether the court would have awarded joanne less than in spousal support.the court further determined there was no evidence of actual damage to plaintiff as opposed to possibility or probability.
the trial court rejected namikas contention that an inference of causation and damage may be drawn from the subsequent modification of spousal support.it explained judge liebmann in could go back and find that the spousal support the parties agreed to in was excessive,even if it was.he had to determine that circumstances had changed since the settlement,and he did.in short,he found that joanne had not used sufficient reasonable efforts to improve her financial situation.this finding has no bearing on what a court might have granted in spousal support had the parties not settled.namikas appeals.

the trial court determined,and the parties do not dispute,that triable issues of material fact exist regarding whether respondents breached a duty of professional care.the question presented here is whether the evidence established the absence of any triable issue as to causation and damages.
in the legal malpractice context,the elements of causation and damage are particularly closely linked.hecht,solberg,robinson,goldberg bagley llp superior court th.the plaintiff must prove,by a preponderance of the evidence,that but for the attorney negligent acts or omissions,he would have obtained a more favorable judgment or settlement in the action in which the malpractice allegedly occurred.viner sweet cal th,barnard langer,supra,th at.this standard requires a of the underlying case,in which the malpractice jury must decide what a reasonable jury or court would have done if the underlying matter had been tried instead of settled.mattco forge,arthur young th.this method is the most effective safeguard yet devised against speculative and conjectural claims it is a standard of proof designed to limit damages to those actually caused by a professional malfeasance jalali root th.
it is not enough for the plaintiff to simply claim that it was possible to obtain a better settlement or a better result at trial.the mere probability that a certain event would have happened will not furnish the foundation for malpractice damages.barnard,supra,th at.damage to be subject to a proper award must be such as follows the fact complained of as a legal certainty.citation.marshak ballesteros th,marshak.in other words,the plaintiff must show that he would certainly have received more money or had to pay less in settlement or at trial.slovensky friedman th,italics added see thompson halvonik th,evidence fails to show that but for that attorney delay in handling action,case would have settled sooner or on more favorable terms.
the requirement that a plaintiff need prove damages to a legal certainty is difficult to meet in any case.it is particularly so in settle and sue cases,which are inherently speculative.filbin fitzgerald,supra,th at.t he amount of a compromise is often an educated guess of the amount that can be recovered at trial and what the opponent was willing to pay or accept.even skillful and experienced negotiators do not know whether they received the maximum settlement or paid out the minimum acceptable.thus,the goal of a lawyer is to achieve a reasonable settlement,a concept that involves a wide spectrum of considerations and broad discretion.theoretically,any settlement could be challenged as inadequate,and the resolution is likely to require a trial barnard langer,supra,th at,fn.

causation and damages 
applying the foregoing principles,we must decide whether a triable issue of material fact exists regarding whether,but for respondents alleged negligence,namikas would have received a better settlement or outcome at trial.namikas alleged that if respondents had advised him to obtain a forensic marital standard of living analysis,he would have obtained mowrey analysis prior to settlement.he further alleged that had that analysis been available,he never would have agreed to pay per month in support.if joanne had refused to settle for a reasonable amount close to her actual marital standard of living he would have insisted on respondents trying the spousal support issue then.
respondents presented evidence,through taylor declaration,that even if taylor had been given mowrey standard of living analysis in,he would not have settled the spousal support claim for less than per month.namikas objected on the basis that joanne,and not taylor,had authority to settle.in reply,respondents submitted a declaration from joanne,who stated when agreeing to settle the amount of spousal support to be paid to me,i always would have followed the advice of my attorney,taylor,and if taylor had advised me not to agree to accept less than monthly spousal support,i would have followed his advice.namikas claims that taylor declaration is inadmissible and that joanne declaration was untimely.he also contends the trial court abused its discretion by denying his request for a continuance to test joanne declaration through.
it is undisputed taylor negotiated the support settlement on joanne behalf.namikas has not shown taylor statements are irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible.although taylor stated he would not have agreed to a settlement of less than per month,instead of saying what his client would have agreed to,he implied he had personal knowledge of what joanne would have done in that situation.joanne declaration is more persuasive,but taylor declaration was enough to shift the burden to namikas to produce admissible evidence demonstrating a triable issue of fact.code civ,subd.p green ralee engineering cal th.he failed to do so.the record is devoid of any suggestion joanne would have settled for less than.
even if an inference to the contrary could be drawn,there is no evidence as to what the settlement amount would have been.lawsuits often settle for reasons not necessarily related to their merits.people fuiava cal th.if joanne had agreed to less spousal support,for example,she may have demanded a larger property settlement or required that namikas pay her attorney fees.thus,any actual harm from respondents conduct is only a subject of surmise,given the myriad of variables that affect settlements t he mere probability that a certain event would have happened,upon which a claim for damages is predicated,will not support the claim or furnish the foundation of an action for such damages.citations.thompson halvonik th,doe salesian soc.th,plaintiff can not controvert the moving party declarations or evidence based on speculation,imagination,guesswork,or mere possibilities see orrick herrington sutcliffe superior court th,summary judgment proper where plaintiff produced no evidence his would have agreed to a settlement that included t
