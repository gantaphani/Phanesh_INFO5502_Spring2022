plaintiff and appellant amarillys laclette,laclette appeals a judgment following a grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants and respondents alexis galindo galindo and curd,galindo and smith the galindo firm sometimes collectively referred to as galindo in an action for legal malpractice.
the essential issue presented is whether laclette action is barred by the statute of limitations,or whether the statute of limitations was tolled by galindo continuing representation of laclette.code civ,subd.a.
we conclude a triable issue of material fact exists as to whether galindo continued to represent laclette during the pendency of a settlement agreement in the underlying action,so as to toll the limitations period in the malpractice action.irrespective of the lack of contact between galindo and laclette over a period,the evidence established the following the trial court retained jurisdiction over the underlying settlement the settlement obligated laclette to pay the sum of at the rate of per month laclette was paying the installments as agreed and galindo remained laclette counsel of record.
given these circumstances,we can not say as a matter of law that laclette could not reasonably expect galindo to represent her in the event of issues arising concerning the performance of the settlement.we reject galindo theory that the hiatus,when no legal services were required of galindo with respect to the settlement agreement,had the effect of implicitly terminating galindo representation of laclette.
factual and procedural background 
the underlying action.
laclette was employed by elite properties dba first class realty elite.laclette was natalie ramirez ramirez real estate agent in the purchase of certain real property located on strickland avenue in los angeles.laclette mother,amaryllis laclette,assisted laclette in the transaction.
in the underlying action,ramirez sued the laclettes and elite for breach of contract and fraud,contending they assured her there were no significant problems with the property and that she did not need an inspection,causing ramirez to forego an inspection of the property as a condition of purchase.
galindo and the galindo firm defended the laclettes and elite in the underlying action.

the instant action for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty.
laclette suit alleging a conflict of interest by galindo.
on february,laclette filed the instant action against galindo for legal malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty,alleging galindo had a conflict of interest in representing both elite and laclette in the underlying action.laclette pled n umerous breaches of the initial settlement agreement were occasioned by the conduct of the defendant elite,which precipitated the settlement agreement to be set aside by the court at the request of ramirez.further,i f laclette had been represented by independent counsel,she could have settled her case separately from her,so the default of the would not have effected her settlement.laclette contended that due to galindo conflict of interest,she was damaged in the amount of,calculated as the amount she was obligated to pay pursuant to the final settlement after trial,less the amount that she would have paid,had the initial settlement not been set aside by the court.
galindo motion for summary judgment.
galindo moved for summary judgment,contending the action was barred by the limitations period of section.galindo asserted that based on laclette own allegations,she discovered facts constituting galindo alleged wrongful acts or omissions no later than january,and sustained actual injury by that same date,when she became obligated to pay ramirez the sum of,instead of the that she would have paid had the initial settlement not been vacated.based on laclette own allegations,laclette had information or circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry,no later than january.
galindo further argued the representation of laclette ended no later than january,in that galindo had no contact with laclette after that date.galindo contended the mere fact the trial court retained jurisdiction over the final settlement did not give rise to a tolling of the statute of limitations.
laclette opposition.
in resisting summary judgment,laclette contended her action against galindo was not barred by the limitations period of section because,as part of the structured settlement,the trial court retained jurisdiction pursuant to section,and because galindo remained attorney of record for laclette,the statute was tolled pursuant to the continuing representation tolling provision of section,subdivision a.
in her responsive separate statement of undisputed facts,laclette acknowledged she had had no contact with galindo since the conclusion of the trial in the underlying action on january.however,laclette argued that although she had been making her payments as agreed,t here are still potential issues that may arise.for example,whether all payments have been made,the amounts of payments,the date of payments,whether ramirez is entitled to an entry of judgment,or laclette is entitled to a dismissal with prejudice.galindo would be directly involved in resolving any such disputes.
