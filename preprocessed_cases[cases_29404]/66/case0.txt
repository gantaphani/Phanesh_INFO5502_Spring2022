petitioner levin suffered injuries as a result of cataract surgery performed at a naval hospital.he filed suit,naming the united states and the surgeon as defendants and asserting,inter alia,a claim of battery,based on his alleged withdrawal of consent to operate shortly before the surgery took place.finding that the surgeon had acted within the scope of his employment,the district court released him and substituted the united states as sole defendant.the government moved to dismiss the battery claim,relying on the ftca intentional tort exception.levin countered that the gonzalez act,in particular,e,renders that exception inapplicable when a plaintiff alleges medical battery by a military physician.the district court granted the government motion to dismiss.affirming,the ninth circuit concluded that e served only to buttress the immunity from personal liability granted military medical personnel in a,and did not negate the ftca intentional tort exception.
held the gonzalez act direction in e abrogates the ftca intentional tort exception and therefore permits levin suit against the united states alleging medical battery by a navy doctor acting within the scope of his employment.
a to determine whether the government immunity is waived for batteries,the court looks to e language,giving the words used their ordinary meaning.moskal united states.levin claims that the operative clause of e,which provides that the ftca intentional tort exception shall not apply to medical malpractice claims,is qualified by the provision introductory clause f or purposes of this section,which confines the operative clause to claims alleging malpractice by personnel in the armed forces and the other agencies specified in the gonzalez act.the government,in contrast,argues that e introductory clause instructs courts to pretend,f or purposes of the gonzalez act,that h does not secure the government against liability for intentional torts,including battery,even though h does provide that shelter.the choice between the parties dueling constructions is not a difficult one.section e operative clause states,in no uncertain terms,that the ftca intentional tort exception,h,shall not apply,and e introductory clause confines the abrogation of h to medical personnel employed by the agencies listed in the gonzalez act.had congress wanted to adopt the government counterfactual interpretation,it could have used more precise language,as it did in c,a subsection adjacent to e.
b under the government interpretation of e,the liability reform act would displace much of the gonzalez act.that reading conflicts with the view the government stated in united states smith.there,the question was whether a person injured abroad due to a military doctor negligence may seek compensation from the doctor in a court,for the ftca gave them no recourse against the government on a claim arising in a foreign country,k.in arguing that such persons also lacked recourse to a suit against the doctor,the government contended that the liability reform act made t he remedy against the united states under the ftca exclusive.b.this interpretation,the government argued,would not override the gonzalez act,which would continue to serve two important functions title f would authorize indemnification of individual military doctors sued abroad where foreign law might govern and the gonzalez act would allow an ftca suit against the united states if the doctor performed a procedure to which the plaintiff did not consent.adopting the government construction,the court held that b grants all federal employees,including medical personnel,immunity for acts within the scope of their employment,even when the ftca provides no remedy against the united states,at.under the government current reading of e,the liability reform act overrides the gonzalez act except in the atypical circumstances in which indemnification of the doctor under f remains possible,while under levin reading,the gonzalez act does just what the government said it did in smith.
c the government attempts to inject ambiguity into e by claiming that,a parallel statute that confers immunity on medical personnel of the department of veterans affairs,expresses congress intent to abrogate h with the unmistakable clarity the gonzalez act lacks.but this court sees nothing dispositively different about the wording of the two provisions,and neither did the government when it argued in the district court that e and f are functionally indistinguishable.

steven alan levin,petitioner united states et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
petitioner steven alan levin,a veteran,suffered injuries as a result of cataract surgery performed at the naval hospital in guam.he asserts that,just prior to the operation,concern about equipment in the operating room led him to withdraw his consent to the surgery.seeking compensation from the united states,levin sued under the federal tort claims act ftca,b,which waives the government sovereign immunity from tort suits,but excepts from the waiver certain intentional torts,including battery,h.levin relied on the gonzalez act,which makes the remedy against the united states under the ftca preclusive of any suit against armed forces medical personnel,a.in the provision at issue in this case,e,the gonzalez act declares that,f or purposes of the act,the intentional tort exception to the ftca shall not apply to any cause of action arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the performance of medical functions.
the government reads e simply to shore up a immunization of medical personnel against tort liability.levin,in contrast,reads e to establish his right to bring a claim of medical battery against the united states under the ftca without encountering the intentional tort exception.the district court for the district of guam,affirmed by the ninth circuit,dismissed levin battery claim based on the reading of the gonzalez act proffered by the government.we find the government reading strained,and levin,far more compatible with the text and purpose of the federal legislation.we therefore reverse the ninth circuit judgment.
the ftca,enacted in,was designed primarily to remove the sovereign immunity of the united states from suits in tort.richards united states.the act gives federal district courts exclusive jurisdiction over claims against the united states for injury or loss of property,or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of federal employees acting within the scope of their employment.b.substantively,the ftca makes the united states liable to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances,under the law of the place where the tort occurred,b,subject to enumerated exceptions to the immunity waiver,a n.the exception relevant in this case is h,which,inter alia,preserves the government immunity from suit on a ny claim arising out of battery.we have referred to h as the intentional tort exception.united states shearer,
originally,the ftca afforded tort victims a remedy against the united states,but did not preclude lawsuits against individual tortfeasors.see henderson blue mink,cadc.judgment against the united states in an ftca action would bar a subsequent action against the federal employee whose conduct gave rise to the claim,but plaintiffs were not obliged to proceed exclusively against the government.they could sue as sole or joint defendants federal employees alleged to have acted tortiously in the course of performing their official duties.
in time,congress enacted a series of statutes designed to shield precisely drawn classes of employees from the threat of personal liability.united states smith.one such measure was the medical malpractice immunity act,stat,passed in and commonly known as the gonzalez act that act,controlling in this case,makes claims against the united states under the ftca the exclusive remedy for injuries resulting from malpractice committed by medical personnel of the armed forces and other specified agencies.a 
a subsection of the gonzalez act key to the issue before us,e,refers to the ftca intentional tort exception.it provides for purposes of this section,the provisions of section h of title shall not apply to any cause of action arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the performance of medical,dental,or related health care functions.section e was patterned on a provision in a statute,enacted six years earlier,that conferred immunity on medical personnel of the public health service.see stat,e ed.for purposes of this section,the provisions of h shall not apply to assault or battery arising out of negligence in the performance of medical functions.targeted immunity statutes enacted around the same time as the gonzalez act similarly shielded medical personnel employed by specific agencies.see supra,at.each such measure contained a provision resembling e.see e for purposes of this section,the provisions of h,shall not apply to any tort enumerated therein arising out of negligence in the furnishing of medical care or related services.f the exception provided in h shall not apply to any claim arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or omission of any person described in subsection a in furnishing medical care or treatment while in the exercise of such person duties in or for the administration.e for purposes of this section,the provisions of h shall not apply to any cause of action arising out of a negligent or wrongful act or omission in the performance of medical functions.
in,departing from the approach,congress enacted comprehensive legislation titled the federal employees liability reform and tort compensation act liability reform act,stat,and often called the westfall act.this embracive measure makes the remedy against the united states under the ftca exclusive for torts committed by federal employees acting within the scope of their employment,b.shielding all federal employees from personal liability without regard to agency affiliation or line of work,the personal immunity provision of the liability reform act tracks the text of a.the comprehensive enactment,however,did not repeal the gonzalez act,smith,at,or,presumably,any of the other laws covering medical personnel employed at particular agencies.unlike the gonzalez act and kindred statutes,the liability reform act does not reference,as e does,the ftca intentional tort exception,h.
the petitioner,steven alan levin,a veteran,was diagnosed with a cataract in his right eye.he sought treatment at the united states naval hospital in guam and was evaluated by lieutenant commander frank bishop,an ophthalmologist serving in the navy.bishop recommended that levin undergo phacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement,a surgical procedure involving extraction of the cataract and insertion of an artificial replacement lens.levin signed forms consenting to the operation,which took place on march.shortly before the surgery began,levin alleges,he orally withdrew his consent twice,but bishop conducted the operation nevertheless.due to complications occurring while the surgery was underway,levin developed corneal edema,a condition that left him with diminished eyesight,discomfort,problems with glare and vision,and in need of ongoing medical treatment.
levin sought compensation for the untoward results of the surgery.after exhausting administrative remedies,he commenced a civil action in the district court for the district of guam.naming the united states and bishop as defendants,levin asserted claims of battery,based on his alleged withdrawal of consent to the surgery,and negligence,based on alleged flaws in bishop performance of the operation.accepting the government representation that bishop was acting within the scope of his employment while performing the surgery,the district court granted the government motion to release bishop and substitute the united states as sole defendant.when levin failed to produce expert testimony in support of his negligence allegations,the court granted the government motion for summary judgment on that claim.
next,the government moved to dismiss the battery claim.the district court no longer had jurisdiction over levin case,the government argued,because the ftca intentional tort exception,h,disallows suits against the united states for battery.levin countered that the gonzalez act,in particular,e,renders the intentional tort exception inapplicable when a plaintiff alleges medical battery by an armed forces physician.the district court rejected levin plea and granted the government motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.app.to pet.for cert.
on appeal to the ninth circuit,levin did not question the adverse judgment on his negligent performance claim,but he renewed the argument that the battery claim,based on his alleged withdrawal of consent,survived.that was so,he maintained,because e negated h,the ftca intentional tort exception.the court of appeals thought levin construction of the gonzalez act plausible,but not the best reading of the statute.as perceived by the ninth circuit,e had a limited office,serving only to buttress the immunity from personal liability granted military medical personnel in a.c lever tort plaintiffs,the court conjectured,might argue in future cases that because the ftca does not authorize battery claims against the united states,such claims may be asserted against military doctors notwithstanding a.ibid.section e foreclosed that argument,but the provision did nothing more,the court concluded.satisfied that e served the dominant purpose of the gonzalez act to immunize covered medical personnel against malpractice liability and did not unequivocally waive the united states sovereign immunity from battery claims,the ninth circuit affirmed the district court disposition 
we granted certiorari,recognizing that courts of appeals have divided on the question whether the controlling provision of the gonzalez act,e,authorizes battery claims against the united states when military doctors operate without the patient consent.compare,at case below,with keir united states,e waives sovereign immunity for battery suits alleging malpractice by military medical personnel and lojuk quandt,same.see also franklin united states,f,concerning department of veterans affairs medical personnel,includes an essentially identical counterpart to e,which similarly nullif ies h and thereby ex
