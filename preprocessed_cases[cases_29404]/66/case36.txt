juan segarra asks that we remand for an evidentiary hearing on his asserted right to withdraw his guilty plea.segarra premises this entreaty on the ground that he was entitled,under the sixth amendment,to be represented at his hearing by counsel.for all practical purposes,that rule is ironclad the question here is whether the district court,when faced with a colorable claim of an actual conflict of interest,should have invoked that rule.concluding,as we do,that the court acted in derogation of segarra sixth amendment rights by proceeding as it did,we remand for further factfinding consistent with this opinion.
we rehearse here only those facts necessary to place this appeal into perspective.on august,a federal grand jury,in a superseding indictment,charged segarra with conspiracy to distribute of controlled substances.see a.the thrust of that count was that segarra managed and supervised a booming business in the sale of drugs at a housing project in juncos,puerto rico.the superseding indictment also contained a second derivative count seeking criminal forfeiture.
after some preliminary skirmishing,not relevant here,segarra pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment pursuant to a written plea agreement the agreement.see.c a b.the instant appeal concerns the circumstances surrounding segarra decision to plead guilty and his subsequent endeavors to withdraw his guilty plea.
during the relevant time frame,attorney rafael anglada represented segarra by appointment of the district court on august,anglada visited segarra in prison and secured his signature on the agreement.a hearing,held the next day,proceeded without incident.in pertinent part,segarra,through an interpreter,confirmed that he understood both the nature of the charges and the consequences of confessing guilt to them.he stated that he had entered into the agreement of his own accord and without pressure from anyone that he had discussed the terms of the agreement with his attorney before signing it and that he was satisfied with anglada representation.
on december,segarra initiated a series of pro se motions aimed at vitiating his plea.he claimed that he had not been fully informed of the consequences of pleading guilty and that his entry into the agreement was neither knowing nor voluntary to the contrary,he signed the agreement and responded on cue during the colloquy only because anglada had coerced and manipulated him.
with respect to this claim,segarra offered a number of particulars.he asserted,for example,that anglada took advantage of his lack of education,his inability to speak english,and his debilitated physical and mental condition.he also asserted that,during anglada prison visit,the lawyer had insisted that he would not leave but had to come away with the a greement signed.in order to ensure segarra acquiescence,anglada ambushed him with a surprise visit from his wife,yolanda vega,whom segarra had not seen in three months.vega,convalescing in a wheelchair,allegedly implored segarra through a veil of tears to follow anglada lead.segarra further noted that anglada had not performed the rudimentary preparatory work needed to try the case and,thus,was adamantly unreceptive to segarra insistence on a jury trial.finally,segarra charged that anglada had concealed exculpatory evidence from the court.as a result of these foibles,segarra stated,he signed the agreement and went through the colloquy in a state of confusion.
in response to segarra allegations,anglada filed a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing on the request.in that motion,anglada admitted that,after entering the plea,segarra repeatedly beseeched him anglada to move to set it aside.anglada had not,however,heeded his client wishes.
the district court considered segarra serial motions on january,without convening an evidentiary hearing.at that time,segarra submitted a signed statement that a fellow inmate had helped him draft.that statement reiterated much of what he had disclosed in his pro se motions,including his claims that anglada had concealed exculpatory evidence and manipulated him into signing the agreement.in its peroration,segarra statement declared 
i have never accepted the agreement that counsel anglada made me sign.counsel anglada never brought me the evidence in the case and i always insisted to counsel anglada on my desire to go to trial.counsel anglada merely limited himself to put undue pressure so that i would sign,so much so that he brought my wife,yolanda vega,in the conditions that i have already reported 
segarra also requested that the district court appoint new counsel to represent him at the hearing and thereafter throughout the case.
faced with this statement and request,the district court solicited comments from both the prosecutor and anglada.the prosecutor argued that the attempted plea withdrawal constituted no more than sparked by what seemed likely to be a stiff sentence.for his part,anglada insisted that he had explained the agreement fully to segarra in spanish and that segarra had understood him.he maintained that his sole contact with vega had been the receipt of desperate telephone calls from her.he also suggested that video cameras at the prison would bear out the absurdity of the charge of coercion.while he conceded that he had been unresponsive to segarra persistent instructions that he seek to vitiate the plea,he explained that he had hoped to persuade his client not to pursue such a course.
anglada proceeded to disparage segarra stated basis for retraction of the plea,indicating to the court that segarra had understood the nature and consequences of his actions.he even pointed out that segarra,in his pro se motions,had failed to assert his innocence.he then stated cryptically that he wished he could call vega and segarra brothers as witnesses because they would know whether segarra is guilty or not.
in a written rescript,the district court denied segarra motions to withdraw his guilty plea and for new counsel.see united states,crim,unpublished.following the imposition of a incarcerative sentence,by new this timely appeal.
the lower court rescript focused on whether segarra should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea.in our view,this focus puts the cart before the horse.there is a logically antecedent question was segarra entitled to representation by counsel other than anglada at the hearing if he was,then his request for the appointment of new counsel should have been the failure to honor it would cast doubt upon the validity of the record on which the district court ruled.consequently,we start with this antecedent question.
the sixth amendment guarantees that,in all felony cases,an accused has a right to the assistance of counsel.const.amend.vi.unless knowingly and intelligently waived,this right attaches at every critical stage of the criminal process.iowa tovar,d.the entry of a guilty plea is one such critical stage,see id.at,and a hearing is another,see united states,cir.
here,segarra sixth amendment challenge,as presented to the district court,had two related but conceptually distinct aspects.one aspect rested upon an argument that counsel performed ineffectively or incompetently.see,strickland washington,d.that aspect is not pursued on this appeal and,in all events,is not properly before us.claims of ineffective assistance of counsel simpliciter,including claims of substandard performance,are routinely adjudicated in collateral proceedings.see united states,cir see also.while there are exceptions to this praxis,see,united states theodore,cir united states natanel,cir,segarra makes no developed argument supporting the applicability of any such exception here.
the remaining aspect of segarra sixth amendment challenge is of a different genre.in mounting this attack,segarra does not rely upon allegations of attorney ineffectiveness or incompetence per se rather,he maintains that anglada concealed exculpatory evidence and manipulated him into signing the agreement in order to avoid a trial for which he the lawyer had neglected to prepare.if segarra allegations are matter on which we take no anglada would have had a very real incentive,at the stage,to cove
