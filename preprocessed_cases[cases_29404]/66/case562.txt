in this unusual medical malpractice case,both physician and patient were doctors.each claimed the other was negligent,and a jury agreed both were.as the jury assessed slightly more fault to the plaintiff percent than the defendant percent,the trial court entered a judgment 
a divided court of appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial,disregarding the finding of the plaintiff negligence because laymen generally have no duty to volunteer information during medical treatment but the plaintiff here was not a layman,and jurors judging his actions could consider his expertise,especially as he emphasized it throughout the trial.because there was some evidence the plaintiff doctor failed to report a critical symptom when he should have,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and reinstate the jury verdict.
background 
this suit was brought by david axelrad,a psychiatrist,against richard jackson,an internist.like the court of appeals,we will refer only to the latter by his title to avoid confusion.
after months of intermittent abdominal cramps and diarrhea,axelrad sought treatment from jackson after an abrupt onset of acute pain.jackson prescribed a laxative and enema for fecal impaction.as it turned out,axelrad was suffering from diverticulitis.it is undisputed an enema should not be prescribed in such circumstances due to the risk of a perforated colon.
returning home,axelrad followed his doctor orders and immediately felt severe abdominal pain with nausea,rigors,and chills.his wife took him to an emergency room,and he was hospitalized for further testing.based on those tests,another doctor operated two days later for what was thought to be appendicitis,but turned out to be diverticulitis and a perforated colon.a portion of the colon was removed and a temporary colostomy constructed.axelrad subsequent course of treatment included surgery to reconnect the colon,complicated by a severe drug reaction.
while the foregoing is undisputed,the parties disagree about much else,including what medical history axelrad reported,when colon perforation occurred,whether it was caused by axelrad disease or jackson treatment,why jackson did not come to the emergency room,and whether axelrad course would have been different had jackson treatment been different.but the only conflict relevant to this appeal is the first.although he alleged several grounds of contributory negligence at trial jackson now argues only that the court of appeals erred in disregarding evidence supporting axelrad neglected to report where his abdominal pain began.
the evidence showed that particular diseases are associated with pain in particular places in the disease in the right upper quadrant,appendicitis in the right lower quadrant,and diverticulitis in the left lower quadrant.while conceding a patient with diverticulitis should not be treated with enemas,jackson testified he did not suspect diverticulitis as it is normally associated with fever,constipation,and pain in the left lower quadrant,while axelrad reported no fever,diarrhea,and pain throughout his abdomen.
a patient can not,of course,be negligent because his symptoms fail to fit the usual pattern.but at trial,axelrad insisted he told jackson his pain started in the left lower quadrant.the latter flatly denied it,and argued axelrad made this claim for the first time at trial.in none of the histories taken by medical personnel during his treatment did axelrad ever report that his pain began in the left lower quadrant,nor did he say so at his pretrial deposition.
it was up to the jurors to resolve this conflict in the testimony.but as the issues were submitted in broad form,how they decided it depends on what presumption applies when jurors issue a split verdict like they did here.
ii.presumptions concerning a split verdict 
as we said in city of keller wilson,when there are conflicts in testimony we must presume jurors decided all of them in favor of the verdict if reasonable human beings could do so.but we also noted that evidence may support one part of a verdict but not another.here,one version that axelrad reported where his pain began supports the verdict against jackson,while the other version that he did not supports the verdict against axelrad.reasonable jurors could not have believed either did or did not report where his pain began.but because either answer would support part of the verdict,which one must we presume jurors believed 
the answer turns on the purpose of the presumption.it is not a prediction about what jurors actually did,as they often do not decide all conflicts one way.here,for example,each party asserted several reasons why the other was negligent,so jurors did not have to agree on any one reason so long as they agreed on the result 
instead,the presumption serves to protect jury verdicts from on appeal.as a result,it operates in favor of any jury finding a litigant asks an appellate court to set aside.here,the court of appeals set aside only one jury axelrad was negligent.to ensure that the appellate court did not substitute its own judgment for that of the jury,we must presume the jury decided all conflicts in favor of this finding 
there are some cases in which this general rule will not apply.courts can not presume findings in favor of one part of a verdict if doing so creates an irreconcilable conflict with another but that is not the case here,as there was evidence jackson was negligent even if axelrad failed to report all his symptoms.accordingly,we must presume jurors found axelrad did not report where his abdominal pain began.
iii.do patients have a duty to cooperate in diagnosis 
we have never addressed whether a patient failure to give an accurate medical history can constitute negligence.but in elbaor smith,we recognized a duty of cooperation which patients owe treating physicians who assume the duty to care for them.there,we held the plaintiff refusal to take prescribed antibiotics should have been submitted as a question of contributory negligence,not just a failure to mitigate damages while elbaor concerned cooperation with treatment rather than diagnosis,nothing in the opinion suggests a patient duty to cooperate applies to only one aspect of medical care.
a medical history,like many aspects of health care,is a cooperative venture requiring active participation by both doctor and patient.a patient statements to a doctor are critical,so critical they are protected by a privilege and made an exception to the hearsay rule in most cases,medical care will never even occur unless patients present themselves for treatment and say what hurts.patients have no duty to diagnose themselves as doctors are licensed and paid to do that,but neither can they demand treatment for a condition they refuse to disclose.all the trial experts agreed patients have a duty to cooperate in diagnosis by giving an accurate medical history.
of course,there are cases in which a patient condition is so obvious that cooperation is unnecessary,or so debilitating that it is impossible.but such cases do not suggest there should be no duty to cooperate they suggest only that a patient condition may discharge it.like any standard,a patient duty to cooperate requires only ordinary care under all the surrounding circumstances 
the court of appeals attempted to limit a patient duty to cooperate in diagnosis to two instances responding truthfully to a physician questions,and volunteering information known to be both significant and unknown to the doctor while we agree a patient duty of cooperation could arise in those situations,we do not think it can be limited to them.
we have rejected similar efforts to compartmentalize negligence in rigid categories.for example,we have discarded categories like,and in favor of a general submission of comparative negligence in products cases,we have refused to limit all allegations of a plaintiff negligence to assumption of the risk or mere failure to discover a defect,as other kinds of negligence can fall in between 
given the infinite variety of patients,diseases,and circumstances surrounding medical care,an exhaustive list defining a patient duty to cooperate can not be made.the spe
