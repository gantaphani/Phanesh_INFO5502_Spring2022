the principal issue in this legal malpractice case is whether the jury needed expert testimony to determine whether the client would have prevailed in an underlying trial but for its attorneys alleged negligence in preparing and trying the case.the trial court concluded that the jury needed such guidance to determine causation.there being none,the court disregarded the jury findings on causation and rendered judgment that the client take nothing.concluding that expert testimony was not needed because the connection between the attorneys negligence and the client loss was obvious,the court of appeals reversed and remanded.we disagree that the causal connection was either obvious or a matter within the common understanding of lay persons.because we conclude that there is no competent evidence to connect the client damages to its attorneys negligence,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment that the client take nothing.
mario turtur and his two sons,steve and chris,are brokers with turtur associates,turtur,a securities firm.lee mckellar owns and operates mckellar ranch,a cattle business.in,turtur agreed with mckellar ranch to be the exclusive marketer of two investments donor cow interests and cattle embryo transplants.although the parties had disagreements about the investment program,turtur continued to market it through.
in,turtur sued mckellar ranch and mckellar,alleging fraud and breach of contract in state court and claiming damages of about.mckellar ranch counterclaimed for fraud,misrepresentation,and breach of fiduciary duty.mckellar ranch thereafter sought bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of texas,staying the state court proceeding.turtur claims against mckellar ranch were severed and made a part of an adversary proceeding in the bankruptcy court the claims against mckellar remained in state court.
joe reynolds,a houston attorney,and john hardy,a tyler bankruptcy attorney,initially represented turtur in the bankruptcy court.after obtaining a continuance,reynolds withdrew as counsel,compelling turtur to look for a new lead trial attorney.about two months before the rescheduled adversary proceeding was to begin trial in tyler,turtur hired the houston law firm of alexander mcevily to represent it,paying a retainer of with the understanding that name partner tom alexander would be lead counsel.judy mingledorff,a new associate at the firm,was assigned to help prepare the case.hardy continued to serve as local counsel.
on june,two days before the adversary proceeding was to begin,alexander appeared for a docket call in harris county state district court and announced ready for trial.the district judge set this case to begin trial the next day.on june,mingledorff filed a motion for continuance in the bankruptcy court based on alexander assignment for trial in state court.mckellar ranch opposed the motion,and the judge denied the continuance.the case proceeded to trial with mingledorff and hardy representing turtur.
by order,the court limited the trial of the adversary proceeding to two days.despite the short trial,the court considered the matter for over two years before rendering its decision on july.by this time,alexander no longer represented turtur,primarily because of a dispute over whether alexander was entitled to keep the retainer since he had been unable to try the adversary proceeding himself.
in its judgment,the bankruptcy court concluded that both turtur and mckellar ranch had breached certain parts of their agreements and that turtur had committed fraud as well.mckellar ranch predominantly prevailed and was awarded net damages of.in a subsequent settlement,turtur paid mckellar and dropped its state court claim against mckellar individually to set this judgment aside.
three months later,turtur brought this suit against alexander and his firm for malpractice,claiming that their negligence proximately caused its loss in the bankruptcy court trial.turtur also alleged breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract and asserted that it was entitled to damages of not less than and to recoup in attorneys fees paid to the defendants.thereafter,turtur amended its pleadings to claim violations of several provisions of the deceptive trade practices act.see.bus.the amended pleadings also added mario,chris,and steve turtur as plaintiffs but did not otherwise identify any claim distinct from those asserted by turtur.the trial court granted special exceptions to the amended petition and ordered the plaintiff to replead to drop the turturs,individually,from this lawsuit,and to specify the maximum amount of damages being claimed in this lawsuit.
in response to these special exceptions,turtur filed its second amended petition alleging that the defendants negligence and statutory violations caused it in damages.plaintiffs second amended petition also dropped chris turtur as a plaintiff,but left mario and steve turtur as plaintiffs,asserting for the first time a claim specific to them.the amended pleading identified mario and steve turtur as successors in interest,the turtur family partnership with respect to their interests in donor cow interests and certain cattle in the possession of mckellar ranch,in the summer of.the turturs alleged that alexander and his firm had cost the partnership million in lost profits by negligently authorizing the sale of these cattle in.concluding that the partnership claim was barred by limitations,the trial court granted defendants motion for partial summary judgment,leaving only turtur legal malpractice and dtpa claims for trial.
at trial,the jury found in favor of turtur on both theories,awarding over million in damages.the trial court denied turtur motion to amend its petition to conform to the award,but it granted alexander and his firm motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the grounds that plaintiff had presented no evidence of causation or damages.turtur,along with mario and steve turtur,appealed the trial court judgment.
the court of appeals affirmed the summary judgment against the turturs on the partnership claim,but it reversed the judgment for alexander and his firm on the legal malpractice and dtpa claims,remanding to the trial court with instructions to conform the jury award of damages to turtur pleadings.at.both alexander and his firm and the turturs petitioned this court for review.
to prevail on a legal malpractice claim,a plaintiff must show that the attorney owed the plaintiff a duty,the attorney breached that duty,the breach proximately caused the plaintiff injuries,and damages occurred.peeler hughes luce.when the plaintiff allegation is that some failure on the attorney part caused an adverse result in prior litigation,the plaintiff must produce evidence from which a jury may reasonably infer that the attorney conduct caused the damages alleged.haynes boone bowser bouldin.to prevail on a claim under the dtpa,a plaintiff must prove that a violation of the statute was a producing cause of the injury.bus.a.while different,both producing cause and proximate cause require proof of causation in fact.union pump allbritton.in this court,alexander and his firm contest only the jury findings of causation and damages.
the court of appeals held that the evidence of causation was legally sufficient,parsing through these facts to establish that,but for the negligence of alexander and his firm,the result in the adversary proceeding would have been more favorable to turtur 
alexander,an experienced civil trial lawyer,agreed to personally try and oversee the preparation of the turturs case but did not follow through with his agreement.
mingledorff,a new associate and former assistant district attorney with no civil trial or bankruptcy court experience,instead acted as lead trial attorney.
at the adversary proceeding,mingledorf called only two witnesses,mario and chris turtur.mingledorff did not adequately prepare mario for his testimony.she did not call steve turtur,although he was available and was the turtur most knowledgeable about the dealings with mckellar.
mingledorff direct examination of mario turtur covers only pages in the reporter record whereas his testimony at the malpractice trial runs pages.steve turtur testimony at the malpractice trial covers pages.
mingledorff did not review some documents produced by mckellar prior to trial,which the turturs expert testified was negligence.the expert also testified that alexander was negligent in turning over a complex bankruptcy matter in a civil case to mingledorff,who had been prosecuting criminal cases for the past several years.
mingledorff did not depose or call as witnesses at the adversary proceeding at least other witnesses who could have given relevant,favorable testimony for the turturs.the turturs expert agreed that this was negligence to the extent that these witnesses had relevant information that may have been critical to proving the turturs claims.
mingledorff did not know how to a deposition and as a result may have failed to read into evidence relevant testimony from a deposition.
mingledorff was not prepared to try the adversary proceeding because she never expected to try the case.
at.based on this evidence,the court of appeals remanded the case for the trial court to render judgment for turtur.id.at.the court subsequently overruled alexander and his firm motion for rehearing en banc,with two justices dissenting.id.at taft radack,jj.dissenting.
alexander and his firm argue here that the facts recited by the court of appeals are not evidence that they caused turtur to lose in the adversary proceeding.they note that the jury was asked to decide a complicated and very subjective causation issue whether,in reasonable probability,a bankruptcy judge would have decided the underlying adversary proceeding differently if alexander had personally tried the case or if he or mingledorff had introduced other evidence.to understand whether any of the omitted evidence would have made a difference,alexander and his firm submit,the jury required some guidance about how the omitted evidence was different from,and more compelling than,the evidence and testimony presented at the adversary proceeding.moreover,since the bankruptcy judge allotted only two days for trial,both sides had to make difficult choices about what evidence to offer lay jurors might not appreciate the legal considerations in making these selections.given these circumstances,alexander and his firm assert that the jury was not competent to decide,without resort to expert testimony,whether the result of the underlying adversary proceeding would have been different but for the alleged malpractice.
turtur responds that the jury did not need any expert help because causation was obvious.while the underlying commercial case was complex,that was precisely why turtur hired alexander.instead of an experienced and successful litigator,it ended up with a new associate with no civil litigation experience who,through a lack of supervision and her own inexperience,made a series of mistakes in the preparation and trial of its case.turtur concludes that the sheer number of errors made by counsel in the preparation and trial of the underlying adversary proceeding make causation obvious here.
breach of the standard of care and causation are separate inquiries,however,and an abundance of evidence as to one can not substitute for a deficiency of evidence as to the other.thus,even when negligence is admitted,causation is not presumed.haynes boone,at.moreover,the trier of fact must have some basis for understanding the causal link between the attorney negligence and the client harm,at see also ronald mallen jeffrey smith,legal malpractice at ed.in some cases the client testimony may provide this link,but in others the connection may be beyond the jury common understanding and require expert testimony.see evid.testimony by experts.as one authority observes 
a failure of proof can result if expert testimony is limited to whether the defendant violated the standard of care.proof of causation of injury often requires expert testimony concerning what the attorney should have done under the circumstances.the expert testimony must be tied to the specific conduct that is in issue.
mallen smith at.
the court of appeals cited two cases,delp douglas,worth,rev on other grounds,and streber hunter,cir,as examples of malpractice actions that did not require expert testimony on causation.at.neither case,however,involved trial malpractice.in both cases the clients themselves were the key decisionmakers,relying upon their attorney advice with unfortunate consequences.under these circumstances,the courts in delp and streber found sufficient the clients testimony that,because of their lawyers bad advice,they made the decisions and took the actions that resulted in their injuries.see delp,at streber,at.in contrast,the decisionmaker here was the bankruptcy judge,who quite properly was not asked to,and did not,testify as to how he might have ruled if the case had been presented differently.without expert testimony,the jury had no direct evidence explaining the legal significance of the omitted evidence.
legal malpractice may include an attorney failure to exercise ordinary care in preparing,managing,and presenting litigation.see zidell bird,no writ.but d ecisions of which witnesses to call,what testimony to obtain or when to almost invariably are matters of judgment.mallen smith at.as such,the wisdom and consequences of these kinds of tactical choices made during litigation are generally matters beyond the ken of most jurors.and when the causal link is beyond the jury common understanding,expert testimony is necessary.see arce burrow,dist,aff in part,rev in part on other grounds,delp,at see also kranis scott,d,expert testimony on causation required unless connection within factfinder ordinary experience samuel hepworth,nungester lezamiz,idaho,expert testimony on proximate cause is required when the issue is not one that lay persons are competent to make dean tucker,expert witness usually required to establish causation sommers mckinney,expert testimony usually required when adequacy of an investigation or soundness of an opinion at issue sanders smith,expert needed when inquiry involves complexities of trial practice meyer mulligan,expert testimony on proximate cause is required when the issue is not one that lay persons are competent to make but see whitley chamouris,expert testimony not needed when malpractice action involves case within a case.
in another case involving allegations of trial malpractice and omitted evidence,the oregon supreme court observed 
since plaintiff,to prevail in this malpractice case,had to convince the trier of fact in the malpractice suit that the result in the earlier trial would have been favorable to her had her lawyer introduced the two documents in question,we know of no other way in which the jury could have been guided in determining the causation issue than the presentation of opinion by properly qualified experts.
shields campbell,or.and the supreme court of maine has stated that without competent expert testimony in a trial malpractice case demonstrating that the result of the underlying proceeding would have been different but for the alleged negligence,the factfinder would be compelled to speculate as to proximate causation.corey norman,hanson detroy,me.likewise,we conclude on this record that the errors allegedly made by mingledorff in the preparation and trial of the admittedly complex,yet truncated,underlying proceeding were not so obviously tied to the adverse result as to obviate the need for expert testimony.we therefore conclude that the court of appeals erred in holding that the jury was competent to determine causation in either negligence or violation of the dtpa without expert guidance in this case.
turtur argues,in the alternative,that it submitted expert testimony on causation through steve peterson,an attorney who testified on the standard of care and gave his opinion about the negligence of alexander and mingledorff.peterson testified that alexander was negligent in failing to participate in the case and supervise mingledorff and that he and his firm were negligent in turning the complex bankruptcy proceeding over to mingle
