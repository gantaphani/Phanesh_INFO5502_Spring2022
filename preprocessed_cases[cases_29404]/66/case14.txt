these appeals call to mind that the law normally ministers to the vigilant,not to those who sleep upon perceptible rights.the tale follows.
these appeals trace their genesis to a suit brought by a massachusetts corporation and its principals,citizens of massachusetts,against their quondam accountant and his firm.their complaint alleged that the defendants negligently advised them to file amended corporate and personal tax returns that had the effect of substantially increasing the principals tax liability and destabilizing the company.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants but rejected their request for attorneys fees.both sides appeal.after careful consideration of a scumbled record,we leave the parties where we found them.
background 
we briefly rehearse the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs who opposed summary judgment below.see rared manchester nh,llc rite aid of,cir.
rtr technologies,rtr or the company is a subchapter s corporation,see,which develops heating and systems for the rail and mass transit industries.rosalie berger is the company owner and president.her husband,craig,is the company director of marketing and sales.at the times material hereto,rosalie and craig berger filed joint income tax returns.
rtr commenced operations in and in that year began making loans to rosalie berger.it continued doing so throughout the,even as the corporation itself received two loans backed by the united states small business administration sba totaling.
by the end of,rtr balance sheet reflected more than in loans to rosalie berger and approximately in overdue debts to its suppliers.that fall,the company nearly collapsed in the economic downturn that followed the terrorist attacks of september,a major customer curtailed a order and rtr proved unable to pay either its trade creditors or its taxes on a current basis.in october,the company sought help from the sba,which extended a direct disaster loan of,subject to the condition that rtr not make any distribution or any advance,directly or indirectly by way of loan,gift,bonus or otherwise to its principals,employees,or related entities.
the company did not adhere to this condition yet,when it was unable to keep its loan payments current,it sought still more money from the sba.the sba denied this request,explaining that rtr continued to loan the principals funds that represent ed valuable financial resources which could have been applied to the recovery effort following the disaster.the sba did agree,however,to enter into a forbearance agreement with rtr,which among other conditions required the company to hire a turnaround manager.
in september of about two months after the forbearance agreement,rtr retained carlton helming,a certified public accountant,and his firm,helming a connecticut professional services corporation.although initially hired as a turnaround specialist,helming eventually took over tax preparation for rtr and the bergers as well.
over the next two years,he grew increasingly concerned about rtr balance sheet he repeatedly told both rosalie berger and rtr general manager that he doubted that the transfers to rosalie berger could be regarded as bona fide loans for tax purposes.to cure this problem,helming recommended that rtr and the bergers amend their corporate and personal tax returns to reclassify the approximately at issue as income to rosalie berger.irony is no stranger to the law part of the reason why helming wanted to amend the previous returns rather than simply change the tax treatment of the transfers going forward was to make it easier for rtr to bring a malpractice suit against its previous accountant.
rosalie berger was dismayed with helming advice and sought second opinions from two tax attorneys.one apparently provided little insight into the matter the other at least partially shared helming concern.nevertheless,rosalie berger eventually followed helming recommendation amended corporate and personal tax returns were filed in december and january,respectively.
the internal revenue service irs accepted the amended returns and issued a deficiency assessment in may.two months later,the irs lodged a tax lien of more than against the bergers.
over time,the bergers paid more than in additional taxes,interest,penalties.the plaintiffs contend that the amended returns had other adverse consequences as well.specifically,they point out that by reclassifying the transfers to rosalie berger as salary payments,the net profit previously reflected on rtr books was transmogrified into a net loss of nearly.they posit that reporting such a loss prevented rtr from securing bid and performance bonds and,thus,not only put certain business opportunities beyond its reach but also destabilized the business financially.
notwithstanding this loss of equilibrium,the plaintiffs continued to retain helming as their accountant he prepared their corporate and personal tax returns for,and.it was not until that the plaintiffs replaced helming with a new accountant,edward szwyd.
rosalie berger avers that she engaged szwyd in part because she hoped that he would be able to reverse the amendment of the returns and reclassify rtr transfers to her as loans.szwyd agreed to adhere to this game plan and,in october,rtr and the bergers filed corporate and personal tax returns.the irs accepted the returns and abated the lien and sundry penalties,although some state tax liability issues have yet to be resolved.
in october of,the plaintiffs sued the defendants in a massachusetts state court.they claimed that helming advice to amend the tax returns was negligent and that following it resulted in substantially increased tax liabilities and lost profits.their complaint charged malpractice,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,breach of fiduciary duty,negligent misrepresentation,and unfair trade practices.the defendants,citing diversity of citizenship and the existence of a controversy in the requisite amount,removed the action to the federal district court.see a.
following pretrial discovery,plethoric briefing,and oral argument,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants.rtr,helming,d.the court concluded that the tort and contract claims were and that the unfair trade practices claim was deficient because it did not allege the requisite level of dishonesty,fraud,or deceit.see id.at.the court subsequently denied the defendants motion for attorneys fees.these timely appeals ensued.
ii.discussion 
we subdivide our analysis into three segments.we look to massachusetts for the governing law.see erie tompkins.rared manchester,at.
tort and contract claims.
we start with the question of timeliness.in the circumstances of this case,this question is confined to the plaintiffs tort and contract claims that is,all of the plaintiffs claims except their unfair trade practices claim.our review of the lower court ruling is de novo.houlton citizens coal.town of houlton,cir.
generally speaking,the limitations period in massachusetts is three years for tort claims.laws ch,and six years for contract claims,id.but where,as here,claims sounding variously in tort and contract are premised on a common factual nucleus,the controlling principle is that limitation statutes should apply equally to similar facts regardless of the form of proceeding.hendrickson sears.in harmony with this principle,the massachusetts legislature has decreed that the limitations period shall apply to all a ctions of contract or tort for malpractice,error or mistake against certified public accountants.laws ch.the conclusion is inescapable,therefore,that a limitations period applies to the entirety of the tort and contract claims asserted here 
the plaintiffs primary argument is that their suit is timeous because their causes of action accrued less than three years before they sued.typically,a plaintiff cause of action accrues when she is injured.see,flannery flannery,when contract is breached joseph fortin.hous.fin.agency,when tort occurs.here,however,helming allegedly wrongful conduct occurred some three years and nine months before the suit was commenced the amended corporate return was filed with the irs in december and the amended personal return was filed with the irs the next month.the most serious tax consequences followed hot on the heels of these filings and transpired more than three years before the commencement of suit the irs assessed a tax deficiency against the bergers in may of and entered a tax lien on july.
in an effort to subvert the force of this chronology,the plaintiffs embrace the discovery rule.that rule,in its massachusetts iteration,holds that a cause of action accrues,and the statute of limitations begins to run,when a plaintiff knows or reasonably should know that she may have been harmed by a defendant conduct,even if the harm actually occurred earlier.see bowen eli lilly.the plaintiffs asseverate that they did not know nor should they have known that they had been harmed by the defendants actions until august of,when their new accountant szwyd agreed to the returns and once again classify the transfers to rosalie berger as loans.
this asseveration has a certain appeal,at least in the abstract.an accountant,like an attorney or a doctor,is an expert,whereas a client is not,and generally a client can neither be expected to recognize professional negligence if he sees it nor be expected to watch over the professional or to retain a second professional to do so.kennedy goffstein,quoting hendrickson,at internal quotation marks omitted.a plaintiff may be aware that her tax bill was high,her lawsuit was dismissed,or her surgical recovery was painful,but not be on notice that someone may have caused her injury.bowen,at.absent some warning sign,people ordinarily are not expected to assume that undesirable outcomes are the result of negligent or otherwise wrongful acts or omissions attributable to their accountants,attorneys,or physicians.
but when we move from the abstract to the facts at hand,we are compelled to reject the plaintiffs argument.the discovery rule properly pertains only to those plaintiffs whose injuries are inherently unknowable.patsos first albany,internal quotation marks omitted.a plaintiff need not know the extent of the injury or know that the defendant was negligent for the cause of action to accrue.williams ely.she simply must know that she sustained appreciable harm as a result of the defendant conduct.id.in other words,the running of the statute of limitations is delayed while the facts,as distinguished from the legal theory for the cause of action,remain inherently unknowable to the injured party.catrone thoroughbred racing ass ns of,cir quoting gore daniel sons.
in this instance,warning signs abounded.moreover,the plaintiffs were aware of all the critical facts by july of.helming had advised them to undertake a course of action that resulted in the entry of a tax lien of more than half a million dollars.at that point,both the plaintiffs harm and the cause of that harm were pellucid,even if the precise claims that they could and ultimately did pursue against the defendants were not.
to be sure,this would be a different case if the plaintiffs believed all along that the prodigious lien that had been entered against them was an unavoidable consequence of complying with their tax obligations until szwyd informed them otherwise.but the plaintiffs harbored no such sanguine belief.the record makes manifest that rosalie berger sought out szwyd because she already believed and had believed virtually from day one that helming advice was wrong.she explained in her deposition that she contacted szwyd because she did agree with amending the returns to begin with.she added that she had signed the amended returns under duress and it was very,very damaging to my company,and i thought to inquire with a professional to see if i had the privilege of.
this was not all.rosalie berger said at other points in her deposition that even before the irs lodged its lien,she had concluded that helming advice to amend the returns was poorly thought out and was probably some of the poorest advice i could have possibly taken.she further vouchsafed that,even though she was not a tax professional,she knew that amending the returns was not the right approach.these statements leave no doubt but that the plaintiffs knew,before july of,that of the returns was a dicey proposition.what is more,there is nothing to suggest that,between july of and october of,any new and material information came to their attention.
if more were needed,we note that rosalie berger disagreement with helming advice was so profound that szwyd was the third professional from whom she sought another opinion.as recounted above,she had obtained advice from two other independent tax professionals even before signing the amended returns.
the knowledge possessed by rosalie berger and evidenced by her statements and actions is more than enough to render the discovery rule inapposite.the ultimate arbiter of massachusetts law,the supreme judicial court sjc,previously addressed a strikingly similar situation.it held that a client could not invoke the discovery rule to toll the statute of limitations on a negligence claim against his former attorneys beyond the date on which he had concluded that they did know what they were doing.lyons nutt,internal quotation marks omitted see frank cooke,hurwitz,explaining that the discovery rule does not apply beyond the time when plaintiff was informed that defendant was not competent to render investment advice.in diversity jurisdiction,we are bound to accept state substantive law as formulated by the state highest court,see rared manchester,at,and there is no justification for us to apply the discovery rule more liberally than did the sjc in lyons.
the plaintiffs try to attack the district court resolution of the timeliness question from a number of angles.their attacks generate more heat than light.
to begin,the plaintiffs maintain that summary judgment was inappropriate because a massachusetts court has observed that the accrual date of a malpractice action against a tax preparer is a question of fact rather than a question of law.see kennedy,at.the cited statement,however,presupposes that the plaintiff has proffered evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact anent the accrual date.see doe creighton,holding that,even though the discovery rule typically raises fact issue,summary judgment is properly granted where the plaintiff did not demonstrate a reasonable expectation of proving that her suit was timely filed.here,the facts show with conspicuous clarity that the plaintiffs knew of the claimed error,its cause,and the resulting harm more than three years before they sued.
next,the plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in suggesting that their causes of action accrued even before the amended returns were filed but the plaintiffs are tilting at windmills whatever the merits of the district court suggestion a matter on which we take no view that suggestion is superfluous.what counts is the court conclusion that the plaintiffs causes of action accrued no later than july.whether or not they may have accrued earlier is of no moment.see houlton citizens,at.
the plaintiffs final foray is an attempt to spin rosalie berger consultations with independent experts in their favor.in the last analysis,this amounts to little more than a endeavor to turn straw into gold.
along these lines,the plaintiffs argue that the statute of limitations is tolled when a plaintiff acts diligently in retaining an expert to search for an injury and the expert fails to detect it.this argument misreads our decision in cambridge plating napco,cir,which stands for the proposition that the mere hiring of an expert does not automatically start the limitations clock.see id.at.the decision does not stand for the materially different proposition that an expert failure to discover an error automatically tolls the limitations period.the latter proposition is untenable.united states kubrick,d holding,under federal tort claims act,that if a plaintiff is incorrectly advised that he does not have a claim,that advice does not toll the statute of limitations.to be sure,cambridge pla
