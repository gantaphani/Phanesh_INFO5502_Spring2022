appellant kevin mcowen filed a medical malpractice action on march,against caremore medical group,peggy salazar not parties to this appeal and a number of doe defendants.on august,appellant amended his complaint by substituting respondent marc grossman,for one of the does.the trial court granted respondent motion for summary judgment on the ground that,as to respondent,the statute of limitations barred the action.we conclude that the trial court erred in ruling that the statute of limitations bars the action and reverse the judgment.
the operative facts are not disputed,unless otherwise noted.
appellant stepped on a nail on february.he first received medical care for this injury on february,from peggy salazar,a nurse with caremore,who was treating appellant diabetes.salazar continued to treat the foot by applying ointment.this proved inadequate and appellant was referred to respondent,who is a vascular surgeon,on march,with what appellant characterizes as a raging infection of his foot.
appellant was referred to respondent for evaluation of an infected sinus of the right fifth metatarsal.respondent saw appellant twice,on march and march.the records of the initial consultation state that there is a likelihood that appellant will lose his toe and that he has a disease.respondent ordered an arterial doppler test to determine the vascular sufficiency of appellant lower extremity.the results of this test are disputed.respondent claims that the test showed that blood flow in the small vessels of appellant feet was a problem appellant disputes that the test report includes this finding.
respondent concluded that an arterial bypass to increase blood flow could not be done,in view of appellant small vessel problem.a further test performed on march,showed osteomyelitis in appellant right foot.respondent saw appellant for the second and final time on march,when respondent discussed the test results with appellant and the condition of appellant right foot.respondent referred appellant to an infectious disease specialist,petreccia.
appellant lost his toe due to gangrene on april,and his right leg below the knee was amputated in july.
as noted,the complaint was filed on march,respondent deposition was taken on november.
appellant contends that he did not learn of respondent role in causing appellant injuries until march,when caremore supplemented its earlier discovery responses.an amended supplemental response by caremore served on march,stated that caremore identifies marc grossman,and david petreccia,as individuals who may have contributed to the injuries sustained by plaintiff.the basis of this supplemental response appears to have been the opinion of caremore expert,cossman,who opined that respondent should have ordered an angiogram,and not a doppler test,that an angiogram would have disclosed if appellant was reconstructible,and that if appellant had a successful reconstruction,his leg would have been saved.as appellant points out in a footnote in his opening brief,grossman would be in this lawsuit if it were for caremore contentions.appellant took cossman deposition on march,when he gave the opinion we have set forth above.it may be assumed that it was this opinion that formed the basis for the amended supplemental response filed by caremore that identified respondent as an individual who may have contributed to the injuries sustained by plaintiff.
the record contains a declaration under penalty of perjury by appellant personally that the first time i was made aware of any facts that may have raised a suspicion of wrongdoing with respect to respondent was after the deposition of defendant caremore medical group and peggy salazar expert,david cossman,prior to that time,no such facts were made aware to me sic concerning the same.
respondent was named as a defendant by an amendment filed on august.
in ruling on respondent motion for summary judgment,the trial court found that it was undisputed that appellant was treated by respondent in march,and that appellant leg was amputated in july.the court concluded the court finds,as a matter of law,that that event amputation put plaintiff on notice of his claim,sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations.see sanchez south hoover hosp.cal d.plaintiff knew he was treated by the moving defendant respondent,knew of his identity and the subsequent amputation long before the doe amendment was filed.he also deposed the moving defendant,which testimony presumably provided additional facts in suppor sic of his claim.
discussion 
the issue is whether appellant was ignorant of facts giving rise to a cause of action against respondent 
appellant naming of doe defendants,and his subsequent amendment to substitute respondent for one of the does,is governed by code of civil procedure section section as we explain below,section is not to be confused with the statute of limitations.
the rule that applies to this case has been stated in general motors superior court th,d when a lawsuit is first initiated after the applicable period of limitations has expired and the plaintiff is entitled to claim the benefit of a delayed discovery rule that is,when for one reason or another the plaintiff is granted an extended period within which to file suit,the relevant inquiry is what the plaintiff knew or,through the exercise of due diligence,reasonably could have discovered at an earlier date but where,as here,a lawsuit is initiated within the applicable period of limitations against someone that is,almost anyone at all and the plaintiff has complied with section by alleging the existence of unknown additional defendants,the relevant inquiry when the plaintiff seeks to substitute a real defendant for one sued fictitiously is what facts the plaintiff actually knew at the time the original complaint was filed.
a plaintiff can avail him or herself of section if the plaintiff is ignorant of facts that give rise to a cause of action against a person who is otherwise known to the plaintiff.in keeping with th e liberal interpretation of section,it is now well established that even though the plaintiff knows of the existence of the defendant sued by a fictitious name,and even though the plaintiff knows the defendant actual identity that is,his name,the plaintiff is ignorant within the meaning of the statute if he lacks knowledge of that person connection with the case or with his injuries.general motors superior court,supra,th at,d.as put by another court the phrase ignorant of the name of a defendant is broadly interpreted to mean not only ignorant of the defendant identity,but also ignorant of the facts giving rise to a cause of action against that defendant.fuller tucker th,d see generally witkin,cal.procedure ed.
in concluding that the amputation of appellant leg put him on notice of his claim sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations,the trial court committed the same error that was committed by the trial court in fuller tucker,supra,th,d.in fuller,as in the case at bar,the medical malpractice complaint naming doe defendants was filed within the statute of limitations.tucker was substituted for one of the does,as respondent was in this case,after the statute of limitations had run.id.at,d.citing sanchez south hoover hospital cal d,as did the trial court in this case,as well as jolly eli lilly cal d,the trial court in fuller concluded that the statute of limitations had run.fuller,supra,at,d.
the error in this case,as it was in fuller tucker,is in identifying the issue in terms of the statute of limitations.the issue,however,is not when the cause of action against the newly named defendant accrued,whether the statute of limitations bars the action against respondent.this can not be the issue since the complaint was filed within the statute of limitations and because the complaint,as filed,named doe defendants.the statute of limitations is not at issue under these circumstances.as the court put it in fuller fuller timely filed her initial complaint.however,after the statute of limitations had expired,fuller brought in tucker as a doe defendant.in such situations,code of civil procedure section permits plaintiffs to bring in def
