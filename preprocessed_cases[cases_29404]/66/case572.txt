in this medical malpractice action arising from the emergency delivery of an infant,defendant douglas mcintyre moved for summary judgment raising the good samaritan statute as an affirmative defense.the good samaritan statute provides an affirmative defense against ordinary negligence for persons who administer emergency care,under specified circumstances.civ.prac.however,the statute does not protect from liability persons whose services were provided for or in expectation of remuneration.id.b.the trial court granted the doctor motion for summary judgment,but a divided court of appeals reversed,holding that the doctor failed to prove conclusively that he was entitled to protection from liability under the good samaritan statute.specifically,the court of appeals held that the doctor failed to prove that he was not legally entitled to receive payment for the emergency services he rendered.
this case presents a question of statutory construction what must a person prove to establish that he or she did not act for or in expectation of remuneration within the meaning of this exception to immunity from liability in the good samaritan statute.civ.rem.b.on this issue of first impression,we hold that the statute requires a person to prove that he or she would not ordinarily receive or ordinarily be entitled to receive payment under the circumstances in which the emergency care was provided.because the summary judgment evidence conclusively established that mcintyre satisfied these statutory requirements,we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
on april,david medical center admitted debra ramirez to have labor induced,as scheduled by her obstetrician and attending physician,patricia gunter.gunter visited ramirez twice during the early stages of labor that day but subsequently left the labor and delivery area.as ramirez labor progressed and the baby head began to crown,gunter still had not returned.mcintyre was on the labor and delivery floor of the medical center visiting one of his own patients when a nurse sent out a page for stork.a stork page means that a delivery is in progress without a doctor present and that a doctor is needed immediately.mcintyre was not for gunter and had never treated nor seen ramirez,but he responded to the page.
when mcintyre arrived at ramirez delivery room,a nurse was supporting the baby head and told mcintyre that ramirez was about to deliver.ramirez had been diagnosed with gestational diabetes and the baby was than normal for his gestational age.indications of shoulder dystocia were present.shoulder dystocia occurs when an infant shoulder becomes lodged against the mother pelvic bone.following several unsuccessful attempts to deliver the baby,mcintyre reached inside ramirez,swept the infant posterior arm across the baby chest and delivered the baby arm.mcintyre then delivered the anterior shoulder and the rest of the baby.mcintyre was in the delivery room for approximately six minutes.gunter arrived after the delivery and resumed care of ramirez and her baby.the baby was born with injuries to the soft tissues and nerves of his right upper extremity,neck,and shoulder,resulting in permanent neurological impairment and paralysis of his right upper extremity and shoulder girdle.
ramirez filed suit against gunter,mcintyre,and david medical center for medical negligence.mcintyre moved for summary judgment based on an affirmative defense provided by the good samaritan statute for persons who in good faith administer emergency health care without being wilfully or wantonly negligent.see.civ.prac.ch.the trial court granted mcintyre summary judgment motion and rendered final judgment in his favor.the court of appeals reversed the trial court judgment in favor of mcintyre,concluding that an issue of fact existed as to whether his emergency medical assistance to ramirez was excluded from the statute protection because he acted for or in expectation of remuneration.at.
mcintyre argues that his summary judgment evidence conclusively established the elements of the good samaritan defense.specifically,he proffered his uncontroverted testimony that neither he nor any doctor in travis county would have charged a fee to ramirez or any other person under the circumstances of this case.this testimony,he contends,proved as a matter of law that he would not ordinarily receive or be entitled to receive remuneration for his actions within the meaning of the statute.ramirez contends that mcintyre failed to prove that he did not fall within the statutory exception for acts performed for or in expectation of remuneration,and that doctors who provide professional services in hospitals are legally entitled to receive payment for those services as a matter of contract law.the parties dispute highlights a practical tension between the statute intent to encourage doctors to provide voluntary emergency medical services and the statute requisites for the same doctors to prove that they are entitled to immunity.we granted mcintyre petition for review to resolve this issue of statutory construction.
ii.the good samaritan statute 
under certain circumstances,the good samaritan statute exempts a person who responds to a medical emergency from liability for ordinary negligence.the statute provides in relevant part 
liability for emergency care 
a a person who in good faith administers emergency care is not liable in civil damages for an act performed during the emergency unless the act is wilfully or wantonly negligent.
b this section does not apply to care administered 
for or in expectation of remuneration or 
by a person who was at the scene of the emergency because he or a person he represents as an agent was soliciting business or seeking to perform a service for remuneration.
c if the scene of an emergency is in a hospital or other health care facility or means of medical transport,a person who in good faith administers emergency care is not liable in civil damages for an act performed during the emergency unless the act is wilfully or wantonly negligent,provided that this subsection does not apply to care administered 
by a person who regularly administers care in a hospital emergency room unless such person is at the scene of the emergency for reasons wholly unrelated to the person work in administering health care or 
by an admitting or attending physician of the patient or a treating physician associated by the admitting or attending physician of the patient in question.
d for purposes of subsections b and c,a person who would ordinarily receive or be entitled to receive a salary,fee,or other remuneration for administering care under such circumstances to the patient in question shall be deemed to be acting for or in expectation of remuneration even if the person waives or elects not to charge or receive remuneration on the occasion in question.
the application of the good samaritan statute is divided into two scenarios defined by the physical location at which the emergency care was rendered.see id.a,c.here,the scene of the emergency was a labor and delivery room in a hospital.accordingly,this case implicates section c,which applies when the scene of the emergency is a hospital.see id.c.the parties agree that mcintyre acted in good faith and without wilful or wanton negligence.mcintyre is therefore exempt from liability under section c,unless he is excepted by some other provision in the statute.
