in,barry jameson filed a complaint against taddesse desta asserting numerous claims stemming from desta allegedly negligent medical treatment of jameson hepatitis while jameson was incarcerated at the richard donovan correctional facility donovan.in three separate prior appeals,this court reversed judgments in favor of desta,and remanded the matter for further proceedings.see jameson desta th jameson iii,jameson desta th jameson ii,and jameson desta july,opn.mod.july,nonpub.opn.jameson i.
on remand from jameson iii,jameson filed a motion for summary judgment adjudication.the trial court denied the motion in its entirety and set the matter for trial.after the parties provided opening statements at an unreported jury trial,desta orally moved for nonsuit.the trial court granted the motion and entered judgment in favor of desta.
on appeal,jameson contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for summary judgment,and in granting desta motion for nonsuit.jameson also claims that the trial court erred in failing to have the trial proceedings recorded by a court reporter.jameson further claims that the trial court displayed bias and prejudice throughout the proceedings and that the court rulings denied him a fair trial.finally,jameson maintains that the trial court cumulative errors resulted in a denial of due process.
we conclude that the trial court properly denied jameson motion for summary judgment adjudication because jameson did not establish that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on any of his claims.we also conclude that the trial court did not err in failing to have the trial proceedings recorded by a court reporter.in addition,we conclude that jameson can not demonstrate that the trial court erred in granting desta motion for nonsuit,because the record on appeal does not contain a reporter transcript.finally,we reject jameson contentions that the trial court displayed bias or prejudice throughout the proceedings and that the cumulative error doctrine requires reversal.accordingly,we affirm the judgment 
this court is fully aware that jameson incarceration and his financial circumstances have made it difficult for him to pursue his claims in court this case aptly demonstrates that civil justice is not free.while this court is sympathetic to the plight of litigants like jameson whose incarceration financial circumstances present such challenges,the rules of appellate procedure and substantive law mandate that we affirm the judgment in this case 
factual and procedural backgrounda.the operative allegations in jameson complaint 
in april,jameson filed a complaint alleging eight causes of action,including breach of fiduciary duty lack of informed consent professional negligence general negligence failure to train battery violation of civil rights intentional infliction of emotional distress and violation of due process against a number of defendants including desta and officials of the california department of corrections and rehabilitation department jameson claims of breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence against desta are the sole remaining causes of action and the only claims at issue in this appeal.
in his complaint,jameson alleged that he had been suffering from hepatitis and that desta negligently prescribed interferon for jameson while jameson was incarcerated at donovan and desta was performing services as a physician for the department.jameson further alleged that the interferon caused him to suffer serious physical injuries,including irreversible damage to his eyesight.with respect to his breach of fiduciary duty claim,jameson alleged in part 
desta breached his fiduciary duty as a doctor when he started jameson on alpha interferon,when jameson had no detectable viral count.the department written policy clearly states if a person has a viral count that does not exceed,a person is not to be given interferon treatment.moreover,such treatment is to be reviewed every six months to review whether such treatment should be continued desta simply continued jameson on treatment jameson should never have been on with deliberate indifference and a reckless disregard for the rights,health and safety of jameson,causing irreparable injury this second six months aggravated the injuries to jameson unnecessarily.
desta held a position of trust with jameson,causing jameson to rely on desta statements and recommendation that jameson begin treatment and stay on it.it is only through jameson research of his own medical file and hepatitis literature that even as a layman he easily discovered the mistaken or malicious prescription by desta that resulted in such damage.jameson iii,supra,th at.
on his professional negligence cause of action,jameson alleged that desta had been professionally negligent in his treatment of jameson,and there existed a relationship.jameson iii,supra,th at.jameson also alleged the following 
due to desta professional negligence and failure to exercise the proper degree of knowledge and skill in diagnosing,treating and monitoring any such treatment,jameson suffered and suffers extreme migraine headaches,vision loss,weight loss,depression and severe emotional duress.jameson suffered such due to desta ordering that jameson take interferon treatment that jameson did not need and local regulations precluded or excluded jameson from taking.jameson and desta shared a position of trust,and desta acted in the capacity of a specialist in the field of h epatology.
jameson liver condition never showed what is called a viral count,and at all times relevant to this matter,jameson viral count was undetectable.therefore,jameson should have never been subjected to what amounted to cancer treatment and all the suffering that is attached thereto.id.at.

discussiona.the trial court properly denied jameson motion for summary judgment summary adjudication 
jameson claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion for summary judgment adjudication.
governing law 
a motion for summary judgment shall be granted when all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.citation.a summary adjudication is properly granted only if a motion therefor completely disposes of a cause of action,an affirmative defense,a claim for damages,or an issue of duty.citation.motions for summary adjudication proceed in all procedural respects as a motion for summary judgment.jameson iii,supra,th at.
on appeal,the reviewing court makes an independent assessment of the correctness of the trial court ruling,applying the same legal standard as the trial court in determining whether there are any genuine issues of material fact or whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.trop sony pictures entertainment,th,quoting iverson muroc unified school dist.th.
factual and procedural background 
as noted above,in november,jameson filed a motion for summary judgment adjudication.in his brief in support of the motion,jameson contended that undisputed evidence demonstrated that desta treated jameson for hepatitis after jameson was already cured,that desta was professionally negligent and breached his fiduciary duty to jameson in the manner by which he treated jameson,and that desta caused jameson to suffer damages.jameson claimed that he was therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law on his breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence causes of action.
in the alternative,jameson requested that the trial court grant summary adjudication with respect to several issues,including whether desta failed to inform jameson of treatment options,whether desta breached his fiduciary duty to jameson,whether desta had been professionally negligent,and whether newly discovered evidence and law of the case demonstrated that desta caused jameson to suffer damages 
desta filed an opposition in which he contended that the trial court should deny the motion for summary judgment adjudication for several reasons,including that there were numerous issues of material fact.
after further briefing,the trial court denied jameson motion in its entirety.among the numerous grounds upon which the court denied the motion was the following 
as to the request for summary judgment,the court first notes that jameson has not established with evidence damages and thus summary judgment would not be proper in any event.as to the issues identified for adjudication,the court further notes that jameson is seeking adjudication of issues and not causes of action as required under code of civil procedure section,subdivision f.summary adjudication must completely dispose of a cause of action or defense.
application 
we begin our analysis by examining the allegations in jameson complaint.see sherman hennessy industries,th,first step in an appellate court review of a summary judgment is identifying the issues framed by the complaint.in his breach of fiduciary duty claim,jameson alleged that desta actions caused pain,suffering,emotional distress,and impairment of enjoyment of life to jameson.similarly,in his professional negligence cause of action jameson contended that desta caused him pain,suffering,and emotional distress for no medical reason.damages are an essential element of both breach of fiduciary duty and professional negligence.see jameson iii,supra,th at,outlining elements.thus,in order to be entitled to summary adjudication of either cause of action,jameson was required to establish as a matter of law the amount of damages to which he was entitled.paramount petroleum superior court th,summary judgment or adjudication improper where amount of damages raises factual issue italics added.
jameson did not attempt to establish the amount of damages to which he was entitled with respect to either his breach of fiduciary duty or professional negligence causes of action in his motion for summary judgment adjudication jameson therefore failed to establish,as a matter of law,this element of his claims,as would be required in order for the trial court to grant him summary adjudication on either cause of action.see paramount petroleum superior court,supra,th at.thus,jameson was not entitled to summary judgment or summary adjudication with respect to either his breach of fiduciary duty cause of action or his professional negligence cause of action.in addition,to the extent the issues as to which jameson sought adjudication were distinct from these two causes of action,jameson was not entitled to summary adjudication with respect to such issues because these issues would not completely dispose of a cause of action,an affirmative defense,a claim for damages,or an issue of duty.jameson iii,supra,th at.
jameson contends that the trial court should have granted his motion for summary judgment adjudication because desta failed to file proper responsive opposition papers to the motion.this argument is unpersuasive because jameson did not carry his initial burden of demonstrating that he was entitled to summary judgment or summary adjudication.any deficiencies in desta opposition papers were therefore immaterial.see,thatcher lucky stores,th,trial court may not grant unopposed motion for summary judgment without first determining that the moving party has met its initial burden of proof.
accordingly,we conclude that the trial court properly denied jameson motion for summary judgment summary adjudication.
b.the trial court did not err in failing to have the trial proceedings recorded by a court reporter 
jameson contends that the trial court erred in failing to have the trial proceedings recorded by a court reporter.
factual and procedural background 
at a hearing days prior to the commencement of the jury trial,the trial court informed the parties that the court no longer provides a court reporter for civil trials,and that parties have to provide their own reporters for trial.
the jury trial was not reported and there is no indication in the record that either party sought to provide a court reporter for the trial.
governing law 
government code section provides in relevant part 
the following provisions apply in superior court 
a in addition to any other fee required in civil actions or cases 
for each proceeding anticipated to last one hour or less,a fee of thirty dollars shall be charged for the reasonable cost of the court reporting services provided at the expense of the court by an official court reporter pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.
for each proceeding lasting more than one hour,a fee equal to the actual cost of providing that service shall be charged per day of services to the parties,on a pro rata basis,for the services of an official court reporter on the first and each succeeding judicial day those services are provided pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure.
b the fee shall be waived for a person who has been granted a fee waiver under section.
c the costs for the services of the official court reporter shall be recoverable as taxable costs by the prevailing party as otherwise provided by law.
d the judicial council shall adopt rules to ensure all of the following 
that parties are given adequate and timely notice of the availability of an official court reporter.
that if an official court reporter is not available,a party may arrange for the presence of a certified shorthand reporter to serve as an official pro tempore reporter,the costs therefor recoverable as provided in subdivision c.
that if the services of an official pro tempore reporter are utilized pursuant to paragraph,no other charge shall be made to the parties.italics added.
california rules of court,rule,contains provisions governing notice concerning the availability of official court reporters rule provides in relevant part 
c party may procure reporter if the services of an official court reporter are not available for a hearing or trial in a civil case,a party may arrange for the presence of a certified shorthand reporter to serve as an official pro tempore reporter.it is that party responsibility to pay the reporter fee for attendance at the proceedings,but the expense may be recoverable as part of the costs,as provided by law.italics added.
application 
government code section and rule clearly indicate that an official court reporter may not be available for a case.the statute and the rule further provide that,to the extent an official court reporter is unavailable,a party may arrange for the presence of a court reporter and that the costs of paying such reporter may potentially be recoverable by the prevailing party.
in this case,the record indicates that the trial court informed the parties of the unavailability of an official court reporter days prior to the commencement of the jury trial.further,there is nothing in the record indicating that jameson attempted to arrange for the presence of a certified shorthand reporter to serve as an official pro tempore reporter,rule.therefore,the trial court did not err in failing to have the proceedings transcribed by a court reporter.
jameson appears to suggest that the trial court failed to inform him in a timely manner of the unavailability of a court reporter.we reject this argument because jameson presents no argument that the trial court failed to comply with rule governing notice of the unavailability of an official court reporter further,the record indicates that the court informed jameson of this fact days prior to the commencement of the jury trial
