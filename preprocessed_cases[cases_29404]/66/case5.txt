alleging that negligent conduct occurred during the birth of their son,his parents filed a medical malpractice suit.they prevailed against the defendant physician but the jury found no liability on the codefendant hospital part.the plaintiffs sought a new trial,the motion was denied,and they appealed.concluding this denial was appropriate,we affirm.
background 
liza rosa rivera and edgard franqui ramos,on their own behalf and on behalf of their minor son,plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against appellee,dorado health,alejandro otero l√≥pez hospital,dorado health or the hospital,along with joseph capre febus plaintiffs alleged that capre febus the physician who delivered and dorado health the hospital where the delivery took place acted negligently in connection with the birth of their son,resulting in suffering from trauma,shoulder dystocia,and ultimately erb palsy.the jury was partially convinced.it concluded that while both capre febus and dorado health were negligent,only capre febus negligence proximately caused impairments.the judgment ordered the doctor to compensate the plaintiffs.plaintiffs moved for a new trial under federal rule of civil procedure a,advancing the same arguments they do here the district court,finding merit to none,denied the motion and this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
plaintiffs make three claims of error,the first being that the trial judge erred in not allowing their attorney to ask a dorado health nurse leading questions.the second claimed misstep was the judge decision not to include one of their proposed jury instructions.and finally,plaintiffs insist that the jury rendered an inconsistent verdict.we take the issues in that order.
leading the witness 
sara montalvo,who at the time of trial had been working at dorado health since,was the nurse that assisted in delivery.plaintiffs called montalvo to testify,and fairly early on in the questioning counsel began posing leading questions.defense counsel objected but the attorney for plaintiffs persisted that leading questions were appropriate because montalvo was affiliated with dorado health.the judge sided with the defense,noting that montalvo was not a hostile witness.when plaintiffs counsel pressed that under the rules hostility is not the only indicator for leading a witness,and it is appropriate when the witness is identified with the other party,the judge stated,i do agree if she becomes hostile,you can lead all the way.the judge then sustained the defense objection to the few additional leading questions asked during the remainder of montalvo examination.
plaintiffs claim the court ruling was because a witness hostility is not the only justification for posing leading questions.and,according to the plaintiffs,because they could not pose leading questions,the examination of montalvo was a disaster,resulting in a miscarriage of justice justifying a new trial 
plaintiffs are correct on the first point.leading questions are generally disfavored on direct examination but o rdinarily,the court should allow leading questions when a party calls a hostile witness,an adverse party,or a witness identified with an adverse party.c emphasis added.consequently,it seems likely that the judge ruling was based on an error of law and therefore an abuse of discretion.see ira green,military sales serv,cir.but even assuming this to be the case,the judge potential misapplication of the rule is not enough.prejudice is required for a party to prevail on a claim of improper exclusion of leading questions.rodriguez banco cent,cir.a.for starters,this would require a proffer on plaintiffs part,in other words,a showing of some specific information that counsel might have elicited if permitted the use of leading questions.rodriguez,at see also.a.that component is missing here.
neither at the sidebar with the judge,nor in the motion for a new trial,did plaintiffs offer any indication as to what they might have been able to extract from montalvo given some leeway with the questioning.the same goes for their brief to this court,as well as at oral argument,despite the panel pointing out the proffer omission.it was not until post,via a federal rule of appellate procedure j letter ostensibly submitted to supplement their list of authorities,that plaintiffs indicated what they would have proven had they been allowed to examine montalvo with leading questions,omitted nursing notes,lies about her findings,and deficient hospital protocols.not only is it improper to advance new arguments in a j letter,ruskai pistole,cir,but it is far too late in the game.see,united states bayard,cir providing that the appellant failure to brief the issue waives it.
given their failure to establish prejudice,plaintiffs first argument affords no relief.we move on.
jury instructions 
prior to trial,plaintiffs proposed jury instructions,the operative one for our purposes being instruction,which for now it suffices to note concerned the obligation imposed on hospitals to carefully select and monitor privileged physicians.after the parties rested,counsel and the judge debated the merit of instruction,along with other jury instruction and verdict form matters.the judge,as later explained in the judgment denying plaintiffs motion for a new trial,decided instead to give other instructions which she felt in essence covered the same content as instruction and,unlike that instruction,conformed to the evidence presented at trial.to this court,plaintiffs make a circumscribed argument.they do not claim that any of the jury instructions issued by the court were problematic,rather they simply persist that instruction should have made the cut.
whether plaintiffs properly preserved their objection to instruction is up for debate.the district court,in the judgment denying the new trial motion,indicated that the plaintiffs had properly objected.on appeal,dorado health claims otherwise and plaintiffs do not say one way or the other.
federal rule of civil procedure requires the court to give parties the opportunity to object to its proposed jury instructions before closing arguments and the instructions are delivered.b.for an objection to be timely except in circumstances not relevant here,it must be made at this point.c a.failure to do so means the objection is forfeited and reviewed for plain error only,the idea being that the trial judge should be afforded the opportunity to cure the alleged error and litigants stopped from ensuring a new trial in the event of an adverse verdict by covertly relying on the error.booker.dep t of pub.health,cir see also.d.
it is clear,at least,that plaintiffs did not object at the juncture required by rule c a.when the judge asked,just prior to closing arguments,whether plaintiffs counsel had any issues with the final jury instructions and verdict form,counsel mentioned a issue with the verdict form,but indicated no concerns or qualms with the jury instructions.however,what is less clear is whether this failure to object definitively places us in the plain error zone.
while a proper request we have that and a proper objection we are missing that is required for a party to assign error to the court failure to give an instruction,the objection requirement does not apply when the court rejected the request in a definitive ruling on the record.d b see also ji bose,cir.in those instances,the challenge is deemed preserved and subject to de novo review.ji,at.
here,there was a lot of back and forth on the record regarding the jury instructions.it is not the easiest exchange to follow but it appears that,at one point,the court intended to include some iteration of instruction but then was convinced otherwise by defense counsel,though even then it is not entirely clear what instruction the court was nixing.compounding the confusion is plaintiffs indication in their brief to this court that the transcripts did not fully reflect the exchange on instruction.given the difficulty we have discerning a definitive ruling on the record.d b,and the fact that plaintiffs do not rely on,or even reference,rule d b relaxed objection requirement,we deem plaintiffs objection to instruction unpreserved.see ji,at treating plaintiff
