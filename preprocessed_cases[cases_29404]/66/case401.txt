in ferguson lieff,cabraser,heimann bernstein cal th,d,ferguson,the california supreme court held that as a matter of public policy lost punitive damages in an underlying action are not recoverable as compensatory damages in a legal malpractice action.plaintiff expansion pointe properties limited partnership pointe appeals a summary judgment for defendants procopio,cory,hargreaves savitch,llp,and steven strauss together procopio,granted on the ground that under ferguson pointe has no recoverable damages.pointe contends the general rule of retrospective application of judicial opinions should not apply here as it relied on law when it signed the retainer agreement with procopio,and despite a california provision in the retainer agreement,under california conflict of law principles the court erred by not applying arizona law that is contrary to ferguson.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
during the and pointe entities developed three communities in the phoenix,arizona,area,the focal points of which were upscale resorts named the pointe at squaw peak,the pointe at tapatio cliffs and the pointe at south mountain.for financial reasons,pointe brought the mutual life insurance company of new york mony into the resorts in under joint venture agreements.
more than years later disputes arose between pointe and mony pertaining to the joint venture agreements and the amount of proceeds to which mony was entitled when pointe exercised its right to purchase mony interest in the pointe at tapatio cliffs,and the amount of proceeds to which mony was entitled when the pointe at squaw peak was sold to the hilton hotel corporation hilton.mony brought a declaratory relief action against pointe in united states district court,district of arizona.
on october,pointe retained procopio,a san diego law firm,to represent it in the litigation.the retainer agreement states it was entered into in san diego.it also provides any dispute concerning this agreement shall be determined under the internal laws of the s tate of california.any suit by any party concerning this agreement shall be filed and tried in san diego county,california.
pointe filed a separate declaratory relief action against mony concerning the pointe at tapatio cliffs,and it was consolidated with mony action.pointe also filed a counterclaim against mony for breach of contract,breach of fiduciary duty,and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.pointe prayed for punitive damages related to the sale of the pointe at squaw peak to hilton.
mony moved for summary judgment on the punitive damages claim,arguing there was no evidence that in allocating all of the sale proceeds to itself it acted with the requisite evil mind under arizona law.pointe argued that mony manipulated the closing documents four times on the day of closing escrow hired its own counsel to represent the joint venture in the resort sale repeatedly changed its legal theories to justify its actions and knew pointe expected to receive approximately million from the sale,but falsely claimed the joint venture agreement limited pointe share of the proceeds to.
the court granted the motion and dismissed pointe punitive damages claim.the court explained that even giving pointe the benefit of reasonable inferences from its cited evidence,the evidence does not clearly and convincingly show the requisite evil mind and evil conduct required by the arizona courts to justify submitting to a trier of fact the issue of punitive damages.the court found the evidence only demonstrates that mony kept the proceeds to which it believed it was entitled.
at a jury trial,pointe defeated mony claims and obtained compensatory damages of related to the sale of the pointe at squaw peak to hilton 
pointe then brought this action against procopio for malpractice and breach of fiduciary duties.as is relevant here,the first amended complaint alleged procopio failed to fully understand arizona law on punitive damages,and intentionally failed to present certain evidence in support of pointe punitive damages claim that would have defeated mony summary judgment motion and resulted in an award of punitive damages in its favor.the first amended complaint prayed for compensatory damages,consisting of lost punitive damages against mony,and punitive damages under civil code section.
procopio moved for summary judgment,arguing that under ferguson,supra,cal th,d,pointe can not recover lost punitive damages.alternatively,procopio argued there was no causal link between mony alleged evil mind and harm to pointe,as required by arizona law.
pointe argued that in the underlying action procopio refused to submit two memoranda written by bob brooks,managing director of pointe resorts at the relevant time.in a may,memorandum,brooks memorialized conversations he had with several mony representatives the previous day over the course of several cocktails and dinner.brooks attributed the following comments to tom mccahill of mony t hese are our assets.you understand we own of squaw peak we are planning on squeezing bob gosnell pointe principal down,which means by the end of the year we are going to take over squaw peak.next june,we got the management of tapatio cliffs and the following december we got south mountain.that going to happen.so,are you getting the picture where would your allegiance be,bob brooks further,mccahill reportedly said,we are prepared to litigate.bob gosnell ca last through litigation.
brooks june,memorandum was reportedly a transcription of a telephone conversation he had that day with mark tobin of mony brooks attributed the following passage to tobin there only one way it could happen.its sic by further dissolution of gosnell joint venture interests and using that as a lever.and there a time table for that,which is squaw peak.squaw peak first,then the cliffs second.and of the management company at south mountain.additionally,tobin reportedly said,that plus the lever would also be anything,any dirt that we uncover between now and the time we decide to uncover it,or decide to take some sort of action against him.
the june memorandum also stated that tobin told brooks a ll of the sic sudden,all you doing is saying to b ob gosnell,you have a choice,pal.its sic your choice.you can walk away or you can go to court and live in a fairytale dream to think that your pockets are deeper than mony gosnell ca possibly think that he can mount a legal effort that is stronger than what we can pay for.we would be sending out our legal people who do foreclosures.we are going to pick up the phone and call aba american bar association and say,who are the biggest asshole litigators you have,and send the bill to this address.and,by the way,they can stay for the next two years on us.with their families.
brooks memoranda,however,were not introduced through a declaration by brooks.rather,gosnell declaration stated the brooks memoranda,exhibits and to defendant motion,set forth admissions by mony representatives as to their evil state of mind specifically,their intent to deprive the pointe entities of the benefit of the bargain by buying justice.gosnell declaration also stated he flew to san diego to deliver the brooks memoranda to procopio before the discovery date and repeatedly sought to have procopio introduce evidence concerning the brooks memoranda.to gosnell knowledge,procopio made no effort to meet with brooks or to obtain a declaration from him 
pointe also submitted the declaration of attorney brian goodwin.the declaration stated that goodwin reviewed the draft opposition procopio prepared to mony summary judgment motion in the underlying action and advised procopio it was insufficient to withstand the motion.the declaration also stated goodwin believed the brooks memoranda were admissible and he advised procopio it needed to and could use the brooks memoranda,but procopio declined on the ground they are hearsay.
in its opposition,procopio objected to the brooks memoranda on hearsay grounds,and because they were written in,approximately eight years before a dispute arose between pointe and mony regarding the sale of the pointe at squaw peak to hilton.the evidence shows that after mony obtained summary judgment on pointe punitive damages claim in the underlying action,pointe consulted two attorneys outside the procopio firm to discuss the potential for a successful motion for reconsideration based on the brooks memoranda.attorney donald petrie believed the court would exclude the brooks memoranda because they were not newly discovered,were hearsay and were not sufficiently probative under arizona law to establish a prima facie case of punitive damages against mony.attorney david niddrie believed the brooks memoranda were inadmissible because they were not newly discovered,were remote in time to the conduct giving rise to the punitive damages claims,lacked credibility because brooks prepared them to make mony look bad,were double hearsay,and appeared irrelevant because it was unclear whether their intent was to drive gosnell out of management or out of the partnership.
the court granted procopio motion and entered judgment for it on january.the court found pointe has raised a triable issue of fact that procopio might have offered more evidence in support of pointe opposition to mony motion for summary judgment,in order to have the issue of punitive damages go to the jury,but as a matter of law,punitive damages are not recoverable in california in a legal malpractice action as a form of compensatory damages.

a party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he or she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.a defendant satisfies this burden by showing one or more elements of the cause of action in question can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.ibid.in determining whether the moving party met its burden,we review the record de novo.rubenstein rubenstein th,d.
retrospective application of ferguson 
in ferguson,our high court held that for public policy reasons punitive damages allegedly lost in an underlying action can not be recovered as compensatory damages in a legal malpractice action.the court explained that m aking a negligent attorney liable for lost punitive damages would not serve a societal interest,because the attorney did not commit and had no control over the intentional misconduct justifying the punitive damages award.imposing liability for lost punitive damages on negligent attorneys would therefore neither punish the culpable tortfeasor citation nor deter that tortfeasor and others from committing similar wrongful acts in the future.ferguson,supra,cal th at,d.the court also concluded permitting recovery of lost punitive damages would violate the public policy against speculative damages id.at,d,the complex standard of proof applicable to claims for lost punitive damages militates against the recovery of such damages id.at,d,and allowing recovery of lost punitive damages as compensatory damages in a legal malpractice action may exact a significant social cost through increased malpractice insurance or exclusion of coverage for malpractice actions.id.at,d.
pointe contends the court erred here by applying ferguson retrospectively.i t is the general rule that a decision of a court of supreme jurisdiction overruling a former decision is retrospective in its operation and that the effect is not that the former decision was bad law but that it never was the law.in re retirement cases th,d.the general rule that judicial decisions are given retroactive effect is basic in our legal tradition.citation.this general principle is subject to two virtually universal exceptions,based on considerations of fairness and public policy.a decision announcing a change in a judicial rule of law is rarely,if ever,a basis for disturbing a final judgment based on the prior rule.citations.nor will the new decision be applied to impair contracts made or property rights acquired in accordance with the prior rule.citations.citation.a decision announces a new rule of law,for example,when it disapproves of a and widespread practice expressly approved by a body of lower court authorities.droeger friedman,sloan ross cal d.
in ferguson,the court resolved a conflict between courts of appeal.the court agreed with this court opinion in piscitelli friedenberg th,d piscitelli,in which we held that in legal malpractice actions,permitting a jury to impose punitive damages on a negligent defendant by restyling them as compensatory lost punitive damages is unjust and contrary to public policy.ferguson,supra,cal th at,d.the court disapproved of a opinion by the third district court of appeal that held the plaintiff in a malpractice action may recover lost punitive damages as an element of compensatory damages merenda superior court th,d merenda.ferguson,supra,at,d.
ferguson was decided on june,nearly a year before pointe filed its original complaint against procopio on march.pointe retroactivity argument,however,is based on the date of its retainer agreement with procopio,october.pointe asserts that in california law and arizona law were comparable in terms of a lawyer responsibility for negligence,and with piscitelli and ferguson,california and arizona law drastically diverged in terms of a lawyer responsibility for negligence,to pointe great detriment.this change unfairly undermines pointe reasonable reliance on the previously existing state of the law,and imposes great hardships on pointe.pointe asserts that based on merenda,it believed procopio would face legal responsibility for the consequences of any negligence,including the loss of punitive damages.
the issue of fairness in applying a judicial decision retrospectively encompasses the extent of reliance on the old standards by the parties,and the ability of litigants to foresee a change in the law.estate of propst cal d.several factors must be considered in determining whether a decision should be given retroactive application particular considerations relevant to the retroactivity determination include the reasonableness of the parties reliance on the former rule bearden borax,th,d.the extent and reasonableness of a party reliance are questions for the trier of fact.boeken philip morris,th,d.
procopio contends pointe waived the retrospective application issue by not raising it at the trial court.in its memorandum of points and authorities,pointe did not expressly mention the retrospective application of ferguson,although it did cursorily argue ferguson should not be applied because california law as to recovery of lost punitive damages in a malpractice action changed during the pendency of the representation.
pointe asserts we may nonetheless consider the matter because theories pertaining solely to questions of law may be raised for the first time on appeal.an appellant may be permitted to change his theory when a question of law alone is presented on the facts appearing in the record.in that case,the opposing party is not required to defend for the first time on appeal against a new theory that contemplates a controverted factual situation.witkin,cal.procedure ed.appeal.as discussed,however,the issue of a party reliance on prior law is a question for the trier of fact.for instance,without any citation to the record pointe asserts application of ferguson will deprive pointe of a right that it bargained heavily on having.italics added.
pointe also asserts procopio fully understood,before the trial court,both the fact issues underlying pointe appellate arguments,and the essential legal approaches,even if all of the same cases and statutes were not cited to the trial court.pointe,however,cited no legal authority concerning the retrospective application of judicial opinions in its memorandum of points and authorities.further,pointe counsel did not appear for the hearing and instead stipulated to the court tentative ruling.additionally,pointe submitted no evidence that in entering the retainer agreement with procopio it relied on merenda or even thought about a potential malpractice claim.we can not presume reliance or consider facts unsupported by the appellate record.kim sumitomo bank of california th,d.
pointe asserts the following paragraph from gosnell declaration shows it raised the retrospective application argument at the trial court subsequent to the execution of the procopio engagement letter,pointe was not made aware of a change in california case law as to the ability of pointe to pursue procopio,given its deliberate denial of its client wishes,then the loss of punitive damages.i have recently learned that this change commenced in during the time in which we were pleading with procopio to introduce the evidence for the theories of evil mind,along with the related evidence procopio did not advise us as to this significant change in his engagement.had it done so,there is no question,given the continued refusal to introduce evil mind with malpractice now potentially not being a method of recovery,pointe would have dismissed procopio as our counsel.procopio was the only california counsel we had at the time.
the documentation filed in conjunction with the motion for summary judgment,however,was voluminous and the trial court was not required to comb through it to find evidence to support a retroactivity argument that pointe did not expressly raise or support with legal authority in its memorandum of points and authorities.further,pointe did not cite the above paragraph from the gosnell declaration in its separate statement as required.code civ,subd.b.
generally,the rules relating to the scope of appellate review apply to appellate review of summary judgments.citation.an argument or theory will not be considered if it is raised for the first time on appeal.citation.specifically,in reviewing a summary judgment,the appellate court must consider only those facts before the trial court,disregarding any new allegations on appeal.citation.thus,possible theories that were not fully developed or factually presented to the trial court can not create a triable issue on appeal.american continental ins.c z timber d,italics added.a party is not permitted to change his position and adopt a new and different theory on appeal.to permit him to do so would not only be unfair to the trial court,but manifestly unjust to the opposing litigant.ernst searle cal.we deem the matter waived.
even absent waiver,however,we would find against pointe on the issue.under pointe theory that the gosnell declaration shows retrospective application of ferguson would be unfair,we must decide whether procopio had a duty to learn about and advise pointe of the piscitelli or ferguson opinions.we agree with procopio that it had no such duty.an attorney has a duty to respond promptly to reasonable status inquiries of clients and to keep clients reasonably informed of significant developments in matters with regard to which the attorney has agreed to provide legal services.bus,subd.m.similarly,rule of the state bar rules of professional conduct provides a member shall keep a client reasonably informed about significant developments relating to the employment or representation,including promptly complying with reasonable requests for information and copies of significant documents when necessary to keep the client so informed.
under the retainer agreement,procopio agreed to adequately represent pointe in the mony litigation.pointe cites no authority suggesting an attorney has a duty to at the inception of the relationship or later in the various types of recovery a client may obtain in a potential malpractice action against him or her.further,attorneys do not commit malpractice based on the state of the law pertaining to malpractice damages,and there is no suggestion that when piscitelli and ferguson were decided procopio believed pointe had a potential malpractice claim against it.because procopio had no reporting duty,pointe reliance argument fails on substantive grounds.
pointe cites janik rudy,exelrod zieff th,d janik,for the proposition an attorney has a duty to alert the client to legal problems which are reasonably apparent,even though they fall outside the scope of the retention.in janik,the issue was whether attorneys for the plaintiff class owed class members a duty of care to consider and protect their interests pertaining to any claims they may have beyond the claims specified in the class certification order pertaining to unpaid overtime wages due under the labor code.id.at,d.the court analogized a class certification order to a retainer agreement and rejected the defendants broad assertion that an attorney can not be sued in malpractice for failing to raise claims beyond the scope of a retainer agreement.id.at,d.the court held that while the scope of the relationship may be limited by the retainer agreement,an attorney who undertakes one matter on behalf of a client owes that client the duty to at least consider and advise the client if there are apparent related matters that the client is overlooking and that should be pursued to avoid prejudicing the client interests.ibid.
the janik court concluded that a cause of action under the ucl unfair competition law would have been based on precisely the same practice,and subject to much the same legal analysis,as the certified cause of action under the labor code class counsel therefore were obliged to consider the advantages and disadvantages to the class of seeking to add a ucl cause of action to their complaint,to bring these considerations to the attention of the class representatives,and to take or recommend such action.janik,supra,th at,d.janik is inapplicable as it pertains to claims against third parties arising from the same course of conduct.
additionally,pointe contention that the retroactive application of ferguson impairs its vested contract rights is erroneous.it is well settled the existing applicable law is part of every contract,the same as if expressly referred to or incorporated in its terms.people gipson th,d.w here a constitutional provision or statute has received a given construction by a court of last resort,and contracts have been made or property rights acquired in accordance with the prior decision,neither will the contracts be invalidated nor will vested rights be impaired by applying the new rule retroactively.peterson superior court cal d.again,the retainer agreement was for procopio representation of pointe in the mony litigation,the agreement did not contain any terms pertaining to a potential malpractice action,and there is no suggestion pointe entered into it in reliance on the merenda opinion.
under pointe theory and showing,any retainer agreement entered into before ferguson was decided would not be subject to its limitation in a later malpractice action.given the numerous public policy reasons outlined in ferguson for excluding lost punitive damages as compensatory damages in a malpractice action,such a holding would be against public policy.the court properly applied ferguson retroactively 
additionally,pointe contends the retainer agreement clause is unenforceable under estoppel principles because procopio gained pointe continuing assent to the terms of the r etainer a greement through a constructive concealment of facts,and through a breach of a duty to speak.
the doctrine of equitable estoppel is founded on concepts of equity and fair dealing.it provides that a person may not deny the existence of a state of facts if he intentionally led another to believe a particular circumstance to be true and to rely upon such belief to his detriment.citations.the traditional elements of estoppel are the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts and he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.oakland raiders county coliseum,th,d.
pointe,however,did not raise an estoppel argument at the trial court,and thus waived the matter.in any event,as we have concluded,procopio had no duty to learn about or discuss the piscitelli or ferguson decisions with pointe.since pointe estoppel argument is based on the asserted breach of duty,it is without merit.
