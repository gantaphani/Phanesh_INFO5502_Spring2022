we have for review the decision in virginia insurance reciprocal walker,so d dca,which certified conflict with the decision in wendel hauser,so d dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons expressed below,we approve the decision of the first district court of appeal in virginia insurance reciprocal.
factual and procedural background 
emily aumon was transferred to scottish rite children medical center,in atlanta,georgia,on june,the day after she was born.after emily was discharged from scottish rite on june,frank walker assumed emily care in tallahassee,florida.approximately eleven months later,emily parents,ann and robert aumon,sought a second opinion from larry deeb,who diagnosed emily with a condition known as congenital hypothyroidism.this condition can be detected by routine metabolic testing and can be treated effectively if the diagnosis is made soon after birth.however,neither the physicians at scottish rite children medical center nor walker conducted the testing required to diagnose hypothyroidism.
following deeb diagnosis,the aumons filed a medical malpractice suit against scottish rite and the physicians who treated emily in georgia,alleging that emily was injured because of their failure to test her for hypothyroidism.the aumons claimed scottish rite failed to test emily for hypothyroidism within one week of her birth as required by georgia public health laws and failed to determine if the hospital where she was born had done so.the suit further alleged that this failure to diagnose emily condition left her with permanent physical impairments and mental retardation.
virginia insurance reciprocal,virginia insurance,scottish rite insurer,settled with the aumons for million on june.virginia insurance also prepared to assert a contribution claim against walker walker and his professional association,on the grounds that walker had also negligently failed to diagnose emily condition and this negligence was the partial cause of the loss for which virginia insurance had compensated the aumons.because the contribution claim was based on a claim of medical malpractice,virginia insurance complied with the medical malpractice presuit screening requirements of sections and florida statutes.
on may,virginia insurance served an intent to litigate against walker,as provided in section,florida statutes supp when the claim was not resolved during the presuit screening process,virginia insurance filed a complaint for contribution against walker in circuit court on november,contending it was entitled to contribution because it had paid more than its pro rata share of the common liability of those released in the underlying suit.see.stat.walker answered the complaint by denying the allegations and moving for summary judgment on the ground that virginia insurance contribution claim was barred by the statute of limitations in section.virginia insurance did not dispute that the complaint had been filed more than one calendar year after it had settled the claim on behalf of scottish rite,but argued that the statute of limitations was tolled during the presuit screening procedure and thus the complaint was timely filed.walker responded that the presuit screening requirements were inapplicable to contribution claims and thus any effort to comply with the requirements had no effect on the statute of limitations in this case.
the circuit court granted walker motion for summary judgment,concluding that the statute of limitations in section d had not been tolled during the time that virginia insurance was attempting to comply with the presuit screening procedure in section and thus the complaint for contribution was not timely.the circuit court based its ruling on the decision in wendel hauser,so d dca.on appeal,the first district disagreed with the fourth district reasoning in wendel,reversed the summary judgment,and certified conflict with the decision in wendel.
in wendel,the fourth district concluded that the plain language of section,which defines those claims subject to the presuit screening procedure,does not encompass claims for contribution.so d at.thus,the fourth district held that the presuit screening procedures initiated by the plaintiff did not toll the time for filing the action for contribution.id.the fourth district also rejected the plaintiff argument that the district court previous decision in walt disney world memorial hospital,so d dca,also applied to the presuit screening process in chapter,florida statutes.in walt disney,the fourth district concluded that disney world claim for contribution against memorial hospital was subject to the medical malpractice mediation requirements.id.at.in wendel,however,the fourth district concluded that section more narrowly defines those claims subject to presuit screening procedures than did its predecessor statute which was at issue in walt disney.wendel,so d at.
this court accepted review to resolve the conflict between wendel and virginia insurance reciprocal on this issue.
discussion 
the conflict issue involves the intersection of statutory provisions of the uniform contribution among tortfeasors act and the florida medical malpractice act when an action for contribution is based on medical malpractice.section,the uniform contribution among tortfeasors act,governs the procedure to be followed by petitioners who file contribution claims based on an injury to person or property or a wrongful death.section d specifically provides that an action for contribution is barred unless the tortfeasor seeking contribution commences the action for contribution within one year after paying an agreement for liability.chapter sets out a complex presuit investigation procedure that both the claimant and the defendant must follow before a medical negligence claim may be brought in court.the legislature has unambiguously dictated 
no action shall be filed for personal injury or wrongful death arising out of medical negligence,whether in tort or contract,unless the attorney filing the action has made a reasonable investigation as permitted by the circumstances to determine that there are grounds for a good faith belief that there has been negligence in the care or treatment of the claimant.
stat.even after satisfying this prerequisite,a potential claimant must follow the procedures outlined in section,florida statutes supp,before filing a medical malpractice action.section requires notice to all prospective defendants of the claimant intent to initiate litigation for medical malpractice section provides that the suit may not be filed for ninety days after this notice is mailed to the prospective defendants and section tolls the statute of limitations during this period as to all potential defendants the certified conflict requires us to determine which statutory provision controls when there is a question concerning the applicable statute of limitations for a contribution action based on an underlying medical malpractice claim.more specifically,we must determine whether the statute of limitations outlined in section d relating to contribution actions was tolled during compliance with the presuit screening procedure in chapter.in order to make this determination,we must first examine the legislative intent in enacting these provisions.
legislative intent must be determined primarily from the language of the statute.see aetna cas.sur.huntington bank,so d.section a,which outlines the presuit procedures for medical malpractice actions,defines a claim for medical malpractice as a claim arising out of the rendering of,or the failure to render,medical care or services.section a provides that a right to contribution occurs where two or more persons become jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property,or for the same wrongful death.further,there is a right of contribution among the tortfeasors even though judgment has not been recovered against all or any of them.id.while neither statute explicitly references the other,the language of each statute implicitly refers to the other.for instance,the injury referred to in section a can arise in any number of tortious contexts,inc
