are contractual predispute jury waivers in civil actions enforceable under california law the parties in this case knowingly entered into such a waiver and the trial court enforced it,relying on trizec properties,superior court d.trizec.a careful review of california relevant constitutional history has convinced us,however,that trizec was wrongly decided.since its enactment more than years ago,the california constitution has provided that only the legislature may prescribe the method for waiving a civil jury.in code of civil procedure section,the legislature has enacted the sole means for selecting a court rather than a jury trial in a civil case.since neither this section nor any other statute suggested by real party in interest authorizes contractual predispute jury waivers,the parties agreement is unenforceable.
background 
petitioners retained real party in interest,pricewaterhousecoopers pwc,to perform an independent audit on the accounting records of two limited partnerships,grafton and allied.the parties engagement letter contained the following predispute jury waiver in the unlikely event that differences concerning pwc services or fees should arise that are not resolved by mutual agreement,to facilitate judicial resolution and save time and expense of both parties,grafton and allied and pwc agree not to demand a trial by jury in any action,proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to pwc services and fees for this engagement.
a dispute later arose and petitioners sued pwc,alleging claims for breach of contract,active concealment,professional negligence,and aiding and abetting and conspiracy to breach fiduciary duty.petitioners demanded a jury trial,and pwc moved to strike the demand based on the waiver clause in the engagement letter.petitioners opposed the motion,asserting that predispute jury waivers are not authorized by statute and,therefore,are invalid under article i,section of the california constitution.relying on trizec,the trial court granted pwc motion,striking the jury demand.this writ petition followed.
discussion 
i.the propriety of writ review 
a ruling denying a party claim to trial by jury is reviewable by writ or on appeal from the judgment.selby constructors mccarthy d.since the improper denial of the right to jury trial is reversible error per se martin county of los angeles th,d,writ review is appropriate to save the time and resources that otherwise would be expended in a needless and unwarranted court trial.selby,at.turlock golf.club superior court d.
ii.the california constitutional right to a jury trial in civil cases 
the california constitution,as originally adopted in,set out the right to a jury trial in the strongest possible terms t he right of trial by jury shall be secured to all,and remain inviolate for ever but a jury trial may be waived by the parties in all civil cases in the manner to be prescribed by law.exline smith cal,wl exline,quoting cal.const.of,art.i.soon after the constitution adoption,the legislature enacted a statute that set out specific situations in which a civil jury is deemed waived and then added,the court may prescribe by rule what shall be deemed a waiver in other cases.exline,at,quoting of the cal.civil practice act stats,ch.
in exline the supreme court considered a jury waiver that arose under a court rule adopted pursuant to the statute of the cal.civil practice act.the supreme court concluded that our constitution forbids the creation of judicial rules of waiver,even if such rules are promulgated pursuant to a legislative delegation of such power to the judiciary.the court interpreted the phrase prescribed by law within article i,section,of the california constitution of,to mean that the legislature,alone,had the power to determine the circumstances under which a jury could be waived.the constitution has imposed the power as well as the necessity upon the legislature,of determining in what cases a jury trial may be waived,which can not be transferred or delegated to any other department of government.the words prescribed by law,look to actual legislation upon the subject,and in no just sense can be extended to a permission of the exercise of this power to others.t he power to prescribe by law is legislative,and can not be conferred on judicial officers exline,supra,cal.at.
since exline,the constitutional requirement that the legislature prescribe the methods for a civil jury waiver has become firmly rooted.our supreme court has,on numerous occasions,stricken trial court rules and disapproved of appellate court decisions creating nonstatutory waivers.see people metropolitan surety cal,invalidating local rule setting out nonstatutory basis for waiver biggs lloyd cal,same see robinson puls cal d,disapproving district courts of appeal cases finding waiver when party with legal and equitable claims failed to specify jury issues in its jury demand.
efforts to modify the california constitution have reinforced the holding of that case.in the constitutional convention of it was proposed that the requirement of legislative action be deleted and the authority to waive a civil jury be granted to the parties on their own or acting with judicial approval the primary argument advanced on behalf of the proposed amendments was that the parties should have the freedom to agree to waive a right that belonged to them.yet,the convention rejected these proposals and reenacted the jury waiver provision without material change.in relevant part,the new provision stated a trial by jury may be waived in civil actions by the consent of the parties,signified in such manner as may be prescribed by law.cal.const.of,art.i.because the constitutional convention of reenacted the prescribed by law terminology contained in the former versions of the california constitution,it effectively incorporated exline construction of that phrase.see sarracino superior court cal d.
nearly a century later,in,the california constitution revision commission considered the impact of the right to jury trial on overcrowded court dockets,but concluded it lacked the expertise to prescribe significant changes,while other,more capable bodies were studying the problem transcript,cal.const.revision com.meeting of july.the commission did adopt one pertinent modification,further clarifying that only the legislature may prescribe the manner in which parties may consent to a civil jury waiver in a civil cause a jury may be waived by the consent of the parties expressed as prescribed by statute.minutes,cal.const.revision com.meeting of,italics added.later,the legislature submitted this revision to the voters,who approved it in november.ballot,proposed amends.to cal.const.with arguments to voters.the current jury waiver provision,now contained in article i,section of the california constitution,retains this language.
hence,california constitutional history reflects an unwavering commitment to the principle that the right to a civil jury trial may be waived only as the legislature prescribes,even in the face of concerns that the interests of the parties and the courts would benefit from a relaxation of this requirement.
when it upheld a contractual predispute jury waiver,the trizec court never addressed this constitutional history.in trizec,the trial court had upheld the tenant constitutional challenge to a predispute jury waiver provision contained in a commercial lease.trizec reversed,but its analysis was limited to the comment,a rticle i,section,of the california constitution can not be read to prohibit individuals from waiving,in advance of any pending action,the right to trial by jury in a civil case.trizec,supra,d at.the court went on to hold,we do not mean to imply that contractual waivers of trial by jury will be upheld in all instances,or that such rights will be taken away from a party who unknowingly signs a document purporting to exact a waiver.the right to trial by jury in a civil case is a substantial one not lightly to be deemed waived.on the other hand,in many commercial transactions advance assurance that any disputes that may arise will be subject to expeditious resolution in a court trial would best serve the needs of the contracting parties as well as that of our overburdened judicial system.trizec,at.
we have no quarrel with the policy behind trizec rule permitting parties to a commercial contract to knowingly and voluntarily enter into a contractual predispute jury waiver.we do question its provenance,however.this rule reflects the court balancing of the policy factors it considered determinative.trizec does not suggest any statutory source for the rule.as our recitation of california constitutional history reveals,unless the legislature prescribes a jury waiver method,we can not enforce it.
iii.code of civil procedure section 
by its express terms,code of civil procedure section is the lone statute authorizing waiver of a civil jury trial in favor of a court trial.see parker james granger,cal d,people metropolitan surety,supra,cal.at,de castro rowe d.section,subdivision a now provides the right to a trial by jury as declared by section of article i of the california constitution shall be preserved to the parties inviolate.in civil cases,a jury may only be waived pursuant to subdivision d.subdivision d sets forth six specific means through which such a waiver can occur a party waives trial by jury in any of the following ways by failing to appear at the trial.by written consent filed with the clerk or judge.by oral consent,in open court,entered in the minutes.by failing to announce that a jury is required,at the time the cause is first set for trial,if it is set upon notice or stipulation,or within five days after notice of setting if it is set without notice or stipulation.by failing to deposit with the clerk,or judge,advance jury fees as provided in subdivision b.by failing to deposit with the clerk or judge,at the beginning of the second and each succeeding day session,the sum provided in subdivision c.
pwc contends that the waiver in the engagement letter complies with section,subdivision d,because pwc filed the written waiver with the clerk or judge as an exhibit to pwc motion to strike the demand for jury trial.pwc correctly argues in its brief that nothing in the language of section or its legislative history explicitly provides for a temporal limitation on when the written consent referred to in section,subdivision d should have been executed.underscoring in original.thus,according to pwc,a written,predispute jury waiver filed following the commencement of a civil lawsuit is valid.
we conclude that the supreme court construction of section,and the language of and policies underlying article,section of the california constitution compel a different result.in madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d,madden,the supreme court determined that only parties to a pending civil action may utilize the jury waiver methods set out in section.there,a party had challenged the validity of an arbitration agreement,entered into pursuant to the california arbitration act caa et arguing that since arbitration implicitly waived a jury trial,the agreement had to comply with section.madden,at.in rejecting this contention,the court held that section does not apply to a predispute arbitration agreement and that each of the waiver methods prescribed by that section presupposes a pending action,and relates only to the manner in which a party to such action can waive his or her right to demand a jury trial instead of a court trial.madden,at.if only parties to a pending action may waive a jury under section,then it is logical to conclude that both the execution of the written consent and the filing of that consent must occur during the pendency of the civil action.in fact,trizec relied on madden reasoning to hold that section did not authorize predispute jury waivers.trizec,supra,d at.it is noteworthy that every other method to effectuate waiver set out in section requires an act or omission in the midst of an ongoing lawsuit.we see no good reason to adopt pwc anomalous interpretation of section,subdivision d 
additionally,the plain language of,and policies implicit in article i,section of the california constitution preclude us from adopting pwc construction of section to authorize predispute civil jury waivers.article i,section requires that the legislature prescribe the manner in which a jury may be waived.prescribe means to lay down a rule dictate.webster collegiate dict.ed.it is manifest that the timing of the waiver may be significant,given the importance of the right involved.depending upon their level of sophistication,parties considering a jury waiver postdispute may be far more aware of the consequences of such a decision and,therefore,exercise more care than when the initial contract was executed.the lack of legislative direction in section on the enforceability of predispute jury waivers hardly constitutes the legislative prescription required by our constitution.we decline to read into section,subdivision d an authorization for predispute jury waivers that the legislature has not provided.
as we have previously explained,despite modification efforts,the california constitution has always imposed the power as well as the necessity upon the legislature to specify the manner in which a civil jury may be waived.exline,supra,cal.at.consequently,it is the job of the legislature,not the courts,to evaluate competing policy concerns and,then,select the applicable rules.section simply does not contemplate enforcement of a contractual predispute jury waiver.even though we recognize that good policy arguments can be made to support or oppose contractual predispute jury waivers the constitution denies us the ability to fashion a waiver procedure on a basis.we may not validate the instant waiver entered into by sophisticated business entities,while reserving judgment on other contractual waivers until cases properly present them for review.as yet,the legislature has not made the difficult policy choices involved,and w e will not,and can not,do what the legislature could have,but did not do.people castille th,d.
iv.the california arbitration act 
the caa effectively permits parties to waive a jury trial by agreeing to arbitrate,and these agreements may be entered into before any dispute has arisen.as discussed in part iii,in madden it was argued that such agreements violate article i,section of the california constitution because the procedure set out in the caa fails to conform to section.the supreme court rejected this argument,concluding that the caa and section are fundamentally different section relates only to the manner in which a party to an action can waive his right to demand a jury trial instead of a court trial.it does not purport to prevent parties from avoiding jury trial by not submitting their controversy to a court of law in the first instance.madden,supra,cal d at,italics added.
in its brief analysis of the jury waiver issue,found that madden approval of predispute arbitration agreements supported the conclusion that the parties contractual predispute jury waiver was enforceable.trizec,supra,d at.pwc adopts this position and argues that the right to enter into a predispute jury waiver,like the one challenged here,is implicit in the caa this argument turns madden on its head.in madden,the supreme court decision hinged on the distinction between an agreement opting for a court trial in the judicial forum,which is governed by section,and an agreement opting out of the judicial forum entirely.yet,trizec and pwc would have us ignore that fundamental distinction and conclude that the two types of agreements are so similar that the legislature approval of one necessarily implies its approval of the other.
jury trials are unique to the judicial system.the legislature authorization of agreements to resolve disputes in a nonjudicial forum,which leads to the loss of a package of procedural rights,does not necessarily imply approval of agreements to modify the judicial forum to eliminate one of those rights.pwc argument also overlooks a public policy difference that may explain the legislature disparate treatment of these two dispute resolution systems.there is both a federal and state public policy in favor of enforcing an agreement to arbitrate d
