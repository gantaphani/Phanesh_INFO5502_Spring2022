background 
on april,linda and her husband,art,filed a complaint against defendants myron stachniw,galesburg cottage hospital galesburg,cottage health care systems cottage health,galesburg orthopedic services,orthopedic,cottage home options cottage home and medical supplies and service.the complaint alleged that defendants were negligent on may,may,and may.the complaint did not have an attached medical report,as required by section a of the code ilcs a west.instead,plaintiffs counsel attached an attorney affidavit requesting days to file a report,as is allowed by section a of the code ilcs a west.upon filing their complaint,plaintiffs instructed the clerk not to issue a summons.no summons was issued on any defendant.
on may,plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their suit pursuant to section of the code ilcs west.section a provides the plaintiff may,at any time before trial or hearing begins,upon notice to each party who has appeared or each such party attorney,and upon payment of costs,dismiss his or her action or any part thereof as to any defendant,without prejudice,by order filed in the cause.ilcs a west.
on april,plaintiffs refiled their complaint under section of the code,which provides 
in any act or contract where the time for commencing an action is limited,if the action is voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff,then,whether or not the time limitation for bringing such action expires during the pendency of such action,the plaintiff,his or her heirs,executors or administrators may commence a new action within one year or within the remaining period of limitation,whichever is greater,after the action is voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff.ilcs west.
plaintiffs refiled complaint alleged the same dates of negligence by the same defendants as set forth in the first complaint,with the addition of a charge of negligence against cottage health on june.the required medical report was attached to the complaint.process was served on orthopedic on april,and on all other defendants on april.
on may,after receiving the refiled complaint,defendants filed motions to dismiss,arguing that the two years allowed by section of the code ilcs west for filing claims of medical malpractice had passed since the last alleged date of negligence in the complaint they received.defendants then filed an answer to the complaint.
on august,plaintiffs responded to defendants motion to dismiss by stating that they did not violate the statute of limitations because their original complaint was filed on april,which was less than two years after the alleged dates of negligence in may.plaintiffs further alleged in their response to defendants motion to dismiss that they filed their new complaint on april,within one year of the voluntary dismissal.
when defendants learned that plaintiffs had previously filed and voluntarily dismissed the case,and purposely withheld issuing a summons,they filed a motion to withdraw their answer to the complaint.defendants then filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of reasonable diligence in serving process in violation of illinois supreme court rule b,which provides 
if the plaintiff fails to exercise reasonable diligence to obtain service on a defendant,the action as to that defendant may be dismissed without prejudice,with the right to refile if the statute of limitation has not run.the dismissal may be made on the application of any defendant or on the court own motion.b.
after a hearing on february,the circuit court held that plaintiffs had violated rule b and dismissed the case with prejudice.the circuit court explained its decision in a letter opinion,in which it held that all of the factors it had to consider weighed in favor of defendants.the court held,
the length of time used in serving the defendants was a few days short of one year after filing.the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case within a month of filing it,and requested that the clerk hold summons.the defendants are all health care providers in galesburg,and their locations are readily ascertainable.the defendants had no actual knowledge of the complaint as evidenced by the fact that they filed a motion to withdraw their answers after learning of the previous complaint.the plaintiffs did not advance any special circumstances affecting their actions.finally,the defendants were all served within a few days of the complaint being filed.
the court also held,
i n lewis dillon,d,dist,the first district,in dicta,warned against the exact circumstances of this case when it said,under plaintiff reasoning,a party would be permitted to file a lawsuit naming a defendant,not issue summons to that defendant advising him or her of the claim,and then,at some later date,dismiss the defendant due to the inability to obtain a section report.to follow this reasoning of what they do know wo hurt them would deny defendants the right to know that they have been named in a lawsuit,not to mention denying them the protections of rule b.this is precisely what happened in the case sub judice.
the appellate court affirmed the circuit court,with one justice dissenting.in his dissent,justice lytton stated that the decisions of the circuit court and the majority ignored plaintiff statutory right to refile their suit under section of the code of civil procedure.the dissent stated,in order to accomplish the purpose of both supreme court rule b and section of the code,courts must consider a plaintiff diligence prior to dismissal and after refiling but not the period in between when no complaint exists.counting only the days that passed while the complaints were on file,the dissent found that defendant went unserved for only days.the dissent found that such a short period of time does not demonstrate a lack of diligence.we granted plaintiff petition for leave to appeal.
the issue before us is whether the circuit court erred when it granted defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint based on violation of supreme court rule b.a court may consider many factors when determining whether to allow or deny a rule b motion,including,but not limited to the length of time used to obtain service of process the activities of plaintiff plaintiff knowledge of defendant location the ease with which defendant whereabouts could have been ascertained actual knowledge on the part of the defendant of pendency of the action as a result of ineffective service special circumstances that would affect plaintiff efforts and actual service on defendant.segal sacco.there is no specific time limitation provided by rule b.rather,a court must consider the passage of time in relation to all the other facts and circumstances of each case individually.segal,at.a ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to rule b will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.womick jackson county nursing home.
in order to determine if the circuit court abused its discretion by granting defendants motion to dismiss,we must resolve the threshold issue of whether it was proper for the circuit court to have counted the approximately months that passed between the voluntary dismissal of plaintiffs complaint on may,and its refiling on april,in its determination of whether plaintiffs obtained service of process on defendants with reasonable diligence.such a determination requires us to interpret rule b and section of the code and is subject to de novo review.see kankakee county board of review property tax appeal board,questions of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo.
before this court,plaintiffs argue that the circuit court should have considered their diligence in serving defendants prior to dismissal and after refiling,but not the period in between when no complaint existed.plaintiffs cite aranda hobart manufacturing,in support of their argument.
in aranda,the plaintiff complaint was dismissed for want of prosecution approximately months after it was filed.aranda,at.the defendant was never served with process during this time period.six months later,and three months after the running of the relevant statute of limitations,the plaintiff filed an identical action pursuant to section of the limitations act,ch,par.the predecessor to section and promptly served the defendant with process.aranda,at.the defendant moved for dismissal pursuant to rule b.aranda,at.the circuit court then dismissed the case with prejudice,finding that the length of time between the filing of the first suit and the service of summons upon refiling showed a lack of diligence by the plaintiff.aranda,at.
on appeal,we reversed the circuit court,holding that section gave plaintiff an absolute right to refile since his complaint was dismissed for want of prosecution,and his complaint was refiled within the time specified by the statute.aranda,at,citing franzese trinko.specifically,we held 
defendant motion to dismiss plaintiff second suit was bottomed on plaintiff overall lack of diligence in obtaining service of summons from september,the date of the filing of the complaint in the first case,until july,the date of service of summons in the second case.service was obtained within days after the filing of the complaint in the second case,which is certainly not a flagrant display of lack of diligence.if the extended period of time of section is to serve any useful purpose,plaintiff must be accorded a reasonable time after refiling his complaint within which to obtain service.we do not say that the court when passing on a motion such as the defendant has filed in this case may not consider an overall span of time between the filing of the first complaint and the ultimate service of summons in the second case in assessing plaintiff diligence.in doing so,however,the period of time within which plaintiff must obtain service following the refiling of his suit under section can not be so abbreviated as to make the right granted by that section meaningless.aranda,at.
plaintiffs argue that,by including the time between dismissal and refiling in its consideration of reasonable diligence,the appellate court has limited plaintiffs use of section to the extent that the right to refile granted by that statute is essentially meaningless.we agree.
section operates as a savings statute,with the purpose of facilitating the disposition of litigation on the merits and avoiding its frustration upon grounds unrelated to the merits.vaughan oil caldwell,troutt alexander.section grants a plaintiff who voluntarily dismisses his complaint the right to refile within one year or within the remaining period of limitation,whichever is greater.ilcs west.if we were to hold that the rule b clock may continue running after a complaint is dismissed,we would essentially be reducing the time to refile granted by section from one year or within the remaining period of limitation,whichever is greater,to a period subject to the discretion of the circuit court.as we held in aranda,section grants a plaintiff the absolute right to refile a dismissed complaint.we may not infringe upon this statutory right to refile.
defendants do not argue that plaintiffs do not have a statutory right to refile,but contend that such a right is still subject to the expectations of reasonable diligence that rule b was created to enforce.in support of their argument,defendants cite several passages from francis hospital,that emphasize how rule b effectuates our historical and constitutional mandate to render justice fairly and without delay.defendants quote passages such as n othing is more critical to the judicial function than the administration of justice without delay and d ue diligence in serving process is essential to this purpose,for it is the sole legally sufficient means of alerting defendants to the pendency of a civil suit,at.as applied to this case,however,does not support defendants argument,as the decision relates only to pending actions.
in,the plaintiff filed his complaint on the last day possible under the statute of limitations,then served the defendants some eight months later,at.when the defendants filed a rule b motion to dismiss,the plaintiff filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss his complaint under section,which the court granted,at.less than a month later,plaintiff refiled his complaint pursuant to section and served defendants with process,at.the defendants then filed another rule b motion to dismiss,at.apparently believing that the plaintiff had an absolute right to refile under section even when a rule b motion was pending,the circuit court denied the defendants rule b motion without holding a hearing on the merits,at.
we reversed the circuit court and remanded the case to the circuit court,holding 
w here a plaintiff relies on section and in response to a pending rule b motion,the rule b motion must be heard on its merits prior to a ruling on plaintiff motion to dismiss under section.we further hold that,in ruling on the pending rule b motions,the trial court may consider the circumstances surrounding plaintiff service of process on his original as well as his refiled complaint,at.
in the instant case,there was no delay of a pending action such as there was in.this is an important difference between the cases because the pendency of an action that a defendant argues is delayed is central to any determination of whether a passage of time should be considered for purposes of rule b.see,at,due diligence is the sole legally sufficient means of alerting defendants to the pendency of a civil suit emphasis added.the requirement of a pending action against which to measure diligence is rooted in simple logic.if an action is dismissed,and not pending,there is no reason to serve a defendant with process.as such,there is nothing to delay,and nothing to be diligent about.see also segal,at,the fifth factor a circuit court is instructed to consider when determining due diligence is actual knowledge of pendency of the action as a result of ineffective service emphasis added womick,at,actual notice of the pendency of a suit is significant in that it may affect a court determination of whether a plaintiff was diligent lafin allstate insurance,d,the specific purpose of rule b is to alert defendants to the pendency of a civil suit emphasis added.
defendants also rely on muskat sternberg,in support of their argument.in muskat,the plaintiff filed her complaint one day before the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations.muskat,at.during the next two years,the plaintiff did not obtain service of process on any of the defendants.muskat,at.the action was then dismissed for want of prosecution.muskat,at.the plaintiff refiled her complaint a year later pursuant to section.muskat,at.defendants were served with process three months after the refiling and responded by filing a rule b motion to dismiss.muskat,at.the circuit court denied defendants motion,holding that only the time between the refiling and the service on defendants was to be counted,and that three months did not constitute lack of diligence.muskat,at.the appellate court reversed and remanded the case,holding that the plaintiff lack of reasonable diligence in obtaining service in the original lawsuit may be considered in ruling on a rule b motion.muskat,at.
we affirmed the appellate court and remanded the case to the circuit court.i
