ryan lee collins,a minor,sued sutter memorial hospital sutter,alleging medical malpractice.the trial court granted sutter motion for summary judgment and entered a defense judgment.the trial court later granted collins a new trial and vacated the judgment,finding summary judgment had been granted in error.sutter appeals.the appeal lies.code civ,subd.a.
on appeal,sutter does not attack the substantive merits of the new trial order.instead,sutter principally contends the order granting a new trial must be reversed both because it was entered after the trial court lost jurisdiction to act and because the order specified a different ground than that stated in collins notice of intent to move for a new trial.
we reject sutter claim that the trial court lost jurisdiction to act on collins motion for a new trial.we also conclude that although collins counsel cited the wrong ground for a new trial in the notice of intent,the timely memorandum in support of the motion notified sutter of the correct ground.sutter was not at all misled.indeed,sutter opposition to collins motion for new trial addressed the issues underlying the correct ground,and there is no indication sutter would have done anything differently had the correct ground been stated in the notice of intent.accordingly,the trial court did not err by basing its new trial order on this ground.
therefore,we shall affirm.
procedural background 
because sutter does not challenge the substance of the trial court order granting collins motion for new trial,which in effect denied sutter summary judgment motion,we omit the factual details adduced on summary judgment.
the complaint alleged sutter nursing staff mishandled collins natal treatment,causing him injuries 
after it answered the complaint,sutter moved for summary judgment,producing evidence that its staff acted within the standard of care.collins opposed the motion,relying on a declaration by nursing expert roberta durham,detailing purported failings by sutter nursing staff.sutter objected to durham declaration,in part arguing that the records durham stated she had reviewed were not properly authenticated,and that her declaration failed to show sutter nursing staff acted below the standard of care.
in his opposition,collins stated sutter had submitted all the relevant medical records and collins was comfortable relying on those records.however,durham declaration had not explicitly stated that she relied on the medical records submitted with sutter motion.
on august,judge loncke issued a tentative ruling sustaining sutter objections.the matter was argued in front of judge loncke on the same day.after taking the matter under submission,judge loncke ordered that collins could file an amended declaration by durham.judge loncke order reads as follows no later than august,collins may file and serve an amended declaration by durham,in compliance with ccp.the declaration may be amended only with respect to what medical records and deposition testimony she reviewed.if,for example,dr.durham relied on the medical records and deposition testimony sutter filed in support of its motion,she may so state.the declaration may not otherwise be amended.no later than august,sutter may file and serve an objection to durham amended declaration.
on august,collins filed durham amended declaration.copies of the medical records durham reviewed were attached to the amended declaration.durham declared that these records were true and correct cop ies,but the records did not include an authenticating declaration from sutter custodian of records.
on august,sutter filed an objection to the amended declaration and attached records,objecting on the same grounds previously asserted.
on august,judge loncke issued a minute order affirming the august tentative ruling,noting that durham amended declaration was still defective.judge loncke concluded,durham statement that she attached true and correct copies of defendant medical records is insufficient to authenticate those records.as a result,there is still no admissible evidence before the court upon which durham bases her expert opinion a n expert opinion without evidentiary support has no evidentiary value.
on september,the court issued an order granting sutter motion for summary judgment.
on september,sutter served on collins notice of entry of the order granting summary judgment.in the notice,sutter referred to the order as a judgment.
on september,collins filed a notice of intent to move for a new trial.collins notice of intent also mistakenly referred to the order granting summary judgment as a judgment.
the sole statutory ground stated in collins notice of intent was that the decision is against law as provided by section,subdivision.
on september,judge chang entered judgment in favor of sutter and against collins.
on october,collins moved to vacate the judgment pursuant to section.
also on october,collins filed a memorandum in support of his motions for a new trial and to vacate the judgment.in noting that a new trial motion is a proper vehicle for challenging a grant of summary judgment,collins cited the against law ground set forth in section,subdivision.substantively,he argued it had not been necessary to authenticate the records durham reviewed because they provided foundational facts established by sutter moving papers,and were.this substantive argument was labeled,the court decision is legally erroneous.collins concluded his argument by saying t he court decision is against law and the product of legal error.italics added.
on october,sutter served notice of entry of judgment on collins.
on october,sutter filed its opposition to collins motion for a new trial.sutter argued the summary judgment had been granted based on two independent grounds related to durham declaration,the procedural ground of lack of foundation and the substantive ground that it did not establish a breach of the standard of care.
sutter also argued in its written opposition that the new trial motion was defective because the only ground specified in the notice of intent was that the judgment was against law,and that ground did not cover the error described by collins memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion.yet,sutter also argued in any event,the trial court is expressly enjoined by article vi,section of the california constitution from granting a new trial for error of law under unless such error is prejudicial.citation.italics added.sutter then argued that because judge loncke sustained its objection that durham opinion on the standard of care was inappropriately conclusory,that was an independent ground of decision,and that any error related to the authenticity objection was harmless.
on october,collins filed a reply in which he explicitly argued the e rror in law ground provided by section,subdivision.collins counsel also represented that an amendment to the notice of intent to move for a new trial had been filed to add the ground of error in law.he argued this formal amended notice was timely.however,collins counsel now concedes on appeal that no such amended notice was ever filed.
in his reply,collins also responded to sutter assertion that durham declaration was too conclusory,first contending that judge loncke had rejected that assertion after oral argument on the summary judgment motion and then detailing how durham described the conduct of sutter nurses that fell below the standard of care.
on november,judge culhane heard oral argument on the motion for a new trial and the motion to vacate the judgment.judge loncke was unavailable.see.collins argued that judge loncke had found durham declaration would be sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact regarding a breach of the standard of care if the documents she had relied on were properly authenticated collins pointed out that judge loncke august tentative ruling allowed a limited,technical amendment to durham declaration,which would have been a useless act had the declaration not been substantively sufficient to raise a triable issue.counsel for sutter,who had not been present at the august hearing,speculated that judge loncke simply wanted to give collins a chance to correct the procedural mistake and establish that his expert relied on authenticated records.sutter then argued the amended declaration was substantively deficient,contending again that durham declaration was too conclusory to present a triable issue of fact on the standard of care.
after judge culhane stated he would take the matter under submission,collins counsel told the court that because the notice of intent to move for a new trial had been filed on september,the last day to grant the motion was november,days later.sutter did not object to this statement or otherwise state its current position that the last day was the very day this hearing took place,november.
on november,judge culhane issued a minute order granting collins motions.on the authentication issue,judge culhane determined that the medical records upon which durham relied were properly authenticated.on the issue of whether durham opinion on the standard of care was conclusory,judge culhane found judge loncke would not have allowed a technical amendment to durham declaration if the court had been inclined to otherwise exclude the declaration on the ground that the doctor opinions were too conclusory.noting that the new trial motion required him to independently review the record and determine whether summary judgment was properly granted,judge culhane found durham declaration passes muster but just barely,in that,liberally construed,it raised a triable issue by stating what the standard of care required and how sutter nurses allegedly failed to meet it.since this court concludes that durham declaration is sufficient,albeit just barely,to create a triable issue of fact,it follows that the granting of summary judgment here was erroneous.accordingly,pursuant to code of civil procedure and,this court exercises its power to vacate both the order granting defendant motion for summary judgment and the judgment entered in defendant favor,and to return this matter to the civil active list.
judge culhane order directed collins counsel to prepare a formal order.in a letter dated november,collins counsel correctly pointed out that the court itself had to prepare the order.see mercer perez cal d.counsel for collins also told the court the last date for the trial court to enter an order granting a new trial would be november,although the reasons supporting the new trial order could be filed within days after filing the order.
sutter did not respond to the assertions in the letter,and sutter never informed the trial court that it was of the opinion that the last day to rule on the new trial motion was actually november,the day the motion was argued.
on november,exactly days after collins filed his notice of intent to file a new trial motion,judge chang issued a minute order granting the motion for a new trial upon the ground that the earlier summary judgment resulted from an error in law under section,subdivision.the record does not explain why judge chang,instead of judge culhane,issued this order.however,sutter does not raise any claim regarding judge chang making the final order granting a new trial.
sutter timely filed this appeal.
discussion 
timeliness of the order granting a new trial 
an order granting a new trial must be made within the day period provided by section.sanchez corea bank of america cal d,sanchez corea.resolution of the issue with which we are presented in this case turns on identifying the event that triggered the day clock.
sutter contends the september notice of order granting summary judgment was the triggering event.sutter argues that the september order granting summary judgment was the rendition of judgment,notice of entry of which triggered the day clock for the trial court to rule on the new trial motion.if the september notice of entry of the summary judgment order triggered the day period,the new trial order should have been issued on or before november,and the new trial orders issued on november and were untimely.section time limits are mandatory and jurisdictional.a n order made after the day period purporting to rule on a motion for new trial is in excess of the court jurisdiction and void.siegal superior court cal d.
collins contends the day period was not triggered until he filed his notice of intent to move for a new trial on september.therefore,the november and november new trial orders were timely.we agree with collins.
as we shall explain,the order granting summary judgment was the rendition of judgment for purposes of ensuring the motion for new trial was not prematurely filed under section,subdivision.however,notice of entry of that order was not the same as notice of entry of a judgment that triggers the day period to rule on a new trial motion under section.
three possible event triggers for starting the day clock are set forth in section.section provides in relevant part,the power of the court to rule on a motion for a new trial shall expire days from and after the mailing of notice of entry of judgment by the clerk of the court pursuant to section or days from and after service on the moving party by any party of written notice of the entry of the judgment,whichever is earlier,or if such notice has not theretofore been given,then days after filing of the first notice of intention to move for a new trial.if such motion is not determined within said period of days,or within said period as thus extended,the effect shall be a denial of the motion without further order of the court,par.the clerk did not provide notice of entry of judgment in this case.it is the second and third event triggers with which we concern ourselves,and the resolution of this case ultimately turns on the third event trigger,the notice of intention to move for a new trial.
section provides that a party must file a notice of intention to move for a new trial,and allows the party to do so either.before the entry of judgment or.within days of the date of mailing notice of entry of judgment by the clerk or service upon him by any party of written notice of entry of judgment,or within days after the entry of judgment,whichever is earliest.but the motion can not be made until there is a decision in the case.the statutory scheme on new trials makes it quite evident that a new trial is not proper until the action has been prosecuted to a point where it can be said to be complete.auto equity sales,superior court cal d,auto equity.
as this court explained in an earlier case section allows a notice of motion to be filed prior to the entry of the judgment but as witkin states,the phrase before the entry of judgment is obscure,misleading and a dangerous trap for the uninformed attorney.citation.section defines a new trial as a of an issue of fact in the same court after a trial and decision by a jury,court or referee.italics added.section states that,the verdict may be vacated and any other decision may be modified or vacated in whole or in part upon a motion by the party aggrieved.case authority holds that until there has been a decision there is no aggrieved party.ehrler ehrler d,ehrler.
it is now settled that a notice of intent may not be filed until there has been a dispositive ruling.witkin,cal.procedure ed.attack on judgment in trial court.a notice of intention to move for a new trial is premature and void if filed before there has been a trial and decision.code civ.as succinctly stated by witkin,that decision is the rendition of judgment by the verdict of the jury or the signed and filed findings of the court.auto equity,supra,cal d at,italics added by auto equity see witkin,supra,attack on judgment in trial court.
the parties agree that,in the context of a motion for summary judgment,rendition of judgment occurs when the written order granting summary judgment is entered.sole energy petrominerals th,sole energy see witkin,supra,attack on judgment in trial court.the parties agree the court rendered judgment when the order granting summary judgment was entered on september.this ruling allowed collins to file the notice of intent b efore the entry of judgment as provided by section,subdivision,without his notice of intent being deemed premature.sole energy,supra,th at.
sutter relies upon sole energy for the proposition that the written order granting summary judgment triggers the day clock.but,as stated by gardenswartz equitable.soc.d supp,cited in sole energy,supra,th at the order for summary judgment can not be regarded as in itself a judgment,as appellant contends.it directs what the judgment shall be and amounts to the rendition of judgment,but it is not itself the judgment.thus,to the extent sutter reads sole energy to mean a summary judgment order equates to a judgment for all purposes,sutter reads too much into it.the court in sole energy merely held a ruling on summary judgment was sufficient to avoid the prematurity trap created by the b efore the entry of judgment language of section,subdivision.
sutter points out that collins referred to the september order granting summary judgment as a judgment.the fact that collins mislabeled the order granting summary judgment a judgment as did sutter in its notice of entry of that order does not make it a judgment.a typical immaterial mistake is a reference,in the statement of grounds,to the judgment rather than the decision,or,where the case was tried by the court,to the verdict rather than the decision.mistakes of this type do not affect the sufficiency of a notice that distinctly informs the adverse party that a new trial is being sought.witkin,supra,attack on judgment in trial court.
sutter also points out that the notice of intent was filed on september,days after notice of entry of the september order,and that days is the period specified in section,subdivision for moving for a new trial after entry of judgment.sutter contends that this shows collins treated the order granting summary judgment as a judgment.it may be that collins mistakenly thought the day period provided by section,subdivision also applied to section,subdivision,which does not state any period of time in which to file a notice that is made b efore judgment.or it could be that collins mistook the order granting summary judgment for a judgment,focusing on sutter reference to the order as a judgment.or it may have been a coincidence that the notice was filed days after the order.but even if collins was mistaken about the nature of the summary judgment order,that does not change what it was.
collins correctly argues that an order rendering judgment is not itself a judgment.he relies in part on cases,such as this court opinion in modica merin d modica,distinguishing a nonappealable order granting summary judgment from an appealable judgment.section does not speak in terms of a ruling or order,appealable or otherwise.
when the notice of entry of judgment has been served after the notice of intent to move for a new trial,it is the notice of intent to move for a new trial that serves as the operable trigger for the day clock,not notice of the judgment.see bunton arizona pacific tanklines d,trial court lost jurisdiction because new trial order was made days after filing of notice of intention to move for a new trial and days from mailing of notice of entry of judgment by the clerk clerk mailing of notice of entry of judgment does not restart the day clock see in re marriage of liu d,unambiguously provides that the filing of the first notice of intention to move for a new trial is the operative event for determining the day period where notice of entry of judgment has not theretofore been given italics added by liu witkin,supra,attack on judgment in trial court.
here,the notice of intent to file a new trial motion was filed on september.the orders of november and were therefore timely,as they were made within the day period provided by section.
sutter contends the legislative policy calling for prompt determinations of new trial motions militates in favor of construing section to encompass a notice of entry of rulings.we see nothing ambiguous in section to construe.if the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction.niles freeman equipment joseph th.a party demonstrates statutory ambiguity by tendering an alternative candidate of meaning,that is,a grammatically plausible reading of the language at issue.ibid.as seen above,section refers to three events that can trigger the day period,mailing of notice of entry of judgment by the clerk,service of notice of entry of judgment by a party,or,if such notice has not theretofore been given,then days after filing of the first notice of intention to move for a new trial.the legislature did not use the word ruling or order in either the first or second event trigger.nor did the legislature use the term rendition of judgment.the word judgment was used.in defining the third event trigger,the one at issue in this case,the legislature omitted any reference to a judgment,in obvious recognition of the fact that some motions for a new trial will be filed before judgment as allowed by section,subdivision.reading a ruling or order granting summary judgment to be synonymous with a judgment would render subdivision of section a dead letter.construction of a statute that would render it a dead letter is disfavored.goehring chapman university th,canons of statutory construction generally preclude judicial construction that renders part of the statute meaningless or inoperative.
sutter also contends that the judgment following the order granting summary judgment is a mere formality.this may be true,but it does not change the fact that the first two triggering events defined by section speak of notice of a judgment,not rulings or orders.while an order granting summary judgment may be the rendition of judgment,such that the losing party is aggrieved and may move for a new trial without running afoul of the prematurity trap,it is not a judgment and does not trigger the day deadline.
in the reply brief,sutter relies on section,subdivision d.we do not ordinarily address such belated arguments.utz.aureguy d.nevertheless,we will put this new argument to rest.subdivision d of section states the court can order the clerk to mail notice of entry of any judgment or ruling,whether or not appealable.italics added.sutter argues that if the court ordered service of notice of entry of an order granting summary judgment,that order would trigger the day period.we disagree.
as highlighted by the italicized text above,section,subdivision d actually distinguishes between judgments and rulings,it does not equate the two.and we note that section,subdivision c defines a judgment for purposes of that statute to include any signed order from which an appeal lies.no appeal lies from an order granting summary judgment.modica,supra,d.
construing the word judgment as used in section to encompass nonappealable orders would add a concept to that section that was not written into the statute by the legislature.as this court recently emphasized,in the construction of a statute the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein,not to insert what has been omitted,or to omit what has been inserted see adoption of kelsey cal th,referring to the cardinal rule that courts may not add provisions to a statute.trackman kenney th.the legislature has the power to rewrite section if it so desires,but we are not at liberty to do so.dodge superior court th.
moreover,applying sutter unique and unprecedented construction of section would be unfair to collins and anyone else who relied on the plain meaning of sections and.this is especially true since sutter raised no objection at the november hearing when counsel for collins advised judge culhane that the deadline for granting a new trial was tied to the september notice of intent to move for a new trial,making the last day to grant the motion november.nor did sutter object when counsel for collins reminded the court in its letter of november that the court was statutorily mandated to prepare the order and that the last day to do so was november.
finally,sutter argues in the reply brief that case law uniformly holds that the event that triggers the section deadline for bringing a new trial motion also triggers the section deadline for ruling on it.sutter cites three cases in support of this claim.palmer gte california,cal th,states that notice of entry of judgment triggered the deadlines of sections and even where proof of service has not been filed with the clerk.id.at.similarly,the other two cases state that when the prevailing party serves notice of entry of judgment,the time within which a new trial motion may be made and granted begins to run.cowee marsh cal d,mccordic crawford cal d.these cases correctly state that notice of entry of judgment may start both the day clock for filing the notice of intent to move for a new trial under section,subdivision and the day clock for ruling on the motion under section.but these cases do not involve or discuss a notice of intent filed before judgment as permitted by section,subdivision,and do not plumb the ensuing disconnect between sections and,as illustrated by this case.cases are not authority for propositions not considered.hart burnett cal.therefore we reject sutter contention.
accordingly,because the trial court orders of november and were made within days of the notice of intent filed on september,they were timely made.see.
ii.wrong ground 
a new trial order can be granted only on a ground specified in the motion.malkasian irwin cal d.the right to move for a new trial is a creature of statute and the procedure prescribed by law must be closely followed.ehrler,supra,d at.normally,s trict construction of the statute ensures protection of the litigant rights.wagner singleton d,wagner.sutter contends the new trial order in this case must be reversed because it relied on a ground not stated in collins notice of intent to move for a new trial.
although collins counsel specified the wrong ground in the notice of intent to move for a new trial,we conclude no basis for reversal is shown.collins timely apprised sutter of the correct ground,and sutter addressed the correct ground in its opposition to the new trial motion.sutter rights were preserved.as will be seen,this case fits within a judicially created exception to the statutory mandate that the ground for new trial be specified in the notice of intent.
section partly provides that a new trial may be granted for any of the following causes,materially affecting the substantial rights of such party.insufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict or other decision,or the verdict or other decision is against law.error in law,occurring at the trial and excepted to by the party making the application.italics added.
a verdict or decision that is against law is ground for a new trial.citations.while this phrase could support an interpretation that would include nearly all the other grounds for the motion,its application has been sharply limited to situations not covered by other subdivisions of.the motion is available mainly in two situations a an improper verdict citation b a defective statement of decision citation.witkin,supra,attack on judgment in trial court,see sanchez corea,supra,cal d at.
sutter contends the against law ground could not be used to attack a summary judgment ruling unless the claim was that the summary judgment movant had not met its initial burden of proof,which is not the claim collins made.collins disputed the scope of the against law ground in the trial court,but does not do so on appeal.we agree with sutter that the against law ground would not support an attack on the summary judgment order herein.
such ground is to be distinguished from the confusingly similar seventh ground furnished by,subdivision,namely,error in law.mccown spencer d,fn.under this ground,a trial court may grant a new trial if its original ruling,as a matter of law,was erroneous.ramirez usaa casualty ins.d,see witkin,supra,attack on judgment in trial court.a case cited by collins applies this ground to the erroneous grant of summary judgment based on a mistake about the adequacy of an opposing expert declaration.tortorella castro th.sutter does not argue that the error in law ground would not provide a legal basis for collins attack on the summary judgment order if timely presented.
the sole ground specified in collins september notice of intent to move for a new trial was that the decision was against law as provided by section,subdivision.he also filed a motion to vacate the judgment,on the ground of incorrect or erroneous legal basis for the decision,not consistent with or not supported by the facts.see,subd.
collins provided arguments on both motions in his october memorandum of points and authorities.he did not limit his arguments to one motion or the other.rather,he asserted those arguments in support of both motions.collins stated the decision was against law,citing section,subdivision,consistent with his notice of intent.but substantively,as we have explained,collins argued it had not been necessary to separately authenticate the records durham reviewed.under the general heading,the court decision is legally erroneous,collins detailed how the records reviewed by durham matched the records tendered by sutter in support of sutter summary judgment motion,and argued simple comparison shows that the records durham reviewed to support her opinion are the same records produced by sutter and authenticated by a sutter employee.collins concluded by arguing the records relied on by durham are adequately authenticated,both by defendant own moving papers and by the contents of the documents.the court decision is against law and the product of legal error.italics added.
in its written opposition to collins new trial motion and during argument at the hearing on the motion,sutter argued that summary judgment had been granted based on two independent grounds for faulting durham declaration,the procedural ground of lack of foundation and the substantive ground that it did not establish a breach of the standard of care.
in its written opposition but not during argument at the hearing on the motion,sutter argued that collins new trial motion was defective because the only ground specified in the notice of intent was the against law ground.however,sutter also went on to argue in its written opposition that the trial court could not grant a new trial absent a showing of prejudice in any event,the trial court is expressly enjoined by article vi,section of the california constitution from granting a new trial for error of law under unless such error is prejudicial.citation.sutter argued judge loncke had found durham declaration was too conclusory,an independent ground of decision making any error regarding the declaration harmless therefore,plaintiff can not obtain a new trial based on any supposed legal error regarding authentication.italics added.sutter reiterated this argument during the hearing on the motion 
thus,sutter written and oral opposition cited and discussed the ground provided by section,subdivision legal error.sutter opposition shows it understood the substantive argument collins was making,albeit under the wrong rubric,in his new trial motion.
in his reply memorandum on the new trial motion,collins explicitly argued the e rror in law ground provided by section,subdivision,and mistakenly asserted that he had amended his notice of intent to allege that ground.yet,during the november hearing,sutter did not voice the objection now pressed on appeal.in fact,the issue of whether collins notice of intent to move for a new trial and subsequent motion stated the correct statutory ground was not raised by either party at the november hearing.
after the november hearing,judge culhane issued an order granting collins motion for a new trial.judge culhane found durham declaration was adequate to raise a triable issue of fact and therefore judge loncke erroneously granted summary judgment.thereafter,judge chang issued a later order granting the motion upon the ground that the earlier summary judgment resulted from an error in law under section,subdivision.
witkin explains that the grounds of a motion for a new trial may be amended after the first notice is filed generally,a motion for new trial can be granted only on a ground specified in the notice of intention to move.citation.however,if the notice omits a ground,it may
