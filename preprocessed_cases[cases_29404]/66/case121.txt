in this diversity suit,we hold that the law of the case doctrine does not preclude us from recalling and modifying this court mandate issued at the conclusion of a prior appeal,and we recall and reform that mandate to permit the award of pre and interest.we further hold that the amendments to the texas finance code govern the interest rate and that a governs the interest rate.accordingly,we reverse the district court judgment in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
this case has a lengthy history,and we recount only the facts necessary to an understanding of the issues presently before us.hall sued the law firm of white,getgey,meyer,lpa for legal malpractice in a diversity suit governed by texas law in which a federal magistrate presided.a jury concluded that the law firm was negligent,hall damages were,the law firm was responsible for hall injuries,and a settling party was responsible for those injuries.the magistrate allowed a settlement credit of against the awarded by the jury and entered judgment in hall favor against the law firm for,together with interest at per annum from the date the federal suit was filed,which was february,and interest at per annum.that judgment was entered september.
both parties appealed,and this court held that the settlement credit should have been only the body of that opinion stated,we modify hall damages award so that it reflects a reduction by this proper amount.the concluding paragraph of the opinion stated 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the magistrate judge pretrial ruling on the offset issue,modify the damages award so that it reflects the proper settlement credit of,and affirm the final judgment as modified.this case is remanded for the entry of an amended judgment in hall favor in the amount of.
affirmed as modified remanded with instructions 
this court issued a mandate on october,that provided in pertinent part,it is ordered and adjudged that the judgment of the district court is affirmed as modified,and the cause is remanded to the district court for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion of this court.although the award of interest and the date from which it should accrue were at issue in the district court and considered at some length by the magistrate in an order entered at the time of judgment in the district court,no issue regarding interest was raised on appeal.neither this court prior opinion nor the mandate explicitly address interest.
on remand,the magistrate initially entered a judgment against the white,getgey law firm in the amount of,plus interest at per annum from february,until september,and interest from september,at per annum.this judgment was entered october.the white,getgey firm filed a motion with the district court seeking to alter or amend that judgment,contending that this court opinion and mandate failed to contain instructions regarding interest,and therefore,the district court lacked authority to award interest,citing federal rule of appellate procedure b and decisions of this court.
rule b provides if the court modifies or reverses a judgment with a direction that a money judgment be entered in the district court,the mandate must contain instructions about the allowance of interest.the law firm asserted in the alternative that if interest were to be awarded,the rate of interest should be limited in accordance with amendments to the texas finance code and pursuant to a.hall countered by filing a motion to enforce the october,judgment and sought discovery in aid of that judgment.the magistrate took the motion to modify the october judgment under submission and stayed discovery pending a ruling on the matters before her.
while the motion to alter or amend the judgment was pending in the district court,hall filed in this court a petition for writ of mandamus seeking to require the district court to lift the stay on discovery,a petition for writ of prohibition seeking to prohibit the district court from altering or amending its october,judgment,and a motion to clarify this court mandate issued in the prior appeal hall contended that this court judgment and mandate necessarily included pre and interest,but alternatively asked this court to clarify its mandate.on may,this court denied the petitions for mandamus and prohibition,without prejudice to hall reinstating them if the magistrate judge has not ruled on the rule e motion and lifted any stay which may prevent the prompt collection of hall judgment within days from the date of this order.this court order further stated,petitioner also seeks clarification of this court prior mandate.as that mandate is plainly worded,the request for clarification is denied.
shortly thereafter,in june,the magistrate entered an order in which she concluded that she had no authority to award interest because this court had modified the judgment on appeal without giving any instructions regarding interest the magistrate june order further concluded that the appropriate procedural vehicle for hall to recover an award of interest was a motion to recall and reform the mandate,presumably meaning this court mandate a second amended judgment against the white,getgey law firm awarding hall was entered june.no provision for any interest,pre or,was included.
hall filed a notice of appeal on july,from the magistrate june,second amended judgment it is this july appeal that is before us today.additionally,on july,hall filed a petition for writ of mandamus asking this court to direct the trial court to vacate its june order amending the judgment and to reinstate its october,judgment that had awarded interest.in the alternative,hall asked this court to recall and reform its mandate to include pre and interest.this court assigned cause number to that proceeding.
the white,getgey firm responded to hall petition for mandamus and motion to recall the mandate by arguing,among other things,that hall had an adequate remedy by appealing the june,second amended judgment.the firm then asserted that hall appeal was untimely and that the litigation was at an end.on september,this court entered an order denying hall petition for writ of mandamus in docket number.the order also said,it is further ordered that the alternative motion for district court sic to recall and reform its mandate to include the and interest awards contained in the september,judgment is denied.hall,however,had not asked this court to order the district court to reform its mandate but had instead asked this court to reform its mandate.this court september,order contained a third provision,which granted petitioner motion for leave to file reply to response to petition for writ of mandamus and alternative motion to recall mandate this court subsequently determined that hall appeal was timely,and that appeal is before us.
hall contends that this court october,mandate did not foreclose the district court from awarding pre and interest.in the alternative,hall asks that we recall and reform that mandate to provide for interest.finally,hall contends that the interest rate should be at least,as originally ordered by the magistrate,while the white,getgey firm contends that if any interest is to be awarded,the floor rate should be only.
the first question we must consider is whether the law of the case doctrine resolves any issue presently before us the white,getgey firm contends that this court decided the issues presented in hall appeal when it denied hall july petition for writ of mandamus and its alternative motion to recall the mandate.we disagree.
first,the july petition for writ of mandamus and the alternative request that this court recall its mandate were presented in an original proceeding.this court did not necessarily or even presumably rule on the merits of the request to recall this court mandate indeed,the white,getgey firm urged this court to deny the mandamus petition without reaching the merits,contending hall had an adequate remedy by appeal.hall had filed just such an appeal a few weeks prior to the filing of the mandamus proceeding.we are now considering that appeal.
second,our september,order in the mandamus proceeding did not rule on
