discussion 
kalaba contends the trial court should have permitted her treating physicians to testify as experts.we disagree.
under section,subdivision a,any party may demand the exchange of expert witness information.in response,a party may provide either a list setting forth the name and address of any person whose expert opinion that party expects to offer in evidence at the trial,or a statement that the party does not presently intend to offer the testimony of any expert witness,subd.f a,b.if a designated expert has been retained for the purpose of forming and expressing an expert opinion at trial,the designation must also include or be accompanied by a declaration signed by the attorney for the party designating the expert and setting forth a brief narrative statement of the expert qualifications,the general substance of the testimony the expert is expected to give,a representation that the expert will be sufficiently familiar with the pending action to submit to a deposition,and a statement of the expert hourly or daily fee,subd.f a e.
subdivision j of section provides that,except when a motion for relief has been granted,and on objection of any party who has himself timely complied with the statute,the trial court shall exclude from evidence the expert opinion of any witness that is offered by any party who has unreasonably failed to do any of the following list that witness as an expert submit an expert witness declaration.produce reports and writings of expert witness make that expert available for a deposition emphasis added.
in bonds roy,supra,cal th,d,the issue was whether a trial court may preclude an expert witness from testifying at trial on a subject whose general substance was not previously described in an expert witness declaration.id.at,d.on the facts of that case,the supreme court answered the question affirmatively,explaining that the statutory scheme as a whole envisions timely disclosure of the general substance of an expert expected testimony so that the parties may properly prepare for trial.allowing new and unexpected testimony for the first time at trial so long as a party has submitted any expert witness declaration whatsoever is inconsistent with this purpose.we therefore conclude that the exclusion sanction of subdivision j applies when a party unreasonably fails to submit an expert witness declaration that fully complies with the content requirements of subdivision f,including the requirement that the declaration contain a brief narrative statement of the general substance of the testimony that the expert is expected to give.subd.f b.this encompasses situations,like the present one,in which a party has submitted an expert witness declaration,but the narrative statement fails to disclose the general substance of the testimony the party later wishes to elicit from the expert at trial.to expand the scope of an expert testimony beyond what is stated in the declaration,a party must successfully move for leave to amend the declaration under subdivision k.bonds roy,supra,cal th at,d,emphasis added.
in schreiber estate of kiser,supra,cal th,d,the issue was whether a trial court may preclude a treating physician,designated as an expert witness,from testifying at trial regarding causation if no expert witness declaration was submitted on his behalf.id.at,d.the supreme court held that section does not require the submission of an expert witness declaration for a treating physician,emphasizing at the outset that the treating physicians in this case were designated as expert witnesses,as required by subdivisions a and f a of section,which requires a list setting forth the name and address of any person whose expert opinion that party expects to offer in evidence at the trial.thus,defendants were on notice at the time of the designation that plaintiff intended to offer opinion testimony by her treating physicians 
t he declaration requirement applies to only certain expert witnesses,those who are parties,employees of parties,or are retained by a party for the purpose of forming and expressing an opinion in anticipation of the litigation or in preparation for the trial,subd.a bonds roy,supra,cal th at,d.a treating physician generally falls into none of these categories prior to the civil discovery act of,a party was required to describe the general substance of the expected testimony of every expert witness.citation.that is no longer the case hence,treating physicians who will testify as experts must be listed,as they were in this case.however,a lthough any person who will be called at trial to give expert testimony must be included on this list,the de
