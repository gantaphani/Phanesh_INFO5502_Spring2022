opinion of the court 
we are once again called upon to determine whether a lawsuit claiming medical negligence is completely preempted by the civil enforcement provision of the employee retirement income security act erisa,a.joseph difelice,appeals the order of the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania dismissing his complaint against.healthcare,aetna for negligent conduct in regard to his medical treatment for sleep apnea and upper airway obstruction.difelice filed suit in state court,alleging that aetna instruction to his treating physician that a specially designed tracheostomy tube was medically unnecessary and aetna insistence that he be discharged from the hospital before his attending physician deemed it appropriate amounted to negligent conduct under state law.aetna removed the case to federal court on the basis of erisa preemption and then moved to dismiss the claim.the district court,relying on our decision in pryzbowski healthcare,cir,held that the claim was completely preempted and dismissed it in its entirety.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm in part and reverse in part.
difelice participates in an employee welfare benefit plan that is administered by aetna,a health maintenance organization hmo.under the terms of this plan,difelice is entitled to certain covered benefits.unless there is a specific provision for a particular type of treatment,a benefit is only covered if,in the determination of aetna,it is medically necessary.medically necessary is a defined term,meaning the service or supply must be care or treatment as likely to produce a significant positive outcome as,and no more likely to produce a negative outcome than,any alternative service or supply must be related to diagnosis of an existing illness or injury may include only those services and supplies that can not be safely and satisfactorily provided at home and,as to diagnosis,care and treatment,must be no more costly taking into account all health expenses incurred in connection with the service or supply than any equally effective service or supply.
in march,difelice was diagnosed with sleep airway obstruction,for which he required a tracheostomy tube his doctor,michael picariello,surgically inserted a tracheostomy tube to eliminate the obstruction,but that tube continually came out.picariello then placed an order for a specially designed tube.however,aetna instructed picariello that the special tube was medically unnecessary.instead of ordering the special tube,the doctor then inserted a different tube,which caused difelice severe pain and resulted in an infection.difelice was later admitted to chester county hospital for treatment,but,the complaint avers,was thereafter discharged at aetna insistence.
difelice filed a complaint in the philadelphia court of common pleas against aetna,his treating physicians,and the hospital.in count i,he alleged that aetna negligently interfered with his medical care by instructing picariello that the specially designed tracheostomy tube he deemed necessary was medically unnecessary for difelice and improperly interfering with picariello medical decision concerning the tracheostomy tube and insisting on difelice discharge from the hospital before his attending physician was planning on discharging him.the other counts involved claims against parties other than aetna.aetna removed the case to the district court on the grounds that the claim against it was completely preempted under erisa and then moved to dismiss.difelice opposed the motion to dismiss and moved to remand to state court.
the district court denied difelice motion to remand and granted aetna motion to dismiss as to count i,and granted the motion to remand on the remaining counts against the other parties.the court held that the disposition of count i was squarely controlled by the third circuit decision in pryzbowski,in which we held that a claim challenging the administration of or eligibility for benefits was completely preempted by section a b of erisa.pryzbowski,at.the court reasoned that the claim against aetna was completely preempted because difelice was challenging aetna decision that he was not entitled to the special tube under the plan,which was entirely a matter of administration,and because aetna was not actually involved in providing any medical services to difelice.difelice appeals the district court order dismissing count 
we have jurisdiction over the district court final order pursuant to,and review the court exercise of jurisdiction and order of dismissal de novo.pryzbowski,at.aetna bears the burden of proving the federal jurisdiction it seeks.spectacor mgt.group brown,cir.in reviewing the complaint,we must accept as true all of difelice factual allegations and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom.langford city of atlantic city,cir.
difelice challenges the district court removal jurisdiction over count i of his complaint and asks us to remand to state court.he argues that his negligence action against aetna is entirely a matter of state law and provides no basis for removal.aetna counters that difelice negligence action is in fact nothing more than an action to recover benefits due under his plan,and as such is completely preempted by the civil enforcement provision of erisa,section a.
under the complaint rule,federal question jurisdiction only exists where an issue of federal law appears on the face of the complaint.franchise tax bd.of cal.const.laborers vacation trust for,d.however,there is an exception to this rule when a purportedly claim comes within the scope of an exclusively federal cause of action,it necessarily arises under federal law,and is completely preempted.see also beneficial bank anderson,d explaining the preemptive effect of erisa.the question before us is therefore whether difelice claims of state law negligence on the part of aetna fall within the scope of the federal causes of action provided in section a of erisa,that is,whether the claims could have been brought under that section.if so,then the existence of the federal claim would provide the basis for federal question jurisdiction but at the same time would require dismissal based on complete preemption.
we have had numerous occasions to consider the question of whether a plaintiff claim against an hmo is covered by section a and is therefore completely preempted.see,pryzbowski,at lazorko,cir in re healthcare,cir dukes healthcare,cir.determining whether a claim could have been brought under erisa has proven to be anything but an exact science.in fact,as my colleagues concurring opinions point out all too well,the exercise seems to have taken on a life of its own,and not a very satisfying or productive life at that.in any event,the statute and our case law chart the path we must follow.
section a allows for civil actions to be brought by a participant or beneficiary to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan.a b.the line between an action to recover benefits,which challenges an administrative decision regarding whether a certain benefit is covered under an erisa plan,and an action alleging negligence or malpractice,which challenges the medical treatment actually provided to a patient,is a blurry one.we have been continually refining the precise test we use in evaluating such claims.
most recently,in pryzbowski,we synthesized the discussions contained in our previous opinions and adopted preferable new terminology.we explained that in the past we had attempted to distinguish between claims directed at the quality of benefits received that is,as to the treatment which would not fall within section a,and claims that the plans erroneously withheld a quantum of benefits due focusing on the administration of the plan which would be completely preempted.pryzbowski,at.following this rubric,we had held that an allegation that an hmo had failed to exercise reasonable care in providing medical treatment was not preempted,dukes,at an allegation that an hmo policy of discharging newborns within hours after their delivery was essentially a medical determination and was not preempted,in re healthcare,at and an allegation that an hmo financial disincentives discouraged medical providers from hospitalizing a mentally ill woman was a quality of care claim because it occurred in the course of a treatment decision,and was therefore not preempted.lazorko,at.
however,in pryzbowski,we found the distinction unclear,and suggested that more helpful terminology was utilized by the supreme court in pegram herdrich,d.although we recognized that pegram concerned fiduciary acts under erisa and not preemption,we found useful the distinction made there between eligibility decisions,which turn on the plan coverage of a particular condition or medical procedure for its treatment,and treatment decisions,which are choices in diagnosing and treating a patient condition,and determined that the distinction was equally applicable for complete preemption analysis.pryzbowski,at quoting pegram,at.emphasis added and internal quotations omitted.we then explained,
regardless of the language used,the ultimate distinction to make for purposes of complete preemption is whether the claim challenges the administration of or eligibility for benefits,which falls within the scope of a and is completely preempted,or the quality of the medical treatment performed,which may be the subject of a state action.
using this nomenclature,it was evident to us in pryzbowski that a claim alleging that a physician knowingly delayed in performing urgent surgery would relate to the quality of care,while on the other hand,a claim alleging that an hmo declined to approve certain requested medical services or treatment on the ground that they were not covered under the plan would manifestly be one regarding the proper administration of benefits.id.citing jass prudential health care plan,cir.however,we were presented there with claims that fell somewhere in between that an hmo had negligently delayed approval of an specialist,and that it had failed to supervise properly its employees to make thoughtful and reasonable decisions as to healthcare.id.at.were those claims based on a treatment decision or on a determination as to eligibility for a benefit we explained that i n analyzing whether a claim falling between the two poles is completely preempted,it is necessary to refer to a.id.at.paring the issue down to its essence,we stated that the relevant question must be whether the claim could have been the subject of a civil enforcement action under a.id.if it could have,then it was a plan benefit claim,and congress has clearly expressed its intent that the claim be preempted by erisa.id.citing metropolitan life ins.taylor,d.
because the claims in pryzbowski fell between the two poles,we took extra care to examine the complaint for artful pleading,to ensure that pryzbowski was not disguising an eligibility claim that could have been brought under erisa as a state law negligence claim.we explained that,although the claim might be ostensibly directed at the provision of medical treatment,we needed to look beyond the face of the complaint to determine whether pryzbowski had artfully pleaded his suit so as to couch a federal claim in terms of state law.id.at quoting jass,at see also franchise tax,at.a plaintiff may not defeat removal to federal court by omitting to plead necessary federal questions in a complaint.the ultimate question was whether,when the basis for the claim was properly understood,the claim fell under erisa.
after carefully examining pryzbowski complaint for the true bases of his claims,we held that his claims were completely preempted.first,regarding the delayed approval,we concluded that underlying the hmo allegedly negligent activities was a policy decision regarding payment to and approval of specialists,a decision that fell within the realm of the administration of benefits.pryzbowski,at.we explained that this claim could have been brought under erisa because h ad pryzbowski sought to accelerate the hmo approval of the use of providers,she could have sought an injunction under a to enforce the benefits to which she was entitled under the plan.id.at.further,her claim that the hmo had failed to properly hire,train,and supervise its employees to make thoughtful and reasonable decisions as to healthcare was also preempted because,reading behind the artful medical negligence pleading,the complaint did not allege that the hmo or its employees had actually engaged in any medical treatment.id.at.because the hmo only role was in administering pryzbowski benefits,it could not possibly have been negligent in providing treatment.id.unlike the situation in which an hmo fills dual roles as an administrator of benefits and a provider of services,and might therefore actually engage in medical treatment,the hmo there was acting solely as an administrator.id.
pryzbowski thus instructs us to determine whether a claim is preempted under section a by first examining whether the claim falls at either of the two poles,entirely treatment or entirely administrative.if based solely on a medical treatment decision,then the claim is not preempted.if based on an hmo administrator eligibility decision,then the claim is preempted.in the more difficult situation in which the claim falls somewhere in between,we must scrutinize the complaint for artful pleading,and then refer to section a itself and determine whether the actual alleged wrongdoing underlying the cause of action could have formed the basis of a suit under that section.
as discussed more fully below,when we apply the pryzbowski framework to the complaint before us,we conclude that difelice claim that aetna interfered with his medical treatment by declaring the special tube medically unnecessary is preempted by erisa because it could have been brought as an action under section a.however,because it appears that difelice claim that he was discharged at the insistence of aetna does not rest on any discharge policy set forth in the plan,or any agreed benefit,it would not be encompassed within the relief available under section a and is therefore not completely preempted.
b.the tracheostomy tube 
we will first examine difelice claim that aetna interfered with picariello medical decision regarding the special tube.under pryzbowski,the first question is whether aetna medical necessity determination is clearly either a medical treatment decision or an eligibility decision.difelice has couched this claim in terms of aetna negligent interference with his care,which seems to imply that aetna itself engaged in medical treatment.however,difelice complaint does not include any allegation that picariello was an agent of aetna,that aetna did not exercise reasonable care in monitoring picariello care,or that aetna itself provided medical treatment rather,his claim rests on aetna instruction to picariello that the specially designed tracheostomy tube he deemed necessary was medically unnecessary,a direct reference to the medical necessity determination called for in the plan.looking behind difelice use of language sounding in negligence,he is alleging that aetna wrongfully denied him coverage for the special tube.thus,the complaint has aspects of treatment and coverage.that is,in making its determination,aetna necessarily had to exercise some medical judgment,it had to determine whether the special tube was as likely to produce a significant positive outcome as,and no more likely to produce a negative outcome than,any alternative service or supply,was related to diagnosis of an existing illness or injury,and was no more costly taking into account all health expenses incurred in connection with the service or supply than any equally effective service or supply.however,here there is no allegation that aetna actually provided the medical care,and aetna use of medical judgment could only have led to an eligibility,not a treatment,decision.
because the decision here was in some sense both a medical treatment and an eligibility decision,thus falling between the two poles discussed in pryzbowski,we must refer to section a and determine whether difelice claim regarding the tube could have been the subject of a civil enforcement action under erisa.pryzbowski,at.clearly,it could have been.difelice could have challenged aetna medical necessity determination by filing a claim under a b to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,and arguing that the special tube was in fact medically necessary,and was therefore a covered benefit.he could have requested an injunction forcing aetna to pay for the special tube,or alternatively,paid for the tube himself and then later filed an action for reimbursement.numerous erisa participants have in fact brought such actions challenging their hmo medical necessity determinations and seeking to recover benefits they alleged were due under their plans.see,mario p c food,cir reviewing claim under section a challenging hmo determination that sex change operation was not medically necessary fritcher health care serv,cir reviewing claim under section a challenging hmo determination that custodial care was not medically necessary kopicki fitzgerald auto.family employee benefits plan,d,granting preliminary injunction to prevent hmo from denying preauthorization for cancer treatment it had deemed not medically necessary see also heasley belden blake,cir reviewing claim under section a challenging an hmo determination that a treatment was an experimental procedure.difelice claim falls squarely within this jurisprudence.because difelice claim that aetna improperly deemed his special tube to be medically unnecessary could have been brought under section a,it is completely preempted by erisa.we will therefore affirm the district court exercise of removal jurisdiction and its order dismissing count i as to aetna conduct regarding the tracheostomy tube.
difelice urges that this result is inconsistent with the supreme court decision in pegram and our decisions in healthcare and lazorko.we disagree.
in pegram,the supreme court answered the question whether an hmo may be liable for a breach of fiduciary duty when its physician owners make mixed eligibility and treatment decisions.pegram,at.there,a physician,who was also an owner of the hmo that covered her patient,waited to order an ultrasound for the patient inflamed appendix,and the appendix ruptured.id.at.the patient sued the hmo for breach of fiduciary duty,alleging that the hmo created an incentive for the physicians to make decisions in their own financial interests,rather than in the exclusive interests of the plan participants.id.the court held that hmos do not act as fiduciaries as envisioned by erisa when their physician owners make decisions that touch both on the patient medical treatment and the patient eligibility for benefits under the plan.id.at.
the court first set forth a framework for understanding the kinds of acts that physician owners acting on an hmo behalf might undertake.on the one hand are pure eligibility decisions turning on the plan coverage for a particular medical treatment,and on the other are treatment decisions,choices about how to go about diagnosing and treating a patient condition.id.at.in between are situations in which the eligibility decision and the treatment decision are inextricably mixed,that is,when an eligibility decision necessarily rests on the physicians judgments about reasonable medical treatment.id.the court found that it was presented with just such a mixed decision the physician owner had determined that the patient condition did not warrant immediate action the consequence of that medical determination was that the hmo would not cover immediate care.id.
having concluded that the decision before it was a mixed decision,the court went on to hold that an hmo physician owners do not act as fiduciaries under erisa when making such decisions.id.at.the court focused on the nature of fiduciaries,explaining that these mixed decisions are not fiduciary in nature,and bear only a limited resemblance to the usual business of trustees.id.the court feared that a contrary result would open the floodgates to malpractice suits against hmos and individual physicians under the guise of erisa breach of fiduciary duty claims,and would erode the distinction between state malpractice and federal erisa actions.id.at.
although,as we noted above,pegram set forth helpful terminology for preemption analysis,see pryzbowski,at,the court holding that a mixed determination made by a physician owner does not subject an hmo to liability for breach of fiduciary duty does not translate to,or govern in,the preemption context.rather,pegram sets a standard for when liability is to be imposed on individuals acting in a fiduciary capacity.it does not presume to encompass erisa claims enforcement as such.in fact,the pegram court specifically stated that it was not discussing the standards governing a claim that a patient had been wrongfully denied benefits due under a plan nor the interaction between such a claim and state law causes of action.pegram,at.accord roark humana,cir stating that the supreme court has not decided whether section a b preempts a medical malpractice claim involving mixed decisions,but holding under fifth circuit law that it does not.in fact,it could be argued that allowing plaintiffs to do an around erisa by permitting them to couch plan decisions that have some impact on treatment in negligence terms would have a similar effect of undermining erisa as was feared by the court in pegram.we remain convinced that,after pryzbowski,we look at what decisions are subject to enforcement,which is a radically different inquiry from when can an hmo be sued for breach of fiduciary duty 
we are also not persuaded that healthcare and lazorko both of which pryzbowski and rely on the distinction compel a different result.in healthcare,we held that a suit against an hmo challenging its policy of a hour discharge of mother and newborn was not preempted by erisa because it went to the quality of the health care provided.healthcare,at.significantly,we noted that the plaintiffs did not allege a failure to provide or authorize benefits under the plan,nor did they claim that they were denied any of the benefits that were due under the plan.id.rather,they alleged that the hmo was negligent in adopting the discharge policy and in supervising the physicians with whom they contracted for services,and that the hmo incentive structure adversely affected the physicians medical judgment regarding when newborns should be discharged.the plaintiffs were not seeking to enforce benefits they thought were due to them under the plan they were challenging the discharge policy itself and the hmo actions in its role as a provider or arranger of medical services,not in its role as administrator of benefits.id.at.the hmo policy and incentive structure were such that the patients never had the option of making an informed decision as to whether to pay for the hospitalization themselves,as would occur in a situation in which coverage is sought and denied.id.although we analyzed the claims in healthcare under the rubric,our holding squares with the preemption framework we later set forth in pryzbowski.because the plaintiffs in healthcare were not suing for any benefits due under the plan,but rather were challenging the plan itself,they could not have sued under section a,and therefore,even under pryzbowski,their claims would not have been preempted.
lazorko involved a similar issue.there,we held that a claim that financial disincentives imposed by an hmo discouraged medical providers from hospitalizing a patient who later committed suicide was a quality of care claim and therefore not preempted.lazorko,at.we noted that lazorko was not claiming that the hmo plan was supposed to include hospitalization,but rather that her doctor was influenced in his by the incentive structure.id.as in healthcare,the patient could not have sued under erisa because she never had the option of seeking continued hospitalization her doctor,as influenced by the hmo policy,did not offer it to her.id.
unlike in healthcare and lazorko,here,difelice is suing based on denial of a benefit he claims he was due under the plan.he is not claiming that aetna negligently adopted a particular policy regarding tracheostomy tubes or imposed an incentive structure that interfered with his physician independent medical judgment.rather,he claims that the special tube was not medically unnecessary,and that aetna wrongfully determined that it was,a claim that is based on the language of the plan and pertains to the nature of benefits provided.unlike the plaintiffs in healthcare and lazorko,difelice sought and was denied coverage for a benefit,and could have paid for the benefit himself and sued under section a for reimbursement.
because under our most recent controlling precedent,pryzbowski,difelice claim that aetna was negligent in determining that the special tube was medically unnecessary could have been the subject of a suit under section a for benefits due under the plan,his claim is preempted by erisa we will therefore affirm the district court exercise of removal jurisdiction and subsequent dismissal of the claim with respect to the tube.
c.the discharge from the hospital 
count i also includes a claim that aetna improperly interfered with difelice medical treatment by insisting on his discharge from the hospital before his attending physician was planning on discharging him.the district court did not address this aspect of the claim in its order dismissing the complaint.
unlike his claim regarding the tracheostomy tube,difelice does not allege that aetna deemed the hospital stay to be medically unnecessary and therefore not covered by the plan.the claim also does not appear to rely on a discharge policy in the plan or any agreed benefit.indeed,it is difficult to tell from difelice vague pleadings what precisely he is alleging that aetna did or the form this insistence took.if aetna in some way forced the hospital to discharge him,or imposed financial incentives like those in healthcare and lazorko that unduly affected his physician judgment,then difelice has pled a negligence cause of action that is not preempted by erisa.
at the dismissal stage,it was aetna burden to prove federal jurisdiction by proving that this is an erisa claim.see spectacor mgt.group,at.there is nothing apparent from the pleadings that would foreclose difelice from being able to prove that the discharge decision was not a plan benefit.unlike his claim that the tube was erroneously determined to be medically unnecessary under the plan,this claim on its face is not.therefore,because difelice claim of insistence on the discharge could give rise to state law negligence liability,we hold that it is not completely preempted by section a of erisa.
aetna argues that,even if difelice hospital discharge claim is cognizable as a state law cause of action,we should uphold the district court dismissal of that claim on the alternative ground that it is nonetheless expressly preempted by virtue of section of erisa,a,which provides that erisa shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan covered by the statute.however,u nlike the scope of a b,which is jurisdictional and creates a basis for removal to federal court,a merely governs the law that will apply to state law claims,regardless of whether the case is brought in state or federal court.lazorko,at.as we have determined that the hospital discharge claim is not preempted by section a,we do not have jurisdiction over that claim.rather,the question of whether the hospital discharge claim will be controlled by federal law pursuant to section must be decided by the district court on remand,should it choose to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under a,or by the state court.see pryzbowski,at where district court has jurisdiction over one claim by virtue of preemption under section a,it has discretion to decide whether to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims arising from the same factual predicate or remand to state court.
because difelice claim that aetna interfered with his medical treatment by finding the special tracheostomy tube to be medically unnecessary could have been brought under section a of erisa for the recovery of benefits due under his plan,it is completely preempted.we will therefore affirm the order of the district court dismissing that claim.however,because aetna has not shown that difelice claim that aetna interfered with his medical treatment by insisting on his discharge from the hospital is based on any plan benefit,that claim is not completely preempted.we will therefore reverse the district court order dismissing that claim and remand for further proceedings.
i am satisfied that judge rendell opinion reaches the correct result under our governing caselaw.while i thus join in her opinion and in the judgment,i write separately to add my voice to the rising judicial chorus urging that congress and the supreme court revisit what is an unjust and increasingly tangled erisa regime.
congress enacted erisa in to promote the interest of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.shaw delta air lines,d surveying congressional statements of purpose.however,with the rise of managed care and the supreme court series of decisions holding preempted any action for damages against hmos,erisa has evolved into a shield that insulates hmos from liability for even the most egregious acts of dereliction committed against plan beneficiaries,a state of affairs that i view as directly contrary to the intent of congress.indeed,existing erisa jurisprudence creates a monetary incentive for hmos to mistreat those beneficiaries,who are often in the throes of medical crises and entirely unable to assert what meager rights they possess.
lower courts have struggled to maintain some semblance of equity notwithstanding the enormous breadth of the preemption test,one that turns on whether the claim is related to a benefit plan,inter alia,by identifying exceptions to preemption,such as that for medical malpractice liability.and in terms of the remedial scope of,they have struggled to make sense out of the distinction between eligibility decisions which are preempted and medical decisions which are not,a hopeless endeavor,as i shall explain.unfortunately,the price of all this has been descent into a serbonian bog wherein judges are forced to don logical blinders and split the linguistic atom to decide even the most routine cases.
erisa was enacted in to address the insecurity of workers vested pension funds,a problem that gained national recognition through such notorious events as the studebaker plant shutdown in,which caused approximately workers to lose their pensions.see generally michael gordon,overview why was erisa enacted,senate,special comm.on aging,the employee retirement income security act of the first decade information paper.prior to erisa,workers were entitled only to the assets in the pension plan or to nominal pension benefits,whichever was lower of course,it was entirely possible for a plan to have zero assets,as happened with some frequency when firms closed shop.erisa contained a raft of provisions designed to protect plan participants against negligent or malfeasant plan managers.for example,it created the pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc,an insurer akin to the federal deposit insurance corporation,to protect against employer insolvency.
the benefit plans in need of protection,however,were of two distinct types pension and welfare and substantially different policy concerns animated congress reform in each area.pension plans,to which employees contribute over the course of their careers and rely upon to provide retirement income,were thought to present far greater opportunity for mismanagement and underfunding.unlike welfare benefit plans,pension plans accrue substantial funds that must be invested with prudence,and they must be able to survive continuously changing circumstances.title of erisa therefore imposed on pension plan managers comprehensive reporting,disclosure,vesting,minimum funding,and fiduciary duty requirements.
welfare benefit plans,which include medical,surgical,sickness,accident,disability,death,unemployment,and similar programs,posed a very different set of challenges.unlike pension plans,welfare benefit plans operate on a pay as you go basis,and generally do not entail financial commitments.see john langbein and bruce wolk,pension and employee benefit law at ed.erisa framers therefore saw no need to impose vesting requirements on such plans.similarly,minimum funding requirements are intended to guard against plan default by the plan sponsor on its commitments to plan beneficiaries,a minor concern where no substantial funds accrue.the framers thus exempted welfare benefit plans from erisa funding requirements as well.
the result is that welfare benefit plans are far less regulated than pension plans.they are subject to erisa reporting,disclosure,fiduciary,and remedial rules those that govern procedure but exempt from the substantive vesting and funding requirements,which are meant to guarantee a certain level of expected benefits.congress relative lack of concern with substantive regulation of welfare plans is clear from the supreme court statement that erisa does not mandate that employers provide any particular benefits,and does not itself proscribe discrimination in the provision of employee benefits.shaw,at.indeed,courts have held that the absence of a vesting provision allows employers to amend their plans virtually at will,even in discriminatory fashion.see,confer custom engine,cir noting a plan sponsor may change benefits prospectively by formal written notice mcgann h h music,cir upholding an employer amendment of its plan to exclude coverage for aids treatment.
despite erisa relatively light regulation of welfare benefit plans,it is clear that the legislation provided substantially greater safeguards for both pension and welfare plan beneficiaries than had previously existed.but erisa also contained a crucial concession to plan sponsors in the form of a,an express preemption provision mandating that titles i and iv of erisa,which impose the regulations discussed above,shall supersede any and all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.although this section is subject to an important exception that allows states to impose laws regulating insurance,see b a,its breadth is striking.the supreme court explains that congress intended 
to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would be subject to a uniform body of benefits law the goal was to minimize the administrative and financial burden of complying with conflicting directives among states or between states and the federal government,and to prevent the potential for conflict in substantive law requiring the tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities of the law of each jurisdiction.
mcclendon,d.this view is premised on the statement of john dent,a sponsor of the act in the house of representatives,who declared that its purpose was to eliminat e the threat of conflicting and inconsistent state and local regulation.cong.reg.
in a meaningful sense,congress decision to federalize pension and employee benefit law appear to have assisted plan beneficiaries as much as plan sponsors.no employer is required to offer a pension or welfare benefit plan to its employees,and were congress to have established erisa regulations as merely a federal baseline and allowed states to supplement it as they saw fit,had erisa not preempted state law,some employers might have declined to offer such plans rather than deal with the compliance costs of tailoring them to individual jurisdictions.at a minimum,it is likely that any compliance costs would have been reflected in a lower level of benefits for plan participants,which of course would undermine the purpose of erisa.from an ex ante perspective,therefore,it might have been reasonable to view even a as furthering the interests of plan beneficiaries.
in practice,however,nothing has been further from the truth erisa generally,and a particularly,have become virtually impenetrable shields that insulate plan sponsors from any meaningful liability for negligent or malfeasant acts committed against plan beneficiaries in all too many cases.this has unfolded in a line of supreme court cases that have created a regulatory vacuum in which virtually all state law remedies are preempted but very few federal substitutes are provided.in these cases,which began with alessi,d,the court initially employed textualist interpretations of a to give erisa a staggeringly broad preemptive scope.alessi itself was a relatively straightforward case in which a unanimous court held preempted a new jersey law that eliminated one method for calculating pension benefits,reasoning that,whatever the law purpose,it clearly related to pension plans.id.at.although alessi itself was innocuous enough,it established a precedent of determining erisa preemptive scope by searching the phrase relates to for concrete meaning,an approach that would eventually be chimerical.
in shaw delta air lines,d,another unanimous decision,two new york statutes required health and disability plans to treat pregnancy the same as other nonoccupational disabilities at a time when federal employment discrimination statutes did not.in a landmark passage,the court stated 
we have no difficulty in concluding that the new york laws relate to employee benefit plans.the breadth of a reach is apparent from that section language.a law relates to an employee benefit plan,in the normal sense of the phrase,if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.
id.at.emphasis added.although the court left the door ajar by cautioning that s ome state actions may affect employee benefit plans in too tenuous,remote,or peripheral a manner to warrant a finding that the law relates to the plan,id.at,the connection with or reference to language became the test for future cases.
the court applied the passage in unanimous holdings in metropolitan life ins.massachusetts,d holding that a state statute mandating mental health coverage in group health insurance policies fell within a preemptive scope,but was saved by erisa insurance exception,and pilot life ins.dedeaux,d holding preempted a state cause of action against an insurer for denial of a claim.by the,however,it had become clear that the relates to standard was one without conceptual limits,and given the court general assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress,rice santa fe elevator,it balked at the specter of a preemptive vortex that could swallow virtually any state remedial law.it abruptly reversed course in new york state conference of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,d,where it unanimously noted that,i f relate to were taken to extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy,then for all practical purposes would never run its course,for really,universally,relations stop nowhere.id.at.internal citation omitted.it recognized that it simply must go beyond the unhelpful text and look instead to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive.id.at.
as discussed above,congress intent behind a preemption was to ensure that plan sponsors would be subject to uniform law.see,at.one critical aspect of this uniformity concerns,erisa civil enforcement provision.in pilot life,the court concluded that congress intended the remedies in to be the exclusive remedies for violations of rights guaranteed under erisa.it explained that the force of a was modeled on the exclusive remedy provided by of the labor management relations act congress was well aware that the powerful force of of the lmra displaced all state law claims,even when the state action purported to authorize a remedy unavailable under the federal provision.at.in other words,a preempts state causes of action to enforce rights even when provides no substitute federal cause of action.this regulatory vacuum creates situations in which plan beneficiaries have little or no recourse for even the most egregious violations of their rights,for the remedies contained in are incapable of making victims whole indeed,in many cases they actually create incentives for hmos to mistreat their plan participants.
section contains two subsections that address a participant right to recover for wrongs committed against the participant personally as opposed to those committed against the plan itself,which are considered violations of the sponsor fiduciary duty.the first,a b,authorizes the participant or beneficiary to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan.it is through this provision that difelice might have sought an injunction to compel aetna to cover the specialized tracheostomy tube.the second,a,authorizes a participant,beneficiary,or fiduciary to seek equitable remedies injunctive relief against any act or practice which violates erisa or the plan terms,or other appropriate equitable relief i to redress such violations or ii to enforce any provisions of erisa or the plan.
although these provisions seem comprehensive at first glance they allow recovery of benefits due and empower a participant to enforce his rights and seek appropriate equitable relief they in fact operate to leave participants almost completely at the mercy of hmos.the first section,a b,by its plain language only allows plan participants to seek the benefits to which they are contractually entitled,even when those benefits have been denied in bad faith and despite the fact that the participants most in need of this section are often the ones least able to take advantage of it.a plan participant whose claim is denied by an hmo utilization review board difelice,for example,see infra is often in the throes of a medical crisis,hardly a feasible time to retain counsel and prosecute an injunctive lawsuit.the costs of such suits are likely to be immense,and erisa provides for attorney fees,if at all,only after the action concludes.see g.even if a participant ultimately prevails against his insurer,it will frequently be the participant estate that reaps the meager reward.
in many areas of law contingency fee structures are used to overcome a litigant initial impecuniosity.but any possibility of using contingency fees in this context is undermined by erisa preemption,for a string of supreme court cases has interpreted erisa to disallow any recovery of compensatory or punitive damages.see langbein wolk,pension and employee benefit law at.in massachusetts mutual life ins.russell,d,the plaintiff sued under a,alleging that the improper processing of her benefit claim exacerbated her condition and entitled her to compensatory and punitive damages under a,which,inter alia,authorizes such equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate.the court,however,concluded that any recovery under must inure to the plan rather than the beneficiary.the court then explained in dictum that a b,the analogous section allowing for a participant recovery,says nothing about the recovery of damages.id.at.in an passage,it explained.
the six carefully integrated civil enforcement provisions found in a of the statute as finally enacted provide strong evidence that congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate expressly.the assumption of inadvertent admission is rendered especially suspect upon close consideration of erisa interlocking,interrelated,and interdependent remedial scheme,which is in turn part of a comprehensive and reticulated statute.
id.at.internal citation omitted.
although russell narrow holding left open the possibility that extracontractual damages are recoverable under a appropriate equitable relief provision,the court subsequent decision in mertens hewitt associates,d,foreclosed any such hopes.in mertens,participants sued the fiduciaries of a failed plan,alleging breach of fiduciary duty and seeking monetary relief,which they characterized as equitable.petitioners argued that,a lthough a beneficiary action to recover losses resulting from a breach of duty superficially resembles an action at law for damages,such relief traditionally has been obtained in the courts of equity and therefore is,by definition,equitable relief.id.at.
the supreme court acknowledged that erisa roots lie in the common law of trusts,see firestone tire rubber bruch,d,that courts of equity had jurisdiction over trust law,and that monetary damages were available in those courts against the trustee.it concluded,however,that s ince all relief available for breach of trust could be obtained from a court of equity,limiting the sort of relief available under a to equitable relief in the sense of whatever relief a court of equity could provide in such a case would limit the relief not at all.mertens,at.put another way,interpreting equitable relief to mean any relief would render superfluous the word equitable.the court solution was to interpret equitable as referring to types of relief traditionally available in courts of equity,that is,injunctions,mandamus,and restitution,but not monetary damages.
the unavailability of extracontractual damages has effects that are perverse.first,as stated above,contingency fees are rendered entirely impractical precious few lawyers would be willing to undertake a horrendously complex case of uncertain outcome when the greatest potential reward is merely provision of the care that had been contractually promised.without contingency fees,participants in the midst of medical crises are completely at the mercy of hmos unless they are fortunate enough to have the financial means to bring a suit for an injunction,a circumstance which is no doubt exceptional.although it might seem a simple matter to seek an injunction compelling coverage of a procedure,nothing is further from the truth where as with difelice the contractual availability of coverage hinges on a highly determination of medical necessity involving accepted standards of care and tolerable levels of risk for the participant malady.to the extent that participants are unable to seek an injunction compelling coverage,erisa remedial scheme is almost entirely illusory.
the second perverse effect is that,at the same time as erisa makes it inordinately difficult to bring an injunction to enforce a participant rights,it creates strong incentives for hmos to deny claims in bad faith or otherwise stiff participants.erisa preempts the state tort of claim denial,see pilot life,at,so that if an hmo wrongly denies a participant claim even in bad faith,the greatest cost it could face is being compelled to cover the procedure,the very cost it would have faced had it acted in good faith.any rational hmo will recognize that if it acts in good faith,it will pay for far more procedures than if it acts otherwise,and punitive damages,which might otherwise guard against such profiteering,are no obstacle at all.not only is there an incentive for an hmo to deny any particular claim,but to the extent that this practice becomes widespread,it creates a race to the bottom in which,all else being equal,the most profitable hmos will be those that deny claims most frequently.
in sum,erisa remedial scheme gives hmos every incentive to act in their own and not in their beneficiaries best interest while simultaneously making it incredibly difficult for plan participants to pursue what meager remedies they possess,a confounding result for a statute whose original purpose was to protect employees.
given that erisa remedial scheme often provides no remedies,litigants have gone to great lengths to identify state causes of action that are not preempted by erisa,and courts have generally been sympathetic to their efforts even when ultimately finding their claims preempted.for example,in travelers ins,a clearly frustrated court inveighed 
under traditional notions of justice,the harms alleged if true should entitle plaintiff to some legal remedy on behalf of herself and her children against travelers and greenspring.consider just one of her claims breach of contract.this cause of action that contractual promises can be enforced in the courts magna carta.it is the very bedrock of our notion of individual autonomy and property rights.it was among the first precepts of the common law to be recognized in the courts of the commonwealth and has been zealously guarded by the state judiciary from that day to this.our entire capitalist structure depends on it.
nevertheless,this court had no choice but to pluck plaintiff case out of the state court in which she sought redress and where relief to other litigants is available and then,at the behest of travelers and greenspring,to slam the courthouse doors in her face and leave her without any remedy.
it is no exaggeration to say that the federal courts have struggled mightily to maintain fidelity to erisa expansive relates to preemption clause while avoiding the wholesale foreclosure of participants causes of action against their hmos.but our search for a middle ground has proved to be a judicial snipe hunt,and we are no closer to success today than we were a decade ago.this court own decisions illustrate the quagmire in which courts find themselves.in dukes healthcare,cir,a participant sued his hmo alleging medical malpractice,a tort,and the hmo argued that the claim was preempted by erisa.we held that the claim was not preempted,reasoning that erisa draws a distinction between actions challenging the quality of care provided and those claiming that the hmo provided an inadequate quantity of benefits under its plan.as we explained,actions challenging the quantity of benefits received are actions that could be brought under erisa a b to recover benefits due under the terms of the plan,and any state law duplicating that remedy is preempted by erisa a.regulation of quality of care,conversely,was found to be a field traditionally occupied by state regulation,id.at,and we did not find anything in the legislative history,structure,or purpose of erisa suggest ing that congress viewed a b as creating a remedy for a participant injured by medical malpractice.id.
we further explicated this distinction in in re healthcare,cir,which concerned,inter alia,a plan participant claim that her hmo was negligent in adopting a policy of presumptively discharging newborn infants within hours.we recognize d that the distinction between the quantity of benefits due under a welfare plan and the quality of those benefits will not always be clear,id.at,and explained that the difficulty arises in part because the same hmo may have assumed both the role as a plan administrator and the separate role as a provider of medical services.id.the policy of discharging newborns after hours was,however,determined to be a function of the role as provider of medical services because it was an essentially medical determination of the appropriate level of care,not a claim that a certain benefit was requested and denied.id.at.we therefore held that the plan participant claim fit squarely within the class of claims that we identified in dukes as involving the quality of care and was not preempted.id.at.
finally,in our most recent and important erisa preemption decision,pryzbowski healthcare,cir,harm was allegedly caused by an hmo delay in approving a procedure to be performed by physicians.there was no question whether the treatment itself was covered the issue was merely one of eligibility,namely whether an physician could perform the procedure.we took note of the supreme court recent decision in pegram herdrich,d,where the court distinguished between an hmo eligibility decisions and treatment decisions.although pegram directly concerned fiduciary duty rather than preemption,we held that its dichotomy was equally applicable in the preemption context indeed,we considered it another way of viewing the distinction.we concluded that an eligibility decision is an administrative decision,and that any action challenging it is preempted because a participant could instead bring suit under erisa a b to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan,or to clarify his right to future benefits under the terms of the plan.conversely,a treatment decision is a medical decision that requires no interpretation of the plan itself,and it is not preempted by erisa since a b offers a plaintiff no avenue of relief.
i believe that dukes,in re healthcare,and pryzbowski were all rightly decided,and that our opinion today reaches the correct conclusion based on those precedents.i write separately,however,to make clear my concern that the opinion masks extraordinary subtleties and complexities of this area of the law that cry out for clarification by the congress,or,failing that,by the supreme court.in fact,i believe that the fundamental distinction upon which federal caselaw currently relies between quantity and quality decisions,or between eligibility and treatment decisions is untenable,and that the blurring is becoming more severe,not less.to the extent we insist on categorizing every hmo decision as either an eligibility or a treatment decision,we contort ourselves into parsing terms that are conceptually indistinguishable,and we fail to come to terms with the realities of modern health coverage.
this problem is evident even among relatively easy cases.pryzbowski is perhaps one of the examples of an eligibility decision,for the hmo only action was designing its plan to utilize network doctors,a clear matter of plan administration.conversely,when one thinks of treatment or medical decisions,one envisions a physician and an examination table,a world seemingly far removed from the hmo administrative offices.yet even in pryzbowski,it takes little creativity to recast the administrative matter of plan design as a treatment or medical decision,for the hmo implicitly determined that requiring plan participants to see network physicians would not expose them to any undue health risks.it is impossible to characterize that decision as anything other than partially medical,for it directly affected participants health.indeed,the delay occasioned by the hmo administrative decision quite literally caused pryzbowski condition seriously to worsen.
the supreme court itself recognized this false dichotomy problem in pegram,where it observed that many and possibly most hmo decisions contain elements of both eligibility and treatment considerations 
a great many and possibly most coverage questions are not simple questions,like whether appendicitis is a covered condition when there is no dispute that a patient has appendicitis,or whether acupuncture is a covered procedure for pain relief when the claim of pain is unchallenged.the more common coverage question is a question.although coverage for many conditions will be clear and various treatment options will be indisputably compensable,physicians still must decide what to do in particular cases.the issue may be,say,whether one treatment option is so superior to another under the circumstances,and needed so promptly,that a decision to proceed with it would meet the medical necessity requirement in practical terms,these eligibility decisions can not be untangled from physicians judgments about reasonable medical treatment.
some courts have attempted to explain away the evident problems in the eligibility versus treatment dichotomy by holding that only hmos which employ their own physicians can make medical decisions.see,merit behavioral care,d.such courts suggest that hmos which do not directly employ physicians can not engage in mixed decisions because they do not actually treat patients.the supreme court itself has cast doubt upon this explanation,stating that decisions are considered mixed not merely because treatment and eligibility are made by the same person,the treating physician.pegram,at.but this distinction is logically tenuous even absent that precedent,for an hmo that employs no physicians must nevertheless review the independent physicians recommendations to determine whether they comport with the health plan requirements.
the case at bar makes evident the impossibility that any such simple rule can adequately reflect the byzantine complexities of health care.aetna policy explicitly equated its coverage,eligibility on an assessment of medical necessity.but the medical necessity clause,which attempts to convert medical decisions into eligibility decisions,compounds the problem i address herein.indeed,aetna denied coverage even though picariello insisted the specialized tracheostomy tube was critical to difelice health.tracheotomy is an extremely serious procedure,and the tracheostomy tube,whose uses are described in the margin,is an integral part of the procedure as two prominent medical school professors explain,tracheotomy is associated with multiple and potentially complications even under elective conditions.eugene myers and ricardo carrau,early complications of tracheotomy incidence and management,clinics in chest medicine at september.indeed,e ven with the use of optimal surgical techniques,complications of tracheotomy may occur during the procedure,in the immediate postoperative period,or long after the surgery.eugene myers and sylvan stool,complications of tracheotomy,tracheotomy churchill livingstone.they counsel that t he best means of preventing complications whenever they occur are paying meticulous attention to detail in the performance of the surgery and performing the tracheotomy as soon as it becomes obvious that the procedure is necessary.id.
this assessment is borne out by the history of difelice condition.in march of,difelice was diagnosed with sleep and upper airway obstruction.his otolaryngologist,michael picariello,attempted several unsuccessful treatments before determining that difelice needed a tracheostomy tube.picariello surgically placed a tracheostomy tube in july of,but it continually extubated from difelice neck.it was only then that picariello determined that difelice needed a tube to remedy a potentially condition.
aetna,however,overruled picariello expert medical judgment and determined that the tube was in fact not medically necessary,leaving difelice with the option of bringing an injunctive suit under erisa,paying for the tube,or receiving a second tube that aetna agreed to cover.he opted for the covered tube,but after it was placed,he developed a serious and progressive soft tissue and bone infection that caused him to be admitted to chester county hospital in october of,following which he was referred to the hospital at the university of pennsylvania.there,doctors removed significant portions of his bone and tissue to treat the infection,and his pectoral muscle was surgically reconfigured.
aetna claims that its decision was not medical merely because it was made with an eye to plan language.to me this makes no sense,for aetna made precisely the same individualized determination of medical necessity as picariello.the fact that aetna is an hmo and picariello is an independent physician is entirely irrelevant to the fundamental character of their assessments.my conclusion that aetna decision may have been largely medical suggests that perhaps difelice claim should not be preempted.such a result would follow comfortably under dukes and in re healthcare.i agree with judge rendell,however,that supreme court precedent compels the conclusion that the proper test is whether a suit is theoretically possible under a,an approach which leads to preemption under the facts of this case.
judge rendell opinion recognizes that aetna decision had a medical component.it declines to characterize it as either eligibility or treatment,and concludes that in such mixed situations,preemption turns on the availability relief under erisa a.this resolution at least has the salutary effect of creating a rule,perhaps the best we can hope for absent intervention from a higher authority that would enable a truly principled jurisprudence.but while this rule is relatively easy to apply,that ease comes at the direct expense of plan participants welfare.the rule premise is that hmos that do not employ their own physicians are solely in the insurance business,that is,they do not provide care and can not be medically negligent.in the opinion words,because there is no allegation that aetna actually provided the medical care,aetna use of medical judgment could only have led to an eligibility,not a treatment,decision.i believe that this statement with which i do not agree encapsulates precisely why erisa failure to change with the times has rendered it incapable of protecting employees,and why congress must act to prevent further injustice.
as discussed above,existing supreme court precedent holds that erisa disallows extracontractual damages even in instances of bad faith,an interpretation that gives safe harbor to hmos that deny claims while also destroying any possibility of participants bringing actions under contingency fee arrangements.the result is that,in many cases,participants must take hmos decisions as law for example,when aetna utilization review board denied coverage for difelice specialized tracheostomy tube,he faced the decision whether to pay for the specialized tube,whereas appealing the hmo decision was simply impractical in the face of a medical emergency.in such cases,the critical insight is that the hmo de facto determines a patient actual treatment along with his eligibility for benefits,for it will be a relatively rare person who is able to pay for invasive procedures.
because erisa creates a system in which an hmo benefit determination frequently determines the actual treatment a participant receives,it follows directly that hmos determine quality of care and make treatment decisions regardless of whether they actually employ physicians.put differently,the root of courts erisa preemption nightmare is that erisa forces them to distinguish between eligibility and treatment decisions while providing a remedial structure that makes the two virtually synonymous.for participants,the torment is still greater erisa de facto places the hmo in control of the treatment a participant receives,yet it preempts any medical malpractice claim against that hmo and provides that the participant can recover no compensatory,punitive,or damages regardless of its malfeasance.
this situation has arisen because erisa has failed to evolve to accommodate the rise of hmos,which did not even exist when erisa was enacted in.back then,insurers dominated the health care industry.see pegram,at.see also kent rutter,democratizing hmo regulation to enforce the rule of rescue,u.ref.insurers had little role in a person treatment decisions instead,a participant would visit a doctor or hospital,receive treatment,and the doctor or hospital would bill the insurer.if an insurer refused to pay,the participant could bring suit under erisa a to recover benefits due under the terms of the plan.this was the role congress envisioned for,and it worked well,for any disagreement with an insurer would occur only after the participant medical crisis had abated,and in some ways the system created an incentive to provide too much care rather than too little.
times have changed.today,approximately of insured american workers receive their health care through some type of managed care plan,a designation which includes hmos.see andy miller,managed care savings noted,atlanta,june,at.one hallmark of managed care systems is the utilization review board,which approves or denies coverage for a procedure before the procedure actually takes place.although a participant may appeal a utilization review board decision,the system is thought to reduce costs to hmos because participants are likely to choose an inferior but approved procedure over a superior procedure for which they might ultimately pay following an unsuccessful appeal.erisa is often to deal with the phenomenon of the utilization review board,for the lack of remedies available under,as discussed above,actively encourages hmos to deny claims.because these denials now take place before the treatment itself,the effect is a systematic deterioration in the quality of treatment participants receive,all oxymoronically occasioned by a statute designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans.shaw,at.
what is to be done not much,absent intervention by congress or the supreme court,for lower courts are bound to follow precedents that lead inexorably to the availability of relief preemption test set forth by the majority opinion in this case.however,several promising avenues exist
