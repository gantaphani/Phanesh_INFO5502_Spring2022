jonathon mcintosh,dds,appeals the district court april,summary judgment based dismissal of his suit under the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act userra,the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment,and texas common law defamation.for the following reasons,we direct that the userra claim be dismissed for want of jurisdiction,and we otherwise affirm.
facts and proceedings below 
mcintosh was the director of dentistry and the treating dentist for the residents at the richmond state school rss,a texas home for people with mental and physical disabilities.rss is a part of the texas department of aging and disability services tdads.david partridge,was the medical director of rss and mcintosh direct supervisor adalberto barrera was the superintendent of rss.
mcintosh was a member of the navy reserve,and he was called to active duty to serve in iraq and kuwait in october.rss contracted with another dentist,june sadowsky,to treat the residents during mcintosh tour of duty.sadowsky reported that the residents teeth were in poor condition,some having been neglected to the point where they needed to be cleaned before their conditions could be properly assessed.in early,corinne scalzitti,conducted an audit of the professional aspects of rss dental clinic,after which she concluded that decisions made by mcintosh had impaired the quality of dental care at rss.
when mcintosh returned from military service in october,he notified partridge of his desire to return to his position at rss.on november,partridge told mcintosh that his clinical privileges were suspended pending an independent investigation into charges of professional incompetence and violations of the applicable standard of care.partridge placed mcintosh on paid leave,and he reported mcintosh conduct to the state board of dental examiners.mcintosh requested a hearing from rss to review his suspension,but none was held.on december,mcintosh brought this suit against partridge,both individually and in his official capacity as medical director of rss,asserting claims under the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act userra,a,the equal protection and the due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment,and texas common law defamation 
meanwhile,rss hired robert anderton,to conduct an independent investigation of the allegations against mcintosh.as part of this investigation,he reviewed the residents dental health and concluded that many residents suffered from extensive dental problems that were not properly treated or recorded on their charts by mcintosh.on august,barrera provided mcintosh with a copy of anderton report and gave him the opportunity to present a response either in writing or in person by august.mcintosh declined this offer,but he subsequently requested,and was granted,an opportunity to submit a written response to the allegations.mcintosh submitted his response on september.after reviewing mcintosh response,barrera terminated mcintosh on september.mcintosh filed a formal grievance with the health and human services commission on september.the grievance was submitted to a neutral adjudicator.at the request of both parties,the grievance process was abated on october,pending the resolution of this lawsuit.
in the proceedings below,mcintosh state law defamation claim was dismissed either upon mcintosh own motion or for failure to state a claim because partridge,as mcintosh employer,had a qualified privilege to report allegations of misconduct to the state board of dental examiners and he did so without malice.partridge then moved for summary judgment on the userra,equal protection,and due process claims,arguing that mcintosh could not establish that his suspension was motivated by his military service or that his constitutional rights were violated.mcintosh filed a for partial summary judgment asserting that his equal protection and due process rights were violated because partridge failed to grant him a hearing,as required by department procedures,before suspending him.partridge also filed an amended motion to dismiss contending,inter alia,that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the userra claims and that the eleventh amendment barred claims against partridge in his official capacity.
in its april,opinion on summary judgment,the district court held that provided for federal jurisdiction over mcintosh userra claim against partridge,that texas sovereign immunity did not bar the suit from being brought in federal court,that mcintosh failed to establish that his termination was related to his military service,and that mcintosh due process and equal protection rights were not violated.on that same day,the district court entered a judgment that mcintosh take nothing from partridge in either his individual or official capacity.
on may,mcintosh filed a motion for reconsideration,which was denied on may.mcintosh timely filed his notice of appeal on june.pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure a,partridge filed a notice with this court that he would be asserting that mcintosh userra claim was barred by the eleventh amendment.the united states intervened to defend the constitutionality of userra.
discussion 
on appeal,mcintosh argues that the district court erred by granting partridge motion for summary judgment as to his userra,due process,and equal protection claims.he also asserts that the district court erred by improperly considering inadmissible evidence submitted with partridge motion for summary judgment and by dismissing his state law defamation claim based upon an affirmative defense that partridge had failed to raise in his first responsive pleading.

federal jurisdiction over userra claims brought by an employee against a state as an employer 
userra is a federal law that protects employees from being discriminated against by their employers because of their military service.mcintosh argues that he was suspended and ultimately terminated from his position at rss because of his military service in iraq,and thus he brought a claim of discrimination under userra against partridge,in his official capacity as medical director of rss partridge and the united states argue that b strips the federal courts of jurisdiction over suits by an individual against a state as an employer,and that the district court erred by not dismissing mcintosh userra claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
userra operative text lays out three separate types of claims and identifies which courts have jurisdiction over those claims.
in the case of an action against a state as an employer or a private employer commenced by the united states,the district courts of the united states shall have jurisdiction over the action.
in the case of an action against a state as an employer by a person,the action may be brought in a state court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the laws of the state.
in the case of an action against a private employer by a person,the district courts of the united states shall have jurisdiction of the action.b.
all parties agree that mcintosh cause of action falls under subsection b of this statute.
in its order,the district court reasoned that,since the statute provides that suits by individuals against a state may,rather than must,be brought in state court,congress was not restricting jurisdiction to state courts.based on its interpretation of the word may,and because the previous version of the statute mandated federal jurisdiction over userra claims brought by individuals against states as employers,the district court concluded that mcintosh userra claim could be brought in either state or federal court this reasoning,however,departs from the proper standard for determining abrogation of sovereign immunity.the supreme court has held that congress may abrogate the states constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.atascadero state hosp.scanlon,d.the district court erred by assuming that federal jurisdiction existed because the statutory text did not expressly limit jurisdiction solely to state courts.under atascadero,congress must affirmatively and clearly grant jurisdiction to federal courts to abrogate state sovereign immunity.
userra jurisdictional statute provides that in an action against a state as an employer by a person,the action may be brought in a state court.b emphasis added.this language provides no indication that congress intended for these cases to be brought in federal court this omission is significant when compared with congress explicit provision for federal jurisdiction in cases where the federal government brings an userra claim or when the defendant is a private employer.b.these provisions demonstrate that congress knew how to provide for federal jurisdiction but specifically chose not to do so for userra claims brought by individuals against states as employers.the seventh circuit has interpreted the statute in a similar manner.see velasquez frapwell,cir per curiam holding that congress intention to limit userra suits against states to state courts is unmistakable.
this interpretation is also supported by a comparison of the current statute with its prior version.previously,congress had authorized the united states district courts to exercise jurisdiction over userra claims,with claims against a state as an employer to be brought in any district in which the state exercises any authority or carries out any function.b amended.by amending the statute to its current form,congress removed the blanket grant of jurisdiction to federal courts over all userra claims,and replaced it with a provision that only mentions the ability of individuals to bring claims against states as employers in state court.if we were to hold that the removal of the statutory language authorizing federal jurisdiction for these suits did not actually remove federal jurisdiction,we would be violating a basic tenant of statutory construction when congress amends a law the amendment is made to effect some purpose.argosy hennigan,cir.
after examining the text of the statute in its current and prior forms,we see no unmistakably clear intention by congress to abrogate state sovereign immunity by allowing individuals to bring userra claims against states as employers in federal court.therefore,this court does not have jurisdiction to hear mcintosh userra claim 
ii.did the district court err by considering partridge summary judgment evidence 
mcintosh objects that the district court erred by considering five pieces of summary judgment evidence anderton report on his investigation of the allegations of professional misconduct against mcintosh,an internal reporting the poor condition of rss residents teeth,partridge letter to the state dental board reporting mcintosh alleged professional misconduct,the state dental board response to partridge letter,and scalzitti audit of the professional aspects of rss dental clinic.mcintosh argues that the,the letters to and from the state dental board,and scalzitti audit are not competent summary judgment evidence and were not properly authenticated.he also asserts that anderton report does not comply with federal rule of civil procedure a b.
at the summary judgment phase,affidavits must set out facts that would be admissible in evidence at trial.fed civ.e.mcintosh asserts that four of five pieces of evidence contained inadmissible hearsay.this objection is without merit.the internal and scalzitti audit go to show why partridge believed that mcintosh was inadequately performing his duties at rss,which is relevant to the userra claim because it is evidence of partridge motivation for suspending mcintosh.since each of the documents is admissible for a relevant purpose other than the truth of the statements contained within them,they are not inadmissible hearsay.fed.evid.c.partridge statement contained in his letter to the dental board forms the basis for mcintosh defamation claim the reply from the state dental board confirms that it received the allegedly defamatory statements and there is no indication that admission of either was harmful to mcintosh.
mcintosh objection that anderton report was not submitted in accordance with federal rule of civil procedure a b,which governs expert reports,is similarly misplaced.anderton report investigated complaints about mcintosh performance as head dentist of rss,and it concluded that he had not been properly performing his duties.barrera partially based his decision to terminate mcintosh on the evaluation contained in this report.therefore,it is admissible as evidence that barrera terminated mcintosh due to his poor performance,not his military service.for this purpose,it is not necessary for the report to meet the requirements of rule a b consequently,the district court did not abuse its discretion by considering these pieces of evidence.furthermore,even if the consideration of the evidence was an error,mcintosh has not demonstrated how that error would have harmed him,so any error would not provide grounds for reversal.richardson oldham,cir.
iii.did the district court err in granting summary judgment on mcintosh due process and equal protection claims 
mcintosh argues that partridge violated his rights under the due process and equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment by failing to provide him with a neutral administrative hearing as required by tdads employee misconduct registry handbook the handbook before he was suspended mcintosh purportedly brings these causes of action against partridge in both his individual and official capacities.to the extent mcintosh claim is against partridge in his individual capacity for damages under,partridge is entitled to the defense of qualified immunity.bolton city of dallas,cir to the extent that mcintosh brings these claims against partridge in his official capacity for monetary damages from the state treasury,they are barred by texas sovereign immunity united carolina bank bd.of regents of stephen austin state,cir.
partridge contends that mcintosh is not covered by the handbook,so he was not entitled to the administrative hearing that it requires.alternatively,he argues that a violation of state procedures is insufficient to prove a violation of mcintosh federal constitutional right to due process and that mcintosh received all the process the constitution requires.the district court held that mcintosh had a property interest in his but that he was not denied due process because the state interest in protecting the residents of rss outweighed mcintosh economic interest in his job because the state actions were taken after the allegations were thoroughly researched,and discussed with him.
mcintosh assertion that his due process rights were violated because he was denied a hearing provided for by the handbook is incorrect because a violation of state law is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a finding of a due process violation.stern tarrant county hosp,cir en banc.the fundamental issue in due process law is not whether state officials violated state law,but whether they provided the plaintiff with the federal constitutional minima.gerhart hayes,cir.therefore,the issue is whether mcintosh received sufficient process to meet the requirements of the federal due process clause before his suspension with pay.
to determine what process is constitutionally due,the supreme court has advised us to balance three factors first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest th
