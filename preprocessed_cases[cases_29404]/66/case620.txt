in this case,a patient with an unsatisfied money judgment against a physician for medical malpractice seeks recovery from a hospital where the physician had staff privileges,alleging that the hospital should be liable to her for failing to ensure that the physician complied with statutory financial responsibility requirements.the issue is whether section,florida statutes,which outlines the financial responsibility requirements for physicians practicing in florida,imposes civil liability on the hospital under these circumstances.see plantation hosp.horowitz,so d dca.
the fourth district court of appeal held that there was no indication of legislative intent to impose civil liability on hospitals anywhere in the statutory scheme.see id.at.this decision expressly and directly conflicts with robert paschall,so d dca,baker tenet healthsystem hospitals,so d dca,and mercy hospital,baumgardner,so d dca,all of which recognized a statutory cause of action based on section.we accepted jurisdiction to resolve this conflict.see art.v,b.const.
we conclude,based on a review of the applicable statutory provisions,that the legislature did not intend to impose civil liability on hospitals for failing to ensure that physicians who are granted staff privileges comply with the financial responsibility requirements of section.we therefore approve the fourth district decision in this case and disapprove the decisions in robert,baker,and baumgardner.
facts and procedural history 
in january,lena horowitz visited the office of derek jhagroo,for examination and treatment of her infected right thumb.on january,jhagroo admitted her to plantation general hospital plantation,where it became necessary to amputate her thumb.lena horowitz and her husband,max horowitz,filed a malpractice suit against jhagroo,alleging that he committed malpractice while examining and treating her right thumb in his office.the complaint alleged that jhagroo was negligent in the treatment he provided in his office and did not involve any allegations arising from the admission and surgery conducted at plantation.jhagroo was the only defendant and there was no allegation that jhagroo was an employee of the hospital.
the malpractice action resulted in a verdict in the horowitzes favor and a final judgment against jhagroo in the amount of.however,the judgment was uncollectible because jhagroo failed to maintain malpractice insurance or otherwise comply with the financial responsibility requirements of section,owned no real property in the united states,and resided in another country.
in february,after unsuccessfully attempting to collect the judgment from jhagroo,the horowitzes filed suit against plantation the amended complaint alleged that plantation breached a statutory duty under section in failing to ensure the financial responsibility of jhagroo as a physician who had been granted staff privileges at the hospital specifically,horowitz asserted that because of that failure,plantation was liable for the first of the unsatisfied judgment.horowitz and plantation each filed motions for summary judgment.the issue on summary judgment was whether the holdings of the second,third,and fifth districts would apply to a case in which the underlying malpractice occurred in the physician office rather than the hospital.see horowitz,so d at 
in robert,one of the conflict cases,the fifth district determined that section mandates financial responsibility as a condition to maintaining staff privileges and therefore imposes a duty on the hospital to ensure physician compliance.so d at.the fifth district reasoned that the obvious intent of the legislature was to make sure that a person injured by the medical malpractice of a doctor with staff privileges would be able to ultimately recover at least of compensable damages.id.the court then held that the cause of action against the hospital would accrue only after the injured person obtained a judgment against the physician for medical malpractice,and that the hospital liability would be limited to.id.at.the second district in baker,so d at,and the third district in baumgardner,so d at,agreed with the fifth district opinion in robert.
the trial court,relying on the decisions of these district courts of appeal,granted summary judgment in favor of horowitz and awarded him.this amount represented the minimum level of financial responsibility required by the statute,plus taxable costs.
on appeal,the fourth district reversed the judgment of the trial court without drawing a distinction between malpractice that occurs in a hospital and malpractice that occurs in a physician office.the fourth district rejected the assertion that section creates a statutory cause of action against a hospital whether it be based on strict liability,negligence,suretyship,contract,contribution,indemnification,criminal punishment,or any other legal theory the creative minds of lawyers can discern.horowitz,so d at.the fourth district determined that the intent of the statute was to ensure that physicians maintain financial responsibility to satisfy judgments against them and not to make hospitals liable for the unsatisfied malpractice judgments of their physicians.id.at.the court noted that its decision conflicted with robert,baker and baumgardner.id.at.
our determination of whether section imposes civil liability on hospitals is a question of statutory interpretation.therefore,our review is de novo.see aramark unif.career apparel,easton,so d.we first address whether hospitals have a duty under the common law to ensure the financial responsibility of physicians.the analysis of the common law provides a basis upon which to determine whether the statute codifies,modifies,or supplants legal principles that previously existed.see id.then,we discuss how this court determines whether a statute imposes civil liability when the legislature has not expressly provided for a private remedy.finally,with this framework in mind,we examine the primary purpose of chapter,the language of section,other provisions in chapter,and related provisions in other chapters to determine legislative intent.
common law 
at common law,a hospital was not vicariously liable for the tortious acts of an independent contractor such as a physician in private practice to whom it had granted staff privileges.see insinga labella,so d.however,consistent with decisions in a number of other jurisdictions,this court recognized a common law duty on the part of florida hospitals to exercise reasonable care in granting staff privileges to physicians.see id.at.we held that when a hospital breaches that duty by granting staff privileges to a medically incompetent physician,the hospital is liable based on a theory of negligence.see id.in insinga,we referred to this theory of liability as the corporate negligence doctrine,whereby the hospital liability is founded on the independent duty it owes to its patients to be responsible for proper medical treatment on its premises.id.at.accordingly,we stated 
while the term corporate negligence may have a much broader connotation,we construe it here to mean that a hospital liability is founded on the independent duty it owes to its patients.the public policy which justifies placing the expanded responsibility and duty of care on a hospital is based on the present day view that a hospital is a multifaceted health care facility that should be responsible for proper medical treatment on its premises.this view is justified because the hospital is in a superior position to supervise and monitor physician performance and is,consequently,the only entity that can realistically provide quality control.
w e find,as a matter of public policy,that hospitals are in the best position to protect their patients and,consequently,have an independent duty to select and retain competent independent physicians seeking staff privileges.we note that the hospital liability extends only to the physician conduct while rendering treatment to patients in the hospital and does not extend to his conduct beyond the hospital premises.moreover,the hospital will only be responsible for the negligence of an independent physician when it has failed to exercise due care in the selection and retention of that physician on its staff.
id.at citations omitted.
the common law duty recognized in insinga was limited to the selection and retention of medically competent physicians for actions occurring in the hospital.we have never recognized a common law duty on the part of a hospital to ensure the financial responsibility of its physicians,who are independent contractors.
in beam university hospital building,so d,dca,the first district rejected the argument that a hospital had a duty at common law to ensure the financial responsibility of its physicians as explained by the first district 
it is true that the corporate negligence doctrine is premised on the notion that it is foreseeable that a hospital failure to properly investigate an applicant for staff privileges would present a foreseeable risk of harm to the hospital patients.however,there is nothing in the case law on corporate negligence suggesting that this foreseeability of harm extends to conceivable risks of financial harm a patient might suffer should he sue a physician financially incapable of paying a malpractice judgment.
id.at citations omitted emphasis supplied the court affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff common law negligence action and noted that no case,either in florida or elsewhere,has recognized the tort of negligent selection of a financially incompetent physician.beam,so d at.although the fifth district in robert recognized a statutory duty under section,the court declined to equate a duty to ensure physician compliance with the statutory financial responsibility requirements with a duty to ensure a physician professional competence,namely,the common law duty of hospitals to select and retain professionally competent staff physicians.see so d at.
we agree with beam and robert that there is no recognized common law duty on the part of hospitals to monitor the financial responsibility of physicians and thus no common law cause of action against hospitals for breaching that duty.if such a duty and cause of action exist,they do so by virtue of statutory modification of the common law.aramark,so d at a statute creates a new cause of action if it provides a remedy unavailable under the common law.
statutory causes of action 
the seminal florida case on whether a statutory cause of action exists without an express provision imposing civil liability is this court decision in murthy sinha,so d.in murthy,the issue was whether chapter,florida statutes,the licensing and regulatory chapter governing construction contracts,created a statutory cause of action against an agent who failed to supervise a corporation construction project.see id.at.because the relevant statute did not expressly provide for a civil cause of action,the question was whether one should be judicially implied.see id.at.
the court explained that historically,when determining whether to judicially imply a cause of action,the primary focus was on whether the statute imposed a duty to benefit a class of individuals and that a cause of action arose when a class member was injured by a breach of that duty.id.however,we concluded that legislative intent had become the primary factor that most courts,including the united states supreme court,used to determine whether a cause of action exists when a statute does not expressly provide for one.see id.citing transamerica mortgage advisors,tama lewis,d,and freehauf sch.bd.of seminole county,so d,dca.
in determining whether the legislature intended to provide a private cause of action against a qualifying agent in chapter,we first recognized that the applicable statutes had imposed a duty on agents to supervise a corporation construction projects.however,we explained that the recognition of a duty did not answer the question of whether a breach of that duty would give rise to civil liability.id.at.to determine the existence of civil liability,we turned to the stated scope of chapter,which established licensing procedures and regulatory duties for the construction industry and created a licensing board to enforce the procedures and duties.see id.at.we concluded that there was no evidence in the language of the statute or the statutory structure that a private cause of action against a qualifying agent was contemplated by the legislature in enacting this statute.id.rather,the language of chapter indicates that it was created merely to secure the safety and welfare of the public by regulating the construction industry.id.
importantly,we noted that i n general,a statute that does not purport to establish civil liability but merely makes provision to secure the safety or welfare of the public as an entity,will not be construed as establishing a civil liability.id.further,we looked to prior statutory enactments and explained that the sole provision authorizing private suits had authorized them only against unlicensed or uncertified contractors and that even that provision had been removed.id.without evidence of legislative intent in the language or the legislative history of chapter,we declined to recognize a private remedy against a qualifying agent.id.
since murthy,we have reaffirmed the principle that whether a statutory cause of action should be judicially implied is a question of legislative intent.see aramark,so d at villazon prudential health care plan,so d.we agree with the fourth district that legislative intent,as used in murthy and its progeny,is a shorthand reference to the ordinary tools for discerning statutory meaning text,context,and purpose.horowitz,so d at.moreover,we agree with the overarching principle that judges lack the power to construe an unambiguous statute in a way which would extend,modify,or limit,its express terms or its reasonable and obvious implications.to do so would be an abrogation of legislative power.holly auld,so d.
the primary guide to our analysis of whether the legislature intended to impose civil liability is,as in all cases of statutory construction,the actual language used in the statute.borden ins,so d.in determining the meaning of the language used,we look not only to the words themselves but also to the context in which the language lies.miele,so d.
chapter,florida statutes 
horowitz relies on section,entitled financial responsibility,to assert that the legislature intended to impose a duty on,and create a cause of action against,the hospital chapter,in which this provision is located,primarily regulates the practice of physicians and medical practitioners,not hospitals.this is evident not only from the substance of the chapter but from the title itself medical practice.city of boca raton state,so d,stating that the title of a chapter reflects the legislature intent.in this chapter,the legislature established procedures and requirements relating to practitioner licensing,specialized certification,physician financial responsibility,discipline,and physician supervision over assistants and created the board of medicine.furthermore,the regulations in chapter are intended to safeguard the public from unsafe and unqualified physicians.see.stat.this is evidenced by the legislature statement that physicians who fall below minimum competency or who otherwise present a danger to the public shall be prohibited from practicing in this state.id.with this overview in mind,we turn to the pertinent provisions of chapter.
section sets forth the statutory financial responsibility requirements for physicians practicing in florida.the first subsection of this provision applies to all physicians and requires,as a condition of licensure,that physicians demonstrate a financial ability to pay medical malpractice claims.see.stat.specifically,section provides 
as a condition of licensing and maintaining an active license,and prior to the issuance or renewal of an active license or reactivation of an inactive license for the practice of medicine,an applicant must by one of the following methods demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board and the d epartment of health financial responsibility to pay claims and costs ancillary thereto arising out of the rendering of,or the failure to r
