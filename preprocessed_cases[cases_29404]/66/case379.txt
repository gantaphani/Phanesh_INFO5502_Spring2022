larry kaplan appeals from the trial court judgment dismissing his medical malpractice complaint against adam mamelak.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
facts and proceedings 
appellant larry kaplan suffered pain from a herniated disk in his spine.the disk,identified as,lay between the eighth and ninth thoracic chest vertebrae of his spinal column.kaplan sought treatment from respondent neurosurgeon adam mamelak.in july,respondent operated on kaplan spine,intending to excise the herniated portion of disk to relieve kaplan pain.during surgery,respondent mistook the disks causing appellant pain and their place on kaplan spinal column.he thus operated on the disks between the sixth and seventh and seventh and eighth thoracic vertebrae,instead of the.
after recovering from surgery,appellant continued to suffer pain.respondent thus ordered an mri of appellant spine.the mri showed the protrusion causing appellant pain from the herniation at remained because respondent had operated on the wrong disks.
respondent met with appellant on september,to discuss the mri findings.during the meeting,respondent told appellant he had mistakenly operated on the wrong disks they discussed appellant treatment options,after which appellant agreed to undergo a second operation.in september,respondent reoperated on appellant,but again mislocated the herniation and operated on the wrong disk.following the second surgery,appellant sought treatment from a different neurosurgeon who operated on the correct disk.from the repeated operations,appellant suffers lingering pain and limited mobility in his back.
on september,one year and six days after the september conversation,appellant served his notice of his intent to sue respondent for medical malpractice.code civ.if filed within days before expiration of the statute of limitations for medical malpractice,the notice of intent ordinarily gives an injured patient an additional days from service of the notice within which to file his malpractice complaint,subd.d.in keeping with his perceived extra time,appellant filed his complaint for medical malpractice less than days later on december.the complaint also alleged causes of action for battery,which the court dismissed on demurrer for failure to state a cause of action.we discuss that dismissal in more detail later in this opinion.
respondent answered the complaint with the affirmative defense that the statute of limitations for medical malpractice barred appellant complaint.respondent observed and the jury later found that appellant knew from the september conversation that respondent had injured him by operating on the wrong disks.thus,appellant notice of intent to sue served on september,was six days late and afforded him no extension to file his complaint,rendering his complaint filed in december three months too late.
respondent moved to bifurcate the trial on his statute of limitations defense from the trial on liability.appellant did not oppose the motion,and the court thereafter granted it.the statute of limitations defense was tried to a jury,which returned a special verdict in respondent favor.in reaching its unanimous verdict,the jury answered yes to the following question was the plaintiff on notice of wrongdoing on the part of the defendant by september,following the jury verdict,the court ruled appellant complaint was untimely under the one year statute of limitations for medical malpractice.the court entered judgment for respondent.this appeal followed.
discussion 
court erred prohibiting discovery on tolling of statute of limitations 
during pretrial discovery,appellant sought discovery on whether respondent had been outside california anytime between the first operation in july and the anniversary in of their september conversation.appellant theory was section tolled the statute of limitations during any days respondent was out of state.that statute states 
i f,after the cause of action accrues,the defendant departs from the state,the time of his absence is not part of the time limited for the commencement of the action.
objecting to the discovery,respondent argued section did not apply to medical malpractice.he therefore refused to answer appellant requests for admission or interrogatories because he deemed them not likely to lead to relevant or admissible evidence.
appellant moved to compel respondent compliance with the discovery requests the court denied appellant motions.agreeing with respondent,it found tolling under section for a defendant absence from california did not apply to the statute of limitations for medical malpractice.thus,discovery involving respondent time outside california sought meaningless information.in support of its ruling,the court relied on a footnote in hanooka pivko th,d hanooka.that footnote stated,the general tolling provision of section is not applicable to medical malpractice actions.id.at,fn,d.
our supreme court decision in belton bowers ambulance service cal th,d,belton shows the trial court erred in refusing to apply section to allow tolling of the statute of limitations for medical malpractice.in belton,a medical care provider injured a prison inmate,who sued the provider for medical malpractice more than one year after being injured.the trial court dismissed the complaint as untimely because the prisoner had not filed it within the statute of limitations.belton,at,d.on appeal,the supreme court reversed the trial court.the supreme court held section tolling provision for the benefit of incarcerated to the part of the medical malpractice statutes of limitations.
the belton court analysis rested on a careful reading of the statute of limitations language in micra medical injury compensation reform act,the legislative scheme covering medical malpractice.it noted micra statute of limitations had two parts.the first required an injured patient to file his medical malpractice complaint within one year of when he discovered,or should have discovered,his injury.the second imposed an absolute limit of three years to file a complaint after the injury occurrence,except under circumstances of fraud,intentional concealment,or a foreign object presence inside a patient.belton,supra,cal th at,d.case law sometimes refers to the period as the inside limit and the period as the outside limit.applying customary principles of statutory interpretation,the belton court concluded the legislature intent in identifying three specific exceptions to the ordinarily absolute outside limit was to prohibit tolling of the statute of limitations for any other reason.id.at,d,favorably citing fogarty superior court d.fogarty no tolling provision outside of micra can extend the maximum time period that section establishes beyond the three identified in the statute.the belton court drew from the inside limit failure to identify,in contrast,any limits on tolling that general statutory tolling provisions continued to apply to the one year statute of limitations.the listing of specified tolling rules in section implicitly excludes others,but these limits apply only to tolling rules which extend the total limitations period beyond three years.belton,at,d.thus,section general tolling of statutes of limitations for the benefit of confined prisoners applied to the statute for medical malpractice.belton,at,d.
the implications of belton analysis for our case here is inescapable.like tolling the statute of limitations for confined prisoners under section,tolling under section for a defendant absence from california is of general applicability.for other general tolling provisions,see minors or insanity restitution orders court assumption of attorney practice war injunction.respondent tries to distinguish belton by noting our case and belton involve different tolling statutes.but belton analysis shows the distinction is inconsequential.the belton court focus was interpreting micra provisions it was a mere happenstance to belton analysis that the tolling provision at issue involved incarcerated prisoners instead of time or any other general tolling provision,and nothing in belton suggests its analysis does not apply to such other general provisions.
