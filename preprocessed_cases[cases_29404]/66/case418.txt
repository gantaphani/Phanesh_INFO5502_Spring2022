respondent,superior court,granted the summary judgment motion of defendants and real parties in interest,seth rosenthal and mark leibenhaut in the medical malpractice action filed by plaintiff and petitioner,donald johnson the trial court granted the summary judgment motion because it found plaintiff expert declaration in opposition to the motion was patently inadequate and it refused to consider a amended declaration.
plaintiff filed this action for a writ of mandate.we granted an alternative writ and stayed the proceedings.we shall conclude that defendants expert declaration was insufficient to establish facts from which a reasonable trier of fact would find the defendants acted within the standard of care.therefore,even if plaintiff expert declaration was inadmissible,defendants were not entitled to summary judgment.
we will issue a peremptory writ.
factual and procedural background 
plaintiff complaint alleged the following pertinent facts.plaintiff was diagnosed with prostate cancer,and in january was treated for that condition by the implantation of radioactive material in his prostate gland.his doctors,including defendants,negligently examined,diagnosed,treated,and cared for him by implanting or causing to be implanted an excessive amount of radioactive material.as a result,his surrounding tissues and organs were badly damaged,necessitating a colostomy,bladder removal,and other related procedures.also as a result,he has suffered great physical and emotional pain.
defendants filed a motion for summary judgment the declaration of kent wallner,a radiation oncologist,was filed in support of the motion.wallner identified the records he had reviewed and stated on september,plaintiff had an ultrasound of his prostate.thereafter,plans were made on where and how many radioactive seeds should be placed.the implantation plan was created by rosenthal.leibenhaut,another radiation oncologist,reviewed the plan and agreed with rosenthal calculation.the plan was within the standard of care at the time the plan involved the implantation of radioactive seeds.however,that dose was increased to seeds during the actual implantation.as to this wallner stated plaintiff had a check of the seeds done on november.the results showed an adequate dosage.the implantation was within the standard of care for the time.
wallner further explained that plaintiff developed a rectal fistula from the radiation,and that he ultimately required a colostomy and resection of the anus,rectum,and colon,and removal of the bladder.wallner opined that the rectal fistula was not indicative of medical negligence,and that plaintiff suffered a known,but rare,outcome of a procedure that was planned,performed and monitored properly and within the standard of care at the time of the treatment.
plaintiff opposition to the summary judgment motion included the declaration of his expert,owen kim.kim stated he was a physician licensed to practice medicine in california,and was the medical director of the roger good cancer treatment center in porterville,california.however,the declaration did not state where it was signed,and purported to be merely under penalty of perjury rather than under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of california.he stated he was a diplomat of the american boards of radiology,hospice,and palliative medicine.the declaration claimed to include an attached curriculum vitae,but none was attached.
kim also made the following statements 
i have reviewed the relevant medical records of donald johnson.based on these,there was clear negligence involved in the implantation procedure of.the prostate volume was estimated to be cc via measurement using ultrasound studies.mcis were planned to be implanted which is significantly higher than the recommendation of mcis according to nist standard.
inexplicably,johnson was implanted with extra seeds to receive mcis at the time of operation,with the very predictable result of severe rectal and urethral injuries.
the post plan studies showed quite clearly that the rectum received far more than the recommended upper safe much as parts of the rectum.what appears to be only a small increase in the overall activity number implanted from what should have been actually has a significant exponential increase in both the dose and the biological effect of tissues.
in summary,there were too many radioactive seeds planned for the volume of prostate,and without any good explanation noted on operative note s or elsewhere the patient was implanted with extra seeds exceeding the already excessive dose planned for this patient.
plaintiff also submitted a declaration in opposition to the motion.in it,he testified to the devastating effect of his injuries,noting he had to undergo a colostomy and urostomy and live the rest of my life as i do with two bags for those procedures,the leakages,the infections,the herniations,dehydration,and the like he also described that by the one year anniversary of the procedure,he was in constant pain and taking six to eight vicodin pills each day.that dosage was later increased.he stated that on the second anniversary of the procedure,my innards were still so damaged that i was urinating through my rectum.
plaintiff objected to wallner declaration on various grounds,including that it lacked foundation and contained legal conclusions.
in reply to the opposition,defendants argued kim declaration was insufficient because it failed to comply with code of civil procedure section failed to properly qualify kim as an expert with the requisite knowledge to offer an expert opinion,failed to establish a foundation for the opinion,and failed to provide any evidence on the issue of the standard of care.
apparently in response to the concerns raised in the reply,plaintiff filed an amended declaration of kim,which added certain information.kim declared he was a radiation oncologist with substantial brachytherapy experience.rather than simply stating he had reviewed plaintiff relevant medical records,he added that the records he reviewed had been provided by rosenthal and others.he stated there had been a failure of the standard of care in the implantation procedure.finally the declaration was made under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of california.the amended declaration was not filed until two days before the date of the hearing on the motion.code of civil procedure section,subdivision b requires opposition papers to be served and filed not less than days preceding the noticed or continued date of hearing,unless the court for good cause orders otherwise.
at the hearing on the motion,plaintiff attorney,steven mccarthy,gave the court an explanation for the faulty expert declaration.mccarthy said that he contracted with american medical forensics services for kim services in this case.when he contacted kim to get his declaration,kim told him he was out of the expert witness business and would not do any further work.after some persuasion,kim agreed to execute a declaration containing only the substance of a letter he had written when he first evaluated the case.
mccarthy said american medical forensics services eventually talked kim into signing the amended declaration,but by then the time to respond was over.mccarthy explained that the nist is the national institute for standards and technology,a part of the department of commerce that promulgates the radiological standards in the business.
the trial court stated everything that you said may well be part of the subsequent motion,but it not a motion that you going to make orally here today without notice to the other side without thoroughly briefing it.the statutory period and the notice required for motion for summary judgment,we all know,has been enlarged for the very purpose of giving folks like you full and complete,and then some,opportunity to respond.i do,frankly,have a whole lot of sympathy for your position of suddenly not having an expert and for having an expert who wo sign what potentially would be of use.i have sympathy for your client,and,if you want to make a motion down the road,that fine.
