background 
the record reveals the following pertinent facts.in march,burns suffered a second stroke,which resulted in partial paralysis to his right side,impairing his ability to walk independently.also as a result of the stroke,burns could not speak,but could understand others and respond with physical gestures.since march,a general internist,had been burns regular treating physician.
on november,burns,then years old,was admitted to the hospital for treatment of a urinary tract infection.while at the hospital,was burns primary care physician.the hospital categorized a patient risk of falling between two levels.a patient who has no impairments of any kind is characterized as a level i fall risk.a patient who has any physical or mental impairments that increase the risk of falling is characterized as level ii.because of burns history of partial paralysis,he was characterized as level ii.
on the evening of november,nurse carrie lewis was burns primary nurse.burns had been in his bed,equipped with four side rails,all of which were raised.between and,nurse lewis went into burns room and found burns attempting to get out of bed through the side rails.after each of the first two occurrences,nurse lewis found burns to be alert,oriented,and able to understand her instructions to stay in bed.after the third occasion,burns still appeared alert and oriented.however,nurse lewis became concerned because of burns failure to follow instructions and because burns now appeared to be agitated.nurse lewis was concerned that burns might again attempt to get out of bed and that he could fall if he did so.
based on these concerns,nurse lewis telephoned at approximately and asked the doctor to order a posey vest to restrain burns to his bed.a posey vest is used to restrain a patient by placing the vest on the patient and then tying the vest straps to the bed.advised nurse lewis that a posey vest might result in burns becoming even more agitated.rather than using a physical restraint,ordered the administration of the drug ativan to calm burns and help him sleep.prescribed a very small dosage and left it to nurse lewis discretion to administer more ativan if needed.
at approximately,nurse lewis administered to burns one milligram of ativan,which was expected to last for at least two hours.between and midnight,nurse lewis and a nurse aide checked on burns approximately every half hour.by burns was asleep he was sleeping at each check.at approximately,a nurse aide walked past burns room and looked inside burns appeared to be sleeping.at,a monitor technician heard a noise in the area of burns room and so informed nurse lewis.upon receiving this report,nurse lewis ran to burns room and found him on the floor with his head bleeding from a cut above his left eye.apparently,burns had attempted to get up from his bed and walk however,he fell and struck his head on the hospital room floor.as a result of the fall,burns developed a subdural hematoma,for which he received treatment.at the request of his family,burns was subsequently transferred to another hospital.
on november,plaintiff and burns filed a complaint against the hospital and.the complaint alleged that the hospital,through nurse lewis,and,failed to properly monitor,medicate,or restrain burns.in count i,burns sought damages for injuries proximately caused by defendants negligence.in count ii,plaintiff sought damages for loss of consortium.in september,burns died of a third stroke,which was unrelated to plaintiff allegations of negligence.on december,burns death was formally reported to the trial court plaintiff was appointed special administrator of burns estate and substituted as the sole plaintiff.
at trial,plaintiff attempted to establish the hospital liability vicariously through the actions of nurse lewis.plaintiff called william barnhart to testify as her medical expert.barnhart is a physician specializing in internal medicine and has substantial experience in observing and working with physicians and nurses in the area of patient fall protection.plaintiff intended for barnhart to testify to the applicable standards of care for physicians and nurses,and the failure of both and nurse lewis to meet their respective standards of care.
barnhart testified as to the standard of care for a licensed nurse and the instances in which nurse lewis deviated from the standard of care.according to barnhart,one such instance included nurse lewis failure to properly communicate burns condition to during their phone conversation.the trial court found that plaintiff did not properly disclose barnhart opinion on this issue during pretrial discovery,in violation of supreme court rule g g.therefore,the trial court struck the testimony relating to nurse lewis communications with.
according to barnhart,nurse lewis deviated from the standard of care for a licensed nurse also by her failure to adhere to proper nursing procedures in the care and treatment of a patient.barnhart opined that nurse lewis,after having failed to receive approval to use a posey vest on burns,should have gone up the nursing chain of command to pursue her concerns that burns would attempt to get out of bed that she should have provided for an alternative to the posey vest to protect against the risk of a fall and that nurse lewis should have had a sitter in burns room,or should have moved burns bed to an area where burns could have received constant supervision.at the close of plaintiff case,the trial court struck this testimony on the grounds that a physician is incompetent to testify to the standard of care placed upon a licensed nurse.
barnhart was plaintiff only medical expert as to the standard of care for the nursing profession.after the trial court ruled that barnhart was incompetent to testify as to that standard,the court granted the hospital motion for a directed verdict.thereafter,the jury returned a verdict in favor of and the trial court entered judgment thereon.the appellate court affirmed.d.
this court allowed plaintiff petition for leave to appeal.a.we subsequently granted the illinois trial lawyers association leave to submit an amicus curiae brief in support of plaintiff.we also granted the american association of nurse attorneys leave to submit an amicus curiae brief in support of the hospital.we will refer to additional pertinent facts as they relate to the issues plaintiff raises before this court.
barnhart testimony 
plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in striking,as a discovery sanction,barnhart testimony relating to nurse lewis communications with.plaintiff also contends that the trial court erred in striking barnhart testimony relating to the standard of care for the nursing profession and,consequently,entering a directed verdict in favor of the hospital.
discovery violation 
during pretrial discovery,plaintiff submitted a disclosure pursuant to supreme court rule,which disclosed the names and addresses of plaintiff witnesses and the subject of their testimony.this disclosure included barnhart name and address,and the following description of his anticipated testimony 
it is anticipated that barnhart will testify that it is his opinion that conte russian and edward hospital deviated from the accepted standards of medical care by disregarding burns sullivan status as a level ii fall risk suffered from cognitive impairment and inability to understand directions and was found trying to climb out of bed on three prior occasions even though he suffered from.he will testify that and the edward hospital staff should have restrained sullivan in bed so that he could not get out.further,he will testify that the attempt to sedate sullivan by issuing medication as opposed to restraints was not properly performed.he will also testify that it is his opinion that sullivan was not properly monitored during sedation despite his inability to understand direction and physical impairments.he will also testify that in his opinion burns sullivan injuries were sustained as a result of medical negligence.
barnhart will testify that in his opinion,after having been advised of sullivan three prior attempts to get out of bed and remove his iv,should have ordered restraints for sullivan.he will testify that in his opinion and the edward hospital medical staff should have ordered restraints for sullivan.that in his opinion,and the edward hospital medical staff should have monitored sullivan more frequently after the decision not to use restraints was made.that as a result of decision not to properly restrain sullivan,he fell out of bed and sustained brain injury including a subdural hematoma.
at trial,barnhart testimony reflected this disclosure.however,he also testified that one instance where nurse lewis deviated from the standard of care for professional nurses was her failure to adequately communicate burns condition to during their phone conversation.
at the close of barnhart testimony,the hospital moved to strike that portion of his testimony relating to nurse lewis communication of burns condition to.plaintiff conceded that barnhart specific opinion regarding nurse lewis failure to adequately communicate with was not included in plaintiff rule disclosure.the trial court granted the hospital motion to strike this testimony.
this cause was tried prior to the amendment of rule effective july,so we will refer to its preamendment version.supreme court rule g requires that,upon written interrogatory,a party must disclose the subject matter,conclusions,opinions,qualifications,and all reports of a witness who will offer any opinion testimony.g.further,supreme court rule i imposes on each party a continuing duty to inform the opponent of new or additional information whenever such information becomes known to the party.i.the rule disclosure requirements are mandatory and subject to strict compliance by the parties.seef ingalls memorial hospital,d,warrender millsop,d.the admission of evidence pursuant to rule is within the sound discretion of the trial court,and the court ruling will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion.susnis radfar,d,seef,d at.
as noted,plaintiff concedes that barnhart specific opinion regarding nurse lewis failure to adequately communicate burns condition to was not included in plaintiff rule disclosure.however,plaintiff argues that the gist of barnhart trial testimony regarding nurse lewis telephone conversation with was an elaboration or a logical corollary of,or effectively implicated,plaintiff rule disclosure.
the trial court did not accept this argument,and neither do we.as the trial court reasoned,you have to drop down to specifics.rule permits litigants to rely on the disclosed opinions of opposing experts and to construct their trial strategy accordingly.firstar bank of illinois peirce,d.the supreme court rules represent this court best efforts to manage the complex and important process of discovery.one of the purposes of rule is to avoid surprise.g,committee comments.to allow either side to ignore rule plain language defeats its purpose and encourages tactical gamesmanship.department of transportation crull,d.our appellate court has stated 
rule establishes more exacting standards regarding disclosure than did supreme court rule,which formerly governed expert witnesses.trial courts should be more reluctant under rule than they were under former rule to permit the parties to deviate from the strict disclosure requirements,or not to impose severe sanctions when such deviations occur.indeed,we believe one of the reasons for new rule was the need to require stricter adherence to disclosure requirements.susnis,d at,quoting crull,d at.
we agree.given this stricter standard of compliance,we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiff violated rule g.see susnis,d at.
plaintiff further argues that even if barnhart testimony constituted a discovery violation,the extreme remedy of striking the testimony constituted an abuse of the trial court discretion.we disagree.where a party fails to comply with the provisions of rule,a court should not hesitate sanctioning the party,as rule demands strict compliance.peirce,d at,quoting warrender,d at.in determining whether the exclusion of a witness is a proper sanction for nondisclosure,a court must consider the following factors the surprise to the adverse party the prejudicial effect of the testimony the nature of the testimony the diligence of the adverse party the timely objection to the testimony and the good faith of the party calling the witness.the decision whether or not to impose sanctions lies within the sound discretion of the trial court,and that decision will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.warrender,d at,ashpole brunswick bowling billiards,d.
the record shows that,regarding the first factor,the hospital was clearly surprised by barnhart testimony.plaintiff concedes that the rule g disclosure did not contain the opinion to which barnhart testified.further,nowhere in his deposition does barnhart suggest or imply that nurse lewis failed to communicate appropriately with and that this failure proximately caused burns fall.
regarding the second and third factors,the nature of the testimony and its prejudicial effect are manifest.barnhart testified regarding an instance of how the hospital deviated from the standard of care for nurses.this was a theory of negligence of which the hospital should have been informed.regarding the fourth through the sixth factors,the record shows that the hospital was diligent in sending its rule interrogatories to plaintiff that the hospital timely objected to the contested testimony and that this lapse in an otherwise detailed summary of barnhart anticipated testimony does not indicate good faith.
the purpose behind rule is to avoid surprise and to discourage tactical gamesmanship.rule brings to a trial a degree of certainty and predictability that furthers the administration of justice.the rule should be enforced by trial judges.peirce,d at.we can not say that the trial court abused its discretion in striking this portion of barnhart testimony.see susnis,d at,finding no abuse of discretion when trial court bars expert physician testimony after party fails to make rule disclosure of testimony regarding the relevant standard of care.
nursing standard of care 
plaintiff also contends that the trial court erred in striking barnhart testimony relating to the standard of care for the nursing profession and,consequently,entering a directed verdict in favor of the hospital.in directing a verdict,the trial court determines as a matter of law that there are no evidentiary facts out of which the jury may construe the necessary fact essential to recovery.emphasis added.jones.accordingly,our review is de novo.
this court has explained the requirement of expert medical testimony in a medical malpractice action as follows 
in a negligence medical malpractice case,the burden is on the plaintiff to prove the following elements of a cause of action the proper standard of care against which the defendant physician conduct is measured an unskilled or negligent failure to comply with the applicable standard and a resulting injury proximately caused by the physician want of skill or care.citations.unless the physician negligence is so grossly apparent or the treatment so common as to be within the everyday knowledge of a layperson,expert medical testimony is required to establish the standard of care and the defendant physician deviation from that standard.purtill hess.
accord dolan galluzzo.
in this case,the trial court ruled that barnhart was incompetent to testify as to the standard of care for the nursing profession and nurse lewis deviations therefrom.the appellate court upheld the trial court ruling.d at.in jones,at,this court summarized the test of an expert physician competency to testify 
in purtill hess,this court articulated the requirements necessary to demonstrate an expert physician qualifications and competency to testify.first,the physician must be a licensed member of the school of medicine about which he proposes to testify.purtill,at,citing dolan galluzzo.second,the expert witness must show that he is familiar with the methods,procedures,and treatments ordinarily observed by other physicians,in either the defendant physician community or a similar community.purtill,at.once the foundational requirements have been met,the trial court has the discretion to determine whether a physician is qualified and competent to state his opinion as an expert regarding the standard of care.purtill,at.
if the expert physician fails to satisfy either of these foundational requirements,the trial court must disallow the expert testimony.jones,at.
dolan established the first requirement,that a expert witness must be a licensed member of the school of medicine about which the expert proposes to testify.dolan explained that there are different systems or schools of medicine with varying tenets and practices,and that testing the care and skill of a practitioner of one school of medicine by the opinion of a practitioner of another school would result in inequities.the practitioner of a particular school of medicine is entitled to have his or her conduct tested by the standards of that school.dolan,at,and authorities cited therein.
this court in dolan further observed 
illinois statutes citations provide for the regulation of practitioners of medicine and surgery,physical therapy,nursing,pharmacy,dental surgery,podiatry,optometry.this is a clear expression by the legislature of public policy to recognize and regulate various schools of medicine.the various acts regulating the health professions citations provide for different training,and regulate the treatment each profession may offer.we simply are not disposed to provide for what,in effect,may result in a higher standard of care when the legislature,by recognizing various schools of medicine,has not done so.to do so would not only be unfair,but it would also assume that science and medicine have achieved a universal standard of treatment of disease or injury.such is not the case.in its wisdom,the legislature has recognized a fundamental tenet of contemporary life no one person,group or school has yet succeeded in abstracting a universal medical method from the many changing methods used in science and medicine.dolan,at.
accordingly,the dolan court held that in order to testify as an expert on the standard of care in a given school of medicine,the witness must be licensed therein.dolan,at.
plaintiff argues that illinois law no longer holds that a health professional expert witness must always be a licensed member of the school of medicine about which the expert proposes to testify.in support of her argument,plaintiff cites the following from jones 
by hearing evidence on the expert qualifications and comparing the medical problem and the type of treatment in the case to the experience and background of the expert,the trial court can evaluate whether the witness has demonstrated a sufficient familiarity with the standard of care practiced in the case.the foundational requirements provide the trial court with the information necessary to determine whether an expert has expertise in dealing with the plaintiff medical problem and treatment.whether the expert is qualified to testify is not dependent on whether he is a member of the same specialty or subspecialty as the defendant but,rather,whether the allegations of negligence concern matters within his knowledge and observation.emphasis added.jones,at.
based on the italicized sentence,plaintiff argues that jones retreats from any rigid,formalistic rule that a health professional expert witness must be a licensed member of the school of medicine about which the expert proposes to testify.
we can not accept this argument.jones clearly reaffirms this court decision in purtill describing two foundational requirements that the expert witness must be a licensed member of the school of medicine about which the expert proposes to testify and that the expert must be familiar with the methods,procedures,and treatments ordinarily observed by other providers in either the defendant community or a similar community.indeed,the very next sentences in jones following the italicized sentence upon which plaintiff relies state if the plaintiff fails to satisfy either of the foundational requirements of purtill,the trial court must disallow the expert testimony.purtill,at.the requirements are a threshold beneath which the plaintiff can not fall without failing to sustain the allegations of his complaint.jones,at.it is only after determining that both foundational requirements are satisfied that the court proceeds to evaluate whether the allegations of negligence concern matters within the expert knowledge and observation.instead of retreating from the license requirement,jones clearly reaffirms that a plaintiff must satisfy both requirements.jones,at,citing purtill,at.
plaintiff similarly points to language in gill foster,in arguing that barnhart lack of licensure in the nursing profession should have gone only to the weight of his testimony and not its admissibility.plaintiff misreads gill.in that case,the trial court barred the plaintiff expert,a licensed general surgeon,from testifying that the defendant,a licensed radiologist,deviated from the standard of care.gill,at.the plaintiff in gill argued that his expert was licensed to practice medicine in all of its branches and,therefore,the expert testimony should have been admitted,with his qualifications going to the weight of his opinion.this court agreed with the plaintiff however,only after finding that the plaintiff had satisfied the licensing requirement.gill,at.we cited to purtill for its analysis the two foundational requirements of licensure and familiarity,and the discretionary requirement of competency.gill,at.when this court ruled that the plaintiff expert could testify,it was in the context of the trial court discretion to determine whether the physician was qualified and competent to state his opinion regarding the standard of care.gill,at.this court was not discussing whether the plaintiff expert satisfied the licensing requirement.far from overruling dolan and its progeny,gill expressly upheld purtill analysis.clearly,gill and jones do not stand for the proposition that this court has disregarded,or should disregard,the licensing requirement first established in dolan.
plaintiff next contends that the appellate court failed to consider section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west,enacted in,subsequent to dolan.section provides that in any medical malpractice action,the plaintiff attorney must attach to the complaint an affidavit stating that the plaintiff has consulted with a health professional in whose opinion there is a reasonable and meritorious cause for the filing of the action.the plaintiff must file a written report,attached to the affidavit,prepared by that health professional indicating the basis for his determination.the section specifically provides 
if the affidavit is filed as to a defendant who is a physician licensed to treat human ailments without the use of drugs or medicines and without operative surgery,a dentist,a podiatrist,or a psychologist,or a naprapath,the written report must be from a health professional licensed in the same profession,with the same class of license,as the defendant.for affidavits filed as to all other defendants,the written report must be from a physician licensed to practice medicine in all its branches.ilcs a west.
plaintiff asserts that section evinces a legislative intent that physicians are competent to testify about the standard of care for the nursing profession.
we can not accept this contention.the written health professional report required by section a is a pleading requirement designed to reduce the number of frivolous medical malpractice lawsuits at an early stage before litigation expenses mount.deluna elizabeth hospital.the health professional report establishes only that the plaintiff has a meritorious claim and,therefore,reasonable grounds for pursuing the action.the requirements of section do not rise to the level of substantive elements of a claim for medical malpractice.gulley noy,d,mueller north suburban clinic,d.the report constitutes only a threshold opinion,based on a health professional overview of the case.the health professional report constitutes only an advisory opinion.mcalister schick.because the purpose of section is to eliminate frivolous lawsuits at the pleading stage,the statute has no bearing on the type of evidence relied upon at trial.lyon hasbro industries,d.further,the fact that jones and gill,which clearly uphold dolan license requirement,were decided subsequent to the enactment of section belies any tension between the statute and this court precedent.
plaintiff next cites wingo rockford memorial hospital,d,in support of her argument against the requirement that a expert witness must be licensed in the school of medicine of which the expert proposes to testify.plaintiff contends that if wingo is applied to this case,barnhart should be allowed to testify to the standard of care applicable to nurse lewis.
in wingo,three physician expert witnesses testified that a nurse deviated from the applicable nursing standard of care by failing to properly communicate the condition of a patient to the treating physician.the physicians opined that the nurse deviation from the standard of care resulted in a baby being born with brain damage.wingo,d at.
the court in wingo distinguished that case from this court precedent and held that the license requirement of dolan did not apply 
we find that the facts of the instant case do not fit within the license requirement of dolan or jones.those cases indicate that the reason for the rule is to prevent a higher standard of care being imposed upon the defendant and to ensure that the testifying expert has expertise in dealing with the patient medical problem and treatment and that the allegations of negligence are within the expert knowledge and observation.those concerns have not been sacrificed here.in the instant case,the allegations of negligence against nurse welden did not concern a nursing procedure but,rather,related to what a nurse is required to communicate to a physician about what transpired since the physician last saw the patient.as such the allegations of negligence do not concern an area of medicine about which there would be a different standard between physician and another school of medicine.furthermore,it was established that the allegations of negligence were well within the testifying doctors knowledge and experience.we believe that a physician should be entitled to testify about what he or she is entitled to rely upon in the area of communication from a nurse in the context of an obstetrical team rendering care to a patient in a hospital.wingo,d at.
accordingly,the court held that no error occurred in allowing the physicians to testify as to the applicable nursing standard of care in that case.wingo,d at.
the appellate court in this case correctly reasoned that wingo does not apply.in this case,the trial court struck barnhart testimony regarding nurse lewis communication with as a sanction for violating rule g.thus,the precise factual scenario of wingo is not present.barnhart remaining opinion testimony related to nursing procedures.d at.in distinguishing wingo from this case,the appellate court did not discuss the merits of wingo,and neither do we.the present case falls squarely within the license requirement of dolan and its progeny.
accordingly,what remains for us is to apply dolan license requirement for expert witnesses to the remainder of barnhart testimony.as noted,barnhart testified that nurse lewis failed to adhere to proper nursing procedures.he opined that nurse lewis should have pursued her concerns that burns was a fall risk by going up the nursing chain of command that she should have provided for an alternative to the posey vest and that she should have provided for constant supervision.
we agree with the trial and appellate courts that,based on dolan,barnhart was not competent to testify regarding the standard of care for the nursing profession and nurse lewis deviations therefrom.dolan specifically included the nursing profession in discussing its rationale for the license requirement.this court acknowledged that the legislature established nursing as a unique school of medicine.dolan,at.further,the dissent in dolan lends support to the conclusion that dolan licensing requirement includes the nursing profession.the dissent stated under this holding a physician would be unable to testify to nursing standards of care even though nurses operated under the physician supervision or to testify to standards for midwives,and this because the physician was not licensed as a nurse or a midwife.dolan,at,ward,dissenting,joined by goldenhersh.clearly,this exact issue was contemplated by this court in dolan,which unequivocally required that a expert witness must be a licensed member of the school of medicine about which the expert testifies.
we note that amicus illinois trial lawyers association expressly agrees with the dolan dissent and contends that the license requirement should not be a threshold test.the trial lawyers association posits there is nothing which a nurse can do which a doctor can not do.to be sure,this supposition is generally accepted.amicus the american association of nurse attorneys taana concedes that in many jurisdictions physicians have been allowed to testify as to the nursing standard of care.see,paris kreitz,noting that physicians are clearly acceptable experts with regard to nurses goff doctors general hospital,d,reasoning that surely,a qualified doctor would know what was standard procedure for nurses to follow.
however,the proposition that t here is nothing which a nurse can do which a doctor can not do presumes a universal standard of treatment among physicians and nurses.dolan expressly rejected this assumption.dolan,at,rejecting the assumption that science and medicine have achieved a universal standard of treatment of disease or injury.taana persuasively reasons 
a physician,who is not a nurse,is no more qualified to offer expert,opinion testimony as to the standard of care for nurses than a nurse would be to offer an opinion as to the physician standard of care.certainly,nurses are not permitted to offer expert testimony against a physician based on their observances of physicians or their familiarity with the procedures involved.an operating room nurse,who stands shoulder to shoulder with surgeons every day,would not be permitted to testify as to the standard of care of a surgeon.an endoscopy nurse would not be permitted to testify as to the standard of care of a gastroenterologist performing a colonoscopy.a labor and delivery nurse would not be permitted to offer expert,opinion testimony as to the standard of care for an obstetrician or even a midwife.nor would a nurse be permitted to testify that,in her experience,when she calls a physician,usually responds in a certain manner.such testimony would be,essentially,expert testimony as to the standard of medical care.
scholars share this reasoning 
physicians often have no knowledge of nursing practice except for observations made in patient care settings.the physician rarely,if ever,teaches in a nursing program nor is a physician responsible for content in nursing texts.in many situations,a physician would not be familiar with the standard of care or with nursing policies and procedures which govern the standard of care.therefore,a physician opinions would not be admissible in jurisdictions which hold the expert must be familiar with the standard of care in order to testify as an expert.an example of a common
