appellant lorine harris appeals from the judgment on the pleadings in her legal malpractice lawsuit against respondent milton grimes.after review,we reverse and remand.
procedural and factual background 
in march,gardena police officer david mathieson shot and killed appellant lorine harris unarmed son during the nighttime execution of a search warrant.appellant alleges mathieson accidentally fired his gun when a grenade used by the police as they forced their way into the home startled mathieson in january,appellant filed wrongful death complaints against mathieson in both federal and state court each complaint alleged causes of action for negligence under state law and for civil rights violations under federal law.mathieson demurred to the state court lawsuit on the ground it was duplicative of the federal lawsuit in response,appellant dismissed her state court complaint without prejudice.
appellant federal civil rights claim eventually went to trial,shorn by the court edict of the negligence claim.the court explained that it feared trying both claims would confuse the jury because they involved contradictory standards of conduct for imposing liability intentional conduct for the civil rights claim,but only negligence for the state law claim.
the federal jury rendered a defense verdict for mathieson.on june,the federal court entered judgment for him on the civil rights cause of action.at the same time,it dismissed the negligence claim without prejudice to appellant refiling it in state court.citing equitable tolling principles,the court explained the dismissal was without prejudice despite the almost delay between the death of appellant son and a refiled complaint because the statute of limitations was tolled while appellant suit was pending in federal court.see addison state of california cal d,addison statute of limitations tolled for state claim while plaintiff in good faith pursued federal claim involving same events against same defendant.the court noted that appellant had days from dismissal of her negligence claim to refile it in state court.see d statute of limitations tolled until days after dismissal.two weeks later,on july,appellant refiled her state court complaint against mathieson for negligence.
the state court set and continued the trial of appellant negligence complaint several times.in september,appellant,andrew smyth,tentatively stipulated to binding arbitration of the claim.based on the tentative stipulation,the court vacated the trial date and set a hearing in november for an order to show cause for dismissal.the court directed the parties to be prepared at the hearing to tell the court whether they agreed to arbitration.several weeks before the hearing,appellant rejected the proposal to arbitrate,fired smyth,and hired respondent milton grimes to take her negligence complaint to trial.
when appellant discharged smyth,smyth did not tell her or respondent about the pending order to show cause.consequently,no one informed the court that appellant refused to arbitrate her claim.the court therefore appears to have assumed the parties had agreed to arbitration and dismissed appellant complaint.
in july,respondent learned about the dismissal.he nevertheless appears not to have moved to set it aside,perhaps because more than six months had passed.see code civ,subd.b permits vacating dismissal only within six months of its entry.the following february,respondent told appellant about the dismissal.in september,she filed a malpractice complaint against him.she alleged he had mishandled her negligence complaint,particularly in not appearing at the hearing on the order to show cause and in failing to move to set aside the dismissal.
trial of the malpractice action was set for february.on that day,respondent moved for judgment on the pleadings,arguing appellant could not state a cause of action for malpractice because his alleged mishandling of the underlying negligence lawsuit against mathieson did not damage her because her negligence lawsuit was untenable.mattco forge,arthur young th,d mattco forge legal malpractice plaintiff must prove damages by showing through a case within a case that underlying lawsuit was viable.respondent argument rested on the purported untimeliness of the complaint against mathieson.according to respondent,the suit against mathieson was because more than six months had passed since the city of gardena rejection in of appellant administrative claim against him under the government tort claims act,subd.a complaint alleging a tort by government must be filed within six months of government rejection of administrative claim.while conceding the negligence claim temporary pendency in federal court tolled the statute of limitations,respondent asserted the tolling ended when the federal court april pretrial conference order omitted the negligence claim from issues to be litigated at trial.because appellant waited more than a year after the pretrial conference order to file her state court complaint in july,respondent concluded it was.
respondent also submitted that day a motion in limine for application of res judicata and collateral estoppel.he asserted the jury had concluded in the federal civil rights trial that mathieson was not negligent in shooting appellant son.thus,respondent argued,the court should not permit appellant to relitigate mathieson liability.
the court did not expressly rule on respondent motion for judgment on the pleadings,although it voiced skepticism that appellant complaint against mathieson was timely.the court agreed,however,that res judicata and collateral estoppel barred appellant complaint against respondent.in reaching its decision,the court relied on the opening statement by appellant counsel in the federal trial and the federal court jury instructions on unreasonable force in violation of someone civil rights.in the opening statement,appellant counsel told the jury he expected mathieson to deny accidentally shooting appellant son and to claim instead that he intentionally pulled the trigger in while aiming at an armed man standing near appellant son,but hit her son instead.based on its review of the jury instructions and opening statement,the court concluded the federal trial had established mathieson shooting was reasonable.accordingly,appellant could not pursue mathieson for negligence.the court therefore entered judgment for respondent.this appeal followed.

discussion 
the court found the federal jury determined mathieson shooting of appellant son was reasonable.according to the court,res judicata and collateral estoppel bound appellant to that determination.the court thus concluded appellant was not entitled to relitigate in her state court lawsuit against mathieson the issue of his negligence,making her lawsuit against him untenable.mattson city of costa mesa d.mattson collateral estoppel and res judicata prevent party from relitigating issues that were or could have been tried in previous litigation.accordingly,appellant could not state a claim against respondent for malpractice in mishandling her lawsuit against mathieson because such a claim presupposed she could prove mathieson was negligent.mattco forge,supra,th at,d plaintiff claiming legal malpractice must prove.the court therefore entered judgment on the pleadings and dismissed appellant malpractice complaint.code civ,subd.c b ii when a complaint on its face fails to state a cause of action,judgment on the plea
