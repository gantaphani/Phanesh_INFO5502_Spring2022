the trial court bifurcated the issue of salisbury actual innocence and tried it without a jury it found salisbury had not met his burden of proof and entered judgment against him.on appeal,salisbury contends he was entitled to a jury determination of his actual innocence because the decision rests on the credibility of witnesses.we agree and reverse.
salisbury was charged with assault with a deadly weapon,plus enhancements for inflicting great bodily injury and the commission of a hate crime.the charges arose out of the august beating of mark david following a rock concert in orange.at trial,salisbury was represented by an orange county deputy public defender.a jury found him guilty of assault with a deadly weapon and the hate crime enhancement it found him not guilty of the infliction of great bodily injury.after his conviction,salisbury retained private counsel,who brought a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence and the ineffective assistance of counsel.the motion was granted and a new trial ordered.the jury in the second trial found salisbury not guilty of any of the charges.
subsequently,salisbury filed this action against the orange county public defender office for legal malpractice.he alleged he was not guilty of the charged offenses,and but for the negligence of the public defenders,he would not have been convicted.at the commencement of trial,the court determined that the question of salisbury factual innocence,a prerequisite to a claim of malpractice based on a criminal case,was a question of fact for the trial court,not the jury.notwithstanding,a jury was impaneled,and both it and the court heard evidence from numerous witnesses.
