the question presented in this appeal is whether a parent may recover for loss of the society and companionship of a child who is nonfatally injured.under illinois law,such a claim may be brought in a action.bullard barnes.however,in dralle ruder,we declined to extend the filial society cause of action to those situations where the child is nonfatally injured.for the reasons set forth below,we adhere to our decision in dralle and refrain from enlarging the scope of liability to encompass claims where the child is nonfatally injured.
background 
plaintiffs mel vitro and sabrina short vitro,acting individually and as parents and guardians of their minor daughter,dorothy,filed a medical malpractice action in the circuit court of du page county against defendants alice mihelcic,and naperville associates in obstetrics and gynecology,naperville associates.the complaint alleged that mihelcic,while in the course and scope of her employment with naperville associates,negligently managed sabrina labor and the delivery of dorothy,thereby causing dorothy severe brain damage.the complaint further alleged that,as a result of her neurological injuries,dorothy will suffer cognitive deficits and physical disabilities for the rest of her life.count i of the complaint sought damages for dorothy injuries,and the second count,which was brought pursuant to the rights of married persons act ilcs west,sought compensation for medical and caretaking expenses incurred by the parents.in count iii,the only count at issue in this appeal,plaintiffs alleged a loss of filial consortium with their daughter as a result of her injuries,and sought damages for this disruption of the family relationship.
defendants moved to dismiss count iii pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure ilcs west on the ground that illinois does not recognize such a claim.defendants pointed to dralle and argued that,under this decision,parents may not claim loss of consortium damages for nonfatal injuries to a child.in response to the motion to dismiss,plaintiffs acknowledged that dralle bars parental loss of consortium claims where the child injuries are nonfatal.however,plaintiffs argued that the dralle decision was poorly reasoned and should be reconsidered.
the circuit court granted defendants motion to dismiss count iii and found,pursuant to supreme court rule a a,that there was no just cause to delay enforcement or appeal of the dismissal.on appeal,plaintiffs urged the appellate court to criticize the rule pronounced in dralle because the analysis is flawed and inconsistent with existing illinois law.the appellate court declined the request,noting that pursuant to controlling authority,plaintiff parents may not bring a claim against defendants for loss of consortium for the nonfatal injuries to their child dorothy.in a summary order,the appellate court affirmed the circuit court dismissal of count iii of the complaint.unpublished order under supreme court rule.we allowed plaintiffs petition for leave to appeal.
a motion to dismiss pursuant to section of the code ilcs west attacks the legal sufficiency of a complaint by alleging defects on the face of the complaint.american national bank trust city of chicago,weatherman bank.in ruling on a section motion,a court must accept as true all facts in the complaint and all reasonable inferences therefrom.american national bank,at,weatherman,at.the critical inquiry is whether the allegations of the complaint,when construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,are sufficient to establish a cause of action upon which relief may be granted.jarvis south oak dodge,weatherman,at.we review an order granting a section motion to dismiss de novo.wakulich mraz,stroger regional transportation authority.
in the case at bar,as noted,count iii of plaintiffs complaint seeks damages for loss of filial consortium resulting from their daughter nonfatal injuries.the same claim was rejected in dralle.accordingly,both the circuit and the appellate courts held that count iii of plaintiffs complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.
plaintiffs argue,however,that dralle was incorrectly decided,and they urge us to overrule that decision.plaintiffs contention that dralle should be overruled implicates stare decisis.the doctrine of stare decisis expresses the policy of the courts to stand by precedents and not to disturb settled points.neff george,overruled on other grounds by tuthill rendelman.this doctrine is the means by which courts ensure that the law will not merely change erratically,but will develop in a principled and intelligible fashion.chicago bar ass illinois state board of elections.stare decisis enables both the people and the bar of this state to rely upon this court decisions with assurance that they will not be lightly overruled.moehle chrysler motors.
to be sure,stare decisis is not an inexorable command.chicago bar ass n,at,payne tennessee,d,souter,concurring.however,we have consistently held that any departure from stare decisis must be specially justified chicago bar ass n,at,and that prior decisions should not be overruled absent good cause moehle,at,heimgaertner benjamin electric manufacturing,or compelling reasons moehle,at,people robinson.this court also has recognized that it will not depart from precedent merely because the court is of the opinion that it might decide otherwise were the question a new one.robinson,at,quoting maki frelk.in sum,when a rule of law has once been settled,contravening no statute or constitutional principle,such rule ought to be followed unless it can be shown that serious detriment is thereby likely to arise prejudicial to public interests.maki,at,see also heidenreich bremner.
in dralle,as in the case at bar,the question was whether the parents of a child born with maladies that included brain damage could recover for loss of their child society and companionship.according to the complaint in dralle,the child injuries were caused,in part,by the mother use during pregnancy of the prescription drug bendectin.the complaint also alleged negligence on the part of the obstetricians.in count iv of the dralle complaint,the parents sought compensation from the drug manufacturer for loss of filial society resulting from their child injuries.the trial court dismissed count iv for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
the appellate court reversed the dismissal order,concluding that illinois recognized a parent claim for loss of companionship and society resulting from nonfatal injuries to a child.dralle,at.the defendant drug manufacturer appealed,and this court reversed,holding that a parent may not recover for loss of society and companionship of a nonfatally injured child.dralle,at.
in bullard barnes,decided prior to dralle,this court held that,in a action,parents are entitled to a presumption of pecuniary injury in the loss of a deceased child society and companionship bullard,at.in dralle,the parents argued that it would be a logical extension of bullard to allow recovery for loss of filial society arising from a child nonfatal injuries.the court in dralle rejected this argument,explaining that there is an important distinction between the two types of claims.where a child is nonfatally injured,the court noted,the child retains his or her own cause of action against the tortfeasor.thus,there is no danger that the injury caused by the tortfeasor will go uncompensated,or that similar conduct in the future will be undeterred.dralle,at.by contrast,an action under the wrongful death act affords the sole remedy for the surviving family members.dralle,at.in dralle view,it therefore makes sense to allow recovery for loss of filial society in actions under the wrongful death act,but not where the victim survives and retains his or her own cause of action the court also pointed to a second relevant distinction between bullard and the case.in bullard,the decision to allow claims for loss of filial society was based on an statutory foundation the wrongful death statute.where the loss of society results from nonfatal injuries to the child,there is no such statutory foundation.
the court in dralle also rejected the argument that our decision in dini naiditch,supported the recognition of a filial society claim where injuries are nonfatal.dini held that,just as a husband may claim loss of spousal consortium arising from nonfatal injuries to his wife,so also a wife may make the same claim where her husband is nonfatally injured.consortium,in this context,includes,in addition to material services,elements of companionship,felicity and sexual intercourse,all welded into a conceptualistic unity.dini,at.in dralle it was argued that,since this court had already recognized claims for loss of spousal consortium arising from nonfatal injuries,it was but a small step to recognize claims for loss of filial society where the child injuries were nonfatal.the court in dralle rejected this argument,explaining that t he companionship and society for which recovery is sought in a filial society claim is not identical with the spousal claim recognized in dini.dralle,at.dralle asserted that spousal consortium includes elements that are absent from the relationship.dralle,at.for this reason,the court decline d to find in the action for spousal consortium a basis for recognizing recovery of loss of filial society.dralle,at.
the court in dralle noted several policy considerations that argue against recognition of the new filial society claim,including the appropriate scope of tort liability and the difficulty in assessing damages.dralle,at.according to dralle,t o recognize claims for loss of society resulting from nonfatal injuries to a child would threaten a considerable enlargement of liability.citations.grandparents,siblings,and friends suffering similar losses of society and companionship would also seek to bring claims,if recovery were to go unchecked.dralle,at.the dralle court was also concerned with the difficulty in assessing damages.noting the intangible nature of the loss,dralle asserted that a trier of fact would find it difficult to distinguish between the child claim,involving pain and suffering,and the legally distinct but factually similar claim by the parents for loss of the child society and companionship.dralle,at.this difficulty,the court concluded,would invite duplicate recoveries.
in a special concurrence justice clark criticized the majority reasoning.while the majority concluded that bullard and dini did not support the recognition of a cause of action for loss of filial society resulting from nonfatal injuries,justice clark came to a different conclusion.in justice clark view,these and other decisions of this court,together with cases on point from other jurisdictions citations,strongly suggest that we should allow recovery to a parent who,through nonfatal injury,suffers the loss of his child society.dralle,at,clark,specially concurring.justice clark found unpersuasive the policy considerations that the majority cited as arguments against recognizing the new cause of action.
in the case at bar,plaintiffs cite to justice clark special concurrence in arguing that,contrary to the majority view in dralle,previous decisions such as bullard and dini support the recognition of a parental claim for loss of filial society resulting from nonfatal injuries.according to plaintiffs,recognition of this new filial society claim would be a logical extension of our previous holdings.any failure to allow such claims,plaintiffs argue,would be inconsistent with this court previous decisions.
plaintiffs also take issue with dralle policy considerations,asserting that they are largely illusory.in answer to dralle concerns about enlarging liability,plaintiffs point to justice clark assertion in his special concurrence that recognition of the new filial society claim will not open the floodgates of litigation.dralle,at,clark,specially concurring.as justice clark explained 
loss of society is an injury to familial relationships which has never been applied to relations among friends,or even to noncustodial relatives.moreover,in the vast majority of cases,the child injuries will neither be so serious nor so permanent as to support a claim for loss of society.dralle,at,clark,specially concurring.
with regard to the alleged difficulty in assessing damages,plaintiffs assert,as did justice clark,that the same difficulty arises in claims for loss of spousal consortium,which are recognized in illinois.plaintiffs note that illinois juries assess damages in spousal consortium claims arising from nonfatal injuries see dini,at,and they argue that there is no reason why a jury could not do the same in parental claims for loss of filial consortium caused by nonfatal injuries.
we agree with plaintiffs that some of what is asserted in dralle in support of the majority holding does not withstand scrutiny.for example,we do not believe that allowing parents to recover for loss of filial society where injuries are nonfatal would necessarily invite duplicate recoveries.it is true,as dralle notes,that in such situations the child retains his own cause of action against the tortfeasor.however,the child cause of action for his injuries and the parents cause of action for loss of society and companionship seek compensation for different harms.the same is true in a spousal consortium context where the injuries are nonfatal.moreover,any possibility of double recovery could be minimized by carefully instructing the jury to distinguish between the injuries of the parent and the injuries of the child.see dralle,at,clark,specially concurring.
we also question dralle reliance on the alleged difficulty faced by a jury in assessing damages.dralle points to the intangible nature of the loss however,intangible losses are encountered in any consortium claim.if illinois juries are capable of assessing damages in claims for loss of spousal consortium where the injuries are nonfatal,we see no reason why they would face insurmountable difficulties in assessing damages in a similar claim for loss of filial consortium.
finally,regarding dralle concern that liability would be enlarged because grandparents,siblings,and friends would also seek to recover for similar losses of the child society,we note that this concern could easily be addressed.if we were to recognize a cause of action for loss of filial society resulting from nonfatal injuries,we could simply base it on the uniqueness of the relationship and limit the holding accordingly.
even though portions of dralle rationale are flawed,we nevertheless agree with an important basis for its holding.in dralle,one of the arguments offered by the parents in support of the new filial society claim was that,because this court had already recognized such a claim in the context bullard barnes,it would be a logical extension to allow it where the child injuries were nonfatal.in rejecting this argument,dralle explained,inter alia,that the decision in bullard to allow claims for loss of filial society in a action was predicated on bullard interpretation of illinois wrongful death act.under this act,damages were allowed for pecuniary injuries,ch,par,and bullard construed this term to include loss of filial society.thus,the statutory foundation was already in place emphasis added dralle,at,for recognition of a claim for loss of filial society in a action.no such statutory foundation existed for allowing a filial society cause of action where the injuries were nonfatal.the court thus evinced a preference for a statutory rather than a nonstatutory,or judicially created,basis for the new claim.implicit in the court reasoning is the conclusion that it is the legislature which should decide whether this new cause of action should be created.we agree with this conclusion.
this court recently expressed a similar view in wakulich mraz.in wakulich,which declined to recognize social host liability for the provision of alcohol to minors,we explained that the legislature was the more appropriate body to address such liability.
the general assembly,by its very nature,has a superior ability to gather and synthesize data pertinent to the issue.it is free to solicit information and advice from the many public and private organizations that may be impacted.moreover,it is the only entity with the power to weigh and properly balance the many competing societal,economic,and policy considerations involved.
this court,on the other hand,is to fashion a law on this subject that would best serve the people of illinois.we can consider only one case at a time and are constrained by the facts before us.wakulich,at,quoting charles seigfried.
with regard to the issue of filial consortium,courts in other jurisdictions have left this determination to the legislature.in colorado,where claims for loss of filial consortium are authorized under the state statute,the supreme court declined to extend the filial consortium claim beyond the context,choosing instead to defer to the legislative branch.elgin bartlett.according to the court in elgin,it is the legislature that is best suited to reach decisions about the intangibles of consortium loss and the appropriate standards and limitations that should be applicable thereto.elgin,at.the same conclusion was reached by the supreme court of missouri,where filial consortium claims also are recognized under the state statute.powell american motors.the court in powell concluded that if missouri is to recognize a cause of action for loss of consortium by the children or the parents of an injured party,the decision to do so should be made by the legislature and not by this court.emphasis added.powell,at.see also boucher dixie medical center,utah declining to extend claims for loss of society and affection beyond the context deferring instead to the legislature as the appropriate body to determine if such claims should be recognized contra,shockley prier.
the elgin,powell,and boucher courts teach that the choice of whether to recognize a new filial society claim is a policy decision that is better left to the legislature.such a decision inevitably involves navigating between the competing interests of compensating all those who have been harmed by a and setting rational and workable limits to liability.boucher,at.with regard to these limits,it is generally acknowledged that while it might be desirable to compensate all those who are harmed by another wrong,the law must recognize the realities of this world and set reasonable boundaries upon liability.cockrum baumgartner,citing tobin grossman.such often is more appropriately left to the legislative branch.elgin,at powell,at.
as noted,dralle based its holding in part on the view that it is the legislature that is better suited to decide whether to recognize a cause of action for loss of a nonfatally injured child society.we believe that,notwithstanding the flaws in other portions of dralle rationale,this legislative deference is in itself a valid basis for reaffirming dralle.see united states powell,d.
we note that plaintiffs direct our attention to no decisions by this court or our appellate court that have criticized or called into doubt the holding in dralle.indeed,it appears that the opposite is true.see doe mckay,decided years after dralle,in which this court relied on dralle reasoning in rejecting a claim for loss of filial society where the interference with the family relationship was direct,rather than indirect.doe reliance on dralle negates any claim that dralle has become unworkable.see payne,at.at,d at.on the contrary,it would appear that the rule in dralle is now firmly settled.see maki,at.
in the case at bar,the dissent points to our decision in seef sutkus,which recognized a parental claim for loss of society of a stillborn child.the dissent asks how can we justify sanctioning a damage claim in the death of a stillborn child citation,whom the parents will never even know,while barring a damage claim in the nonfatal injury of a newborn child,whom the parents will come to know,live with,and suffer with for her or his entire life at.at,at fitzgerald,dissenting,joined by kilbride and rarick,jj.the answer is that,unlike the case at bar,seef involved the wrongful death act,ch,par.et.in seef,we noted that the act considers an unborn fetus to be a child,and damages therefore may be recovered for loss of the society of a nearly child who dies at birth.as was the case in bullard,the decision in seef rests on a statutory foundation.dralle,at.thus,it is the legislature,not this court,that sanctioned a claim where the infant is stillborn,but did not provide a cause of action in the case of a nonfatally injured newborn.
in sum,plaintiffs in the case at bar have failed to demonstrate good cause heimgaertner,at,or compelling reasons robinson,at,for departing from stare decisis.plaintiffs direct our attention to no decisions by this court or our appellate court that have criticized or called into doubt the holding in dralle.nor has it been shown that upholding dralle would bring about serious detriment prejudicial to public interests.maki,at,heidenreich,at.
moreover,we determined that there is a valid basis for the decision in dralle that is independent of any defects in other portions of dralle reasoning.see powell,at.at,d at.this valid basis,as we have indicated,is dralle implicit deference to the legislature as the more appropriate body to decide whether the new filial society claim should be recognized.in view of this sound rationale,as well as plaintiffs failure to meet the burden required to depart from stare decisis,we decline to overrule dralle.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we adhere to our decision in dralle and decline to enlarge the scope of liability to encompass claims for loss of filial society resulting from nonfatal injuries to a child.we affirm the judgment of the appellate court below,which affirmed the circuit court dismissal of count iii of plaintiffs complaint.
stare decisis,certainly,is an indispensable part of our judicial process.prall burckhartt.it promotes evenhanded,predictable,and consistent legal development,fosters reliance on judicial decisions,and contributes to the integrity of the courts.see wakulich mraz,quoting payne tennessee,d.but as the united states supreme court has recently reminded us,and the majority today notes,stare decisis is not an inexorable command.lawrence texas,d,overruling bowers hardwick,d at.at,at.
the obligation to follow precedent begins with necessity,and a contrary necessity marks its outer limit.indeed,the very concept of the rule of law requires such continuity over time that a respect for precedent is,by definition,indispensable.citation.at the other extreme,a different necessity would make itself felt if a prior judicial ruling should come to be seen so clearly as error that its enforcement was for that very reason doomed.planned parenthood of southeastern pennsylvania casey,d.
that is,stare decisis is not so static a concept that it binds our hands to do justice when we have made a mistake.see neff george,people mitchell,our most important duty as justices of the illinois supreme court,to which all other considerations are subordinate,is to reach the correct decision under the law.we have repeatedly stated that a prior case may be overruled only if there are compelling reasons or good cause to do so.see people robinson,heimgaertner benjamin electric manufacturing.here,there are not only compelling reasons,but also the best cause to abandon dralle ruder,it was incorrectly decided.
though i echo the arguments advanced in justice clark forceful and eloquent special concurrence in dralle,i believe that the resolution of this case can be distilled into a single,simple question is there an injury that is,did mel and sabrina vitro suffer an injury of their own when their daughter dorothy became brain damaged as a result mihelcic alleged negligent management of sabrina labor and delivery 
we have recently reiterated that parents interest in the companionship,care,custody,and control of their children is perhaps the oldest liberty interest protected by the federal and state constitutions.see wickham byrne,citing troxel granville,d lulay lulay,the history and culture of western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children,quoting wisconsin yoder,d.today,parents go to great financial lengths to pro
