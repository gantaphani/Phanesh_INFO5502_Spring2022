background 
smith,a former coal miner,has a history of medical problems with his right knee.he has undergone more than a dozen surgeries on that knee.in,robert burdge replaced smith right knee joint with a prosthesis.burdge warned smith about the possibility of having his leg amputated if his knee got worse and expressed concern about the effect of smith heavy work as a coal miner.in,smith received a total knee replacement by another physician and began receiving social security disability benefits.when he received this prosthesis,physicians informed him of substantial bone loss in his knee,precluding any future knee replacements.in,burdge performed a bone graft procedure to stabilize the prosthesis.
on january,burdge performed a second bone graft procedure at louis university hospital because smith tibial plateau had collapsed.a few days after the surgery,smith began to develop severe,adverse symptoms around the surgical site.on january,he went to a scheduled visit with burdge.because of smith symptoms,burdge admitted smith to louis university hospital and prescribed an antibiotic treatment in case smith had an infection.smith condition worsened and burdge removed the bone grafts because he suspected that smith was experiencing a bone graft rejection.the symptoms of infection are the same or similar to the symptoms of a bone graft rejection.after numerous related hospital stays over the ensuing months and with all other options seeming futile,smith consented to have his right leg amputated above the knee.that procedure was performed on september.
in,smith brought this medical malpractice action based on diversity jurisdiction against burdge,tenet healthsystem sl,doing business as louis university hospital tenet,and burdge employer,louis university slu collectively,the defendants smith alleged that the defendants negligent treatment caused the amputation of his right leg.count one alleged that tenet and slu placed smith in an unclean hospital room following his january,procedure and failed to follow internal policies and federal regulations regarding infection control the policies.count two alleged that the defendants were liable for burdge negligent failure to properly diagnose,treat and monitor smith knee the defendants denied all liability,denied that smith developed an infection in his right knee,and suggested that the cumulative trauma from smith history of knee problems was the sole cause of his amputation.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of tenet and slu on the portion of count one concerning the allegation of an unclean hospital room and judgment as a matter of law in favor of tenet and slu on the remainder of count one.a jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants on count two,and the district court denied smith motion for a new trial and taxed smith for a portion of the defendants costs.smith raises eight issues on appeal and renews his request for a new trial.
ii.discussion 
smith argues that the district court abused its discretion in disallowing certain of his questions during voir dire because this limitation prevented an inquiry into potential juror biases regarding tort reform,medical malpractice and plaintiffs with preexisting medical conditions.because smith contemporaneously failed to object to the way in which voir dire was conducted and did not request permission to rephrase his questions,we review this issue for plain error to determine if the limitation was so prejudicial as to cause a miscarriage of justice.ratliff schiber truck,cir.
given the questions asked of the potential jurors by the district court and smith attorney,we find no error.district courts have broad discretion to determine the scope of voir dire.id.at.voir dire is proper provided that there is an adequate inquiry to determine any juror bias or prejudice.see nanninga three rivers,cir.in this case,the district court questioned the prospective jurors about experiences involving medical malpractice.the court also gave each party twenty minutes to supplement the court examination.see.a explaining that when the court examines prospective jurors,the court shall permit the parties or their attorneys to supplement the examination by such further inquiry as it deems proper emphasis added.
prior to voir dire,the parties submitted proposed questions in writing.the district court disallowed certain of smith questions because they called for lengthy responses from individual jurors however,during smith supplementary examination,smith counsel was permitted to ask questions to individual potential jurors.the district court even allowed potential jurors to respond to two questions that smith counsel asked about tort reform and medical malpractice despite the district court instruction before voir dire that smith counsel was not to ask those questions.voir dire provided an adequate inquiry to determine any juror bias or prejudice.
admission of medical,psychiatric and social security records 
the district court admitted into evidence some of smith medical,psychiatric and social security records over smith objections that these records were irrelevant and unduly prejudicial.smith reiterates these arguments on appeal and argues that,despite a request from smith,the district court failed to weigh the probative value of these records against their prejudicial effect.see.the federal rules of evidence govern the admissibility of evidence in a medical malpractice action based upon diversity jurisdiction.see sosna binnington,cir.we review a district court rulings on the admissibility of evidence for a clear and prejudicial abuse of discretion.id.at.
we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in determining that these records were relevant.evidence is relevant if it merely has any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.the trial judge has broad discretion in determining the relevance of a given item of evidence.united states wilson,cir.the defendants theory of the case was that smith amputation was caused by the cumulative trauma of his decades of knee problems.these records substantiate smith history of knee problems.the portions of the records pertained to other issues at trial,such as the extent of smith damages.
we also can not say that the district court abused its discretion in determining that any prejudicial effect of these records did not substantially outweigh their probative value.see.united states derring,cir we do not reweigh the value of the material against its potential for harm to the defendant,but determine only whether the district judge abused his discretion in admitting it.generally,the balance of rule weighing should be struck in favor of admission.block macy,cir.we find nothing in the record to indicate that the district court abused its discretion in following this general rule.
smith argues that the district court abused its discretion because,despite smith motions and objections,the court did not actually weigh the evidence pursuant to rule.we presume that the district court weighed this evidence pursuant to rule because the district court ruled on motions and objections in which smith specifically requested that the court weigh the probative value of the records against their prejudicial effect.the district court mere failure to make a record of its rule weighing is not reversible error.see united states price,cir holding that a trial judge failure to expressly state reasons in the balancing of probative value and u
