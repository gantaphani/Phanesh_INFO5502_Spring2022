facts and allegations 
oasis west owned property in beverly hills which it wished to redevelop with a new hotel,luxury condominiums,and other improvements.there was a hilton hotel on the property,and the project is often referred to as the hilton project.the project required the approval of the beverly hills city council.
on january,oasis retained reed smith to represent it in connection with the project.goldman was to have overall responsibility for the matter.in its complaint,oasis alleged that it hired reed smith to render advice,strategic planning and assistance in the formulation of the project and to interface with the city officials from whom oasis sought support for the project.the complaint also alleged that oasis sought goldman assistance because he was an expert in civic matters and because he was a,influential leader who was extremely active in beverly hills politics.he was president of the southwest homeowners association and had appeared before the city council many times to address other developments in the city.oasis alleged that it understood that goldman statements and opinions on city development matters bore significant influence on city council members and the local citizenry,particularly members of the southwest homeowners association.
reed smith represented oasis in connection with the hilton project for a little over a year,until april of.during that period,oasis paid reed smith about in fees.
oasis complaint alleged that during the representation,goldman was intimately involved in the formulation of the plan for oasis sic development of the property,its overall strategy to secure all necessary approvals and entitlements from the city and its efforts to obtain public support for the project.goldman was a key oasis representative in dealing with beverly hills city officials,including the planning commission and city council.throughout the representation,oasis revealed confidences to goldman,which it reasonably believed would remain forever inviolate.
oasis development proposal was put before the city council in june.for the next two years,the council and the city planning commission reviewed the project and held hearings on such things as the size of the buildings,parking,traffic,and so on.in april,the council certified the eir and introduced an ordinance approving a development agreement between the city and oasis.
many beverly hills citizens opposed the project.on april,a political action committee called citizens right to decide committee was formed,with the goal of putting a referendum on the ballot which would leave approval of the project up to the voters.
it was at this point that goldman took the acts of which oasis later complained.oasis complaint characterized goldman actions thusly after reed smith terminated the representation,goldman switched sides,and engaged in acts of treachery and disloyalty,intended to cause the city council to deny permission for the project.the complaint alleged that goldman lent his support to a citizen group opposed to the project and campaigned for and solicited signatures for a petition circulated by said citizen group that sought to abrogate the city council approval of the project and instead place approval of the project in the hands of the citizenry by proposition 
goldman declaration in support of the special motion to strike is more specific.he declared that he took no part in any of the public hearings and discussions concerning the project for two years after reed smith relationship with oasis was terminated.after that,he did two things.
on may,he addressed the city council,opposing a rule which required individuals seeking signatures on the referendum petition to carry with them the entire eir and other documents,totaling about pounds.goldman statement was that the requirement was unnecessary and unfair whether you for the hilton or for the referendum.
on may,he and his wife spent about minutes soliciting signatures on the referendum petition from their neighbors.at or houses,they left a dear neighbor note which they both signed,expressing concern about the size of the project and the traffic impact,indicating that they would sign the referendum petition,and urging the neighbor to do the same.
goldman declared that he at no time disclosed confidential information to anyone,and did not believe that he disclosed that he had ever worked for oasis in connection with the hilton project.
by letter of may,oasis demanded that goldman and reed smith withdraw from all activities that may in any manner be construed as adverse to the project and that they retract their opposition.goldman and reed smith agreed that neither would take any additional acts in opposition to the project.oasis letter in response insisted that both goldman and his retract their support for the referendum,and remain silent on the issue.
with the special motion to strike,appellants also submitted a declaration from larry larson,who headed the citizen committee.he detailed the committee acts in opposition to the project,declaring in each instance that goldman took no part in the effort.he further declared that the modest number of signatures goldman and his wife collected made no difference to the success of the petition,that goldman never disclosed any confidential oasis information,and indeed that goldman never disclosed that he had represented oasis,so that larson learned of the representation only from news reports concerning this lawsuit.
the citizen committee was successful in placing the measure on the ballot,as measure h.the measure passed by a narrow margin in november of,allowing the project to go forward.
oasis filed its complaint in january.it sought million in damages,alleging that but for the conduct of goldman and reed smith,oasis would not have had to spend in excess of million to oppose the petition and then to actively campaign for the approval of measure 
with its response to the special motion to strike,oasis submitted declarations authenticating the reed smith engagement letter and payment from oasis to reed smith of in fees.the president of oasis declared that goldman had attended many team meetings,at which there was discussion and development of confidential planning and strategy with respect to the project.
oasis also submitted a group of february emails authenticated by a cc recipient which include two emails from goldman to the city council stating his opposition to a different project larson email to goldman soliciting the southwest homeowner association opposition to the hilton project goldman response to larson recounting the association activities in general,and,relevant to the hilton project,stating that though the eir and traffic reports for both the hilton and state that the net traffic will not increase,i do believe it and i am sure neither do you.my suggestion was going to be that neither project be approved until something definitive and meaningful is done with the monica intersection and larson reply,against soliciting the southwest homeowner association support on the referendum petition.
discussion 
under section,a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states constitution or the california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.
an act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech is statutorily defined as any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd e.the statute definitional focus is not on the form of the plaintiff cause of action but rather the defendant activity giving rise to his or her asserted liability and whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.tuchscher development enterprises,san diego unified port dist.th.
when a special motion to strike is filed,the initial burden rests with the defendant to demonstrate that the challenged cause of action arises from protected activity.brill media,llc tcw group,th.in deciding whether the initial arising from requirement is met,a court considers the pleadings,and supporting and opposing affidavits stating the facts upon which the liability or defense is based,subd.b.navellier sletten cal th.
there is no doubt that on the evidence presented here,goldman activities were protected activity.the typical slapp suit involves citizens opposed to a particular real estate development.the group opposed to the project,usually a local neighborhood,protests by distributing flyers,writing letters to local newspapers,and speaking at planning commission or city council meetings.dixon superior court th,fn.omitted.
however,as oasis argues,a substantial line of cases holds that section does not apply to litigation which is actually about an attorney breach of the duty of loyalty.benasra mitchell,silberberg knupp llp th freeman schack th fire ins.sheppard,mullin,richter hampton th prediwave simpson thacher bartlett llp th,but see peregrine funding,sheppard mullin richter hampton llp th.
in each of these cases,a former client sued a lawyer,alleging that the lawyer undertook concurrent or subsequent representation of an adverse party under circumstances which made that second representation a violation of rules of professional conduct rule c,on concurrent representations,or rule e,on subsequent representations.in each case,the holding is that the case arose from the lawyer act in accepting the second representation,rather than the litigation activities the attorney undertook on behalf of the second client.
oasis characterizes this case as one involving a subsequent representation,and a violation of rule e.rule is titled avoiding the representation of adverse interests.rule e provides that a member shall not,without the informed written consent of the client or former client,accept employment adverse to the client or former client where,by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.we agree with appellants that there was no violation of this rule.
first,there was no second representation.oasis arguments to the contrary strain the facts.for instance,oasis points out that in his comments to the city council,goldman said that it would be unfair to require an year old to carry pounds of material from home to home.from this,oasis asks us to conclude that goldman was representing senior citizens.oasis points out that the emails it submitted were to the extent that they were from goldman from goldman reed smith account.from this,oasis concludes that goldman was acting as a lawyer and was representing opponents of the project generally and the southwest homeowners association.finally,oasis cites its evidence that in march,a number of beverly hills citizens took out an ad in the local newspaper to support our neighbor and friend ken goldman,who had recently been sued by oasis.the many signers wrote that we are not legal experts,but the lawsuit appears to many people to be a blatant attempt to intimidate a devoted community leader from exercising his constitutional right to free speech.
the facts simply do not support the conclusions oasis would have us draw.
as oasis argues,an attorney can violate rule e even if the second employment does not create an relationship.american airlines,sheppard,mullin,richter hampton th.we do not see,however,that an attorney can violate the rule if there is no second relationship or second employment of any kind.
in american airlines,supra,a lawyer accepted employment as a federal rule of civil procedure b witness with an entity,ado,which was adverse to an existing client,american airlines.american,which had objected to the employment,sued.it alleged,among other things,a breach of rule c,which provides that a member shall not accept representation of more than one client in a matter in which the interests of the client actually or potentially conflict,without the informed written consent of each client.the lawyer defended on the theory that employment as a rule b witness did not create an relationship,and that rule c only applied to such relationships.the court rejected the argument,holding that the rule does not require representation of both clients as an attorney.id.at,emphasis in the original.the court found that as a witness,the lawyer was an agent and fiduciary of ado and was required to act in ado best interest.he also owed fiduciary duties to american,and under the facts,the duties collided,creating a violation of rule c.id.at brand century ins.th attorney may not testify as an expert witness against an insurer,where he had previously represented the insurer in substantially related matters.
american airlines,supra,also considered rule e,rejecting the lawyer argument concerning the clause which provides that the subsequent representation is forbidden if by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.this is what most of the litigation on this rule concerns.the court said,it is anathema to the state bar rules of professional conduct to suggest that an attorney can place himself in a situation in which he undertakes adverse representation of a third party,and the client can not object because the attorney has promised not to disclose the client confidential information even though the information may be decidedly helpful to the new client.it is precisely this compromised situation,when the burden of deciding which client to favor is placed solely on the attorney shoulders and within the attorney sole power to decide,that rule is designed to avoid.american airlines,supra,th at.
but goldman never undertook a second employment,or developed any other relationship which could create conflicting fiduciary duties.he was not placed in the position of choosing between clients,because there was no second client.the purpose of rule e is t o protect the confidentiality of the relationship where an attorney successively represents clients w
