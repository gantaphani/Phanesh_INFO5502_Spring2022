introduction 
appellant,a california public benefit corporation concerned with protecting the interests of health care consumers throughout california,sued on behalf of the general public to enjoin the practice of respondent kaiser foundation health plan kaiser of transmitting to its attorneys allegedly irrelevant medical information concerning kaiser patients who were either making or contemplating making medical malpractice claims against kaiser.appellant alleged that kaiser practices violate california unfair competition law,business and professions code sections et the ucl.
the superior court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend after finding that the challenged practices were not unlawful and were,in fact,authorized by the confidentiality of medical information act,civil code sections et the confidentiality act.we agree with that court analysis and,additionally,find that appellant claims are barred by amendments to the ucl enacted in november by proposition.we thus affirm the judgment of dismissal.
ii.factual and procedural background 
appellant initiated this action on march,and,on july,filed a first amended complaint fac purporting to allege two causes of action under the ucl,the first for engaging in an unlawful,unfair and fraudulent business practice and the second for untrue and misleading advertising.
to support these claims,appellant alleged that,at least since january,kaiser has engaged in the following practices disclosing medical information regarding patients without first obtaining such patient authorization or otherwise being authorized to do so under the law sharing,selling or otherwise using medical information regarding such patients for a purpose not necessary to provide health care services to the patients and concealing these practices from patients.appellant further alleged that whenever a patient makes a claim against kaiser,kaiser uses and discloses all of the patient medical information including medical information which is irrelevant to the patient claim.
according to the fac,kaiser alleged practices are unlawful under the ucl because they violate the confidentiality act as well as the affected patients state constitutional right to privacy.appellant further alleged the challenged conduct is unfair because the harm to patients outweighs the utility of kaiser acts and practices,is fraudulent because kaiser has made representations that it uses and discloses patient medical information only in accordance with the law,and renders untrue and misleading kaiser advertising regarding its alleged protection of confidential patient information.
kaiser demurred to appellant fac.a hearing on the demurrer was held before the honorable steven brick on october.on october,the court filed an order sustaining kaiser demurrer without leave to amend.the trial court found that the conduct alleged in the fac was not unlawful under the ucl because it did not violate the confidentiality act or the california constitution.the court further found that,in the absence of any alleged unlawful conduct,the fac failed to state a ucl cause of action based on unfair or fraudulent conduct or a cause of action for false advertising.
a judgment of dismissal was entered on november.appellant filed its notice of appeal on december.
iii.discussion 
standard of review and issues presented 
we review a trial court ruling on a demurrer independently.citation.liska v.the arns law firm th,d.our task in reviewing a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend is to determine whether the complaint states,or can be amended to state,a cause of action.for that purpose we accept as true the properly pleaded material factual allegations of the complaint,together with facts that may properly be judicially noticed.citations.crowley katleman cal th,d.
appellant contends that it has successfully alleged facts to support a cause of action for violating the ucl.the ucl does not proscribe specific practices but,instead,defines unfair competition to include any unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair,deceptive,untrue or misleading advertising and any act prohibited by chapter commencing with section of part of division of the business and professions code.bus.
although appellant characterizes kaiser practices regarding its disclosure of patient information as unfair,fraudulent and at odds with its advertising,appellant case rests on the proposition that kaiser conduct is unlawful within the meaning of the ucl.indeed,in this court appellant concedes that all of its theories regarding kaiser disclosure policy are tethered to and dependent upon proving that the challenged business practice is unlawful.the unlawful prong of the ucl borrows violations of other laws and treats them as unlawful practices that the unfair competition law makes independently actionable.citations.communications,los angeles cellular telephone cal th,d.here,appellant contends that the business practices it described in its fac violate both the confidentiality act and our state constitution.as noted in our factual summary,the trial court rejected these contentions.for reasons we will explain,we agree with the trial court.
on appeal,kaiser also contends that appellant claims are barred by proposition,which was approved by california voters on november,and became effective the following day.see cal,art.ii,subd.a.proposition amended certain provisions of the ucl and the false advertising law and thereby limited the right of private litigants to prosecute ucl actions.we agree with kaiser that proposition bars the present action and establishes a second,alternative basis for affirming the judgment.
b.the alleged conduct is not unlawful 
appellant complains that confidential patient information is disclosed by kaiser but the fac does not identify to whom the allegedly improper disclosure is made.to clarify the factual issue presented to us,we construe the fac as challenging kaiser practice of disclosing to its attorneys all information it has pertaining to a patient who has filed or expressed an intent to file a claim against kaiser.this construction is consistent with the fac allegations summarized above and has also been adopted by the trial court and the parties themselves.
appellant first contention is that kaiser disclosure practice violates section,subdivision a,a provision of the confidentiality act,subd.a section a,which states no provider of health care,health care service plan,or contractor shall disclose medical information regarding a patient of the provider of health care or an enrollee or subscriber of a health care service plan without first obtaining an authorization,except as provided in subdivision b or c.
one of the express exceptions to section a which is set forth in section,subdivision c authorizes the disclosure of medical information regarding a patient to persons insuring,responsible for,or defending professional liability that a provider may incur when those persons are engaged in reviewing the competence or qualifications of health care professionals or in reviewing health care services with respect to medical necessity,level of care,quality of care,or justification of charges,subd.c section c.therefore,as the trial court found,the practices alleged in the fac are authorized by section c and do not violate the confidentiality act.
appellant contends that kaiser disclosure practice is not authorized by section c because kaiser discloses to its attorneys all medical information about a patient who has filed a claim against kaiser,including information that is not relevant to the patient claim.according to appellant,implicit in section c is that its terms are intended to exclude irrelevant medical information.
we find nothing in the language of this particular provision to support appellant interpretation of it.furthermore,several circumstances indicate to us that the legislature specifically elected not to graft a relevancy limitation onto the section c exception.
for example,in contrast to section c,some of the statutory exceptions to section a do expressly impose specific limitations on the disclosure of medical information.as this court observed in pettus cole th,d pettus,i t is important to note that even the permissive disclosure exceptions do not always allow full disclosure of all medical information.the exceptions recognize that in some circumstances a legitimate need for access to medical information may conflict with an individual interest in keeping that information confidential,and attempt to strike a balance.thus,under some of the exceptions described in civil code section,subdivision c through the legislature established parameters within which disclosure is permissible and allowed disclosure of only that information which is necessary to achieve the legitimate purpose addressed by the particular exception.id.at,d.
a good example of an exception that expressly limits the disclosure of medical information is section,subdivision c,of the confidentiality act,which states that a health care provider or service plan that has created medical information about a patient at the request and expense of the patient employer or as the result of an health care service may disclose to the patient employer only that part of the information that a is relevant in a lawsuit,arbitration,grievance,or other claim or challenge to which the employer and the employee are parties and in which the patient has placed in issue his or her medial history,mental or physical condition,or treatment,provided that information may only be used or disclosed in connection with that proceeding or b describes functional limitations of the patient that may entitle the patient to leave from work for medical reasons or limit the patient fitness to perform his or her present employment,provided that no statement of medical cause is included in the information disclosed,subd.c section c.
the fact that some statutory exceptions to section a,like section c,expressly establish parameters within which disclosure is permissible strongly suggests that the absence of such parameters from the language of section c was intentional.
another circumstance supportive of this conclusion relates to the timing of the enactment of section c.although originally enacted in,the confidentiality act was repealed and reenacted in substantially the same form in.see heller norcal mutual ins.cal th,d,heller.almost a year before the confidentiality act was reenacted,the legislature enacted section of the code of civil procedure,the statutory process by which a consumer may challenge a third party subpoena of his or her personal records,the definition of which specifically includes records held by a physician,dentist,ophthalmologist,optometrist,chiropractor,physical therapist pharmacist,pharmacy,hospital,medical center,clinic,radiology or mri center code civ,subd.a.the purpose of this statute is to protect a consumer right to privacy citation in his personal records maintained,or kept,by his attorney,accountant,doctor,banker,sasson katash d,emphasis supplied see also lantz superior court th,d.
in our view,the fact that the legislature elected to reenact section c without adding any language indicative of a legislative effort to erect additional protections for consumer privacy,protections over and above those provided by code of civil procedure section,again suggests rather strongly that the absence of an express relevancy limitation in section c was intentional.
our conclusion that a relevancy limitation was intentionally omitted from section c is reinforced by the rather obvious problems with implementing such a requirement.such a restriction would,in essence,raise an intolerable barrier between a health care organization like kaiser and its attorneys.it has long been recognized,at both the federal and state level,that an attorney preparing for litigation must have access to a wide panoply of material and facts.proper preparation of a client case demands that he assemble information,sift what he considers to be the relevant from the irrelevant facts,prepare his legal theories and plan his strategy without undue and needless interference.hickman taylor,emphasis supplied see also,citing and quoting this language,psc geothermal services superior court th,d ranch superior court th,d.in order for an attorney to prepare a meaningful defense to a malpractice claim,he must have unfettered access to his own client knowledge regarding its relationship to the patient pursuing that claim.put another way,the legislative determination to omit a relevancy limitation from section c is an acknowledgement that all patient information in kaiser possession is sufficiently potentially relevant to a malpractice claim to merit disclosure to kaiser own attorneys.
appellant argues that,totally apart from the terms of section c,the disclosure of irrelevant medical information violates the california constitution provisions protecting the right of privacy therefore,it contends,if section c is interpreted to permit such disclosure,it is unconstitutional in so doing.as the superior court recognized,our supreme court holding in heller,supra,cal th,d,undermines any constitutional challenge based on the right of privacy.
in heller,the plaintiff developed serious medical problems after doctors geis and yamaguchi removed a bone spur from her left hand.she brought a malpractice claim against geis and,during the litigation phase of that lawsuit,yamaguchi disclosed her private patient information to the insurer who represented both doctors.after the malpractice claim against geis was resolved,plaintiff brought a second malpractice action against yamaguchi and also alleged violations of section a and the constitutional right to privacy based on the disclosures that yamaguchi had made during the first malpractice case.the heller court held that both the confidentiality act and constitutional claims were properly dismissed pursuant to a demurrer.the court found that yamaguchi disclosures were expressly authorized by section c and,consistent with our analysis above,also found that,s hould the legislature deem it necessary to further limit access to a plaintiff medical condition,it is free to do so by amendment.heller,supra,cal th at,d.
the heller court also found that the plaintiff constitutional privacy claim failed as a matter of law because she failed to allege facts to support a conclusion that any expectation of privacy as to her medical condition would be reasonable under the circumstances of the case.heller,supra,cal th at,d.the court reasoned that by placing one physical condition in issue via medical malpractice litigation,a person has his or her expectation of privacy regarding that condition substantially lowered by the very nature of the action.id.at,d.this principle clearly applies to kaiser patients who have either filed or signaled a possible intent to file medical malpractice claims as a consequence,appellant constitutional argument fails.
appellant contends that heller does not undermine its constitutional argument because heller involved disclosure only of relevant,information concerning the medical condition in issue in that case.in this sense,appellant maintains,heller simply reaffirms the general rule that,even when a patient places his or her medical condition in issue he or she continues to have a reasonable expectation of privacy as to medical information which is not directly relevant to that particular condition.citing jeffrey imai,tadlock keeney th,d pettus cole,supra,th at,d.
as a factual matter,appellant reading of heller is not supported by the language in that opinion.yamaguchi disclosed the heller plaintiff condition and prognosis as well as her medical records.heller,supra,cal th at,d.furthermore,the heller court never stated or intimated that the constitutionality of a section c disclosure hinged in any way on satisfaction of an unwritten relevancy test.
nor are we persuaded that appellant case authority is factually relevant as it addresses the very different issue of disclosure of medical information to third parties.in the factual scenario at issue here a the plaintiff puts at issue not only a medical condition but a relationship between the patient and a health care provider,and b the target of t
