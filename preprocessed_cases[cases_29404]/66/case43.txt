diana and humberto ramírez appeal from the denial of a motion for mistrial and claim that the district court erred by admitting hearsay evidence during the testimony of an expert witness for the,natalio,in a medical malpractice trial in the district of puerto rico.after careful review,we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion or in admitting the testimony in question 
background 
appellants filed a medical malpractice suit in the district of puerto rico,sitting in diversity,against debs,alleging that he negligently performed surgery to investigate fluid leakage that occurred after stitches were removed following diana ramírez breast augmentation and surgery.debs performed no diagnostic testing to confirm his suspicion that the leakage came from a ruptured implant prior to performing the second surgery.appellants claimed that,as a result of the second surgery,the scarring ramírez had sought to have corrected was actually made worse,and one of her breasts was deformed.
during a trial in february,the appellants presented an expert witness,josé,to establish that the treatment debs provided fell below the relevant standard of care,a required element for a claim of medical negligence under puerto rico law.see oliveros abreu,wl.off l translations.to rebut this evidence,the defense called its own expert,robert walton,whose testimony is the subject of this appeal.
during walton direct examination,over repeated objections from the appellants,the defense referred walton to testimony that the second procedure had caused additional scarring,and asked,what do you have to say about that walton responded,my spanish is not very good,but there is a term for this,it called disparate.disparate is a spanish term that translates as nonsense or absurdity,new revised velázquez spanish and english dictionary,although appellants contend that it carries a more negative or disparaging connotation than its english equivalents suggest.the jury burst into laughter at the use of the term,prompting appellants counsel to move for a mistrial on the ground that walton had improperly characterized the testimony of,thus resulting in prejudice to the jury.the district court agreed that walton had stepped outside the bounds of his role as witness,and accordingly struck the response from the record,instructed the jury to totally disregard the response,and admonished walton to adhere strictly to his professional opinion 
after the direct examination resumed,walton was asked what the medical literature indicates about scarring caused by a second surgery.following an objection that the question called for a response that would necessarily be comprised of hearsay,the defense asked walton whether he was familiar with the literature on the subject.over a renewed hearsay objection,walton responded by referring to a earl peacock,who,walton testified,had published research on the topic of scarring.he then continued,a long time ago,when surgeons started doing repairs in the fingers,at which point the appellants counsel objected that the answer was nonresponsive,and then made another hearsay objection and a request to strike the references to peacock.the court questioned the witness directly,establishing that he was testifying not from peacock work,but from his own collective knowledge,including other sources,independent research,and experience with the subject of scarring.walton was then permitted to continue his answer,in which he explained that the only clinical evidence or other research that indicated increased scarring when a second surgery is performed soon after a first was specific to surgery performed on the hand.
on february,the jury returned a verdict for the defendant,indicating on a special verdict form that it did not find that debs violated the standard of care by performing the second surgery.appellants now argue that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial as a result of walton characterization of the appellants expert testimony as disparate,and in permitting walton to present hearsay testimony in the form of an oral summary of peacock published research.since we find no abuse of discretion,we affirm the judgment below.
ii.analysis 
motion for mistrial 
debs does not challenge the district court ruling that walton description of conclusions was an inadmissible characterization of the latter testimony.thus,we have only to consider whether,assuming the evidentiary error,the district court abused its discretion when it opted to strike the testimony and issue a curative instruction instead of declaring a mistrial.see united states,cir a ruling denying a motion for mistrial is reviewed for manifest abuse of discretion.our caselaw on this point is clear 
when a motion to declare a mistrial has its genesis in a claim that improper evidence came before the jury,the court must first weigh the claim of impropriety and,if that claim is well founded,strike the offending evidence.next,unless the court believes that the evidence is seriously prejudicial and that a curative instruction will be an insufficient antidote,the court should proceed with the trial after instructing the jury to disregard the evidence.declaring a mistrial is a last resort,only to be implemented if the taint is ineradicable,that is,only if the trial judge believes that the jury exposure to the evidence is likely to prove beyond realistic hope of repair.

put simply,appellants have not come close to rebutting our presumption that the district court curative instruction to immediately after walton gave the challenged testimony and reinforced during the final jury sufficient to remedy any prejudice caused by walton use of the term disparate.appellants argue that they were prejudiced by the undercutting of testimony,which was the only evidence submitted to show the requisite standard of care,yet they have made no satisfactory showing that it was probable that the jury would have been unable to put aside walton comment when instructed to do so.on this point,appellants can offer only the observations that the jurors laughed when walton referred to conclusions as disparate,and that the statement constituted an assessment of credibility.with regard to the former,the jury outburst preceded the curative instructions,and appears to have been nothing more than a spontaneous response to the use of an unexpected colloquialism in the courtroom.the district court observed this behavior from a much better vantage point than ours,and evidently did not interpret it to be an indication that the jury had been irredeemably biased.we see no reason to question this evaluation.
we also reject appellants argument that the nature of the erroneous statement that,they argue,impugned their expert a mistrial.even if we accept appellants claim that the challenged testimony impugned their expert credibility,we still would not think that they were entitled to a mistrial.contrary to the appellants reading of our decision in united states shay,we there held that expert testimony directed at credibility need not always be excluded as a matter of law,ci
