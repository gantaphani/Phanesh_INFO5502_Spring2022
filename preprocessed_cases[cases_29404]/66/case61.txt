audit reports and financial statements are staples of the accounting profession.accuracy is a paramount concern,for much can turn on a relatively minor bevue.but mistakes occur,and courts have grappled with the extent of an accountant liability to third parties,for such errors.this appeal requires us to enter the fray.
the case at hand involves ostensible misstatements attributed to the carelessness of the defendants an accounting firm and one of its principals.the court below,ruling on a motion for summary judgment,concluded that even if the financial statement prepared by the defendants for their client corporation contained negligent misrepresentations,the defendants were not liable to the plaintiff a third party for those misrepresentations.although our appraisal of the governing law differs in one salient respect from that of the lower court,we reach the same conclusion.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
a brief recitation of the facts suffices to put the pivotal legal issue into perspective.following the conventional summary judgment praxis,we recount the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant here,the plaintiff.houlton citizens coalition town of houlton,cir.
in the,jeffrey canty formed canty roofing and sheetmetal,crs.as the name implies,crs principal business was the installation and repair of roofs.for much of crs existence,the firm of dias lapalme d l rendered accounting services to it.the partner in charge was david lapalme.for the most part,the work was mundane,involving,inter alia,the preparation of annual financial statements and tax returns.
over the years,crs installed and repaired roofs on a variety of public and private buildings.contractors working on public construction projects in massachusetts are required by statute to post payment and performance bonds on a basis.see.laws ch.crs routinely bid on public works jobs and,thus,from time to time required bonds.
in,martin donovan,an insurance broker,introduced crs to north american specialty insurance nasi.at donovan instance,nasi inspected crs financial records and canty personal finances.apparently satisfied with the results of its review,nasi entered into a bonding relationship with crs.once this relationship commenced,nasi told canty that crs would be required to provide updated financial statements,prepared by an independent certified public accountant,for each succeeding calendar year.
in late,canty agreed to sell crs to a group composed of three businessmen,namely,robert cote,paul flynn,and david beasley.the transfer of ownership,structured as a sale of stock,occurred on december.shortly thereafter,d l prepared an independent,financial statement for crs with respect to calendar year.this statement,issued by d l on march,lacked specific information about the change in ownership.to make matters worse,the notes to the financial statement contained three arguably misleading comments that implied canty continuing participation as crs sole shareholder or so nasi now contends.we summarize these comments in the margin 
crs thereafter obtained new contracts for work on public buildings.to facilitate these engagements,nasi wrote bonds relying,it claims,on the financial statement totaling on june,and bonds totaling on august.but crs foundered under the stewardship of its new owners and eventually defaulted on these bonds.this calamity forced nasi,qua surety,to step into the breach.doing so cost it nearly.
invoking diversity jurisdiction,a,nasi sued d l and lapalme in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts.it charged the accountants with negligent misrepresentation and deceptive trade practices.nasi grounded its complaint on the assertion that,but for the accountants omission of accurate ownership information in the financial statement,it would not have continued furnishing bonds for crs and,therefore,would have avoided the ensuing losses.after allowing an extended period for pretrial discovery,the district court granted summary judgment in the defendants favor.
this timely appeal ensued.in it,nasi challenges the district court interpretation and application of the legal regime governing an accountant liability to third persons and maintains that,under a proper formulation of the law,the existence of genuine issues of material fact would preclude the entry of summary judgment.
ii.some threshold principles 
we preface our discussion of the central issue with a reminder as to certain threshold principles that inform our analysis.summary judgment is appropriate only when the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in reviewing an order granting summary judgment,we construe the record and all reasonable inferences from it in favor of the summary judgment loser.grant,llc comm r of me.dep t of,food rural,cir houlton citizens coalition,at.our review is plenary,so that we may,if the occasion arises,reject the rationale employed by the lower court and still uphold its order for summary judgment.perez volvo car,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.

iii.negligent misrepresentation 
against this backdrop,we turn to the law pertaining to accountants liability to third parties for negligent misrepresentation and,in particular,the watershed opinion of the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc in nycal kpmg peat marwick llp.we next examine the decision below and discuss an area of disagreement.we then offer our views on the meaning,under massachusetts law,of the phrase substantially similar transactions as that phrase relates to an accountant liability to third parties for negligent misrepresentations.finally,we apply the discerned law to the gleaned facts to complete our canvass.
a.the watershed case.
nycal kpmg peat marwick llp is the sjc most comprehensive effort to plot the borders of an accountant liability to third parties for negligent misrepresentations.in that case,the of that they had relied to their determent on financial statements prepared for the acquired company by the defendant a accounting firm.nycal,at.after studying the available options the sjc adopted the restatement rule about the scope of an accountant liability to a third party for negligent misrepresentations.id.at citing with approval restatement second of torts.the sjc description of the rule follows 
section describes the tort of negligent misrepresentation committed in the process of supplying information for the guidance of others as follows one who,in the course of his business,profession or employment,or in any other transaction in which he has a pecuniary interest,supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions,is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information,if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.
that liability is limited to loss suffered a by the person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance he intends to supply the information or knows that the recipient intends to supply it and b through reliance upon it in a transaction that he intends the information to influence or knows that the recipient so intends or in a substantially similar transaction.
id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the sjc recognized that section was not,and that courts had been erratic in interpreting and applying it.id.at.this lack of uniformity seemed most readily apparent in respect to the level of or on the part of the putative defendant.the sjc opted to demand actual knowledge.id.in so doing,it interpreted section as limiting the potential liability of an accountant to noncontractual third parties who can demonstrate actual knowledge on the part of accountants of the of potential third parties that will rely upon the accountant work product,as well as actual knowledge of the particular financial transaction that such information is designed to influence.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the accountant actual knowledge,the court added,should be ascertained at the time the audit report or financial statement is issued.id.at.
despite this emphasis on actual knowledge,the sjc added a caveat.it cautioned that accountants could not avoid liability by burying their heads in the sand the restatement standard will not excuse an accountant willful ignorance.id.at.
b.the decision below.
the district court appropriately acknowledged nycal as the starting point for its analysis.the fulcrum of the court unpublished opinion is its determination that the sjc had not fully embraced the restatement rule,but,rather,had rejected the language of section b which extends an accountant liability beyond particular transactions that the accountant knowingly intended to influence to substantially similar transactions.in reaching this conclusion,the veteran district judge relied on the fact that the nycal court,at one point in its opinion,referred to actual knowledge of the particular financial transaction,at,without including the restatement reference to substantially similar transactions.having embraced this narrow reading of nycal,the judge envisioned that the case at hand hinged on whether the defendants knew of the particular financial transaction that the financial statement was designed to influence.discerning no evidence that d l actually knew,in march of,of a particular bonding transaction scheduled to occur later that year,judge tauro entered judgment for the defendants.
in effect,then,the district court held that substantially similar transactions,by definition,could not reach the level of particularity that nycal required.nasi vigorously attacks this holding,and we think that it may read too much into what might well be an economy of words.after all,the sjc mentioned the substantially similar transactions variant in its initial recital of the rule,nycal,at,and we can think of three reasons why the court omission of this reference in its reprise may well lack decretory significance.first,the language and structure of nycal point toward outright acceptance of the restatement rule,uncurtailed.see,id.at remarking that the restatement rule comports most closely with the standard of liability traditionally imposed by the massachusetts courts in other professional contexts.second,nycal itself did not involve a dispute about whether transactions were or were not substantially similar and,thus,the sjc had no incentive to discuss that aspect of the restatement rule in any detail.third,the nycal court language requiring actual knowledge of a particular financial transaction,id.at,just as easily can be read to incorporate substantially similar transactions as to exclude them 
in the end,we need not probe this point too deeply.the extent to which massachusetts accepts the restatement rule is a matter of state law,and the sjc some day will resolve all doubt.for now,we assume arguendo,favorably to nasi,that massachusetts follows the rule of section of the restatement,without reservation.that rule limits an accountant liability for negligent misrepresentation to those third parties who the accountant actually knows will receive the information,and then,only for transactions that are the same as,or substantially similar to,the ones which the accountant actually knows will be influenced by the supplied information.in other words,an accountant remains potentially liable in situations in which he actually knows that a recipient of his information will rely on that information in the course of a specific transaction,even though the transaction itself does not transpire,as long as it is supplanted by a substantially similar transaction.
defining substantially similar transactions.
although substantially similar transactions can serve as a basis for an accountant liability to a third party under the restatement rule,the dimensions of that doctrine remain in doubt our interest,of course,is in how the massachusetts courts would define the neither the sjc nor the massachusetts appeals court has addressed this issue.
the restatement does not attempt to define the phrase substantially similar transactions.nevertheless,the commentary offers some insight into what is meant by the term.thus,when a corporation seeking a bank loan asks an accountant to audit the books and prepare a report for the prospective lender,liability for negligence will attach even though the corporation delays for a month in obtaining the loan.see restatement second of torts cmt.j.the transaction,though later in time,remains substantially similar because its essential character the amount and terms of the not changed.id.so too if the amount of the anticipated loan varies slightly,the ensuing transaction nonetheless will remain substantially similar slight variances do not affect a transaction essential character.id.if,however,after the accountant report is delivered the corporation seeks and receives a much larger loan,the transactions will no longer be substantially similar and the accountant will not be liable to the bank for a careless misstatement.id.
in the last analysis,t he question is one of the extent of the departure that the maker of the representation understands is to be expected.id.minor deviations are to be anticipated in complex business transactions,and such deviations ordinarily do not allow the misinformer to escape liability to a known third party.if the departure is major,however,a different result obtains the transaction actually consummated can not then be regarded as essentially the same as the transaction originally contemplated and,therefore,can not be regarded as substantially similar.
quite plainly,this definition is and requires development.we think that,under it,an accountant liability for substantially similar transactions must be determined in two steps.first,the rule implicitly recognizes that the risk perceived by the accountant at the time of the engagement cabins the extent of the duty that he owes to known third parties.rusch factors,levin,advocating this proposition prior to promulgation of the final version of the restatement rule ryan kanne,iowa same citing draft version of the restatement.thus,an inquiring court initially must consider,from the preparer standpoint,what risks he reasonably perceived he was undertaking when he delivered the challenged report or financial statement.
second,the court must undertake an objective comparison between the transaction of which the accountant had actual knowledge and the transaction that in fact occurred.this comparison can not be hypertechnical,but,rather,must be conducted in light of t he ordinary practices and attitudes of the business world.restatement second of torts cmt.j.the goal of this inquiry is to determine whether the two transactions share essentially the same character.if so,the actual transaction is substantially similar to the contemplated transaction and,therefore.elsewise,the third party has no recourse against the accountant for negligent misrepresentation.
d.the merits.
with these guideposts in place,we turn to the case at hand.to recapitulate,the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants because it found insufficient evidence to show that they had actual knowledge of the critical transactions,the issuance of several bonds on which crs eventually defaulted.in so holding,however,the court employed a same transaction standard,to the exclusion of substantially similar transactions.we now employ the more inclusive standard assuming,albeit without deciding,that the sjc would adopt it in an appropriate case.
the restatement rule has six elements.a finding of liability requires inaccurate information,negligently supplied,in the course of an accountant professional endeavors,to a third person or limited group of third persons whom the accountant actually intends or knows will receive the information,for a transaction that the accountant actually intends to influence or for a substantially similar transaction,with the result that the third party justifiably relies on such misinformation to his detriment.see nycal,at.the third party has the burden of proving each of these elements.consequently,he must create a trialworthy issue on all six in order to avoid the entry of summary judgment.see mcintosh antonino,cir discussing the burden of production that devolves upon a nonmovant who bears the ultimate burden of persuasion on an issue underlying a summary judgment motion.creating such an issue necessitates the production of specific facts,in suitable evidentiary form.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
assuming,for argument sake,that the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to nasi,suffices to limn genuine issues of material fact on five of the six elements the question reduces to whether nasi issuance,in,of the particular bonds upon which crs defaulted constituted transactions that d l actually sought to influence,or,alternatively,substantially similar transactions.nasi would have us answer this question affirmatively for three reasons.we examine these reasons separately.
first,nasi argues that the bonds which it issued in were part of a regular bonding program and that d l prepared the financial statement with this program in mind.to buttress this argument,nasi describes its relationship with crs as common in the industry,explaining that sureties typically prequalify contractors for underwriting purposes,establishing maximum limits on both individual and aggregate bonds.such bonding programs,nasi tells us,usually stay in place for a year at a time.
while this trade usage might be neglected to offer any evidence of trade usage proper focus is on the accountant actual knowledge and intent to influence.see nycal,at spencer doyle.regardless of how nasi perceived the situation,the critical issue is what the defendants actually knew,when they released the financial statement,about nasi intent to use the statement in deciding whether to maintain a bonding program which involved writing new bonds for crs in.see nycal,at.the evidence here,even when viewed in a light favorable to nasi,does not support a conclusion that the defendants intended to undertake the risk of a full year worth of bonds.
to establish the defendants actual knowledge and intent to influence,nasi relies most heavily on cote deposition.cote testified in substance that once he and his partners had acquired the stock of crs,he met with lapalme to discuss the preparation of the financial statement.at that time,he informed lapalme that crs new owners planned to use the financial statement to meet the corporation obligations for ongoing bonds which he described as projects that were currently being worked on by crs for which bonds had been issued.cote specifically disclaimed having told lapalme that the financial statement would be used to obtain future bonds,and nasi points to no other hard evidence to fill this gap.
taken at face value,cote testimony does not support a conclusion that the defendants knowingly undertook the substantial risks inherent in the issuance of future bonds.to the contrary,an objectively reasonable accountant in lapalme position doubtless would have thought,based on cote request,that he was subjecting his firm to possible liability for nasi inventory of bonds previously issued those that related to crs ongoing construction contracts,not for nasi bonding program.since no reasonable jury could have concluded otherwise,nasi failed to show facts sufficient to support its bonding program hypothesis.
if more were we doubt that it surrounding circumstances suggest how improbable it is that d l would have been willing to undertake liability for future bonds.lapalme was keenly aware that the preparation of the financial statement was likely to be d l last engagement for crs.cote testified that he and his partners had begun looking for a new accountant by the time that d l completed its work on the financial statement.this was to be expected d l had been retained to handle the crs account by the former owner,canty,and the agreement obligated the new owners to retain d l only until the firm had completed the tax returns and other financials necessary to close out calendar year.it strains credulity to believe that an experienced would undertake liability for indeterminate amounts of bonds not yet written when he had no reasonable anticipation of working for the principal in the future.
nasi next contends that the defaulted bonds represented transactions which were substantially similar to those that the defendants intended to influence.here,however,as we shortly will show,the bond transactions plainly did not share the essential character of the earlier transactions about which the defendants knew and which they intended to influence.accordingly,the two sets of transactions can not be considered substantially similar.
to be sure,determinations of this type involve matters of degree.if,for example,d l had agreed to release the financial statement in anticipation of allowing nasi to review it before issuing a bond for a specific future project,and nasi thereafter issued a bond for that project in an amount that varied by,say,d l would be liable to nasi for any loss occasioned by a negligent misrepresentation see restatement second torts cmt.similarly,if d l had agreed to provide the financial statement in anticipation of allowing nasi to review it before bonding a project that was slated to start on may,but the project did not get underway until june,d l would still be liable.id.in each instance,the key is the accounting firm actual knowledge of the surety intention to rely on the financial statement for a specific whether to issue a bond in a known amount for a known project.the firm thus could anticipate its likely exposure from attempting to influence the surety decision,and the imposition of liability for negligence should not be defeated by modest variances that the firm,given the way in which business transactions typically develop,reasonably could have anticipated.see id.
in this context,there is no scientific formula for ascertaining substantial similarity.even if the change involves a new transaction,rather than merely a modification of the earlier known transaction,the accounting firm might still be held liable if the identity of the third party is unchanged,the type of transaction pretty much the same,and the firm exposure relatively constant.imagine,for example,that d l agreed to provide the financial statement in anticipation that nasi would review it in deciding whether to write a bond referable to a specific roofing contract that crs hoped to secure.imagine,too,that the project fell through,but crs instead obtained a different,roughly comparable roofing contract,likewise requiring a bond,and nasi,relying on the financial statement,provided the bond.in that hypothetical situation,d l likely would be liable to the surety for misinformation.see id.cmt.j,illus.
there is an obvious difference between these examples and the case at hand.the examples presume that the accountants knew the general nature of the risk they were taking and the approximate dollar amount of their potential liability.in this case,however,d l accepted potential liability only for ongoing projects in various stages of nasi seeks to hold the firm liable for unknown future projects not yet begun or even bid when the financial statement was delivered.the increased degree of risk is patent.by like token,d l accepted potential liability only for bonds previousl
