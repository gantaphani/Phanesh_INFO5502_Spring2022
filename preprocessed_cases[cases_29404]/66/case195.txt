donald hoagland,as receiver for midwest transit,filed suit in an illinois state court against the sandberg law firm,which in the course of representing midwest had,hoagland charged,wronged its client.the law firm removed the suit to federal district court on the basis of diversity of citizenship.the district court entered judgment for sandberg after determining that hoagland had not proved the elements of legal malpractice,and hoagland appeals.
as happens all too often when a suit comes into the federal courts by removal,so that the original pleadings did not specify a basis for federal jurisdiction,the case came to us without adequate specification of the citizenship of the parties,even though the only possible basis for federal jurisdiction was diversity of citizenship.we therefore directed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressed to jurisdiction,and they have done so.the supplemental briefs reveal that hoagland is a citizen of illinois and it is his citizenship rather than midwest that is germane to diversity,fdic elefant,cir gross hougland,cir jump manchester life casualty management,cir navarro savings ass lee,d,because there is no suggestion that he was appointed receiver in order to create diversity jurisdiction.gross hougland,supra,at.the briefs also reveal,however,that while the sandberg firm is a professional corporation incorporated and having its principal place of business in missouri,three of the members of the firm the shareholders in the professional corporation are citizens of illinois.if the citizenship of the members is what counts for purposes of determining diversity,as would be the case if the law firm were a partnership,a limited liability company,or any other noncorporate enterprise,then the requirement of complete diversity has not been met and the suit must be dismissed for want of federal jurisdiction.
in coté wadel,cir,however,we held,as had the second circuit in saxe,bacon bolan,cir,that for purposes of the diversity jurisdiction a professional corporation should be treated like any other corporation,rendering the members citizenship irrelevant.a number of subsequent cases are in accord.schneider ex rel.estate of schneider fried,cir ocean ships,stiles,cir edell associates,law offices of peter angelos,cir duffey wheeler,cir.there are no contrary decisions.
we reaffirmed coté in saecker thorie,cir,and at about the same time,in a case involving a nonprofit corporation,made clear that coté stands for a rule that for purposes of diversity jurisdiction a corporation is a corporation is a corporation,ccc information services,american salvage pool ass n,cir quoting coté wadel,supra,at see also national ass of realtors national real estate ass n,cir wild subscription plus,cir mutual service casualty ins.country life ins,cir it does matter what kind.yet we know that business entities that are functionally similar to corporations,but are not formally corporations,such as limited partnerships and companies,are not classified as corporations for diversity purposes.carden arkoma associates,d great southern fire proof hotel jones.belleville catering champaign market place,cir tango music,llc deadquick music,cir cosgrove bartolotta,cir rolling greens mhp,comcast sch holdings,cir per curiam gmac commercial credit llc dillard department stores,cir riley merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir handelsman bedford village associates limited partnership,cir.since professional corporations differ in certain respects from business corporations,perhaps in more respects than the entities involved in the cases just cited,we were led in saecker thorie,supra,at,to wonder whether the rule of coté could be reconciled with these cases.
upon reconsideration,however,we have concluded that we ought to continue to follow coté rather than overrule it and by doing so create an intercircuit conflict and,worse,inject confusion into the determination of federal jurisdiction.a salient consideration in favor of coté is the easy applicability of a rule that treats any corporation as a corporation for diversity purposes.functional approaches to legal questions are often,perhaps generally,preferable to mechanical rules but the preference is reversed when it comes to jurisdiction.when it is uncertain whether a case is within the jurisdiction of a particular court system,not only are the cost and complexity of litigation increased by the necessity of conducting an inquiry that will dispel the uncertainty but the parties will often find themselves having to start their litigation over from the beginning,perhaps after it has gone all the way through to judgment.jurisdictional rules ought to be simple and precise so that judges and lawyers are spared having to litigate over not the merits of a legal dispute but where and when those merits shall be litigated.in re lopez,cir see also budinich becton dickinson,d jerome grubart,great lakes dredge dock,d concurring opinion kennedy wright,cir xpress,united states.the more mechanical the application of a jurisdictional rule,the better.the chief and often the only virtue of a jurisdictional rule is clarity.in re kilgus,cir citations omitted.
there is an enormous variety of types of corporation.there are business corporations,professional corporations,public benefit and charitable corporations,mutual benefit corporations,religious corporations,educational and scientific corporations,municipal and other public corporations,cooperative corporations,corporations sole see,cal,and native american tribal corporations.see william meade fletcher,fletcher cyclopedia of the law of private corporations,ch.ed,and james cox thomas lee hazen,cox hazen on corporations,ch.ed.would it be a sensible,or even a feasible,judicial undertaking to create and apply,case by case,a standard for deciding which of these should be classified as corporations for purposes of the diversity jurisdiction and which not no court has thought so.all the cases that discuss the citizenship of nonbusiness corporations hold that they are indeed corporations for diversity purposes.besides those we cited already,see moor county of alameda,d municipal corporation city of clinton moffitt,cir same rucci city of pacific,cir same caudle american arbitration ass n,cir nonprofit corporation indiana port comm bethlehem steel,cir public corporation university of rhode island chesterton,cir same gaines ski apache,cir tribal corporation stock west,confederated tribes of the colville reservation,cir same.countless other cases assume that business and nonbusiness corporations should be treated the same,tosco communities for a better environment,cir per curiam nonprofit corporation bell united states,cir same knab mary hospital,cir charitable corporation wellness wellness house,cir same fresenius medical care cardiovascular resources,puerto rico caribbean cardiovascular center,cir public corporation strotek air transport ass of america,cir incorporated trade association american institute of chemical engineers,cir educational and scientific nonprofit corporation lyxell vautrin,cir per curiam religious corporation.is all this law to be discarded 
simplicity,at least,could be preserved by a rule that only a corporation organized under a state law is a corporation for purposes of the diversity jurisdiction.but such a rule would involve the courts in rewriting the diversity statute.the statute states flatly that a corporation is a citizen of the state in which it is incorporated and also the state in which its principal place of business is located.c.the word is not qualified.in refusing in carden to treat a limited liability company as a corporation for purposes of the diversity statute,the supreme court dropped no hint that the corporations of which the statute speaks are limited to business corporations.had the court been minded to go down that it thought there was some reason to think congress had wanted to confine the corporate category to business might have been expected to consider whether noncorporate business entities that were functionally similar to business corporations should be treated the same way in order to carry out congress desire to give special treatment to businesses.far from adopting a functional approach,one that might cast a shadow over coté,carden rejects such an approach in favor of drawing a bright line between corporations and all other associations.the court said that having established special treatment for corporations,we will leave the rest to congress.carden arkoma associates,supra,at.we shall do likewise.
coté was decided in the second circuit similar decision had been rendered three years earlier.in the years since,a judicial consensus has,as we have seen,emerged that all corporations are to be treated the same way in determining citizenship for diversity purposes.against this background,our overruling coté would cause needless confusion and create an intercircuit conflict.such a step would be especially gratuitous because of the tendency already noted in saecker toward the convergence of professional with business corporations.saecker thorie,supra,at see also christopher wang,comment,breaking up is hard to do allocating fees from the unfinished business of a professional corporation,chi.the tax advantages that formerly motivated the choice of the corporate form by law firms have largely been eliminated,cox hazen,supra,and that choice is now determined,just as in the case of business firms,by the advantages of limited liability,perpetual existence,and the other traditional advantages of incorporation.see robert hillman,organizational choices of professional service firms an empirical study,business lawyer,thomas rutledge,the place if any of the professional structure in entity rationalization,business lawyer,robert hamilton,professional partnerships in the united states,debra thill,comment,the inherent powers doctrine and regulation of the practice of law will minnesota attorneys practicing in professional corporations or limited liability companies be denied the benefit of statutory liability shields,mitchell,see also fletcher,supra.
in missouri,the state in which the sandberg firm is incorporated and has its principal place of business,the statute makes the regular corporation law of missouri applicable to professional corporations.vernon annotated missouri statutes,see also,churchman kehr.at the same time,missouri authorizes the formation of limited liability companies.vernon annotated missouri statutes,nimrod chapel,the limited liability company small business applications in missouri.bar.had the sandberg firm followed that route missouri regards as legally rule of carden arkoma associates would have clicked in and removal of the litigation to the federal district court would have been precluded.on the other hand,the firm could have elected to be taxed on a is,there would have been no state income tax at the entity as a professional corporation it must,like a regular business corporation,pay corporate income tax unless it elects subchapter s status.b,a revenue ruling,cb hamilton,supra.at.
the major difference remaining between a professional corporation and a business corporation besides the facts that only licensed professionals who are employed by the professional corporation may be shareholders or directors and that shares can only be transferred to other individuals licensed to practice in the same profession,fletcher,supra,is that the former usually requires less financial capital,the principal capital of a professional corporation being its human skills and reputation and contacts of its professional employees.but of course there are many professional corporations that have more financial capital than many business corporations there are law firms today that have annual revenues of hundreds of millions of of them just passed the mark.in the case of professional as of business corporations,limited liability makes it easier to raise equity capital from individuals who do not want to place their personal assets beyond those invested in the corporation at risk.
in the case neither of a business corporation nor of a professional corporation does limited liability shield the personal assets of investors who cause the corporation to commit a tort or other unlawful act.this is an important point the neglect of which has led to an exaggerated sense,illustrated by such cases as south high development,weiner,lippe cromley,ohio,per curiam,and kenneth vinall,hoffman,see bradley jones,the professional corporation,fordham,of the practical difference between professional and business corporations.of course a lawyer can not insulate himself from a malpractice suit by incorporating.but neither can an individual who uses his position in a business corporation to commit a tort.suppose a corporate employee in furtherance of his employment bribes the purchasing officer of one of his corporation customers.the customer if harmed by the bribe can sue the he can also sue the employee who did the bribing.it is a common misunderstanding that the principle of limited liability protects the shareholders and officers of a corporation for liability for their own wrongful acts.it does not.it protects them from derivative liability,that is,from being called to account for the wrongs of the corporation.spartech opper,cir emphasis in original see also dietrich cape brewery ice,industries of illinois,ter maat,cir refrigeration sales,cir coastal abstract service,first american title ins,cir haupt miller,iowa fields jantec,or,vacco industries,van den berg,th,d.you do buy immunity from suits for your torts by being a member of a business corporation or a member of a professional corporation.
so the differences between the two types of corporation are actually rather slight,maybe slighter than the differences between business corporations and limited liability companies.but these are details.the charm of coté rule is that it avoids the need for judges to entangle themselves in functional inquiries into the differences among corporations.and it is a rule supported,maybe compelled,by carden formalistic approach.granted,had the effect of coté flat rule been to induce states to rename sole proprietorships,mah jongg clubs,or pit bulls corporations in order to make them more or would it be less suable in federal court,we would be in trouble but we are relieved to note that no such tendency is discernible.it is because states are not using the label of corporation to game the diversity statute that the courts are comfortable deferring to the label the state places on a business entity.great southern fire proof hotel jones,supra,illustrates the point.the limited partnership association involved in that case had many properties of a corporation,but because it was called that in the pennsylvania statute it was deemed not to be a corporation for purposes of the diversity jurisdiction.wild subscription plus,supra,at ripalda american operations.
the only situation in which a simple reference to state law will fail to resolve the issue of a party citizenship is where the party is foreign,for it is then necessary to determine whether the characteristics of the foreign entity are enough like those of a corporation to make corporation the correct translation into english.carden arkoma associates,supra,at.puerto rico russell.lear johnson electric holdings,cir.carden describes this as the one exception to the admirable consistency of our jurisprudence on this matter.at.cases involving entities are indeed treating the state label as determinative.
so there is federal jurisdiction of hoagland suit,and we can proceed at last to the merits of his appeal,which are slight.the district court determined after a bench trial that hoagland suit failed as a suit for legal malpractice.hoagland does disagree.a suit for legal malpractice under illinois law,which governs the substantive issues in this case simply because the parties have assumed that it does,indiana ins.pana community unit school district,cir grundstad ritt,cir wood,cir bbserco,metrix,cir,requires unless the lawyer breach of duty is obvious even to a layperson,which is not contended expert testimony regarding the standard of care or loyalty that the lawyer is alleged to have violated.barth reagan,and cases cited there besco henslee,monek henslee,d.
hoagland presented no such testimony.his grievance is that he should have been allowed either to amend his complaint to make clear that his claim,which he believes the district judge misunderstood,is not malpractice but is rather breach of contract or alternatively breach of fiduciary duty,or allowed to dismiss his suit without prejudice and start over.to bolster his contention that he is not proceeding on a malpractice theory he points out that he is seeking not common law damages but only the return of the attorneys fees that midwest paid the sandberg firm.we think the judge understood hoagland case perfectly well and that hoagland attempt to change horses came too late,but in any event his current theory has no basis in illinois law,so amending the complaint or dismissing the suit without prejudice would do him any good.widell wolf,cir hatch department for children,youth their families,cir.
the claim,in substance and without regard to how it might be characterized,is that the sandberg law firm represented the corporation midwest and its swindling a derivative action and used its dual representation to prevent the corporation from recovering assets of which the president had wrongfully deprived the corporation that the law firm had wrongfully accepted payment of its fees from the corporation the client whose interests the firm had sacrificed and that it should therefore be required to rebate disgorge the fees to hoagland for the benefit of the corporation.an attorney throwing one client to the wolves to save the other is malpractice.rogers robson,masters,ryan,brumund belom,nagy beckley,d,barth reagan,supra,at wissore alvey,d,tucek grant,d,ronald mallen jeffrey smith,legal malpractice,ed restatement third of the law governing lawyers comment f,and comment a,whatever the plaintiff chooses to call it.brush gilsdorf,d.he can not be permitted,by recharacterizing the by calling the conflict of interest a breach of fiduciary obligation or by contending that his contract with the law firm contained an implied promise not to commit such get around the requirement of presenting expert testimony.that is the kind of formalist move that courts rightly reject.illinois courts hold that when a breach of fiduciary duty claim is based on the same operative facts as a legal malpractice claim,and results in the same injury,the later claim should be dismissed as duplicative.fabricare equipment credit bell,boyd lloyd,d,majumdar lurie,d,see also meredith duncan,legal malpractice by any other name why a breach of fiduciary duty claim does not smell as sweet,wake forest.
the fact that restitution was sought instead of conventional damages also does not alter the nature of the suit.restitution is a remedy,at least when sought as here as reparations for a tort.dan dobbs,dobbs law of remedies,ed see also alaska sales service,millet,alaska city of harker heights sun meadows land.it is often sought in lieu of damages.dobbs,supra,for a pertinent example see stanley brassfield,cowan howard,d,see also c authorizing forfeiture and disgorgement of fees if debtor attorney has a conflict of interest ingram merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir per curiam.asking for restitution does change the cause of action.
a curious consequence of today holding is that states define the meaning of a federal jurisdictional statute,no less,one designed to draw a boundary between state and federal domains.my colleagues conclude that for purposes of a a corporation is any entity on which a state bestows that label.thus if a state renames a limited liability company as a limited liability corporation,it becomes a citizen with its own jurisdictional attributes,and the citizenship of its members no longer matters.contrast cosgrove bartolotta,cir.so too if a state renames a limited partnership a limited partnership corporation,or a joint stock company as a joint stock corporation.
almost all corporations are created and defined by state law,so states now hold the keys to federal jurisdiction.thus when in texas lawyers organize as professional corporations,while local politics dictated that groups of physicians be professional associations,the former becomes a citizen while the latter is treated like a partnership under carden arkoma associates,d.and if lawyers in missouri may organize professional corporations,while those on the other side of the mississippi river in illinois must call themselves limited liability partnerships,again the states have admitted one to federal court while excluding the other.these and more details about which states use which labels may be found in alan bromberg larry ribstein,limited liability partnerships,the revised uniform partnership act,and the uniform limited partnership act ed.
my colleagues proceed as if state control over the scope of federal jurisdiction were an inescapable result of congress decision to treat corporations,but not other organizations,as citizens.then the only question is whether something is a corporation,and,as states devise and regulate corporations,see atherton fdic,d kamen kemper financial services,d,the jurisdictional effect of the label is a natural consequence.yet congress has not made such a decision.sections a and c taken together mean that corporations are citizens,but nothing in says that state rather than federal law identifies a corporation.section is a federal statute,after all.its meaning also is a question of federal law.and if,as often is apt,federal law absorbs rules from state sources,the decision to do this also is one of federal law.see united states kimbell foods,d.see also clackamas gastroenterology associates,wells,d using rules of agency,not state nomenclature,to identify an employer for purposes of federal law.
my colleagues have collected quite a few cases for the proposition that treats as a corporation any entity bearing that label as a matter of state law.with the exception of coté wadel,cir,and saxe,bacon bolan,cir,however,these decisions fail to discuss or even notice the jurisdictional question.they therefore have not produced holdings on the subject.see pennhurst state school hospital halderman,d united states tucker truck lines.webster fall.
the supreme court,which has addressed this question,treats taxonomy as a matter of federal law.great southern fire proof hotel jones,is an example.it held that a joint stock company must be deemed a partnership rather than a corporation under,even though the constitution of pennsylvania provided that all joint stock companies or associations having any of the powers or privileges of corporations not possessed by individuals or partnerships were corporations.see at.pennsylvania made joint stock companies,unlike normal partnerships,distinct entities that like corporations could sue and be sued in their own name this made joint stock companies corporations as a matter of pennsylvania not,the supreme court held,as a matter of federal law,under which entity status is not a sufficient reason for regarding it as a corporation within the jurisdictional rule heretofore adverted to.id.at.
although the court did not say what attributes justify calling an entity a corporation,great southern fire proof hotel demonstrates that federal rather than state law supplies the rule of decision.the court observed,at,that state judges referred to joint stock companies also called limited partnership associations as under pennsylvania law but did not explain what distinguishes a quasi corporation from a real one.if a joint stock company deserves a quasi,why does a professional corporation,which like a joint stock company differs in many ways from a firm chartered under a state general corporate law 
just as great southern fire proof hotel holds that nomenclature is not sufficient to make an entity a corporation under,so moor county of alameda,d,holds that the name is unnecessary.the court concluded in moor that a municipality is a corporate citizen under a when it is a freestanding entity with the ability to incur and pay its own debts,and operate without immediate direction of the state that created it.this even though the entity was called a county rather than a corporation.
