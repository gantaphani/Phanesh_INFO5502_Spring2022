the law firm of donahue,mcintosh hammerton donahue appeals the trial court denial of its special motion to strike brought under the statute code civ,all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise noted.donahue contends the legal malpractice action filed against it arose from an act in furtherance of its right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue,and is therefore protected under the statute,subd.b.donohue also contends the action is barred by the litigation privilege,and thus subject to a special motion to strike.we disagree with each of these contentions.
as donahue recognizes,this case presents a garden variety legal malpractice action.a legal malpractice action alleges the client attorney failed to competently represent the client interests.legal malpractice is not an activity protected under the statute.that the malpractice allegedly occurred in the course of petitioning activity does not mean the claim arose from the activity itself.because kolar malpractice action does not arise from an activity protected under the statute,donahue failed to meet its initial burden.we also conclude the litigation privilege does not bar legal malpractice claims based on a litigator failure to provide competent representation in a prior lawsuit.in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we reject a number of other contentions donahue raises.accordingly,we affirm the trial court order 
factual and procedural background 
in march,plaintiffs judy and jan kolar,and the kolar family trust kolars retained donahue to provide legal services in connection with a dispute arising from property improvements constructed by plaintiffs neighbors.specifically,plaintiffs alleged the neighbors built a deck and staircase without receiving plan approval from an architectural committee as required by the subdivision covenants,conditions,and restrictions cc r.donahue filed a complaint on behalf of the kolars against plaintiffs neighbors,and maintenance and management companies employed by their homeowners association homeowner litigation.the kolars lost the homeowner litigation,and the court entered judgments against them that included attorney fees totaling.
the kolars filed the present malpractice suit,alleging donahue failed to exercise reasonable care and skill while representing them in the homeowner litigation.donahue filed a special motion to strike under the statute,which the trial court denied.donahue now appeals.
standard of review 
an order denying an special motion to strike is appealable under sections,subdivision j,and.we review the trial court order de novo.computerxpress,jackson th,d.
discussiona.the kolars malpractice action does not arise from petitioning activity protected under the statute 
the statute provides a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.
to prevail on an motion,the movant must first make a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action arises from an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.integrated healthcare holdings,fitzgibbons th,d.once the movant meets this burden,the plaintiff must demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the claim.citation.if the plaintiff can not meet this burden,the trial court must strike the cause of action.ibid.
section,subdivision e,clarifies as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.
donahue contends the kolars malpractice action arises from donahue petitioning activities in the homeowner litigation and therefore is protected under section,subdivision e.we disagree.
it is beyond dispute the filing of a complaint is an exercise of the constitutional right of petition and falls under section.brown electrical contractor,rhino electric supply,th,d.thus,malicious prosecution actions are subject to scrutiny because b y definition,a malicious prosecution suit alleges that the defendant committed a tort by filing a lawsuit.citation.jarrow formulas,lamarche cal th,d.the protection for petitioning activities applies not only to the filing of lawsuits,but extends to conduct that relates to such litigation,including statements made in connection with or in preparation of litigation.kashian harriman th,d.indeed,courts have adopted a fairly expansive view of what constitutes activities within the scope of section.id.at,d.
although a party activities constitute act s in furtherance of a person right of petition or free speech,it does not follow that any claims associated with those activities are subject to the statute.to qualify for protection,the moving party must demonstrate the claim arises from those activities.a claim arises from an act when the act forms the basis for the plaintiff cause of action equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.t he arising from requirement is not always easily met.ibid.a cause of action may be triggered by or associated with a protected act,but it does not necessarily mean the cause of action arises from that act.city of cotati cashman cal th,d,cashman.as our supreme court noted california courts rightly have rejected the notion that a lawsuit is adequately shown to be one arising from an act in furtherance of the rights of petition or free speech as long as suit was brought after the defendant engaged in such an act,whether or not the purported basis for the suit is that act itself.citation.id.at,d.
this point was illustrated in san ramon valley fire protection dist.contra costa county employees retirement th,d.there,a local fire protection district filed suit against a county retirement system and its board challenging defendants decision to increase the amount of employee retirement fund contributions.in response,the defendants filed an motion,which the trial court denied.affirming,the court of appeal determined that even if the defendants discussions and voting on the increase constituted activities protected under the statute,the plaintiffs cause of action arose from the board collective action in increasing the contribution.the court explained the statute definitional focus is whether the defendant activity giving rise to his or her asserted liability constitutes protected speech or petitioning.citation.citation.thus,the fact that a complaint alleges that a public entity action was taken as a result of a majority vote of its constituent members does not mean that the litigation challenging that action arose from protected activity,where the measure itself is not an exercise of free speech or petition.acts of governance mandated by law,without more,are not exercises of free speech or petition.t he defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citation.citation.id.at,d.
