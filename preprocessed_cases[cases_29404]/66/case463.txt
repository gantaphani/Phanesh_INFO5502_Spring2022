it is settled that a doctor duty to disclose serious potential complications to a patient before performing a medical procedure is not defined by the standards of the medical community.arato avedon cal th,d,arato.however,whether a risk of serious complications exists can be a question appropriately reserved for resolution by medical experts.jambazian borden th,d.here,we consider this distinction in connection with jury instructions covering both an informed consent claim and a general medical negligence claim.
paul betterton sued jonathan leichtling for malpractice.the jury returned a defense verdict.on appeal,betterton contends the court erroneously rejected his proposed jury instruction on informed consent and the instructions the court did give on negligence and informed consent resulted in a miscarriage of justice.we conclude that betterton proposed instruction,while flawed,was a more accurate statement of the law than the instructions given by the court,which conflicted with the principles discussed in arato and other cases.however,under the circumstances of this case the instructional error did not prejudice betterton.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
background 
betterton consulted leichtling to explore the option of surgery for a hernia in his groin.leichtling performed the surgery on an outpatient basis.that night,betterton experienced intense pain in his scrotum and testicle.he called leichtling,who prescribed a different pain medication.during the first postoperative visit,a week after the surgery,leichtling noted that betterton was experiencing residual pain and bruising caused by bleeding from the area of the surgery,which had drained into his scrotum.
at an appointment two weeks later,leichtling noted that betterton still had swelling in his scrotum caused by blood drainage.leichtling saw betterton after another two weeks,and noted that his testicle remained abnormally firm.however,leichtling recommended that betterton return to work the following week.betterton did not see leichtling after that date.his pain prevented him from returning to work.although he went to a pain clinic,and tried acupuncture and various medications,betterton was never able to resume his job as a fedex courier.
during a assessment the day before his surgery,betterton had told a nurse that he customarily took about four aspirin a week,and had been taking two aspirin every four hours the last two weeks for cold and flu symptoms.the nurse called an anesthesiologist to see if betterton aspirin use might cause any bleeding complications.the anesthesiologist reassured the nurse,and she did not warn betterton about any increased danger of bleeding due to his aspirin use.leichtling did not remember discussing aspirin with betterton he would not have considered it a significant issue.however,betterton remembered the anesthesiologist mentioning his aspirin use just before surgery,and assuring betterton that he would speak to leichtling about it and they would take care of it.
betterton called a blood specialist to testify about the effects of aspirin and its risks for surgical patients.leichtling called numerous experts,including himself,to testify on that subject and on the nature of betterton surgery and its complications.
betterton theories at trial were leichtling was negligent in deciding to go ahead with the surgery,and leichtling failed to obtain betterton informed consent to the operation because he did not advise betterton of the risk of increased bleeding due to aspirin use,and the option of delaying surgery to allow the blood platelets to restore themselves.these two theories are reflected in betterton proposed jury instruction,which is at issue on appeal 
plaintiff seeks to recover on either of two separate grounds 
that leichtling was negligent 
that leichtling failed to obtain plaintiff inform e d consent to the surgery.
as to the allegation of negligence,you must determine the standard of professional learning,skill and care required of the defendant only from the opinions of the physicians including the defendant who have testified as expert witnesses as to such standard.
you should consider each such opinion and should weigh the qualifications of the witness and the reasons given for his or her opinion.give each opinion the weight to which you deem it entitled.
you must resolve any conflict in the testimony of the witnesses by weighing each of the opinions expressed against the others,taking into consideration the reasons given for the opinion,the facts relied upon by the witness,and the relative credibility,special knowledge,skill,experience,training and education of the witness.
as to the allegation of failure to obtain informed consent,you need not determine the physician duty to disclose only from the opinions of the physicians who have testified as expert witnesses.you should determine what material information the defendant knew or should have known would be regarded as significant by a reasonable person in the plaintiff position when he decided to accept the recommended surgery.
the trial court rejected this instruction,and over betterton objection gave the standard version of baji,as follows 
you must determine the standard of professional learning,skill and care required of the defendant only from the opinions of the physicians including the defendant who have testified as expert witnesses as to such standard.

the court also gave,with betterton approval,the following version of baji 
except as hereinafter explained,it is the duty of the physician to disclose to the patient all material information to enable the patient to make an informed decision regarding the proposed operation or treatment.
material information is information which the physician knows or should know would be regarded as significant by a reasonable person in the patient position when deciding to accept or reject a recommended medical procedure.to be material a fact must also be one which is not commonly appreciated.
there is no duty to make disclosure of risks where the procedure is simple and the danger remote and commonly understood to be remote.
likewise,there is no duty to discuss minor risks inherent in common procedures,when such procedures very seldom result in serious ill effects.
however,when a procedure inherently involves a known risk of death or serious bodily harm,it is the physician duty to disclose to the patient the possibility of such outcome and to explain in lay terms the complications that might possibly occur.the physician or surgeon must also disclose such additional information as would be called for by the standard of s k ill and care required of the defendant under the same or similar circumstances.
even though the patient has consented to a proposed treatment or operation,the failure of the physician to inform the patient as stated in this instruction before obtaining such consent is negligence.this negligence renders the physician subject to liability for any injury caused by the operation if a reasonably prudent person in the patient position would not have consented to the operation if he had been adequately informed of all the significant perils.
discussion 
betterton argues that baji is inappropriate in an informed consent case because it requires the jury to determine the duty of disclosure solely by reference to expert testimony.he contends,as he did below,that its use in his case violated the principles discussed by this court in daum spinecare medical group,th,d daum.there,we summarized the law governing informed consent standards as follows
