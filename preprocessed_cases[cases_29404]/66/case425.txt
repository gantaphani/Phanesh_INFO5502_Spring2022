following a jury trial and verdict,a judgment was entered in the amount of in favor of respondent in his legal malpractice action against appellants.we conclude that respondent action is barred by a prior judgment in a malpractice action against a party in privity with respondent,and reverse the judgment.
statement of facts and procedural 
the current of several that has resulted from an joint venture agreement to develop acres of commercial its genesis years ago,when respondent father,mike mooney,a licensed commercial real estate broker doing business as mike mooney associates,entered into a listing agreement with specialty restaurants corporation specialty,which owned the property located near the western entrance to the san bridge on state route in foster city the property.pursuant to the listing agreement,mike mooney was given the exclusive right to sell or lease the property for a stated commission of seven percent.he died before the property was sold or leased.his son,respondent,also a licensed real estate broker,acquired the listing rights to the specialty restaurants land deal along with his father business 
on september,praxis development group,praxis,and its principal dan levin,entered into a limited partnership agreement with specialty the agreement to form bridge landing associates bla the stated purpose of the agreement was to subdivide,develop and lease the property as an office building complex for the production of income and profit.pursuant to the agreement,specialty contributed to the limited partnership an option for bla to acquire title to the property the agreement specified that praxis assumed the obligation to undertake to obtain all necessary approvals and financing,and thereafter to own and operate the project as an investment for the production of income for sale,in whole or in part.specialty agreed to cooperate with praxis to subdivide the land and facilitate construction of the office building complex.once praxis obtained the permits and secured financing,the agreement contemplated that the partnership would acquire the property from specialty at a price equal to the fair market value of the land as determined by an appraisal.
the agreement further provided in section that i f,months following the agreement date,there has not occurred a construction start date,the option shall thereupon expire,unless the delay has resulted from either delays in the public approval process or an inability to obtain a commitment to finance the project in a manner which would not result in an economic hardship on the project or would make the project economically infeasible,in which case the general partner may extend the construction start date for up to an additional eighteen months 
when the agreement was executed,the parties anticipated that within six months the california department of transportation would obtain approval from foster city to construct a freeway interchange at or near the property to connect east third avenue to state route,the san bridge.the negotiation with foster city of an agreement for construction of the freeway interchange upon satisfactory terms and conditions was described as critical to the success of the project.thus,specialty promised to use its best efforts to negotiate and facilitate the contemplated interchange exchange agreement,and to ensure that praxis was not delayed in the approval process for development of the project.the dates stated in the agreement regarding the timing of construction were specified to start only upon the day the interchange agreement is signed.
on july,bla entered into an exclusive right to lease agreement with respondent,as the of mike mooney associates,to market the property and find tenants for the office space,with his compensation based upon the structure of any lease he negotiated.in october of,respondent registered applied biosystems as a prospective tenant to lease office space in the project,although applied biosystems was opposed to the freeway interchange.
after the agreement was executed,levin repeatedly expressed his understanding to specialty that the option period granted to praxis pursuant to the agreement did not commence until the interchange exchange agreement was executed and the property lines of the project were definitively determined.praxis advised specialty in writing,either explicitly or implicitly,on at least eight occasions from september through january that it was waiting for the signing of the interchange exchange agreement prior to commencing the option period during which praxis would then begin its development work.specialty was ultimately unable to obtain approval of the interchange exchange agreement by foster city,and on april,the interchange was deleted from the foster city general plan.
despite the disapproval of the freeway interchange,levin and respondent continued to work with applied biosystems to finalize a tenancy agreement.respondent presented evidence that following the deletion of the interchange exchange agreement from the foster city general plan,applied biosystems remained interested in leasing office space on the property.
specialty notified levin by letter dated june,however,that the option is no longer of any force and effect because it is terminated pursuant to.specialty position in the letter was that the option period in favor of bla expired on march.in the letter specialty also requested dissolution and liquidation of the bla partnership.levin and respondent were also informed by specialty in august of to refrain from any further negotiations with applied biosystems,or any other activity regarding the property.
levin was stunned by the announcement from specialty of termination of the option,which he considered unfounded and contrary to both the provisions in the agreement for extension of the option period until the interchange exchange agreement was executed,and the position previously taken by specialty.following specialty assertion that the option had expired and the partnership was terminated,praxis and mooney were foreclosed from proceeding with the development of the property.
as part of its previously initiated chapter bankruptcy proceeding,in may of specialty filed an adversary action against praxis to dissolve the bla partnership and quiet title to the property specialty praxis.levin retained attorney kenneth greene to represent praxis in the bankruptcy action levin testified that he did not engage greene to represent respondent interests in specialty praxis,but rather only to pursue the rights of bla under the agreement.levin was aware,however,that the interests of respondent and praxis in the litigation were intertwined,because if the bla partnership goes forward and bla actually gets the land and pays for the land,then the commission is paid to shawn mooney.
respondent also realized that he had a vested interest in the success of in specialty praxis.due to respondent commission agreement with bla,his rights were derivative of praxis rights in the litigation.thus,he not only actively assisted greene in the presentation of praxis claims,but simultaneously retained greene to file two separate claims in the bankruptcy proceeding mooney one based on his commission agreement with bla,the other based on his father contract with specialty.
praxis action was tried first.respondent knew that if bla was successful with the assertion that the option had not expired the project would proceed and he would not need to pursue his claims.respondent assisted greene by gathering facts and information about the litigation.he also explained to greene that the case on his behalf was the same for the praxis claim.mooney was present at the counsel table helping out with the case during the trial and proceedings in specialty praxis.levin considered mooney to be a very good source of information about what was going on and what had transpired.
following two days of trial of the praxis adversary action in specialty praxis,the united states bankruptcy court for the central district of california issued its decision in re specialty restaurants corporation,no,wl on may.the court concluded that the agreement was silent on the effect of the deletion of the interchange exchange agreement upon the commencement of the option period,but the reasonable intent of the parties was that the period was to run from the date the interchange exchange agreement was deleted from the foster city general plan on april,and therefore expired on april.the court rejected praxis claim that the time should be tolled during the pendency of the adversary action.the court further found the freeway interchange was essential to the success of the proposed project,and the deletion of it from the foster city general plan rendered the agreement impossible to perform by praxis given the infeasibility of a more modest office building development.the court concluded that praxis was under an affirmative duty to protect its rights,and not only failed to file suit for declaratory relief,but also failed to file a counterclaim in these proceedings making the assertion.the bankruptcy court therefore dissolved the partnership and granted specialty request to quiet title to the property.
when the bankruptcy court decision against praxis and levin was issued,respondent was very concerned that his derivative rights were likely to go down with them in mooney specialty,which was still pending before the same judge.respondent also felt that the unsuccessful specialty praxis litigation was the fault of greene.
respondent remaining creditor claims against specialty for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,and tortious interference with an existing contract mooney specialty were resolved following trial before the bankruptcy court in october of.the court found that specialty did not breach the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by repudiating the joint venture agreement,and did not breach its contract with respondent.
levin retained bill caspari of the law firm of boli and caspari to pursue an appeal of the bankruptcy court decision in specialty praxis the appeal was taken by praxis to the united states district court of the central district of california.respondent and levin also planned to have caspari file an action for legal malpractice against greene and the richman law firm in the event the appeal was unsuccessful.respondent assisted caspari with the appeal and the preparation of the contemplated malpractice suit.
however,caspari advised respondent that until the bankruptcy court decision was final no damages had been suffered as a result of any malpractice by greene.in a conversation with respondent in august of,caspari stated that if and when it became necessary to do so,he would file a malpractice action against greene and the richman law firm on respondent behalf.the strategy explained to respondent by caspari was to await the decision on appeal in specialty praxis if praxis won,they would all collect from specialty as the party primarily at fault if praxis lost,the malpractice case against greene would need to be filed within one year,at the there was still plenty of time to do it.
caspari did file an appeal for respondent from the adverse decision of the bankruptcy court in mooney specialty,principally to delay the outcome of that case while specialty praxis was pending.caspari felt that the two cases were entirely interconnected,and the praxis appeal was chronologically advanced,so awaiting that decision was appropriate.
in a memorandum re specialty restaurants corporation praxis development group specialty restaurants on january,the district court affirmed the bankruptcy court judgment,with the explanation p raxis frames the issue for the court to consider as whether praxis lost it s rights in the property by failing to file an affirmative claim.however,praxis lost its rights in the property because the bankruptcy court found that the option had been neither exercised nor extended by april.in other words,praxis lost its rights in the property not because it failed to file an affirmative claim,but because the evidence presented to the bankruptcy court did not show that it continued to have any rights in the property.praxis development group specialty restaurants,no.cv,wl,at aff.cir.the court concluded that the bankruptcy court was correct to rule on the purpose of the agreement and its continuing viability,and did not commit clear error in finding the purpose was no longer feasible.the bankruptcy court correctly did not reach the issue of the tolling of the option period,as praxis had not raised the issue prior to the close of trial finally,the record shows that praxis did not pursue its breach of contract claim before the bankruptcy court.by not doing so,it has abandoned any such claim.accordingly,the judgment of the bankruptcy court is affirmed.ibid.
an appeal was taken by praxis to the ninth circuit,which filed its memorandum re specialty restaurants corporation,october.the ninth circuit held that praxis claims had not been delineated in its answer or preserved in the pretrial conference order.in re specialty restaurants corporation cir.therefore,the claims would not be considered on appeal,and the bankruptcy court did not err.id.at.
once the circuit court opinion was filed,praxis and levin,represented by appellants,initiated a lawsuit for legal malpractice against greene and the richman law firm praxis richman on january,which alleged that greene provided negligent representation in the specialty praxis litigation.numerous claims of deficient performance by greene were presented that he failed to file a claim for affirmative relief in the adversary action he failed to file any other affirmative claim against specialty on behalf of praxis he failed to preserve praxis affirmative claims at the issue conference held in the adversary action he failed to advise levin and praxis that specialty actions had triggered the option period he failed to advise levin and praxis to file an affirmative claim against specialty and he failed to advise levin and praxis that the option period began in april,or at any time during the pendency of the litigation.as a result of green negligence,praxis and levin claimed damages that included profits they reasonably would have enjoyed had they been able to enforce the limited partnership agreement against specialty and develop the property which was the subject of the limited partnership agreement.
caspari did not file a malpractice action for respondent against greene and the richman law firm.by august of,caspari perceived a conflict of interest due to his representation of praxis in its potential million action based upon greene malpractice,and the limited pool of assets available for collection of a judgment.he was also concerned with the dubious prospects of success in respondent malpractice case against greene and the richman law firm,particularly with the issue of respondent damages in the underlying case involving specialty.caspari,however,did not advise respondent that he had a conflict of interest until february of.caspari testified that he did not discuss the malpractice case with respondent before then,but if respondent had asked he would have sent him a letter advising him that he was not going to represent him.on february,caspari sent a letter to respondent in which he stated unfortunately,our office will not be able to represent you in connection with an action against greene due to our representation of praxis.
respondent adduced evidence that as the february,deadline to file his malpractice case drew near,he repeatedly attempted to contact caspari to discuss the impending statute of limitations,but received no response.according to respondent,before the letter dated february,caspari did not advise him of a conflict of interest or recommend that he seek other counsel for a malpractice case.
after the statute of limitations for respondent malpractice case against greene lapsed,respondent separately filed the present action against appellants for legal malpractice on february.as amended,the complaint essentially alleged dual levels of legal malpractice first,by greene in specialty praxis in failing to properly raise the issue of the tolling of the option period,which would have given bla the right to exercise the option to purchase the property and lease office space to applied biosystems and then,by caspari in failing to file a malpractice action against greene before the statute of limitations expired.as damages resulting from caspari negligence,respondent further alleged that upon rental of office space by applied biosystems from bla he would have received compensation pursuant to his two listing agreements.
once the appeals in specialty praxis were concluded,the praxis richman case proceeded with a motion for summary judgment by the defendant richman law firm.following a hearing on the motion the trial court found that there is no issue of material fact in this action and that defendant is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.the court determined that levin had no standing to sue in his own right and legal malpractice claims are not assignable.as to praxis,the court found as a matter of law that paragraph of the partnership agreement between praxis and specialty restaurant corporation defined the circumstances in which the two years allowed for praxis performance could be extended.these related to delays in public approvals and financing.litigation was not one of them.the construction start date was not delayed in the manner provided for by the contract,and thus the condition precedent for an extension of the partnership agreement did not exist.thus,it made no difference whether attorney kenneth greene presented a claim for affirmative relief since specialty filing of the litigation would have been no ground to excuse performance and would give no basis for an extension.the court further found that the failure to file a counterclaim for affirmative relief did not cause the option to expire.the option expired because the construction start date did not occur.moreover,filing a counterclaim for affirmative relief would not have changed the facts that the construction start date did not occur and that the prerequisites to praxis being able to extend the option did not occur.a lawyer has no obligation to allege an unmeritorious claim or to advise a client on an unmeritorious claim.the court entered judgment in favor of the richman law firm on september.praxis filed a timely notice of appeal.
the judgment in praxis richman was affirmed on appeal in an opinion filed on july,see fn,ante.despite the undisputed facts that specialty never performed and greene did not file any claims against specialty,two essential elements of a cause of action for legal malpractice were found unsubstantiated damages and causation.the additional undisputed fact,that a condition specified in the agreement,namely,the interchange exchange agreement also never occurred,was found to excuse specialty performance of the agreement based on impossibility.the court pointed out once foster city deleted the interchange exchange agreement from its general plan,the agreement as contemplated by specialty and praxis became impossible to perform or impractical because success of the project depended upon this condition.the parties from the beginning must have known that the agreement could not be fulfilled unless foster city implemented the interchange exchange agreement.the court thus concluded that any claims filed by greene on behalf of praxis in specialty adversary action would have been futile.accordingly,praxis can not establish any injury or damages from greene failure to file any claims or advise it that the option would lapse in april.
the court also concluded that the impossibility or impracticality of performance of the joint venture agreement was not due to greene failure to plead or claim specialty express or implied repudiation of the agreement,but rather due to foster city rejection the interchange exchange agreement that occurred before any failure to perform by specialty.the court explained that the parties contracted with the clear intent that praxis would develop the property and specialty would sell the property to the partnership once the interchange exchange agreement occurred.once,this critical element failed to occur,performance on the contract was excused.thus,even if praxis option had been tolled or did not expire,performance by specialty would have been excused under this agreement.
focusing specifically upon the liability of greene for malpractice,the court stated an attorney is liable for legal malpractice only if his or her failure results in loss of the client meritorious claim.loube loube th,d,citing gutierrez mofid cal d.thus,if greene had filed a breach of contract claim or a claim of anticipatory repudiation against specialty,praxis would not have been likely to prevail because specialty was excused from performing based on the affirmative defense of impossibility.accordingly,praxis suffered no damages from greene failure to act.and in response to praxis argument that the project could have proceeded even without the interchange exchange agreement,the court stated praxis argument,however,misses the pivotal issue a central assumption of the contract did not occur.once specialty was unable to negotiate the interchange exchange agreement,which was necessary for the project to be successful under the express terms of the agreement,specialty performance on the contract was excused.accordingly,praxis could not succeed in a breach of contract claim or in any other affirmative claims based on specialty nonperformance of the contract.accordingly,the claim of legal malpractice against greene must fail as a matter of law.
as a second,independent basis for affirming the trial court grant of summary judgment against praxis claim of legal malpractice in praxis richman,the court found that praxis can not establish that greene was the cause of any injury.according to the undisputed evidence,praxis lost its rights in the property once the option period expired as specified in the agreement,not because greene failed to file an affirmative claim that the time for acting on the option agreement was tolled.consequently,the court concluded,greene failure to file a claim against specialty in the adversary proceeding was not,as a matter of law,the cause of praxis loss of interest in the property or project.
meanwhile,the present case proceeded to trial in july and august of.the jury returned a special verdict in favor of respondent in the amount of,based upon caspari negligent failure to timely file a malpractice action against greene.this appeal followed.
discussion 
appellants have presented numerous issues in this appeal,but we confront and resolve only the first of them that the present action is precluded by the collateral estoppel effect of praxis richman.appellants argue that the final determination in praxis richman,that greene can not be liable to praxis for legal malpractice,bars the present malpractice action which is necessarily based upon the same underlying conduct.appellants acknowledge that the parties in the two suits are not identical,but claim there was a privity between mooney and praxis,which makes the relationship between mooney and praxis sufficiently close to justify application of collateral estoppel and foreclose relitigation of the malpractice issue.
we very recently restated the fundamental principles that govern the doctrine of collateral estoppel issue preclusion by collateral estoppel prevents relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.citation.castillo city of los angeles th,d see also bob baker enterprises,chrysler th,d.the doctrine rests upon the ground that the party to be affected,or some other with whom he is in privity,has litigated,or had an opportunity to litigate the same matter in a former action in a court of competent jurisdiction,and should not be permitted to litigate it again to the harassment and vexation of his opponent.public policy and the interest of litigants alike require that there be an end to litigation.panos great western packing cal d,see also citizens for open access.tide,seadrift th,d.rodgers sargent controls aerospace th,d rodgers.
