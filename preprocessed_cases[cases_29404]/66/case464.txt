introduction 
petitioners diane johnson diane and ronald johnson ronald the johnsons,along with their minor daughter brittany johnson brittany,filed an action against real party in interest,california cryobank,cryobank,and its employees,officers and directors,real parties in interest charles sims,and cappy rothman,alleging real parties failed to disclose that the sperm they sold to the johnsons came from a donor with a history of kidney disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease adpkd.that sperm was used to conceive brittany who has been diagnosed to have this serious kidney disease.in,the trial court ruled in connection with a summary adjudication motion brought by cryobank that brittany is not entitled to recover general damages and damages for lost earnings.in that same year,the court granted motions brought by sims and rothman for summary adjudication as to the fraud causes of action set forth in petitioners second amended complaint in,petitioners filed motions to reconsider or vacate the rulings and to amend their complaint to add a claim for punitive damages.in november,the trial court denied the motion to set aside the rulings.the following month,the court denied the motion for leave to amend petitioners second amended complaint to add a claim for punitive damages without prejudice to the filing of a motion pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a 
the issues presented in connection with this writ proceeding are whether sperm banks such as cryobank are health care providers as that term is used in section,subdivision b,doctors such as sims and rothman and sperm banks such as cryobank act as health care providers when they perform genetic screening of potential sperm donors,an individual complaining that negligent screening of a donor sperm caused her genetic disability is entitled to recover damages for lost earnings and general damages,and the trial court erred in denying petitioners motion to set aside the orders summarily adjudicating the fraud causes of action asserted against sims and rothman 
we conclude that cryobank is a health care provider as that term is used in section,subdivision b sims,rothman and cryobank were acting as health care providers at the time they performed the professional services alleged within the second amended complaint and brittany is not entitled to recover general damages or damages for lost earnings.
ii.factual and procedural background 
second amended complaint.petitioners sued cryobank,sims and rothman for professional negligence,fraud and breach of contract.in their second amended complaint petitioners allege that in cryobank,a corporation in the business of providing sperm from donors to health care providers and their clients,approved an individual designated as donor as a sperm donor in,the johnsons infertility physician directed them to cryobank sperm bank facility,and diane selected donor.after a successful implant procedure with sperm from donor,brittany was born in april.in may,brittany was positively diagnosed with adpkd.as neither ronald nor diane has adpkd or a family history of the disease,it was donor who genetically transmitted adpkd to brittany.
at the time donor approached cryobank in december,sims and rothman,on behalf of cryobank,interviewed him and learned facts that signaled the presence of adpkd in donor family.even though cryobank,sims and rothman knew of donor family history of kidney disease,none of this information was provided to the johnsons at or prior to the time they purchased the sperm specimens.
cryobank,sims and rothman failed to examine or test donor to ascertain whether he was suffering from kidney disease or was a potential carrier of the adpkd gene,failed to properly investigate donor family history of kidney disease,and falsely represented to the johnsons that the sperm they were purchasing had been tested and screened for infectious and reasonably detectable genetically transferred diseases and medical abnormalities,and therefore could safely be used to effectuate the johnsons pregnancy.
trial court rulings.the fraud causes of action set forth in petitioners second amended complaint were based on the theory that sims and rothman either negligently or intentionally misrepresented,suppressed concealed facts from the johnsons regarding donor medical history.in,sims and rothman moved for summary adjudication as to these claims.in july,the trial court granted the motions,finding that there was no evidence to support petitioners fraud claims.at about the same time,the court held,in connection with a motion for summary adjudication brought by cryobank,that brittany is not entitled to recover general damages or damages for lost earnings.
donor profile.in,donor completed a document entitled about the donor hereafter donor profile.in january,prior to filing suit,diane contacted cryobank and requested a copy of the donor profile.although a copy of the document was provided,the johnsons did not know,and real parties did not disclose to them,that page had been rewritten,and that certain notations contained on the original page had been deleted.
during the course of the action,petitioners propounded discovery to cryobank in an effort to obtain a copy of donor files and records maintained by cryobank.cryobank objected to providing any information regarding donor,claiming the donor right to privacy and his privilege.johnson,supra,th at,d.
in,petitioners served donor with a subpoena to attend his deposition and produce his medical records and certain documents showing his involvement with cryobank.johnson,supra,th at,d.when he failed to appear,petitioners moved to compel his attendance and production of the requested records.id.at,d.when the trial court denied the motion,petitioners filed a petition for writ of mandate,which we granted.id.at,d.
in may,this court ruled that petitioners could take donor deposition,and delve into his and his family health and medical history,and his communications with cryobank.johnson,supra,th at,d.
on april,the trial court issued an order directing the donor deposition.at the first session of the deposition,held on may,cryobank produced a redacted copy of its file on donor.petitioners counsel briefly reviewed the contents of the file,and in so doing,learned for the first time that the copy of the donor profile diane received from cryobank on january,differed from the copy found in donor file.specifically,on the original page,donor affirmative answers to the questions concerning the presence of kidney disease in his mother and his were circled,a question mark was written next to each x,and the notation at risk for kidney disease was written directly above the x denoting his mother kidney disease.the document contained three different colors of ink.on october,after a number of requests to cryobank counsel,petitioners were provided with a of the original donor profile.the of page revealed that the donor responses were written in blue ink,the question marks next to the donor x for his family kidney disease were written in black ink,the notation at risk for kidney disease was written in black ink,and the circles around the x were written in red ink.
petitioners motions.in october,petitioners filed two motions.the first sought an order allowing petitioners to amend the second amended complaint to add a claim for punitive damages.the second,based on sections and and the trial court inherent equitable power,sought reconsideration of the ruling that brittany is not entitled to recover damages for loss of earnings and general damages,and of the orders summarily adjudicating the fraud causes of action in favor of sims and rothman.
trial court rulings.the trial court denied petitioners motion to amend the second amended complaint to add a punitive damages claim without prejudice to the filing of a section,subdivision a motion.the trial court also denied petitioners motion to vacate or reconsider the summary adjudication orders in favor of sims and rothman,and the ruling prohibiting brittany recovery of general damages and damages for loss of earnings.the court found that the motions were untimely under section,subdivision a,and that petitioners had failed to produce evidence establishing extrinsic fraud as required by section.this petition for writ of mandate followed.
iii.discussion 
petitioners were required to comply with section,subdivision a prior to amending their complaint to add a claim for punitive damages.
petitioners motion for leave to amend the operative complaint to add a claim for punitive damages was denied without prejudice to the filing of a motion pursuant to section,subdivision a petitioners contend this was error because cryobank is not a health care provider as that term is used in section,subdivision b,and sims,rothman and cryobank were not acting as health care providers at the time they rendered the services described in the second amended complaint.
section,enacted in as a part of the brown lockyer civil liability reform act,imposes procedural requirements on a party claiming punitive damages in a medical malpractice action.central pathology service medical clinic,superior court cal th,d,central pathology.subdivision a of the statute provides that i n any action for damages arising out of the professional negligence of a health care provider,no claim for punitive damages shall be included in a complaint or other pleading unless the court enters an order allowing an amended pleading that includes a claim for punitive damages to be filed.the court may allow the filing of an amended pleading claiming punitive damages on a motion by the party seeking the amended pleading and on the basis of the supporting and opposing affidavits presented that the plaintiff has established that there is a substantial probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim pursuant to section of the civil code.the court shall not grant a motion allowing the filing of an amended pleading that includes a claim for punitive damages if the motion for such an order is not filed within two years after the complaint or initial pleading is filed or not less than nine months before the date the matter is first set for trial,whichever is earlier.
subdivision b,added in,provides that f or the purposes of this section,health care provider means any person licensed or certified pursuant to division commencing with section of the business and professions code,or licensed pursuant to the osteopathic initiative act,or the chiropractic initiative act,or licensed pursuant to chapter commencing with section of division of the health and safety code and any clinic,health dispensary,or health facility,licensed pursuant to division commencing with section of the health and safety code.health care provider includes the legal representatives of a health care provider.italics added.
although section is not part of the medical injury compensation reform act micra perry shaw th,fn,d,the language of section,subdivision b is virtually identical to the language of civil code section,subdivision c a micra provision enacted in.where,as here,the same phrase appears in different statutory schemes,we can assume the legislature intended the phrases to be accorded the same meaning only if the statutes involved have the same or similar designs and objectives.we therefore look to the legislative history underlying each of the statutes.delaney baker cal th,d.
civil code section,which limits the size of any award of noneconomic damages in an action for injury against a health care provider based on professional negligence,is an integral part of micra.western steamship lines,san pedro peninsula hospital cal th,d.micra,which includes a variety of provisions all of which are calculated to reduce the cost of insurance by limiting the amount and timing of recovery in cases of professional negligence,was enacted in response to a medical malpractice insurance crisis,which the legislature perceived threatened the quality of the state health care.citation.id.at,d.the legislature goal was to bring down premiums so that doctors could continue to practice medicine in california,and charge reasonable prices.perry shaw,supra,th at,d.
we recognize that medical malpractice insurance does not cover punitive damages peterson superior court cal d,fn,and that the legislature goal in enacting section was not to reduce the cost of malpractice insurance.rather,it was to require greater certainty of the propriety of imposing punitive damages by requiring clear and convincing evidence of fraud,malice,or oppression,and to provide health care providers with additional protection by establishing a pretrial hearing mechanism by which the court would determine whether an action for punitive damages could proceed.central pathology,supra,cal th at,d.although it is clear that code of civil procedure section was not enacted for the same reasons as micra,both statutes were adopted to protect health care providers.micra reflects a strong public policy to contain the costs of malpractice insurance by controlling or redistributing liability for damages,thereby maximizing the availability of medical services to meet the state health care needs western steamship lines,san pedro peninsula hospital,supra,cal th at,d,while code of civil procedure section shelter s health care providers from the need to defend against punitive damage claims which have no substance.looney superior court th,d.the legislature decision to provide health care practitioners with a procedural hurdle designed to weed out meritless punitive damage claims suggests the legislature believed that such a mechanism was necessary to ensure that health care providers would not be embroiled in frivolous litigation that would affect their ability to continue to provide medical services to meet the health care needs of californians.we are satisfied that the legislative purposes underlying code of civil procedure section and civil code section are similar enough to support a finding that the legislature intended that the phrase health care provider found in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a be accorded the same meaning as the identical phrase found in civil code section,subdivision c.
cryobank is a health care provider as that term is used in section,subdivision b.
cryobank claims that because it is licensed as a clinical laboratory under business and professions code,division,section et and as a tissue bank pursuant to division,chapter,commencing with health and safety code section it qualifies as a health care provider as that term is defined in section,subdivision b.however,in kotler alma lodge th,d,a case interpreting civil code section,the court rejected appellants contention that any entity licensed under health and safety code division falls within the ambit of micra,noting that t he express language of civil code section,subdivision c states otherwise a health care provider under micra is any clinic,health dispensary,or health facility,licensed pursuant to division of the health and safety code,subd.c.thus,the only division licensees entitled to the protections of micra are those licensed as clinics,health dispensaries or health facilities.citation.kotler,supra,th at,d.the kotler court concluded that n ot only would a contrary holding render surplusage the legislature use of the terms clinic,health dispensary and health facility to specify which division licensees are covered by micra,this limitation also makes sense in light of micra purpose,which was to remedy a health care crisis attributed to the high cost of malpractice insurance.citation.ibid.the limitation identified by the kotler court also makes sense in light of the legislative purpose behind section,which was to protect health care practitioners from the need to defend against meritless punitive damage claims.looney superior court,supra,th at,d.
cryobank apparently concedes that it is not a clinic as defined by health and safety code section or a health facility under health and safety code section cryobank claims,however,that it qualifies as a health dispensary,and thus is a health care provider under section,subdivision b.
coe superior court d.coe lends support for cryobank claim.in coe,the issue was whether a blood bank was a health care provider under civil code section.coe,supra,d at.irwin memorial blood bank held two licenses,one under division of the business and professions code as a clinical laboratory,and one under division of the health and safety code as a blood bank.coe,supra,at.turning to the definition of blood bank which is defined in health and safety code section as any place where human whole blood,and human whole blood derivatives specified by regulation,are collected,prepared,tested,processed,or stored,or from which human whole blood or human whole blood derivatives specified by regulation are distributed coe,supra,at,fn,the coe court found that the term health dispensary includes blood banks,since a blood bank dispenses a product and provides a service inextricably identified with the health of humans.id.at.the coe court reasoned that because blood is so vital to human health,the legislative purpose in enacting micra,to assure health care was available to the medically indigent and the economically marginal,would be served by including a blood bank within the ambit of the micra protections.id.at,fn.
the similarities between coe and the instant case are marked.cryobank,like the blood bank in coe,is licensed as a clinical laboratory under division of the business and professions code,and holds a license under division of health and safety code.sperm banks are regulated under health and safety code chapter,tissue banks health,et while blood banks are regulated under health and safety code,chapter,human whole blood,human whole blood derivatives,and other biologics health,et.sperm banks,like blood banks,are subject to regulations that mandate screening for certain conditions and infectious disease.see health,subd.c,et.the main difference between blood banks and sperm banks seems to be that health and safety code section,which regulates the licensing requirements for personnel who may collect human blood,specifically provides at subsection of section a that the collection of human blood must be performed under the direct and responsible supervision of a licensed physician and surgeon.no similar requirement exists with respect to the collection of sperm by sperm banks.see health.while this fact is significant,it is not dispositive of the issue of whether a sperm bank can be considered a health dispensary.under coe,the factors to be considered are whether cryobank dispenses a product,and the service is inextricably identified with the health of humans.coe,supra,d at.
there is no question that cryobank dispenses a product sperm,and provides a service provision of donor sperm to health care practitioners and their clients.petitioners contend,however,that the service offered is not inextricably identified with the health of humans.we disagree.the first documented case of human artificial insemination in the united states occurred in.see note,fda approved a critique of the artificial insemination industry in the united states.ref.since that time,artificial insemination has become an increasingly popular means of achieving parenthood id.at.a wide variety of factors leads individuals to their decision to use the procedure,including genetic disorders,sexually transmitted disease,and male partner infertility.id.at.in response to the increase in documented cases of artificial insemination,organizations such as the american fertility society and the american association of tissue banks aatb began publishing professional guidelines for biological and genetic screening of donor semen,emphasizing that properly screened sperm is essential to the health of a child conceived by artificial insemination.id.at.regulation of the industry followed.id.at.
prior to,tissue transplants such as skin grafts and artificial insemination were essentially unregulated.legis.analyst,to assem.com.on health,assem.bill reg.sess.in march,assembly bill was introduced to require tissue banks to have a license issued by the department of health services department.assem.bill reg.sess.the department urged adoption of the bill because it believed that standards are required and surveillance is needed to ensure that tissue is properly stored,labeled,tested,and transported to meet new medical demands for human tissue.ibid.the provisions,structure,and authority within the bill were modeled after current statutory control of blood and blood products.staff analyst,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.argued in support of the bill was that l iving tissues are commonly employed to save or restore patients today,yet no body of law protects recipients from potential infection,mistyping,or related injury.this bill is necessary to maintain the high industry standards essential to effective transplantation.ibid.what is clear from the history of the bill is that the legislature recognized that the use of semen,among other tissues,has the power to affect human health.we therefore conclude that the service provided by provision of semen to health care practitioners and their inextricably identified with the health of humans.
petitioners contend that the legislative purpose underlying section will not be furthered by declaring cryobank to be a health care provider since sperm is not vital to human health and the provision of sperm is not necessary to protect the medically indigent and the economically marginal.coe,supra,d at,fn.nothing contained in coe requires us to consider whether the legislative purpose underlying section will be furthered by declaring cryobank to be a health care provider.we note,however,that while the ability to purchase and sell donor sperm may not be essential to human health in the same sense as blood and there is no necessity that donor sperm be made available to the medically indigent or the economically marginal,sperm is vital in numerous instances each year to procreation.and healthy sperm,together with a safe artificial insemination process,is vital to the birth of a healthy child.we therefore conclude that cryobank qualifies as a health dispensary,and thus a health care provider as that term is used in section,subdivision b.
sims,rothman and cryobank.petitioners concede that sims and rothman are licensed physicians and thus are health care providers.petitioners claim,however,that because sims and rothman on behalf of cryobank were not acting as health care providers at the time they rendered the services described in the second amended complaint,petitioners had no obligation to comply with section,subdivision a 
the protections set forth in section apply whenever an injured party seeks punitive damages for an injury that is directly related to the professional services provided by a health care provider acting in its capacity as such central pathology,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.thus,although section on its face applies only to actions involving negligence,its procedures must be followed even if the plaintiff alleges an intentional wrong such as fraud.central pathology,supra,at,d.
to determine whether the injury that is the basis for the claim was caused by conduct that was directly related to the rendition of professional services,we examine the allegations contained within the complaint.central pathology,supra,cal th at,d.
petitioners allege that cryobank is a tissue bank licensed under california law sims and rothman are licensed physicians in the state of california cryobank made representations and assurances to petitioners regarding the safety of the human sperm which was purchased at cryobank and that cryobank represented that it tested and screened its donors to assure they were healthy and reasonably free of disease.petitioners also allege that sims and rothman interviewed donor in order to obtain detailed information regarding his medical history and the medical history of his family.specifically,petitioners allege that sims and rothman obtained information regarding the donor mother and aunt,that they suffered kidney disease,high blood pressure and hearing loss,and that this clearly signaled the presence of adpkd to defendant sims,rothman and cryobank.petitioners further allege that the donor clearly informed real parties of multiple incidents in his family history of relatives being afflicted with kidney disease coupled with hypertension which even in was symptomotology commonly known by the medical community in the united states as red flag indicators of a highly aggressive genetically transferred life threatening kidney disease,adpkd.
petitioners brush aside these allegations,claiming that no special knowledge,skill or care as a member of the medical profession was required of sims or rothman at the time they performed the genetic screening,only common sense and the ability to read the aatb standards of course,the test is not the degree of skill required,but whether negligence occurred in rendering services for which a provider is licensed.williams superior court th,d williams.
although genetic screening,under the aatb guidelines cited by petitioners,may be performed by someone other than a physician,this does not mean that sims and rothman were not acting as health care providers when they reviewed the information taken from the donor profile.the record reveals that the evaluation process at cryobank consisted of laboratory tests a physical examination,and an interview.each of these phases required the application of medical knowledge and experience to the information that was received.according to the aatb standards,an interviewer is required to make an evaluation as to whether a particular condition proposes a risk of one percent or less to the offspring.the interviewer is then required to evaluate whether there is a medical problem that has a possible genetic etiology.to do so,the interviewer applies all the information gathered to medical knowledge of genetics and disease states,to determine whether a potential donor poses a risk to offspring.petitioners allege that sims and rothman,on behalf of cryobank,participated in the screening of donor,and that both physicians evaluated the donor information in order to determine whether the donor posed a risk to offspring.
we conclude that sims and rothman and thus cryobank were providing professional services when donor was interviewed and approved for the donor program.see,osborn irwin memorial blood bank th,d osborn holding that a blood bank is a medical provider under micra,and that donor screening and blood testing are professional services for purposes of micra.
petitioners,characterizing the purchase and sale of donor sperm as a purely commercial transaction,suggest that because there existed no relationship between real parties and donor or between real parties and petitioners they had no obligation to comply with section,subdivision a.however,the absence of a relationship does not excuse petitioners from complying with the statute.see williams,supra,th at,d.
in williams,a phlebotomist,a nonemployee of the defendant rehabilitation institution,acquired hiv while drawing blood from a violent patient.the patient thrashed around,causing the needle,already contaminated with his blood,to puncture her gloved hand and lacerate her thumb.she sued,contending that section did not apply because she had alleged no facts bringing her claim under professional negligence statutes and because no health care provider services were rendered to her by the rehabilitation institute.williams,supra,th at,d.on appeal,the court held that the plaintiff action was within the scope of section,notwithstanding that the plaintiff was not a patient.by adoption of section,the legislature intended to protect health care providers from unsubstantiated claims for punitive damages in actions against those providers in their capacity as practitioners.citation.while lawsuits unrelated to the practitioner conduct in providing health care were not intended to be included citation,it would defeat the purpose of the legislation if claims arising out of the practitioner professional negligence were excluded from coverage simply because the injured party was not a patient.we therefore conclude section applies to any foreseeable injured party,including patients,business invitees,staff members or visitors,provided the injuries alleged arose out of professional negligence.williams,supra,at,d,italics added.
in reaching its decision,the williams court relied on atkins strayhorn d.civil code section applied separately to a claim for loss of consortium brought by the spouse of an injured patient,yates pollock d.the limitation on noneconomic damages contained in civil code section applies in a wrongful death action initiated by deceased patient survivors,and hedlund superior court cal d,section,the micra statute of limitations governing actions for breach of professional negligence,applied where a woman sued two psychologists claiming injuries sustained as a result of psychologists failure to disclose a patient intentions of harming the plaintiff.williams,supra,th at,d.we recognize that these cases involve claims made by third parties arising out of a relationship.however,what these cases make clear is that in deciding whether a plaintiff is required to comply with section,the focus is not on whether the defendant health care provider and the injured party had a relationship,but on whether the health care provider charged with negligence was acting in the capacity of a health care provider at the time of the allegedly tortious acts.the collection,processing,and testing of sperm for use in artificial insemination requires the exercise of professional expertise and professional judgment.under williams and the authorities cited therein,the fact that there existed no relationship between cryobank and the donor or between cryobank and petitioners is irrelevant.
petitioners claim that cryobank,sims and rothman improperly screened donor sperm,and that as a result,adpkd was genetically transmitted to brittany.genetic screening,we conclude,is an ordinary and usual part of the medical professional services provided by real parties.because the allegations contained with the operative complaint demonstrate that the injury that is the basis for petitioners claim was caused by conduct that was directly related to the rendition of professional services,we conclude that petitioners were required to comply with section,subdivision a prior to asserting a claim for punitive damages against cryobank,sims and rothman.
brittany can not recover general damages or damages for loss of earnings.
petitioners contend the ruling barring brittany from recovering general damages and damages for loss of earning was incorrect,and that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to set the earlier ruling aside.
in,the trial court,relying on turpin sortini cal d,turpin and andalon superior court d.andalon,characterized brittany lawsuit as one for wrongful life,and held that she is not entitled to recover general damages or damages for lost earnings.in,petitioners motion to reconsider vacate the ruling was denied,prompting this petition.even though the petition may be untimely,the damage issues have been fully briefed and are important for the guidance of the trial court and the litigants.we will therefore reach the issue.andalon,supra,d at.
general damages.in turpin,our supreme court ruled that a child born with a hereditary affliction deafness is entitled to maintain a tort action against a medical care provider the child failed to advise the child parents of the possibility of the hereditary condition,depriving them of the opportunity to choose not to conceive the child.the gist of the minor claim was that she had suffered harm or damage as a result of defendants negligent performance of their professional task,and that,as a consequence,she was entitled to recover under generally applicable common law tort principles.turpin,supra,cal d at.with respect to the child claim for pain and suffering or other general damages,our supreme court held that recovery should be denied because it is simply impossible to determine in any rational or reasoned fashion whether the plaintiff has in fact suffered an injury in being born impaired rather than not being born,and even if it were possible to overcome the first hurdle,it would be impossible to assess general damages in any fair,nonspeculative manner.id.at.the court explained,that i n requesting general damages in a wrongful life ca
