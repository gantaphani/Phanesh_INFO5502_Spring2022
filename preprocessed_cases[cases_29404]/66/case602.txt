defendants macneal memorial hospital association and john brofman,appeal an order granting plaintiff jean lisowski motion for a new trial.plaintiff brought a negligence action against defendants after the death of her husband,edward lisowski lisowski.a jury returned a verdict for defendants.plaintiff moved for a new trial.her main contention was that the trial court erred in refusing to give the jury instruction illinois pattern jury instructions,civil,hereinafter ipi civil after defendants failed to produce their expert witness.we reverse and direct the trial court to reinstate the jury verdict.
plaintiff alleged in her complaint that lisowski suffered years of ill health before his death because of defendants negligence.she alleged brofman was negligent in performing a thoracentesis to drain fluid from lisowski lungs through a chest tube on november.she also alleged brofman failed to obtain lisowski consent to the procedure.plaintiff alleged macneal hospital was liable under an agency theory.during the procedure,lisowski diaphragm and liver were lacerated.he required emergency surgery and intensive care.he was released from the hospital days after the procedure.he died three years later of ventricular fibrillation,a heart problem.
the first trial in october ended in a hung jury.the second trial,beginning on may,is the subject of this appeal.
in discovery,defendants disclosed jesse hall as a controlled expert witness under supreme court rule f f.defendants said hall,a pulmonologist and critical care specialist,would state that brofman conduct complied with the standard of care.hall apparently was deposed in but the deposition is not in the record.plaintiff maintains hall stated in the deposition that brofman deviated from the standard of care.
plaintiff disclosed william warren,a thoracic surgeon,as her expert witness under rule f f.plaintiff did not disclose that warren would say lisowski suffered depression and suicidal tendencies because of brofman negligence.plaintiff also disclosed edward allen lisowski edward,the couple son,who plaintiff said would testify to family hardships attributable to brofman negligence.three months before the trial,plaintiff counsel sent a letter to defense counsel,asking to add hall as a plaintiff witness if defendants intended to abandon him.defense counsel responded by letter,stating defendants had not abandoned hall.
in opening statements,plaintiff counsel told the jury that hall would testify and state that brofman deviated from the standard of care by inserting the chest tube at the wrong location and in the wrong direction.defense counsel did not object.
plaintiff called brofman in her case in chief as an adverse witness under section of the code of civil procedure code ilcs west.brofman denied deviating from the standard of care either in performing the thoracentesis or in obtaining consent.brofman said he received training from hall when he was a medical student.brofman denied having independent knowledge of hall alleged opinion that brofman deviated from the standard of care in treating lisowski.
plaintiff expert warren said he reviewed the medical records from the procedure,the depositions of the treating physicians,a electrocardiogram report and an autopsy report in forming his opinions.warren said brofman deviated from the standard of care in obtaining consent while lisowski was sedated and in the way he performed the thoracentesis.warren admitted on that he did not know how lisowski reacted to sedation or his mental capacity at the time he allegedly consented.warren said obtaining consent after as little as of a milligram of the sedative would be a deviation from the standard of care.the trial court barred warren from testifying that lisowski was depressed and suicidal after the procedure because plaintiff failed to disclose these opinions in discovery.
defendants called brofman in their case in chief.he testified,i believe that the anatomical landmarks i chose and the techniques i chose and the care with which the tube was inserted all complied very much with the standard of care.the following took place in the jury presence during of brofman by plaintiff counsel 
by plaintiff counsel y ou said you did your training in pulmonary critical care at the university of chicago,correct 
brofman yes.
and that in fact was under jesse hall,the expert that your counsel has retained in this case,correct 
hall was part of the faculty at the time i was there,yes.
q.so you were actually studying under jesse hall,correct 
hall was part of the faculty and was involved in my training.
right.so when hall comes in here later today and tells us that you violated the standard of care by inserting the chest tube as you did,do you have any problem with him testifying to that 
stevenson defendants counsel objection.move to strike.
the court to plaintiff counsel counsel,you have now taken the burden to bring hall in.
by basile plaintiff counsel 
do you have any problems with him testifying to that,or are you going to have a problem with qualifications 
stevenson same objection.
the court that would be sustained.
the court i will let him answer that question.that puts the burden on you plaintiff to bring him in.
by brofman hall is certainly free to testify in any way he chooses.
after brofman testimony,defense counsel presented written motions for directed verdicts on the issues of consent and medical negligence.the trial court took the motions under advisement.later,in the jury instruction conference,the following took place 
the court plaintiff instruction is instruction ipi civil,failure to call a witness.i take it you referring to jesse hall 
stevenson defendants counsel my objection is that the plaintiff shifted the burden of proof by putting in statements which defense did not put in.therefore,the ipi civil instruction as against the defendant only is improper because it was the plaintiff who made all of the issues about what this expert was going to say.
hall is currently unavailable this afternoon because of surgical and other issues and i could not bring him in today,but i told you this morning that if that was the case,we were ready to proceed and close without him.
basile b ack in february of,i sent a letter to defense counsel telling her that i wanted to call hall as one of my witnesses.i also wanted to amend my rule disclosures.
she sent me a letter indicating that defendants had not abandoned hall and that they intended to call him in their case in chief.
the deposition of hall in various parts states that brofman violated the standard of care.even until now,and the court is aware,defense counsel has indicated that jesse hall would be here to testify.
the court if you plaintiff counsel had stopped with violating the standard of care,you would have been within appropriate bounds for.i would have allowed that without any question and may very well have given this instruction.
however,when you indicated to that jury that the doctor would testify,you then brought it upon yourself to produce that doctor to testify.
both parties had an obligation to produce the doctor,nobody produced him.therefore,the court will not give the instruction,and the court will strike references to what jesse hall may have testified to.
basile plaintiff counsel so the record is clear also,the witness at this point has not been abandoned by the defense counsel,and i would at this time request an opportunity to call him in.we would ask that we could reopen our case and call him as another witness or a rebuttal witness.
the court if you issued a subpoena,you could have brought him in.
stevenson he has issued a subpoena.
basile i could.defense counsel said defendants were not abandoning hall,he still under defendants control.i ca issue a subpoena today because defense counsel still has abandoned him as far as the record goes.
at this point,if defense counsel is going to stipulate for the record she abandoned him,i like the opportunity to call him in as a rebuttal witness.
stevenson your honor,i have abandoned him,he not available.i have a right to make a legal determination whether to proceed with this case as is or try to continue the case when hall is available.
basile i would ask that we have a short continuance and see if we can get him in here tomorrow morning.
the court i have no reason to continue this further.i going to proceed at this time.
the instruction is refused.
in closing arguments,plaintiff counsel said brofman conduct caused serious injury to lisowski.counsel argued that defendants would try to trivialize the injury by focusing on lisowski other health problems.plaintiff counsel said lisowski almost died twice in the hospital.he argued that the main issue was whether brofman inserted the chest tube negligently,not lisowski medical history.f rom the beginning i told you we are not denying that lisowski had congestive heart failure and noninsulin dependent diabetes,counsel said.
defense counsel said in closing arguments that lisowski died of congestive heart failure.as noted,lisowski died of ventricular fibrillation but it is undisputed that he suffered from congestive heart failure before his death.defense counsel argued that plaintiff exaggeration of the seriousness of her husband condition after the procedure was contradicted by the fact that family members were not called to lisowski bedside after the procedure and that the couple son edward did not testify at the trial.
the trial court instructed the jury that it was plaintiff burden to prove defendants acted or failed to act in one of the ways claimed by plaintiff,that plaintiff was injured and that defendants negligence proximately caused plaintiff injury.the trial judge then told the jury t here was some evidence concerning a jesse hall.you are to disregard any reference of what was alleged concerning jesse hall.
the jury returned a verdict in defendants favor.
plaintiff moved for a new trial.defendants in their response to plaintiff motion said hall medical practice and travel prevented him from appearing during the trial.defendants said hall would not have been available until two days after the trial ended.
after a hearing,the trial court granted plaintiff motion for a new trial in the following written order,stating in its entirety 
this matter coming to be heard on plaintiff motion to vacate judgment and for new trial the judge having read the briefs and heard argument,i t is hereby ordered the judgment of may,is hereby vacated and the matter is set for retrial on march,at in room without further notice.
there was no written statement of the reasons for the ruling.see turner commonwealth edison,d,when a new trial is granted a concise statement of findings or reasons should be incorporated into the record by the trial judge so that the reviewing court may know what prompted his action.nor can we ascertain the judge reasons from a transcript of the hearing because there is none in the record.
as a threshold matter,plaintiff argues that we must affirm the order for a new trial because defendants violated supreme court rule a a in failing to provide a complete record.plaintiff notes the absence of hall deposition the letters between the attorneys on defendants refusal to abandon hall and a transcript of the hearing on plaintiff motion for a new trial.
rule a provides the report of proceedings shall include all the evidence pertinent to the issues on appeal.a.absent a sufficient record,the reviewing court presumes that the trial court conformed to the law and that its rulings were supported by the evidence.adams sarah bush lincoln health center,d.in general,the burden is on the appellant to present a satisfactory record.foutch.but a reviewing court may consider an appeal despite deficiencies in the record where the trial transcripts sufficiently convey the conduct at issue.gonzalez nissan north america,d.doubts arising from the incompleteness of the record will be resolved in favor of the appellee.foutch,at.
here,the material pertinent to this appeal appears in the trial transcript.plaintiff does not claim this transcript is incomplete.the transcript,with plaintiff motion for a new trial,provides a sufficient record for review.see senderak mitchell,d,where the court does not state its reasons for granting a new trial,we look to the posttrial motions and assume the errors stated there prompted the order.accord rodriguez chicago transit authority,d.see also berry searle,objections considered on review are delimit ed to those in the complaint.
defendants first argue that the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial because the jury verdict was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.plaintiff argues that this court must defer to the trial court because the judge there was in a better position to observe the trial and recognize errors.
a new trial is proper if the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.maple gustafson.a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence where the opposite conclusion was evident or the verdict was unreasonable or arbitrary and not based on the evidence.maple,at.the jury role is to resolve conflicts in the evidence to determine the credibility of witnesses and to decide the weight to be given each witness testimony.maple,at.after the jury reaches a verdict,the trial court must not reweigh the evidence or interfere with a verdict merely because another result was possible or reasonable.maple,at.nor can this court reach its own conclusions on questions of fact where the trial was fair and the evidence did not favor either side.maple,at.we will reverse an order for a new trial only if the trial court abused its discretion.maple,at.a court abuses its discretion when it grants a new trial despite sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict.maple,at.
to establish medical malpractice,the plaintiff must show a deviation from a standard of care and a causal connection between the deviation and the injury.simmons garces.p roximate cause must be established by expert testimony to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.simmons,at.where the medical expert testimony of the causal connection is contingent,speculative or merely possible,proximate cause is not established.knauerhaze nelson,d.
here,the opinions of warren and brofman conflicted.brofman,who testified over a period as plaintiff adverse witness,on direct examination by defendants and on by plaintiff denied deviating from the standard of care of a pulmonologist performing a thoracentesis.warren,a thoracic surgeon and not a pulmonologist,said his review of documents showed brofman deviated from a pulmonologist standard of care.it was the jury role to resolve these conflicts,assess the credibility of brofman and warren and determine the weight to be given to each doctor testimony.see maple,at.the jury resolved these matter in defendants favor.this conclusion was not arbitrary or unreasonable in light of the conflicting evidence before the jury.a new trial was not justified on the grounds that the jury conclusion was against the manifest weight of the evidence.see maple,at.
we turn to the question of whether plaintiff was entitled to a new trial because trial court errors rendered the trial unfair.plaintiff cites tonarelli gibbons,d,to argue that a new trial is required where the accumulation of evidentiary and instructional errors causes prejudice.
a new trial should be granted where the trial court rulings in the course of the trial result in prejudicial error.herington illinois power,d.a reviewing court should reverse an order for a new trial and reinstate the jury verdict where errors were insubstantial,not prejudicial to the movant or insufficient to justify a new trial.lagoni holiday inn midway,d.the mere fact that multiple errors are present does not in and of itself result in prejudicial error.first national bank of la grange glen oaks hospital medical center,d.
we review in turn the errors raised in plaintiff posttrial motion and on appeal.each question is subject to its own standard of review.redmond socha.we first consider whether the trial court erred in denying plaintiff request for ipi civil as to hall.this is the or instruction.wilkerson pittsburgh corning,d.the instruction allows the jury to infer that any evidence not offered but within the control of a party is adverse to that party.first national bank of la grange lowrey,d.the decision to grant or deny a party request for this instruction rests with the sound discretion of the court.schaffner chicago north western transportation.
defendants argue that ipi civil was properly denied because hall was equally available to both parties.defendants claim they had a reasonable excuse for hall surgery schedule and travel plans.defendants rely on chiricosta,d,for the proposition that a party request for an instruction should be granted only if she clearly is entitled to it.defendants cite bulger chicago transit authority,d,to argue that a new trial on the basis of jury instructions is appropriate only where a party right to a fair trial has been seriously prejudiced.bulger,d at.
plaintiff argues she was entitled to the instruction under the criteria established by our supreme court in schaffner.this instruction should be given when the missing witness was under the control of the party adversely affected by the instruction the witness could have been produced by reasonable diligence the witness was not equally available to the party who requested the instruction a reasonably prudent person would have produced the witness if he or she believed the testimony would be favorable and there was no reasonable excuse for failing to produce the witness.schaffner,at.
here,the trial court refused the instruction based on its conclusion both parties had an obligation to produce the doctor,nobody produced him.an analysis of the schaffner factors shows hall was under defendants control to the extent that they had named him as a controlled expert witness,but plaintiff,with reasonable diligence,could have obtained hall appearance by subpoena under rule.this rule provides that the missing witness of one party can be compelled by another party to appear and testify at trial.section a of the rule provides any witness shall respond to any lawful subpoena of which he or she has actual knowledge.a.a subpoena is an order of the court,not an overture by a party,and it requires compliance.camco,lowery,d,citing people ex rel.fisher carey.rule can be used by an injured plaintiff to produce a witness at trial even if the witness had been within the defendant control and disclosed by the defendant in discovery.collier avis rent a car system,d.
here,a reasonably prudent plaintiff would have produced hall by subpoena if she believed hall would discredit brofman defense and support her complaint.whatever hall said in his deposition,both parties knew it in.plaintiff could have mounted the effort to subpoena hall in the four years between his deposition and this trial.although defendants were obligated to produce hall,they presented a plausible excuse for his absence on the day his testimony was expected and notified the court in advance that they were prepared to close without hall,if necessary.based on the criteria stated in schaffner,the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give the instruction.
plaintiff relies on bargman economics laboratory,d,and ciborowski philip dressler associates,d,to argue that the court refusal to give the instruction,among other errors,warranted a new trial.
in bargman,the trial court erred in refusing the instruction where the witness was in the defendant control and no reasonable excuse was given for failing to call him.bargman,d at.in ciborowski,the defendant failure to call a witness under its control warranted the instruction despite the fact that the plaintiff could have subpoenaed the witness.the court relied on mccormick,evidence,at when it would be natural under the circumstances for a party to call a particular witness his adversary may use this failure as the basis for invoking an adverse inference.ciborowski,d at,quoting biel wolff,d.
in both bargman and ciborowski,the court found that the propriety of the instruction depends on the circumstances at hand.bargman,d at,ciborowski,d at.here,the circumstances differ from those in bargman and ciborowski.defendants here consistently maintained that hall was in their control but unavailable to testify at the trial because of his surgery schedule and travel plans.plaintiff did not attempt to rebut this excuse.
the next issue also pertains to jury instructions.defendants argue that the trial court correctly instructed the jury to disregard plaintiff prejudicial references to hall in her opening statement and of brofman.plaintiff responds that defendants can not complain on appeal of plaintiff references to hall because they failed to object at trial.
to preserve an issue for appeal,a party must object at trial and raise the issue in a posttrial motion.people enoch.an issue is preserved for review where it was included in a response to an opponent posttrial motion.vaughn speaker,d.the transcript here shows defense counsel objected during when plaintiff counsel asked brofman if he would have a problem when hall testified to his deviation from the standard of care.defendants again raised the issue of plaintiff prejudicial references to hall in their written response to plaintiff motion for a new trial.defendants claim that plaintiff made prejudicial statements was preserved for review.
we believe that plaintiff conduct in revealing hall alleged testimony to the jury in her opening statement and of brofman further supports the conclusion that she is not entitled to a new trial on the basis of jury instructions.a defendant is entitled to a trial free from a plaintiff improper remarks that draw attention to the defendant failure to call witnesses or otherwise attempt to shift the burden of proof to the defendant.people thomas d.the instruction should not be given where,as here,prejudicial references to the missing witness were made during the trial.wilkerson,d at.questions that presume facts not in evidence are prejudicial because the jury may assume the witness,if called,would have admitted the alleged facts.bartimus paxton community hospital,d.where a party has injected error into the proceedings it is manifestly unfair for that party to be granted a new trial.see mcmath katholi.for all of these reasons,plaintiff references to hall militate against the jury instruction.
we now turn to the last question pertaining to jury the trial court erred in telling the jury to disregard plaintiff references to hall.defendants claim the instruction was needed to cure plaintiff introduction of inadmissible evidence,including hearsay evidence that hall said brofman breached the standard of care of brofman that exceeded the scope of direct and improper impeachment with an impermissible hypothetical question.
as noted,instructing the jury rests within the sound discretion of the court.schaffner,at.the court has a duty to instruct the jury to disregard improper evidence,such as hearsay.people rice,d.in general,can not exceed the scope of direct examination.anderson human rights comm n,d.although a party is not entitled to present her theory of the case through anderson,d at,hypothetical questions are permissible leonardi loyola university of chicago.the party may use facts in evidence that conform to her theory of the case.leonardi,at.it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to allow a hypothetical question,although the supporting evidence has not already been adduced,if the interrogating counsel gives assurance it will be produced and connected later.leonardi,at.evidence admitted upon an assurance that it will later be connected up should be excluded upon failure to establish the connection.leonardi,at.
here,the trial court properly instructed the jury to disregard plaintiff reference to hall on of brofman.plaintiff question,when hall comes in here later today and tells us that you violated the standard of care,was not stated as a hypothetical but as a fact.as such,the question was improper as hearsay and as beyond the scope of direct examination.but even if the question were a proper hypothetical,the trial court correctly instructed the jury to disregard the references after plaintiff failed to produce hall and connect the hypothetical to admissible evidence.see leonardi,at.
the next is
