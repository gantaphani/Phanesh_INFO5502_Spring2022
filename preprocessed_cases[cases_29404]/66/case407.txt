we conclude kish refusal to be deposed reasonably may be construed as a concession his claims for breach of contract and legal malpractice lacked merit.consequently,the dismissal reflected adversely on the merits of the case and constituted a favorable termination for the purpose of initiating a claim for malicious prosecution.we further conclude ross demonstrated that a reasonable trier of fact could find both of the other elements of malicious prosecution,lack of probable cause and malice.because ross produced evidence sufficient to establish a probability of prevailing on his claim for malicious prosecution,we affirm the denial of kish special motion to strike that cause of action.
factual and procedural background 
resolution of the real estate matter and ross suit for unpaid fees.
kish sold a residence in san diego in february for.ten months after the sale,the buyers found a water borne fungus,poria incrassate,had damaged the home.the buyers sought damages of to from kish,the realtor,an exterminator and a home inspector.the buyers alleged kish falsely represented there had been no prior water damage to the home when,in fact,kish personally had filed two claims with his homeowner insurance carrier for water damage in.kish hired ross to represent him at a mediation of the buyers claim and paid ross in fees prior to the mediation.the dispute was resolved at the mediation with kish voluntarily contributing toward a settlement.
ross subsequently sued kish in small claims court for unpaid legal fees and costs incurred in the real estate matter in the amount of.
kish sues ross for breach of contract and legal malpractice.
after ross filed the small claims action,kish,acting in propria persona,sued ross for breach of contract and legal malpractice alleging ross orally promised the fees in the real estate matter would not exceed.kish alleged he paid ross and,on the eve of the mediation,ross demanded an additional,which kish also paid.kish claimed ross was ill prepared for the mediation in that he failed to file a brief,failed to retain an expert in time for the hearing and failed to seek a defense under kish homeowner policy.ross dismissed the small claims action and filed a for the unpaid fees in kish breach of contract and legal malpractice case.
when ross noticed kish deposition,kish requested a continuance but failed to provide an alternate date.ross sought an order to compel the deposition and,on may,the trial court granted the request and ordered kish to pay monetary sanctions.kish refused to be deposed,assertedly on the advice of new york attorney jeremiah sheehan,until sheehan had been admitted pro hac vice to represent kish.twice ross successfully opposed sheehan motions to be admitted in this case.
ross opposed sheehan first request for admission pro hac vice,heard on may,because sheehan had not associated an active member of the california state bar and the notice of the motion was defective.ross also alleged an order granting the motion would reward sheehan unauthorized practice of law in that he previously had represented himself as kish attorney at the hearing on ross demurrer to kish first amended complaint.sheehan also filed a settlement memorandum and checked in with the clerk at a settlement conference as counsel for kish.ross alleged that although judge charles stoll admonished sheehan regarding the unauthorized practice of law at the settlement hearing,sheehan subsequently engaged in numerous acts of unauthorized practice of law.
the trial court denied sheehan request for admission pro hac vice on the grounds the motion lacked adequate notice,sheehan failed to associate local counsel of record and a search of the records of the new york state bar association revealed sheehan registration status was delinquent and thus he was not an attorney in good standing in new york.
when sheehan paid his dues,he sought reconsideration.ross opposed this motion on the additional ground that sheehan was,in fact,a resident of california.ross asserted sheehan and kish were codefendants in a boundary dispute involving the residence they shared in california.
on june,the trial court again denied the motion.that same date,the trial court granted ross request for discovery sanctions,ordered kish to appear immediately for his deposition and warned that failure to comply would result in dismissal.
on july,ross filed a request for dismissal as a terminating sanction for kish refusal to comply with the previous order for his deposition.kish failed to oppose the request and failed to appear at the hearing on july.the trial court found t here are repeated failures to comply with court orders regarding discovery.since no opposition papers were filed,there is no showing that the plaintiff intends to comply with his discovery obligations.in light of this lack of showing that the plaintiff will comply with discovery,no sanctions less than terminating sanctions appear appropriate.
ross sues kish for malicious prosecution and abuse of process kish special motion to strike.
following dismissal of the breach of contract and legal malpractice action,ross sued kish for malicious prosecution and abuse of process,alleging kish lawsuit had been filed to obtain leverage against ross in the claim for unpaid fees.
kish filed a special motion to strike ross complaint for malicious prosecution and abuse of process.kish alleged ross could not demonstrate a favorable termination of kish lawsuit or that it had been instituted with malice and without probable cause.in support of the motion,kish declared that,p rior to the small claims trial taking place,i told one of my skin care clients,john bartholomay,a massachusetts lawyer,of the circumstances surrounding the real estate matter and the small claims case against me for unpaid legal fees.bartholomay advised me that i had a valid legal malpractice claim against ross.kish further declared he and sheehan were involved in a personal relationship from june of through august of.during that time,sheehan provided kish legal services as part of a living agreement between them.kish averred he instituted the legal malpractice action against ross at the direction,advice and insistence of sheehan.kish asserted that,f rom the advice i received from sheehan and from bartholomay i thought i had a good case.further,sheehan advised kish not to appear for his deposition until sheehan had been admitted pro hac vice.
in opposition to the special motion to strike,ross declared it was undisputed at the mediation of the real estate matter that kish failed to disclose to the buyer of his property the prior insurance claims or water intrusions that precipitated those insurance claims.moreover,the buyer claim in the real estate matter was bolstered by evidence of a comprehensive loss underwriting exchange report obtained by the buyer counsel prior to making a claim against kish,which report showed two prior insurance claims for water intrusion in by kish.citation.on april,kish hired ross to assist him in resolving the case in mediation.not knowing what it would cost to prepare for mediation or if mediation would even result in a resolution,and there being a possibility that the case could proceed to arbitration or litigation,there was never any discussion regarding a cap or limit on attorney fees.kish executed a retainer agreement with ross whereby kish agreed to pay ross an hour.the retainer agreement estimated ross fee for handling the real estate matter would be plus through mediation only.
with respect to the merits of the legal malpractice claim,ross declared that w ith kish full knowledge,consent and agreement to fund,he hired experts to evaluate the buyers claim.specifically,ross hired dan baxter of environmental analysis associates,an expert in mold and fungus,gary dresser of harbor pest control,to identify and evaluate the extent of the poria incrassata,and bob zoller of south pacific construction,a licensed general building contractor,to estimate the cost of repairs.ross further declared that on may,ross attended an inspection of the property with the experts.although kish was invited to attend the inspection,he chose not to.following the inspection,the experts issued reports of their findings,copies of which were provided to kish on june.
ross evaluated the expert opinions and concluded they would be detrimental to kish.ross declared such expert evidence could have been used against kish in the mediation rather than to his benefit i decided it was in kish best interests not to present any expert evidence at the mediation kish and i discussed this strategy prior to the mediation and kish agreed.ross further declared that in a telephone conversation on or about july,kish told ross he wanted the case settled at mediation.
with respect to kish claim ross committed legal malpractice in not pursuing a declaratory relief action against kish homeowner insurance carrier,ross declared he was not hired to pursue such a claim and the retainer agreement reflects he was hired to handle a claim against kish by the buyers of his real property.additionally,kish filed his own insurance claim on july,which was denied.
regarding the failure to file a mediation brief,ross declared such briefs are not mandatory and ross determined it would be more effective to discuss the facts of the case,as well as kish contentions and available defenses,in a telephone conference with the mediator prior to the mediation.ross thereafter gave an effective oral presentation that included exhibits at a mediation on july,in san diego,california.the mediation resulted in a negotiated settlement of payable to the buyers of kish san diego property,with kish agreeing to pay a mere.
prior to the settlement,ross discussed its terms and effect with kish and kish stated to ross that he understood the terms of the agreement and that he agreed to it.at the conclusion of the mediation,kish expressed to ross his relief that the matter had been settled,and how happy he was with the result.he thanked ross for getting him off so incredibly cheaply.
ross thereafter sued kish in small claims court for legal fees and costs incurred in the real estate matter in the amount of,which included paid to one of the experts and,which represented kish share of the mediator fee.
ross declared that,in response to the small claims action for unpaid fees and costs,kish filed the retaliatory legal malpractice action.fn.omitted.kish legal malpractice action resulted in a judgment being entered in ross s favor following the court dismissal of kish complaint and after an evidentiary hearing on ross for unpaid legal fees.citation.
the trial court granted kish special motion to strike the abuse of process claim but denied the motion as to the malicious prosecution claim,thereby permitting that cause of action against kish to proceed.the trial court found there was evidence which,if credited by the finder of fact,could establish each element of the malicious prosecution claim.kish appeals this ruling 
contentions 
kish contends the special motion to strike should have been granted with respect to the malicious prosecution cause of action because ross can not demonstrate any of the three elements of malicious prosecution.specifically,kish claims ross can not show a favorable termination of kish lawsuit for breach of contract and legal malpractice because the case was dismissed as a sanction for discovery violations.kish further asserts ross can not demonstrate the lawsuit was brought without probable cause because sheehan and bartholomay advised kish the case had merit and the action survived ross demurrer.finally,kish claims ross can not show the lawsuit was initiated with malice.
discussion 
legal principals applicable to a special motion to strike.
section,subdivision b,provides that a cause of action arising from a constitutionally protected right of free speech is subject to a special motion to strike unless the plaintiff establishes the probability he or she will prevail on the claim,subd.b.in ruling on such a motion,the trial court must first determine whether the defendant has met the burden to show the activity underlying the cause of action is constitutionally protected.equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,d.if the defendant establishes this,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show a probability of prevailing on the cause of action.ibid.it is settled that a claim for malicious prosecution is subject to a special motion to strike under section.jarrow formulas,lamarche,supra,cal th at,d,chavez mendoza th,d.consequently,the only issue to be determined on this appeal is whether ross carried his burden to show a probability of prevailing at trial,subd.b.
in ruling on a special motion to strike,the court does not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations.citations.kashian harriman th,d.rather,once the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing of facts which would support a judgment in his or her favor,the court will consider the defendant opposing evidence,but only to determine if it defeats the plaintiff showing as a matter of law.citation.ibid.the process the court uses in determining whether the plaintiff has shown a probability of prevailing on the merits is similar to the process used in determining motions for nonsuit,directed verdict or summary judgment.paulus bob lynch ford,th,d computerxpress,jackson th,d kyle carmon th,d.i n order to establish the requisite probability of prevailing citation,the plaintiff need only have stated and substantiated a legally sufficient claim.citations.put another way,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.citations.navellier sletten cal th,d.if the plaintiff meets its burden the motion must be denied.mattel,luce,forward,hamilton scripps th,d.
we review de novo a trial court ruling on a motion to strike under section by conducting an independent review of the entire record.citations.paulus bob lynch ford,supra,th at,d hms capital,lawyers title th,d computerxpress,jackson,supra,th at,d.
ross has shown a probability of prevailing on his malicious prosecution action.
in order for ross to prove that kish lawsuit for breach of contract and legal malpractice action constituted malicious prosecution,ross must show a termination of the lawsuit in ross favor,lack of probable cause in bringing or continuing to prosecute the action and malice.zamos stroud,supra,cal th at,d.we examine each of these elements in turn.
favorable termination.
the favorable termination element of a malicious prosecution action is established by showing that termination of the underlying lawsuit reflect ed on the merits of the action and the plaintiff innocence of the misconduct alleged.citations.sierra club foundation graham th,d.w hen the underlying action is terminated in some manner other than by a judgment on the merits,the court examines the record to see if the disposition reflects the opinion of the court or the prosecuting party that the action would not succeed.associates,shapiro th,d,quoting sierra club foundation graham,supra,at,d eells rosenblum th,d pender radin th,d.should a conflict arise as to the circumstances of the termination,the determination of the reasons underlying the dismissal is a question of fact.fuentes berry th,d.
kish contends the underlying action was not terminated in ross favor because it was dismissed for failure to comply with discovery orders and thus does not reflect on the merits of the action.ross responds the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of the case indicate a concession on the part of kish that the claim lacked merit and thus is the equivalent of a failure to prosecute,which constitutes a favorable termination.minasian sapse d.
it appears ross has the better argument.the evidence submitted by ross in opposition to the special motion to strike permitted the reasonable inference that kish allegations of breach of contract and legal malpractice were groundless.
kish claim for breach of contract was based on kish assertion that ross orally promised the fees in the real estate matter would not exceed.however,this claim is directly contradicted by the written retainer agreement between kish and ross,which stated ross would charge kish per hour and estimated the total fee for handling the real estate matter at plus through mediation.the glaring inconsistency between kish claim and the written retainer agreement suggests ross did not orally promise the fee for handling the real estate matter would not exceed.also,given that the real estate matter might not have settled at mediation,attorneys fees far in excess of reasonably would be anticipated had the matter proceeded to litigation.thus,the claim that ross orally promised the fee for handling the real estate matter would not exceed was not credible.
kish claim for legal malpractice fares no better.this claim is based on kish allegation ross was ill prepared for the mediation in that he failed to retain experts in time for the hearing and failed to file a brief.kish also complained that ross failed to seek a defense under kish homeowner policy.however,ross refuted kish claim he failed to obtain expert opinions in the real estate matter by declaring he hired three experts and obtained a report from each.further,kish was aware of the retention of these experts,consented to their hiring and received a copy of their reports.ross explained he did not present the opinions of the experts because they would have been harmful to kish case.ross also averred he discussed this strategy with kish and kish agreed with it.regarding the failure to file a mediation brief,ross declared such briefs are not mandatory and he instead made an oral presentation in advance of the mediation,which fully advised the mediator of kish view of the dispute.
with respect to kish assertion ross should have filed a declaratory relief action to obtain a defense under kish homeowner policy,the retainer agreement makes no mention of a declaratory relief action or insurance claim but indicates kish retained ross to defend a claim by the buyers of kish real property.in any event,according to ross declaration,kish filed his own insurance claim which was denied.moreover,kish claim he hired ross to pursue a declaratory relief action,in addition to handling the mediation of the real estate matter,is undermined by kish assertion ross orally promised the fees would not exceed.
further reflecting the lack of merit in kish claim of legal malpractice is the result of the mediation.the overall settlement amount of was low compared to the to claim against kish,and kish contributed only toward the settlement.also,kish voluntarily participated in the settlement.these facts suggest kish could not prevail on a claim against ross for legal malpractice in that he can not show he would have obtained a more favorable outcome but for ross alleged errors or omissions.marshak ballesteros th,d thompson halvonik th,d.
regarding kish assertion the dismissal of his lawsuit did not reflect on the merits because he relied on the advice of sheehan in refusing to attend the deposition,a reasonable fact finder could reject this defense given the personal relationship between sheehan and kish.moreover,attendance at a deposition is a matter exclusively within kish control.the record suggests kish was a relatively sophisticated litigant,given that he appeared in propria persona in the lawsuit against ross and he was involved in other lawsuits.additionally,kish was familiar with the facts of the real estate matter and thus was aware the claims against ross for breach of contract and legal malpractice were not tenable.
given these circumstances,it is reasonable to conclude kish refusal to submit to a deposition was a concession the claims for breach of contract and legal malpractice lacked merit.in other words,kish conduct suggests kish knew ross did not commit malpractice or breach of contract in handling the real estate matter.thus,the dismissal of kish lawsuit for refusing to be deposed,like the dismissal for failure to prosecute in minasian sapse,supra,d,reflects adversely on the merits of the action based on the natural assumption that one does not simply abandon a meritorious action once instituted.consequently,the dismissal must be seen as a termination favorable to ross.
kish argues minasian sapse,supra,d at,is inapplicable because kish actively pursued the claim against ross in that he and sheehan communicated with ross counsel,kish answered interrogatories,sheehan attempted to represent kish at a settlement conference,kish successfully opposed ross demurrer,sheehan sought to appear pro hac vice to represent kish and kish briefly retained two different attorneys to represent him in the action against ross 
however,notwithstanding kish participation in the lawsuit,he defied discovery orders and failed to appear for his deposition,failed to make any showing he would comply in the future,failed to appear at the motion for terminating sanctions and failed to file any opposition to the motion.although kish had counsel of record at the time of termination,kish failed to seek reconsideration or appeal the ruling.thus,the factual distinctions between this case and minasian do not prevent application of the reasonable inference that one does not abandon a meritorious cause of action.
kish claims several published appellate opinions mandate a finding there was no favorable termination in this case namely,zeavin lee d.de la pena wolfe d.pattiz minye th,d.however,these cases are distinguishable.
in zeavin lee,supra,d,the underlying action was dismissed because the plaintiff refused to answer discovery or cooperate with her lawyer.zeavin held dismissal of the action based on the plaintiff failure to respond to discovery was not a favorable termination as to the plaintiff attorney.id.at.zeavin noted,i t would be beyond law or reason to conclude that an attorney who in good faith files and diligently prosecutes an action could later be held liable for malicious prosecution solely because that attorney client later unilaterally,and for reasons known only to herself,refuses to make discovery.id.at.
in de la pena,a similar situation occurred.de la pena held a concession by an attorney client that a prior suit lacked merit was not binding on an attorney who substituted into the case after the plaintiff motion to dismiss had been granted.de la pena wolfe,supra,d at.
in pattiz minye,supra,th,d,the plaintiff daughter refused to cooperate in discovery and the case was dismissed.pattiz found the dismissal was not sufficient to support a malicious prosecution cause of action because the failure o
