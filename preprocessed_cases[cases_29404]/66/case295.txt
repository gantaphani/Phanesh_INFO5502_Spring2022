lee,matson,and robert wilton pryor not a party in this suit developed large pore hemofiltration lphf technology for the treatment of sepsis,shock,acute renal failure,multiple organ system failure,and systemic inflammatory response diseases.the filtration technology treats these conditions and diseases by continuously removing blood from the body,filtering excessive toxins,and continuously returning the filtered blood to the body.compl.the inventors hired fulbright to secure patent protection for the lphf technology.on november,patent patent,entitled,hemofiltration of toxic disease,issued with lee,matson,and pryor as the named inventors.the inventors assigned their intellectual property rights to immunocept 
immunocept subsequently hired patent attorney thomas felger,partner at baker botts,to prosecute additional applications based on the lphf technology.felger reviewed the patent and met with immunocept in to discuss,inter alia,independent claim,the claim at issue in the malpractice suit.felger also reviewed the file history of the patent as late as february.

during the course of due diligence,j j patent attorneys discovered that the patent suffered from a fatal flaw,namely the transition phrase consisting of in claim j j patent attorneys did not think that the claimed invention would provide adequate protection from competing methods.compl.therefore,on april,therakos terminated discussions with immunocept.
after immunocept discussed the claim scope issue with fulbright,the parties entered into a tolling agreement that ran from march,to april.the parties agree that the critical date for the statute of limitations analysis is march.
on may,immunocept sued fulbright in the western district of texas for legal malpractice under texas state law,alleging as the sole jurisdictional basis.fulbright moved for summary judgment,arguing that the malpractice claim is barred by the statute of limitations and that damages are too speculative as a matter of law.on march,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of fulbright on both independent grounds.

under christianson colt industries operating,jurisdiction extends to any case in which a complaint establishes either that federal patent law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law,in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the claims,d.the supreme court later rephrased the christianson test as a determination of whether a claim necessarily raise s a stated federal issue,actually disputed and substantial,which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.grable sons metal,darue eng g,d.because legal malpractice is a state law claim,we must determine whether it satisfies the second part of christianson in view of the federalism concerns of grable.we conclude that it does.
immunocept complaint alleges,as the only cause of action,attorney malpractice,which under texas state law requires proof of duty,breach,causation,and damages.see peeler hughes luce,stating the elements of a malpractice cause of action.immunocept alleges as the sole source of attorney error a claim drafting mistake that provided inadequate patent protection and could allow competitors to copy the claimed methods without infringing the patent by simply adding another element.compl.thus,the alleged attorney error narrowed the scope of the patent.
because it is the sole basis of negligence,the claim drafting error is a necessary element of the malpractice cause of action.as such,there is no way immunocept can prevail without addressing claim scope.the parties,however,dispute whether there was a drafting mistake.therefore,if determining claim scope involves a substantial question of federal law that passes the federalism muster of grable,there is jurisdiction over the malpractice claim under both christianson and grable.

because patent claim scope defines the scope of patent protection,see johnson johnston assocs.serv,en banc,we surely consider claim scope to be a substantial question of patent law.as a determination of patent infringement serves as the basis of jurisdiction over related state law claims,so does a determination of claim scope.after all,claim scope determination is the first step of a patent infringement analysis.see lacks,mckechnie vehicle components usa,describing the two steps of an infringement determination.
