the administrative hearing 
handyman contested the citation.an alj heard the matter.both sides submitted briefs and presented witnesses.
handyman hearing brief disputed all the alleged violations.
as to item,handyman maintained myhres had waived cancellation rights in writing so as to authorize work to start immediately.
as to item,handyman maintained that the contract showed handyman full licensed business name,along with the shorter form handyman connection.
as to item,handyman maintained that gary bon,the alleged unregistered home improvement salesperson,came within two statutory exceptions to the registration requirement the exception for a bona fide service repairperson who is in the employ of a licensed contractor and whose repair or service call is limited to the service,repair,or emergency repair initially requested by the buyer of the service,subd.b and the purported exception for a person qualifying for a contractor license in his own right,subd.b

the decision 
after the hearing,the alj filed a proposed decision upholding the citation,which the board adopted without change.
factual findings 
the registrar of contractors issued the citation at issue to handyman on january,charging violations of sections,subdivision a,and.
at all relevant times,handyman was a licensed general contractor.
on march,handyman entered into a home improvement contract with the myhreses,under which handyman was to provide labor for the installation of hardwood flooring in the master bedroom and a hallway,at a total price of no more than,and as low as on april,handyman purported to enter into a contract with the myhreses for the same job on the same terms 
in early,the myhreses decided they wanted to replace carpeting in their master bedroom and a hallway with hardwood flooring.they bought the flooring,intending to install it themselves,but did not.after receiving an advertisement from handyman in the mail,they called handyman about the project.it was arranged that gary bon,a licensed,individual,independent contractor,would come to the myhres home to discuss the project.he did so on march,then contacted handyman and arrived at the price range shown on the contract.
the contract,titled labor estimate,initially served as such it indicated it had been prepared by bon on march,described the work to be done as install hardwood flooring master bed room and hallway,and gave the prices indicated above plus labor cost,a sum initialed by bon and forrest myhres.
however,the document also had a section titled acceptance of proposal,which said the specifications and conditions are satisfactory and are hereby accepted.you are authorized to do the work as specified.payment will be made upon completion.bon and forrest myhres signed immediately below these words.
viewing the labor estimate in its entirety,a reasonable person would conclude,as the myhreses did,that it became a binding contract once executed.consistent with this conclusion,the document also contains the words make checks payable to handyman connection,a guarantee on the back,and a notice required by section which begins state law requires anyone who contracts to do construction work to be licensed if the total price of the job is or more including labor and materials.
on april,bon returned to the myhres home to begin work.at that time he had myhres sign the purported contract the agreement,which had substantially more standard terms and notices and bore the words contract.
the real contract the labor estimate did not comply with the provisions of civil code section,as charged in item of the citation.as a home improvement construction contract,it was required by statute to give the buyers notice of their right to cancel within three business days,but it did not.the purported contract entered into on april did contain this notice and related matters among its standard terms.however,its explanation of the buyer right did not conform to civil code section.
the contract did not use handyman licensed business name,as charged in item of the citation.it used only the appellation handyman connection,not handyman connection of sacramento,the purported contract of april indicates that handyman connection is a dba of handyman connection of sacramento,it also did not contain the name set forth on handyman license however,the correct licensed name is printed below the line for handyman signature.
handyman employed an unregistered home improvement salesperson,as charged in item of the citation.gary bon,who was not registered,acted as a home improvement salesperson for handyman he sold home improvement goods and services,was an agent for handyman,and negotiated the contract.
the contract failed to comply with the statutory requirements enumerated in item of the citation.the later purported contract could not remedy the deficiencies of the real contract because it was produced days after that contract.
the civil penalties assessed in the citation,totaling,are fair and reasonable.all are in the category of minimum penalties.
legal conclusions 
factual finding failure to provide required notice of right to cancel constitutes cause to deny handyman appeal of item in the citation.handyman argued that the purported contract dated april,was a contract executed in connection with the making of emergency or immediate necessity repairs or services that are necessary for the immediate protection of persons or real or personal property,to which this requirement for notice does not apply.this argument fails because finding does not involve the purported contract.but even if it did,there was no emergency or immediate necessity as of april.therefore,handyman contention that the myhreses waived cancellation rights in writing is irrelevant.it is also irrelevant and unnecessary to find whether a writing signed by myhres constitutes a valid waiver statement under civil code section however,under that provision a waiver is required only in connection with emergency repairs or services.
factual finding use of wrong namestyle constitutes cause to deny handyman appeal as to item of the citation.as this finding concerns only the real contract,it is unnecessary to decide whether the purported contract also is in violation.
factual finding use of unregistered home improvement salesperson constitutes cause to deny handyman appeal as to item of the citation.handyman admits that gary bon was a home improvement salesperson,and the statutory exemptions from the registration requirement on which it relies do not apply to him.
the exemption for a qualifying person,as defined in section,subd.b does not apply.in the context of the license law,this expression means a natural person whose knowledge and experience provide the basis for licensing another natural person or another organizational entity.it does not mean a natural person who provided the experience and knowledge necessary for qualifying his own license.italics added.though a licensed contractor,bon was not the qualifying person for handyman license.therefore his license did not exempt him from the requirement to register as a salesperson when working as such for handyman.
the other exemption claimed by handyman,for a bona fide service repairperson who is in the employ of a licensed contractor and whose repair or service call is limited to the service,repair,or emergency repair initially requested by the buyer of the service,subd.b,also does not apply.bon performed an installation service,not a repair service.
factual finding failure to comply with enumerated provisions of constitutes cause to deny handyman appeal as to item of the citation.
factual finding justifies the civil penalties assessed.
handyman constitutional arguments regarding the interpretation of section would be deferred to the consideration of an appellate court.
the writ petition 
handyman filed a verified petition for peremptory writ of administrative mandamus in the superior court.its supporting points and authorities asserted that the trial court was required to apply the standard of review because the board decision involved handyman fundamental vested rights.the attorney general response disputed both points.
the trial court statement of decision 
the trial court issued the following statement of decision upholding the board order 
petitioner is challenging a citation imposed against it for certain violations of the business and professions code.
the first question is whether or not exhibit of the administrative record,referred to by the alj as contract,the document titled labor estimate dated march,is a contract requiring compliance with the contractors law.i find that this document is a contract.whether or not the second document,referred to by the alj as contract,exhibit of the administrative record,is also a contract is irrelevant to this determination.
both documents were negotiated by gary bon on behalf of petitioner.gary bon is not a registered home improvement salesperson.thus,the next question is whether bon comes within any of the exceptions set forth in section,subd.b.
s ection,subd.b provides an exception for a qualifying person,as defined in section.the language of this provision in section does not specifically state that this exception is for a qualifying person for the particular home improvement contract or involved in the transaction.but this is the only logical reading of this provision.petitioner argues that bon is licensed as a glazier,and thus,that is sufficient for this exception to apply.i disagree.it is not reasonable to interpret this provision to exempt anyone who has any kind of a license from the requirements of registering as a home improvement salesperson.the intent of this law is to protect the public with regard to home improvement salespersons.the l egislature wanted there to be an adequate identification of the salesperson on the contract,namely a registration number.a license for something else does not provide the same kind of protection.while bon may or may not be a fine person,his being licensed as a glazier does not identify him in any way as a home improvement salesperson.the qualifying person referred to in section refers to the person who qualifies the particular home improvement contractor involved in the transaction,namely the responsible managing officer or responsible managing employee of handyman connection of sacramento,who qualified the corporation for its contractor license.
petitioner next argues that bon is covered by the exception provided in section,subd.b.this argument is also not persuasive.bon was not acting as a bona fide service repairperson.the salient distinction is not so much what is a service versus what is a repair.the distinction is home improvement salesperson versus a service repairperson.here bon responded to a call for a home improvement,installing a wood floor.therefore,he is not exempted from registration.
having already found that contract is a contract for purposes of complying with the business and professions code,the court finds that there is substantial evidence to support the findings of all the other violations included in respondent decision.the decision is also supported by the findings.
petitioner also argues that the independent judgment test should apply here.again,i disagree.but,even applying that test,i also find that the findings are supported by the weight of the evidence.italics added.
the trial court thereafter entered judgment in favor of the board,from which handyman appeals.the judgment,like the statement of decision,cites both the substantial evidence test and the independent judgment test.
discussion 
istandard of review 
as it did below,handyman contends that the board findings must be reviewed under the standard because the board order infringes a fundamental vested right to engage in the occupation for which it is licensed.the attorney general replies,as below,that only review is required.neither party is entirely correct.
in an administrative mandamus case where a fundamental vested right is at stake,the trial court must exercise independent judgment and determine whether a preponderance of the evidence supports the administrative findings of fact.code civ,subd.c fukuda city of angels cal th,d,bixby pierno cal d,angelier state board of pharmacy th,fn,d vaill edmonds th,d.where a fundamental vested right is not at stake,the trial court need only determine whether substantial evidence supports those findings.code civ,subd.c steinsmith medical board th,d.and on appeal,whichever standard was used below,the standard of review of the trial court factual determination is whether the trial court findings are supported by substantial evidence.fukuda city of angels,supra,cal th at,d,yakov board of medical examiners cal d,drummey state bd.of funeral directors cal d,angelier state board of pharmacy,supra,th at,fn,d.
in a case such as this one,where the only sanction imposed is a revocation,suspension,or restriction of the petitioner fundamental vested right is implicated and the trial court is not authorized to exercise independent judgment on the evidence.steinsmith medical board,supra,th,d.
arguing the contrary,handyman asserts that the public nature of its disciplinary record means for five years,handyman will have a scarlet letter on its forehead.this assertion is not persuasive.the citation here does not prevent handyman from carrying on its trade or restrict it in any way.handyman may find business harder to come by with a public disciplinary record,as it speculates,but that is immaterial.as explained below,the purpose of the license law is to protect the public.the right to do business as a contractor can not entail a right to hide one infractions.
because these proceedings did not implicate any fundamental vested right,the trial court was required to determine only whether substantial evidence supported the board findings of fact.so far as the court applied the test to fact questions,it should not have done so but as it reached the same result under both tests,any error was harmless.on review,we likewise determine only whether substantial evidence supports the trial court findings of fact.
as to questions of law,however,we must exercise our independent judgment.silver los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority th,d home depot,contractors state license bd.th,d,superseded by statute on another point,as stated in denver darling,controlled environments construction,th,fn,d.some issues here turn on interpreting the license law.in applying independent judgment on this subject,we must give deference to the board interpretations,but not to the exclusion of other tools of statutory construction.t he binding power of an agency interpretation of a statute or regulation is contextual its power to persuade is both circumstantial and dependent on the presence or absence of factors that support the merit of the interpretation.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.
statutory construction 
before turning to handyman remaining contentions,we note a few basic rules of statutory construction and their relevance to the license law.
we begin with the fundamental rule that our primary task in construing a statute is to determine the legislature intent.citation.citation.the court turns first to the words themselves for the answer.citations.citation.when the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction and courts should not indulge in it.citation.the plain language of the statute establishes what was intended by the legislature.citation.citation.people statum cal th,d.
in focusing on the words of a statute,we give them their ordinary meaning.california school employees governing board cal th,d.where the words of the statute are clear,we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.citation.burden snowden cal th,d.if there is any ambiguity,we resolve it by examining the context in which the language appears and adopting the construction which best serves to harmonize the statute internally and with related statutes.hsu abbara cal th,d.the legislative history of a statute may be useful in this examination,fair employment housing com.cal d.so may the interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with implementing it.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th,d.
the intent of the license law is clear.the courts of this state have long emphasized that the law was enacted for the safety and protection of the public against imposition by persons inexperienced in contracting work,and for the prevention of fraudulent acts by contractors resulting in loss to subcontractors,materialmen,employees,and owners of structures.citation.home depot,contractors state license,supra,th,d.thus,if any ambiguity appears in the language of the license law,we must construe the law so as to effectuate the legislature intent to protect the public.
the alleged violations 
handyman contends that all four charges in the citation were wrongly sustained.we agree as to item wrong namestyle,but disagree as to the rest.
item failure to provide notice of right to cancel within three business days 
in a home solicitation contract the buyer agreement shall contain in immediate proximity to the space reserved for his or her signature a conspicuous statement in a size equal to at least bold type,as follows you,the buyer,may cancel this transaction at any time prior to midnight of the third business day after the date of this transaction.see the attached notice of cancellation form for an explanation of this right,subd.a.subdivision b of civil code section requires the agreement to contain on the first page,in a type size no smaller than that used in the body of the document,the seller name and address and the date the buyer signed the agreement.subdivision c of civil code section sets out the required format for the notice.
a home solicitation contract as used in civil code section means any contract,whether single or multiple,for the sale,lease,or rental of goods or services or both,made at other than appropriate trade premises in an amount of dollars or more,including any interest or service charges,subd.a.goods means tangible chattels bought for use primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,and including goods that,at the time of the sale or subsequently,are to be so affixed to real property as to become a part of the real property whether or not severable therefrom,subd.c.services means work,labor,and services,including,but not limited to,services furnished in connection with the repair,restoration,alteration,or improvement of residential premises,subd.d.
handyman does not dispute the document that the alj and the trial court found to be the labor estimate dated march,appendix a,post does not contain the required notice.handyman asserts,rather,that that document is not the contract in the myhres transaction,and that the real agreement dated april,with the statute handyman is wrong on both points.
the labor estimate is the binding contract in this case because it contains all the elements of a home solicitation contract and both parties performed in accordance with it therefore,it was required to inform the myhreses of their cancellation rights.but even if the subsequent agreement may be considered,it too fails to comply with civil code section because myhres purported waiver of notice is ineffectual.
the labor estimate appendix a,post 
it is essential to the existence of a contract that there should be.parties capable of contracting.their consent.a lawful object and.a sufficient cause or consideration.the labor estimate has all of these elements.it names the parties.under description it sets out the object of the contract and its consideration install hardwood flooring master bed room and hallway,square feet labor cost followed by the initials and.finally,under acceptance of proposal it sets out the parties consent the specifications and conditions are satisfactory and are hereby accepted.you are authorized to do the work as specified.payment will be made upon completion.below these words are the signatures of gary bon prepared by and forrest myhres approved by.nothing more was needed to create a binding contract,as the parties recognized myhres considered the myhreses contractually bound once they had signed the labor estimate,and bon returned to start work on handyman behalf without further negotiation 
though the later agreement adds matters omitted from the labor estimate,it does not change any term specified there.thus,when the agreement was executed,the parties had already entered into a home solicitation contract within the meaning of civil code section which did not contain the notice of cancellation rights required by civil code section.
the trial court correctly found that substantial evidence supported item of the citation.
the agreement 
handyman asserts that the agreement of april,does not violate civil code section because when myhres signed it she also wrote and signed a personal statement that authorized work to start immediately and expressly waived the myhreses right to cancel,pursuant to civil code section.this agreement does not aid handyman for two reasons.first,handyman violated section by entering into the contract of march,and this is so regardless of what is said a month later.second,while it is true that under the circumstances described in section a buyer may legally waive the right of cancellation,those circumstances did not exist here.thus,even if the agreement could properly be deemed part of the contract,handyman conduct would still not be exonerated.
sections to,inclusive,shall not apply to a contract that is initiated by the buyer and that is executed in connection with the making of emergency or immediate necessity repairs or services that are necessary for the immediate protection of persons or real or personal property,provided that the buyer furnishes the seller with a separate dated and signed personal statement describing the situation requiring immediate remedy and expressly acknowledging and waiving the right to cancel the sale within three business days,italics added.
a attachment to the agreement,titled authorization to start work,reads as follows one of the following statements must be handwritten by the customer to allow the handyman connection craftsman to begin work immediately.due to the emergency nature of the work,i hereby waive the recission sic period.or.it is my personal desire to start this work immediately and i waive the recission sic period.immediately afterward appears the following statement,handwritten,signed,and dated by myhres it is my personal desire to start this work immediately and i waive the recission sic period.
myhres statement does not satisfy civil code section because it does not describ e the situation requiring immediate remedy and because,in fact,no emergency existed.
myhres testified that bon gave her this form on april,and asked her to write out the second statement exactly as it appeared on the form.the words she wrote were not her words.
bon testified that handyman routinely provides him this form when he goes out on jobs.if a customer wants work to start immediately,bon is supposed to use the form before he starts the job.asked if it was just a matter of,quote,personal desire,he answered yes.
handyman chief executive officer ceo,mcgreevy testified that he approved the form.he admitted that civil code section does not contain the term personal desire,but explained i t was our belief that it can only be the consumer that would make the decision whether or not it was an immediate necessity,and so the personal desire to start the work immediately was just our way of having the consumer make that statement that it was their personal desire to start the job immediately and that would meet the immediate necessity language.
handyman repeats this argument on appeal,asserting that civil code section creates a subjective standard which depends only on the homeowner desires.to put it bluntly,this is nonsense.civil code section does not state that personal desire to start work immediately is sufficient to create an emergency or immediate necessity.nor does handyman cite any authority so construing the statute.
handyman asks us to rewrite section by inserting new language to make the statute serve a purpose at odds with the legislature express purpose.we may not do so.burden snowden,supra,cal th,d.
as a fallback position,handyman asserts that there was an emergency or immediate necessity because the myhreses removed carpeting and exposed the particle board underlayment to prepare for the installation job.according to handyman,i t was uncontroverted that the particle board underlayment was not intended as a walking surface and using it as a walking surface would cause damage to the particle board.this assertion was not uncontroverted.even if it had been,it was made by a witness without any expertise to opine on the subject.and even if uncontroverted and given by an expert,it would not establish emergency or immediate necessity within the meaning of civil code section.
handyman cites only to the testimony of its ceo,mcgreevy.however,mcgreevy is not individually licensed as a contractor,and his testimony does not reveal any relevant expertise thus his lay opinion deserves little weight.furthermore,myhres testified that there was no problem walking on the floor during the short time between the removal of the carpeting and the start of work.but most important,even if walking on the particle board indefinitely might have damaged or destroyed it in the long term,this would not establish an emergency or an immediate necessity to remedy the problem.construing these statutory terms in their ordinary sense california school employees governing board,supra,cal th,d,they do not include or ultimate problems.
therefore,even if the agreement and myhres personal statement could be considered as part of the contract,they would not show that handyman complied with the law.
item working out of namestyle 
acting in the capacity of a contractor under any license issued hereunder except a in the name of the licensee as set forth upon the license,constitutes a cause for disciplinary action.
handyman claims it complied with this provision because the agreement gives handyman full name as set forth on its license handyman connection of sacramento.the trial court disagreed,finding that only the real contract the labor estimate,which shows the firm name only as handyman connection,could be considered on this issue.
we conclude the trial court erred,but not for the reason handyman gives.rather,the information set out in the real contract,when considered in full,substantially complied with the statute.
section has not received much judicial construction.the case closest on point is asdourian araj cal d,asdourian.asdourian mainly addresses section,which requires a person seeking compensation for contracting work to prove he was a duly licensed contractor at all times during his performance however,asdourian also cites section,and its rationale applies to that provision as well.
as to section,asdourian,supra,cal d,held that substantial compliance is sufficient.therefore,the plaintiff,krikor asdourian,could obtain compensation for his work even though he used his own name in the transactions at issue rather than the business name on his contractor license artko,which was entirely different from his own name id.at.the policy behind section enforcement of the license law asdourian,at,was satisfied because at the time of the contracts the plaintiff firm held a valid license,which bore his name as the responsible managing party the license,which officially attested to his experience and qualifications,was effective throughout his performance and his competence and experience formed the basis of his firm license.if the license had been issued to the plaintiff in his own name,the situation would not have differed materially from the actual situation.id.at.thus,the discrepancy between the name the plaintiff used on the contracts and the name on his firm license was a technicality that could not defeat his right to compensation.id.at.
here,although the labor estimate bears only the name handyman connection,and not handyman connection of sacramento,it contains all the information about the name of the contractor needed to comply with the policy of the license law.as well as a short form of the business name,it gives the business address,telephone number,and license number.the name on the contract handyman connection was not a departure from but was rather an abbreviation of the contractor full legal name.it was as if a contract had said sears rather than sears roebuck and company,a customer checking on handyman legal status and qualifications would not have been misled by this information.and there is no evidence that handyman performance would have differed if its full business name had been printed on the labor estimate.in fact,that name more closely resembles the name on the contract than the plaintiff business name in asdourian,supra,cal d,resembled the personal name he used on his contracts.
like the court in asdourian,supra,cal d,we see section as in pari materia with section.therefore,we find that asdourian s reasoning applies to section.statutes in pari materia should be construed together.citation.long beach police officers city of long beach cal d.as in asdourian,the violation charged here amounted to a mere technicality,and upholding it would not serve the purpose of the license law.
the citation should not have been sustained as to item.because the penalty imposed below included for this alleged violation,remand to the board will be required.
item employing unregistered home improvement salesperson 
a home improvement contractor who employs a person to sell home improvement contracts while such person is not registered by the registrar as a home improvement salesman as provided in this article,is subject to disciplinary action.
it is undisputed that gary bon was not registered as a home improvement salesperson,although he acted as handyman agent in negotiating and executing the myhres project.however,handyman contends he came within two statutory exceptions to the registration requirement.handyman is wrong.
section provides as relevant 
a home improvement salesperson is a person employed by a home improvement contractor licensed under this chapter to solicit,sell,negotiate,or execute contracts for home improvements,or for the sale,installation or furnishing of home improvement goods or services,
b the following shall not be required to be registered as home improvement salespersons 
a qualifying person,as defined in section.
a bona fide service repairperson who is in the employ of a licensed contractor and whose repair or service call is limited to the service,repair,or emergency repair initially requested by the buyer of the service.italics added.
section,which forms part of article licensing of the license law,provides as relevant 
a the board shall require an applicant for a contractor license to show such degree of knowledge and experience in the classification applied for,and such general knowledge of the building,safety,health,and lien laws of the state and of the administrative principles of the contracting business as the board deems necessary for the safety and protection of the public 
b an applicant shall qualify in regard to his or her experience and knowledge in one of the following ways 
if an individual,he or she shall qualify by personal appearance or by the appearance of his or her responsible managing employee who is qualified for the same license classification as the classification being applied for.
if a corporation,or any other combination or organization,it shall qualify by the appearance of a responsible managing officer or responsible managing employee who is qualified for the same license classification as the classification being applied for.
the qualifying person exception 
handyman asserts that,as a licensed contractor,gary bon was a qualifying person under section,subdivision b.we disagree.handyman interpretation of the key words as defined in section ignores a significant part of the statute and its implementing regulations.handyman interpretation would also introduce an absurdity into the license law and controvert its purpose.
when interpreting the term qualifying person,the obvious question is qualifying for what nothing in section,standing alone,answers that question.to do so we must examine the provision together with section.
handyman asserts that section states in pertinent part b an applicant shall qualify in regard to his or her experience and knowledge in one of the following ways if an individual,he or she shall qualify by personal appearance bolding and underscoring added by handyman.based only on this portion of section,handyman concludes that because bon qualified for his license in this way,he comes within section,subdivision b we disagree.
first,handyman ignores section,subdivision a,which explains what an applicant seeks to qualify for and how his knowledge and experience qualify him the board shall require an applicant to show such degree of knowledge and experience in the classification applied for as the board deems necessary for the safety and protection of the public.italics added.as noted as handyman has omitted to mention in all its pleadings throughout this has applied for and received a license only in the specialty classification of glazing,tit.
we think the legislature exempted a qualifying person,as defined in section from the registration requirement because when a seller of home improvements is licensed to do the work contracted for,the buyer can reasonably feel confident that the seller has accurately assessed and described the work required and will perform it competently at a fair price.when the salesperson is not licensed to do the work,the buyer can have no such confidence thus such persons must be regulated in some other way for buyers protection.
bon license protects the public when he performs as a glazier.it does not do so when he performs flooring installation work for which he is not licensed.thus it makes no sense to conclude that merely because bon holds a license in a specialty unrelated to the work he sold the myhreses and then undertook to perform,he need not register as a home improvement salesperson.
handyman also ignores a significant part of section,subdivision b.the provisions immediately following subdivision b the only part handyman quotes explain how businesses applying for contractors licenses must qualify.in particular,subdivision b states if a corporation,it shall qualify by the appearance of a responsible managing officer or responsible managing employee who is qualified for the same license classification as the classification being applied for.italics added.when handyman applied for its corporate contractor license,it qualified through an officer or employee entitled to a license in the classification general building contractor for which handyman sought licensing bon did not and could not have qualified handyman for its license,as he was neither a responsible managing officer or responsible managing employee nor the holder of a general contracting license.therefore he is not a qualifying person,as defined in section,with respect to handyman.for this reason also it would not serve the purpose of the license law to exempt him from registering as a home improvement salesperson when he works in that role for handyman.
handyman interpretation of the qualifying person exemption,for which it cites no authority,misreads the statutory language.moreover,to permit contractors acting as unregistered home improvement salespersons to sell projects they are not personally qualified to carry out would expose the public to the sort of sharp practice the registration requirement was meant to guard against.for both reasons,we reject handyman position.
the service repairperson exception 
handyman also asserts bon was not required to register as a home improvement salesperson because he acted as a bona fide service repairperson who is in the employ of a licensed contractor and whose repair or service call is limited to the service,repair,or emergency repair initially requested by the buyer of the service,subd.b.we disagree.
this provision does not define its key terms.to construe them,therefore,we look first to their use in related statutes.
the definition of home improvement in section includes in the alternative the repairing,remodeling,altering,converting,or modernizing of,or adding to,residential property,and the installation of home improvement goods or the furnishing of home improvement services.it adds for purposes of this chapter,home improvement goods or services means goods and services,as defined in section of the civil code,which are bought in connection with the improvement of real property home improvement goods include goods which are to be so affixed to real property as to become a part of real property whether or not severable therefrom.italics added.
as previously noted,a home improvement salesperson is a person employed by a licensed contractor to solicit,sell,negotiate,or execute contracts for home improvements,for the sale,installation,or furnishing of home improvement goods or services,subd.a.
as previously noted,goods and services have the following definitions in civil code section 
c goods means tangible chattels bought for use primarily for personal,family,or household purposes,and including goods that,at the time of the sale or subsequently,are to be so affixed to real property as to become a part of the real property whether or not severable therefrom 
d services means work,labor and services,including,but not limited to,services furnished in connection with the repair,restoration,alteration,or improvement of residential premises italics added.
repair is not defined in the license law or in any related statute.therefore we give the term its ordinary meaning.california school employees governing board,supra,cal th,d.according to a standard dictionary,repair means to restore by replacing a part or putting together what is torn or broken fix,mend b to restore to a sound or healthy state renew,revivify to make good remedy to make up for compensate for webster third new internat.dict.according to a legal dictionary,repair means t o mend,remedy,restore,renovate.to restore to a sound or good state after decay,injury,dilapidation,or partial destruction.black law dict.ed.
we presume the legislature intends every word in a statute to have meaning,with nothing superfluous or redundant.california mfrs.public utilities com.cal d.in this light,we observe that as to home improvement goods and services the legislature has distinguished repair from restoration,alteration,or improvement,subd.d,and repairing from altering,converting,or modernizing of,or adding to.thus,the legislature evidently did not intend these terms to be exact synonyms.
furthermore,the ordinary meaning of repair entails fixing what is broken or healing what is injured.the other terms used in these statutes do not necessarily convey that meaning.for instance,one can restore a structure or part of a structure by refitting it for its original use,even though nothing in its present state is broken or unsound.similarly,one can alter,convert,moderniz e,or add to a structure without having to fix anything broken.
similarly,the service performed by a service repairperson is the servicing of an existing product,such as a furnace or air conditioner.
this construction of the statute would seem to make sense from a practical point of view.the statute appears to exempt from registration those bona fide repair people who come to one home to fix something that is broken or to service an existing product.we think the legislature probably had in mind that it would be nonsensical to require a homeowner to have his basement fill up with water from a broken water heater because a registered salesperson could not be located 
here,the myhreses did not want to repair or service anything,but to alter or modernize conditions in their home.they did not want their carpeting refurbished and restored to its former state they wanted to replace it in the master bedroom and hallway with a different kind of flooring therefore they called handyman to do the job that gary bon described in all the documents he prepared as install hardwood flooring.bon was not called to carry out a repair and did not make one.thus,the exemption from registration as a salesperson set out in section,subdivision b,for a bona fide service repairperson does not apply.as the trial court observed,the salient statutory distinction is not between service and repair,but between home improvement salesperson and service repairperson.
handyman asserts to the contrary that it merely complet ed the flooring repair project started by the myhreses.it sic obvious that the work was performed to restore the floor and house to a good and sound state.this was not an installation of some new fixture or device into an area that did not need to be restored.italics added.as there is no evidence the floor and house needed to be restored before the project began,we presume handyman means that once the myhreses had removed the carpeting to prepare for bon installation job the area could not remain without floor covering.but this is no different from any other case where people upgrade their homes by replacing perfectly sound fixtures with others they deem more attractive or.thus,for instance,if a homeowner opts to replace a structurally sound but drab composition roof with a tile or shingle roof,the old roof must come off to make way for the new.that does not make the upgrade a repair in any normal use of the english language,even though the house may be roofless until the job is done.
handyman also analogizes its installation job to projects such as an upgrade from a cheap leaking faucet to an expensive water softening faucet or replacing a destroyed formica kitchen countertop with a corian countertop.the adjectives give the game away.what is leaking or destroyed needs repair,and whether the repair includes replacing the old item with a more expensive model is immaterial.here,the myhreses did not seek to replace old carpeting with sought to replace one kind of flooring with another.moreover,though the carpeting was worn,there is no evidence it was unusable or fundamentally flawed.
the board alleged misinterpretations of section 
handyman asserts that the board has manufactured an installation exception to the registration,that if a project involves an installation it can not be a repair within the meaning of section.handyman specifically claims that t he agency or its representatives testified to this purported exception.yet handyman does not provide any record citations to the alleged testimony.we therefore disregard handyman claim.cal.rules of court,rule a c city of lincoln barringer th,d.
handyman also takes issue with the board interpretation of section,subdivision b,because the board chief of enforcement,david fogt,supposedly defined service and repair in his testimony in ways that go beyond their statutory and dictionary meanings.but since these terms are not defined in section,subdivision b,and repair is not defined anywhere in the license law,any interpretation of the terms must go beyond the statute itself.and a dictionary definition,though always a good starting point,does not necessarily settle how the legislature meant a term to be understood within a statutory scheme.in any event,because the board is charged with enforcing the statute and presumably has expertise in this field,its interpretation deserves some degree of deference.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.
handyman calls the chief of enforcement explanation of service performing service to something that already exists,to continue for that product or that material to continue to be viable an obvious alteration of the statutory definition of the term service.we disagree.it is a reasonable elucidation of the term in context that correctly distinguishes it from the installation of new materials in a home improvement project.
handyman also asserts that as to repair the board ignores the dictionary definition and imposes a limitation not found in the statute or any case law that the restoration must be with a material.handyman fails to support this assertion with record citation.therefore,we disregard it.cal.rules of court,rule a c city of lincoln barringer,supra,th,d.
handyman asserts more broadly that the board interpretations of section,subdivision b and,by grafting new provisions onto the statute,unconstitutionally usurp the legislature lawmaking powers in violation of substantive due process.we disagree.as we have shown,the board interpretations of both provisions are clearly in keeping with their language and purpose.
no rule of lenity in administrative law regulatory statutes not contracts of adhesion 
handyman asserts that we must construe any ambiguity in the statutory scheme in handyman favor.handyman is wrong.
in effect,handyman urges us either to import the rule of lenity from criminal law into civil administrative law,or to treat occupational regulatory statutes as contracts of adhesion to
