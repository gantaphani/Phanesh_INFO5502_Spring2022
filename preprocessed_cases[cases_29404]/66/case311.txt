on july,maria de jesus arroyo the decedent died at white memorial hospital the hospital after being transported there by ambulance and treated for cardiac arrest by john plosay.on may,the decedent husband,guadalupe arroyo,and the decedent eight children filed the present action against the hospital and plosay,alleging three causes of action,the first two of which were based on facts diametrically opposed to those underlying the alternative third cause of action 
the first two claims,medical negligence brought as a survivorship action by plaintiff guadalupe arroyo alone and wrongful death brought on behalf of all plaintiffs were based on allegations that the hospital staff and plosay prematurely declared the decedent dead,after which she was placed in a compartment in the hospital morgue while still alive,inflicted disfiguring injuries to her face while trying to escape,and ultimately froze to death.plaintiffs alleged that they did not discover these facts,and could not reasonably have discovered them,until december,when an expert they retained in a prior dismissed action against the hospital which was based solely on the alleged disfigurement of the decedent remains after death reviewed discovery material in the prior case and opined,inter alia,that the decedent injuries occurred.the third cause of action,styled negligence and brought on behalf of all plaintiffs,was based on the alternative factual premise the premise underlying the prior action against the hospital that after the decedent died from cardiac arrest,her body was mishandled by hospital staff when placing it in the morgue,resulting in facial disfigurement that could not be masked by the mortuary whose workers first observed the injuries.
in sustaining two demurrers by the hospital without leave to amend one to the medical negligence and wrongful death claims,the other to the negligence claim after amendment,the trial court concluded that the limitation period of code of civil procedure section applicable to actions for professional negligence against a health care provider,applied to all claims and commenced on or about july,the date plaintiffs learned of the decedent death and the disfiguring injuries to her face.therefore,the filing of this action on may,was untimely,and the court dismissed the action against the hospital.as to plosay,by stipulation plaintiffs agreed that the trial court ruling on the hospital demurrer to the medical negligence and wrongful death claims applied to him as well,and plaintiffs agreed to dismiss those claims,along with the negligence claim,as to him.the court entered an order of dismissal based on the stipulation.
plaintiffs appeal from the dismissals,contending that the trial court erred in concluding that their three claims were barred by section.assuming as we must that plaintiffs allegations are true,we hold that they do not show,as a matter of law,that the period of section for the medical negligence and wrongful death claims began running on or about july.first,the injury a term of art encompassing the generic elements of wrongdoing,causation and harm norgart upjohn cal th,d,norgart that plaintiffs then reasonably suspected was not the same injury as that underlying the medical negligence and wrongful death claims.second,the facts alleged do not permit the conclusion,as a matter of law,that a reasonable investigation of all potential causes of the injury plaintiffs suspected at the time of the decedent death would have uncovered the factual basis for the negligence and wrongful death claims before december,the date plaintiffs expert in the prior action against the hospital rendered his opinion.therefore,the trial court erred in sustaining the hospital demurrer to these two causes of action,and we reverse the orders dismissing those claims as to the hospital and plosay.
as to the cause of action for negligence,we conclude that section provides the applicable limitation period,because facts subject to judicial notice the hospital licensed status and administrative regulation establish that placing the decedent remains in the hospital morgue falls within the definition of professional negligence,negligence in providing services for which the hospital is licensed,and section is not limited to actions for injury caused to a patient,but rather applies to actions for injury by any party whose injury was a foreseeable result of the alleged professional negligence.because the present action was filed more than one year after plaintiffs knew of or reasonably suspected their injury,the negligence claim is barred.on that basis,we affirm the trial court dismissal of the negligence claim against the hospital.we affirm the dismissal as to plosay based on plaintiffs stipulated dismissal of the claim as to him.
background 
the mutilation action 
the case at issue in this appeal was not plaintiffs first suit against the hospital.before filing the instant action on may,plaintiffs had filed suit against the hospital on january,for ease of reference,we like the parties refer to this action as the mutilation action.
the complaint in the mutilation action alleged that on july,the decedent was taken by ambulance to the hospital,where she received treatment for cardiac arrest,acute myocardial infarction,and hypertension.shortly after arrival,she was pronounced dead by hospital staff.when workers for the mortuary selected by the family came to pick up the body,they found it lying face down in the hospital morgue.the decedent nose was broken and her face had suffered lacerations and contusions injuries that had not been present when she arrived at the hospital or when the body was viewed by relatives after the declaration of death.the workers informed plaintiffs of the injuries to the decedent remains,which the mortuary was unable to mask.
plaintiffs alleged causes of action for negligence per se based on health,subd.a,which makes it a felony to willfully mutilate any remains known to be human,without the authority of law,ordinary negligence,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.after the trial court denied plaintiffs ex parte request to shorten time to hear a motion to amend the complaint and summarily adjudicated the claims for negligence per se and intentional infliction of emotional distress in the hospital favor,plaintiffs dismissed the remaining claim for negligence without prejudice on january,just before trial.
the current lawsuit 
on may,plaintiffs filed the instant lawsuit,naming the hospital and plosay as defendants.the complaint acknowledged the prior filing of the mutilation action,and in part alleged facts substantially similar to the facts alleged in that action.thus,the complaint in the present case alleged that plosay and the hospital staff pronounced the decedent dead shortly after she arrived to be treated for cardiac arrest,acute myocardial infarction,and hypertension,that the body was laid out for plaintiffs to view and pay their respects before it was taken to the hospital morgue,and that the decedent face then had no injuries.it further alleged that when the mortuary workers examined the decedent body in the hospital morgue,it was lying face down.after the body was taken to the mortuary,the workers discovered that the decedent nose was broken and the face showed lacerations and contusions.plaintiffs became aware of the disfiguring of the remains when contacted by the mortuary,and the mortuary was unable to mask the injuries.
however,whereas the mutilation action was premised solely on the injuries having occurred after death,plaintiffs now alleged that during discovery in the mutilation action,an expert,relying on deposition testimony,declarations of the hospital personnel,and the decedent medical records,opined that the decedent remains were not disfigured after death.rather,according to the expert,the decedent had been prematurely declared dead by plosay and the hospital staff,frozen alive in the hospital freezer,eventually woke up due to the extreme cold,and damaged her face and turned herself face down as she struggled unsuccessfully to escape her frozen tomb.to avoid the statute of limitations,plaintiffs alleged that they did not discover that the decedent had been frozen alive until the expert gave his opinion on december,and could not have discovered that fact earlier by the exercise of reasonable diligence.
the complaint alleged three causes of action against the hospital and plosay.the first two claims,for medical negligence brought by plaintiff guadalupe arroyo alone,as successor in interest to the decedent and for wrongful death brought on behalf of all plaintiffs,were based on the defendants alleged negligence in prematurely declaring the decedent dead and allowing her to be frozen alive,resulting in her death.the third claim also brought on behalf of all plaintiffs was nearly identical to the negligence claim brought in the mutilation action,and was based on the alternative theory that the defendants mishandled the decedent remains in transporting the body to the hospital morgue,or by manipulating her body there,resulting in disfigurement to her face.
attached to the complaint was a declaration under section by plaintiff guadalupe arroyo in which he declared that the decedent died on july,and that he is the decedent successor in interest attached as an exhibit to the declaration was a copy of the decedent death certificate,which stated that the date of death was july,that it occurred at the hospital,and that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest,supplemented by acute myocardial infarction and hypertension.a physician other than plosay was the certifying physician.
the hospital demurrer 
the hospital demurred to the complaint,challenging all three causes of action on the ground that they were barred by the statute of limitations of section an action for injury or death against a health care provider based upon such person alleged professional negligence must be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the injury.according to the hospital,the first two causes of action medical negligence and wrongful death were barred because plaintiffs were aware of the disfiguring injuries to the decedent face on or about july,the date she was pronounced dead,and such knowledge placed them on notice of potential wrongdoing by the hospital.however,they did not file the instant complaint until may,much longer than one year after their discovery of the potential wrongdoing.similarly,the hospital argued that the limitation period had expired for the third cause of action for negligence in the handling of the remains,because it was identical to the claim in the mutilation action,which had been dismissed,and the claim was not timely revived by the current action filed on may.
in opposing the hospital demurrer,plaintiffs conceded that section applied to the medical negligence and wrongful death causes of action,but argued that as alleged in the complaint they could not have reasonably discovered the injury underlying those claims before december,when their expert in the mutilation action first opined the decedent was alive when the facial injuries occurred.because the complaint was filed on may,less than one year later,the claims were timely.as for the third cause of action plaintiffs argued that the limitation period for ordinary negligence applied,and therefore the claim was not barred.
trial court ruling 
as here relevant,the trial court sustained the hospital demurrer without leave to amend as to the causes of action for medical negligence and wrongful death,agreeing with the hospital that section barred the claims,because plaintiffs knowledge of the decedent facial injuries started the limitation period running,and the instant complaint was filed more than one year later as to the third cause of action for negligence in the mutilation of the body,the court sustained the demurrer,but granted leave to amend.
the first amended complaint 
plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint.the only material changes in the first amended complaint were that the third cause of action for negligence was amended to be brought on behalf of all plaintiffs except guadalupe arroyo as the decedent successor in interest,and that the claim no longer incorporated by reference facts specifically contained in the paragraphs of the first two causes of action.
the hospital demurrer to the first amended complaint 
the hospital demurred to the negligence cause of action on the ground that it was barred by section.to show that the claim was for professional negligence within the meaning of section,the hospital asked the court to take judicial notice of a copy of the hospital license issued by the california department of public health in effect as of the date of the decedent death,july,which was attached to the demurrer.the license certified the hospital as a general acute care hospital with a capacity of beds.the hospital also asked the court to take judicial notice of,inter alia,california code of regulations,title,section,which provides that hospitals with a licensed bed capacity of or more shall maintain a morgue with autopsy facilities subd.b,and r efrigerated compartments shall be maintained if human remains are held unembalmed with an air temperature not higher than degrees fahrenheit subd.c.
based on these facts subject to judicial notice,the hospital argued that the injuries to the decedent remains occurred during the provision of services for which the hospital was licensed.in particular,the first amended complaint alleged that the injuries occurred when the remains were transported to or manipulated at the hospital morgue.because as a condition of its license the hospital was required to maintain a refrigerated morgue,the hospital argued that the facial injuries to the remains inflicted on the way to or in the morgue necessarily fell within the scope of services the hospital was required to perform.thus,the third cause of action was governed by section,and was barred because the claim was filed in the instant action more than one year after discovery of the decedent facial disfigurement.
in opposition to the hospital demurrer,plaintiffs argued that section did not apply to the hospital mishandling of the decedent remains,because that statute only applies to actions for death or injury inflicted on the patient of the health care provider,whereas here the decedent was dead when the facial injuries occurred.
stipulation between plaintiffs and plosay 
before the hearing on the hospital demurrer,plaintiffs and plosay entered a stipulation in which they agreed that the trial court earlier ruling sustaining without leave to amend the hospital demurrer to the medical negligence and wrongful death causes of action applied with equal force and effect to plosay.plaintiffs agreed to dismiss those claims against plosay,and also to dismiss the third cause of action for negligence as to him.pursuant to the stipulation,before the hearing on the hospital demurrer,the court entered an order of dismissal as to all claims against plosay.
ruling on the hospital demurrer 
the trial court sustained the hospital demurrer without leave to amend and entered an order of dismissal as to the entire action as to the hospital.the court reasoned that plaintiffs were alleging that the hospital negligence in the handling of the decedent remains proximately caused emotional injury to them,and that such injury was encompassed by section.
discussion 
because this case comes to us on a demurrer for failure to state a cause of action,we accept as true the allegations in plaintiffs complaint.we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation citation.evans city of berkeley cal th,d.only when the facts alleged,or matters subject to judicial notice,demonstrate as a matter of law that the statute of limitations has expired can a demurrer be sustained on that ground.aryeh canon business solutions,cal th,d.
i.the causes of action for medical negligence and wrongful death 
the trial court sustained the hospital demurrer to the medical negligence and wrongful death claims alleged in plaintiff complaint on the ground that they were barred by the limitation period of section.plaintiffs contend that the court erred,because,as alleged in the complaint,they could not have reasonably discovered a factual basis for those claims before december,when their retained expert,on review of evidence obtained in discovery in the mutilation action,opined that the decedent remains were not disfigured after death,but rather that the decedent was alive when placed in the hospital morgue and injured herself trying to escape.taking the allegations of the complaint as true,we conclude that it can not be said as a matter of law that the period began running on or about july,the date of the decedent death.first,the injury that plaintiffs reasonably suspected at that time was not the same injury underlying the medical negligence and wrongful death claims.second,the facts alleged in the complaint do not permit the conclusion,as a matter of law,that a reasonable investigation of all potential causes of the injury plaintiffs suspected at the time of the decedent death would have uncovered the factual basis for the negligence and wrongful death claims before december,the date plaintiffs expert first rendered his opinion.therefore,the trial court erred in sustaining the hospital demurrer to these two causes of action.
in discussing this issue,we note as previously discussed that plosay never demurred to the claims on this ground the claims were dismissed against him based on a stipulation that the trial court ruling on the hospital demurrer applied equally to him.thus,on appeal plosay can raise only issues presented by the hospital demurrer,and his respondent brief on appeal essentially mirrors the hospital.therefore,we refer only to contentions made by the hospital on appeal,with the understanding that plosay makes the same arguments.
section,a provision of the medical injury compensation reform act of micra,provides in relevant part that i n an action for injury or death against a health care provider based upon such person alleged professional negligence,the time for the commencement of action shall be three years after the date of injury or one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the injury,whichever occurs first.italics added.plaintiffs do not dispute that section applies to the medical negligence and wrongful death claims.
the limitation period of section is a codification of the discovery rule,under which a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff is aware,or reasonably should be aware,of injury,a term of art which means both the negligent cause and the damaging effect of the alleged wrongful act.steketee lintz,williams rothberg cal d,see knowles superior court th,d knowles general discovery rule analysis of,inter alia,jolly eli lilly cal d,jolly and norgart,supra,at,d,apply to section.a plaintiff has reason to discover a cause of action when he or she has reason at least to suspect a factual basis for its elements.citations.under the discovery rule,suspicion of one or more of the elements of a cause of action,coupled with knowledge of any remaining elements,will generally trigger the statute of limitations period.citations.norgart,supra,explained that by discussing the discovery rule in terms of a plaintiff suspicion of elements of a cause of action,it was referring to the generic elements of wrongdoing,causation,and harm.citation.in so using the term elements,we do not take a hypertechnical approach to the application of the discovery rule.rather than examining whether the plaintiffs suspect facts supporting each specific legal element of a particular cause of action,we look to whether the plaintiffs have reason to at least suspect that a type of wrongdoing has injured them.fox ethicon endo surgery,cal th,d,fox.
the limits of the discovery rule have been restated in many decisions.see,fox,supra,cal th at,d,norgart,supra,cal th at,d,jolly,supra,cal d at.as summarized in fox,supra,cal th at pages,d,the various restatements of the principles lead to a straightforward conclusion simply put,in order to employ the discovery rule to delay accrual of a cause of action,a potential plaintiff who suspects that an injury has been wrongfully caused must conduct a reasonable investigation of all potential causes of that injury.if such an investigation would have disclosed a factual basis for a cause of action,the statute of limitations begins to run on that cause of action when the investigation would have brought such information to light.in order to adequately allege facts supporting a theory of delayed discovery,the plaintiff must plead that,despite diligent investigation of the circumstances of the injury,he or she could not have reasonably discovered facts supporting the cause of action within the applicable statute of limitations period.
here,the hospital contends that the limitation period for the medical negligence and wrongful death claims began running on or about july,because by that date plaintiffs knew the decedent had died knew that her face had been disfigured knew that they had suffered emotional distress from the disfigurement and suspected wrongdoing by the hospital.although not so explicitly phrased by the hospital,two alternative premises underlie the hospital argument.
first,the hospital assumes that,regardless of the plaintiffs duty to conduct a reasonable investigation,these listed facts of wrongdoing,causation,and harm norgart,supra,cal th at,d,necessarily constitute the same injury that supports the medical negligence and wrongful death causes of action.thus,in the hospital telling,plaintiffs were aware of their injury on or about july,and the statute began to run at that time whatever plaintiffs could or could not have discovered by a reasonable investigation after that is irrelevant to when the limitation period began.see kleefeld superior court th,d a plaintiff diligence after he has become suspicious of wrongdoing is not relevant to the running of the statute of limitations and is only relevant to determine when he should have suspected wrongdoing.second,the hospital implicitly contends,in the alternative,that even if the injury as of july,was not the same as that underlying the medical negligence and wrongful death claims,those claims are still barred because within one year plaintiffs could have discovered through reasonable investigation the factual basis for the claims.
on both counts,the hospital is wrong.the generic elements wrongdoing,causation,and harm norgart,supra,cal th at,d,constituting the injury that plaintiffs reasonably suspected had occurred on or about july,are entirely different from those underlying the medical negligence and wrongful death claims.the injury that plaintiffs reasonably suspected had occurred on or about july,consisted of the mishandling of the decedent body after death the wrongdoing,which caused disfigurement to the decedent face causation,and plaintiffs resultant emotional distress upon learning of those injuries the harm.by contrast,the medical negligence and wrongful death claims are based on a wholly different injury raised by diametrically opposed facts.the wrongdoing element of both relates not to mishandling the decedent remains,but to prematurely declaring her dead and having her placed in the morgue while still alive.the causation element of both relates not to causing disfigurement of the decedent face,but to causing her to freeze to death in the morgue.the harm element of both has nothing to do with emotional distress from knowing of or observing injuries.assuming without deciding that the medical negligence claim is a proper survivorship action meaning a claim that belonged to the decedent but survived her death adams superior court th,d the generic,nontechnical element of harm in that claim is harm caused to the decedent,not harm emotional or otherwise caused to plaintiffs as for the wrongful death claim,the relevant harm is the harm which the death caused to the plaintiffs as the decedents heirs a distinct harm,different in kind,from emotional distress that might be caused by knowing of or observing the disfiguring of the decedent remains after death in short,the generic elements norgart,supra,cal th at,d,of the injury plaintiffs suspected on or about july,can not reasonably be equated to the generic elements of the injury underlying the medical negligence and wrongful death claims.
as we conclude below,in section ii of our discussion,we agree with the hospital contention that the alleged negligence in mishandling the decedent remains,causing disfiguring injuries,is professional negligence within the meaning of section,subdivision.but,contrary to the hospital argument,that conclusion does not mean that plaintiffs suspicion of such wrongdoing commenced the limitation period for the medical negligence and wrongful death claims.the hospital contends that those claims merely embody a different theory of liability under the discovery rule,not a distinct type of wrongdoing.the hospital argument,however,ignores the fundamental point that it is the suspicion of the factual basis of wrongdoing that commences the limitation period under the discovery rule.obviously,the factual basis of the wrongdoing that underlies the medical negligence and wrongful death claims prematurely declaring the decedent dead and placing her in the morgue while alive is completely different from the factual basis of the wrongdoing plaintiffs suspected as of july,mishandling the decedent remains,causing disfiguring injuries after death.the difference is not in the theories of liability,but in the essential suspected facts.in short,suspected wrongdoing in handling the decedent remains after death is not the same as suspected wrongdoing in causing her death.
thus,the ultimate question is whether it can be said,as a matter of law,that through a reasonable investigation of all the potential causes of the injury suspected on or about july,plaintiffs would have discovered within one year the factual basis for the medical negligence and wrongful death causes of action.see fox,supra,cal th at,d.nothing in the complaint compels that conclusion as a matter of law.
according to the complaint,the decedent was declared dead by plosay and the hospital staff,and the body was laid out for viewing by the family.no alleged facts,or inferences compelled from those facts,suggest that plaintiffs observation of the body should have led them to suspect that the decedent was still alive and that plosay and the hospital staff had prematurely declared her dead.similarly,no alleged facts,or inferences compelled from those facts,suggest that anything about the discovery of the body lying face down in the refrigerated compartment of the hospital morgue or the nature of the disfiguring injuries observed by the mortuary workers should have led plaintiffs to suspect that the decedent was alive when placed in the morgue compartment,that she had frozen to death there,or that the disfiguring injuries observed on the body occurred while the decedent was still alive.moreover,the decedent death certificate incorporated into the survivorship declaration of guadalupe arroyo and attached to the complaint later certified that the decedent died on july,at the hospital,and that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest,with subsidiary causes of acute myocardial infarction and hypertension.
based on the facts in the complaint,read as a whole,plaintiffs had absolutely no reason to suspect that the decedent was alive rather than dead when placed in the hospital morgue and when the disfiguring injuries occurred,and thus had no reason to suspect or investigate potential wrongdoing by the hospital or plosay in prematurely declaring the decedent dead.while it is true that i t is a plaintiff suspicion of negligence,rather than an expert opinion,that triggers the limitation period,knowles,supra,th at,d,here plaintiffs had no reasonable suspicion of the wrongdoing later disclosed by their expert in the mutilation action.and nothing on the face of the complaint or matters of which we might take judicial notice compels the conclusion that a reasonable investigation by plaintiffs would have produced the opinion reached by plaintiffs expert in the mutilation cause of action that the decedent injuries were and that she froze to death in the hospital morgue sooner than december.
the hospital analogizes the present case to dolan borelli th,d dolan,but that decision is inapposite.in dolan,the defendant surgeon performed surgery in april to alleviate the plaintiff carpal tunnel syndrome in her right hand.id.at,d.by june,even though the defendant had told her that he expected the surgery would relieve her pain by then,the plaintiff symptoms were significantly worse than before surgery,and she believed that the defendant had performed the surgery improperly.ibid.in february,she consulted an attorney and complained that the defendant had done something wrong.in june,another surgeon performed surgery on the plaintiff hand,and discovered that the prior surgery did not release the right carpal tunnel ligament.plaintiff did not file suit against the defendant until august.ibid.
the court of appeal affirmed the trial court grant of summary judgment on the ground that the limitation period of section began to run no later than february,when the plaintiff consulted an attorney,and therefore the filing of the lawsuit more than one year later in august was untimely.dolan,supra,th at,d.the appellate court rejected the plaintiff contention that the negligence alleged in the complaint defendant failure to release the carpal tunnel ligament could not reasonably have been discovered until the second surgery in june,which disclosed that specific condition.ibid.the court reasoned,as here relevant,that the essential inquiry is when did plaintiff suspect defendant was negligent,not when did she learn precisely how he was negligent.id.at,d.
the hospital reliance on dolan exposes the essential flaw in the hospital reasoning.in dolan,the evidence showed as a matter of law that the wrongdoing,with its resultant causation and harm,for which the plaintiff was suing defendant negligent performance of the first surgery on plaintiff hand,resulting in failure to release the carpal tunnel ligament was the same wrongdoing,causation,and harm which she reasonably suspected had occurred no later than february wrongdoing in the performance of the first surgery,resulting in exacerbated pain.thus,the limitation period for that injury necessarily commenced in february,and it did not matter whether plaintiff then knew the precise factual parameters of the defendant negligence.
in the present case,as we have explained,the injury that plaintiffs reasonably suspected had occurred on or about july,the mishandling of the decedent remains after death,causing disfiguring injuries and resultant emotional distress to plaintiffs was not the same injury for which plaintiffs were suing in the medical negligence and wrongful death causes of action the hospital and plosay prematurely declaring the decedent dead and having her placed in a refrigerated compartment in the morgue while still alive where she froze to death,resulting in distinct harm to the decedent and to plaintiffs.the question here,unlike dolan,is whether,as a matter of law,a reasonable investigation of all potential causes of the injury suspected on or about july,would have uncovered within one year a factual basis for the medical negligence and wrongful death causes of action.for the reasons we have stated,we conclude that it would not.therefore,we can not say as a matter of law that the limitation period was triggered on or about july,and that it commenced any earlier than december,the date plaintiffs expert in the mutilation action offered his opinion.thus,the filing of this action on may,was within the limitation period of section.it follows that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the medical negligence and wrongful death causes of action,and we reverse the dismissal of those claims as to the hospital and plosay.
ii.negligence cause of action 
plaintiffs contend that the trial court erre
