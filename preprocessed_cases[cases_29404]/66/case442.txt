introduction 
defendant,dean mauro,who is an attorney,appeals from an order denying his special motion to strike,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,the second amended complaint for civil extortion,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and wrongful interference with prospective economic advantage brought by plaintiff,michael flatley.the complaint was filed two days after mauro,on behalf his client,tyna marie robertson,commenced litigation in illinois against plaintiff.robertson is not a party to this appeal.mauro argues the trial court should have granted the special motion to strike because the second amended complaint alleges harm that results from the protected activity of proposing settlement of a disputed claim on behalf of robertson.further,mauro argues his conduct was absolutely privileged as prelitigation communications pursuant to civil code section,subdivision b.we disagree and affirm the order denying the special motion to strike.the trial court properly ruled the attempt to extort money in exchange for silence is not the proper subject of a special motion to strike.
ii.background 
initially filed pleading 
plaintiff filed a complaint for civil extortion,defamation,fraud,intentional infliction of emotional distress,and wrongful interference with prospective economic advantage on march.named as defendants were mauro and robertson.mauro was not named in the defamation and fraud causes of action.on march,plaintiff filed a first amended complaint.on april,defendant mauro demurred to and moved to strike the first amended complaint.on may,the trial court overruled the demurrer to the civil extortion and emotional distress claims.the trial court sustained with leave to amend the demurrer to the tortious interference claim.
b.the second amended complaint 
plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on june.the second amended complaint alleges that plaintiff is a resident of ireland and a well known performer and entertainment entrepreneur.defendants are illinois residents,who allegedly intentionally communicated about plaintiff to and from california.plaintiff alleged he met robertson in las vegas,nevada prior to october.the second amended complaint further alleged that at the time they met and unbeknownst to plaintiff robertson was an with a gambling habit that had led to her seeking the protection of the bankruptcy courts robertson had been sued for charging over of personal items to a company credit card and passing dishonored checks and robertson had extorted money and other financial benefits from men.
plaintiff employed a private secretary,thomas trautmann plaintiff gave robertson trautmann telephone number.during october,robertson telephoned trautmann.trautmann arranged for plaintiff to come to las vegas on october.robertson arrived at plaintiff two bedroom suite in the venetian hotel in las vegas.at that time,robertson was told that one of the bedrooms was occupied by plaintiff and the other by trautmann.robertson did not request separate accommodations.plaintiff and robertson had dinner together and returned to his suite.the two went directly to plaintiff bedroom.robertson allegedly went into plaintiff bathroom,subsequently reappeared in the nude,and then climbed into bed with him.it was alleged that robertson voluntarily spent the night with plaintiff.the next morning robertson kissed plaintiff in the presence of trautmann.plaintiff and robertson then had breakfast together in the suite.when robertson subsequently left for the airport on the morning of october,she kissed plaintiff and said she hoped to see him again soon.
days later,on november,robertson telephoned the las vegas police and falsely accused plaintiff of raping her on the night of october.according to the second amended complaint,robertson stated that she called the police because she wanted to make a record.the authorities took no action in response to robertson november,telephone call.
in january,mauro,robertson lawyer,sent a letter to a corporate service in carson city,nevada.a copy of the letter was sent to plaintiff counsel in los angeles.the letter alleged plaintiff had sexually assaulted robertson.the letter indicated that robertson reported the incident to the police and demanded that plaintiff make a substantial payment.the letter warned that,if payment was not made,the information concerning the alleged rape would be turned over to state,local,and federal authorities for criminal prosecution.the letter also warned that,in the absence of a payment,robertson would issue a press release to numerous named media sources throughout the world.
in january,in three separate telephone conversations with plaintiff lawyers in los angeles,mauro threatened to go public with robertson sexual assault claim if plaintiff did not make a sufficient payment to satisfy robertson.defendants are alleged to have made the threats as part of a pattern and practice of robertson to extort payments and other economic benefits from men with whom she has had sexual liaisons.the threats are alleged to have not been made in connection with a proceeding contemplated in good faith or to achieve a bona fide purpose in litigation but in furtherance of a scheme to profit by extorting money.after plaintiff refused to pay anything,robertson filed a civil complaint in illinois and then made false and defamatory statements about him on television and other media outlets that he had raped her.on july,mauro answered the second amended complaint.

iii.discussion 
standard of review and burdens of proof 
a special motion to strike may be filed in response to a meritless suit filed primarily to chill the defendant exercise of first amendment rights.dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman th,d,quoting wilcox superior court th,fn,d,disapproved on another point in equilon enterprises consumer cause,cal th,fn,d.section,which was enacted in,authorizes a court to summarily dismiss such meritless suits.stats,ch.there is no requirement though that the suit be brought with the specific intent to chill the defendant exercise of free speech or petition rights.navellier sletten cal th,d,equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,d.the purpose of the statute was set forth in section,subdivision a,as follows the legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances.the legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance,and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process under section,any cause of action against a person arising from any act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue must be stricken unless the courts finds a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on whatever claim is involved,subd.b dowling zimmerman th,d dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman,supra,th at,d.in order to protect the constitutional rights of petition and free speech,the statute is to be construed broadly,subd.a briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,averill superior court th,d.
when a special motion to strike is filed,the trial court must consider two components.first,the moving party has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case that the plaintiff cause of action arose out of the defendant actions in the furtherance of the rights of petition or free speech,subd.b mission oaks ranch,county of santa barbara th,d,overruled on another point in briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,fn,d,macias hartwell th,d braun chronicle publishing th,d dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman,supra,th at,d wilcox superior court,supra,th at,d.section does not apply to every claim which may have some tangential relationship to free expression or petition rights.the supreme court has held section can not be read to mean that any claim asserted in an action which arguably was filed in retaliation for the exercise of speech or petition rights falls under section,whether or not the claim is based on conduct in exercise of those rights.citations.city of cotati cashman cal th,d,quoting computerxpress,jackson th,d,orig.italics.quoting from computerxpress,jackson,supra,th at page,d,the supreme court in city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th at page,d,explained california courts rightly have rejected the notion that a lawsuit is adequately shown to be one arising from an act in furtherance of the rights of petition or free speech as long as suit was brought after the defendant engaged in such an act,whether or not the purported basis for the suit is that act itself.citation.a defendant who meets the burden of showing the cause of action arises out of the exercise of the rights of petition or free speech has no additional burden of proving either plaintiff subjective intent to chill city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th at,d,equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,d,or a chilling effect.city of cotati cashman,supra,cal th at,d.
second,once the defendant establishes the cause of action arises out of the exercise of petition or free expression rights,the burden shifts to plaintiff.the plaintiff must then establish a probability that he or she will prevail on the merits,subd.b briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,d,kyle carmon th,d conroy spitzer th,d dove audio,rosenfeld,meyer susman,supra,th at,d.the supreme court has defined the probability of prevailing burden as follows t he plaintiff must demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if the evidence submitted by plaintiff is credited.wilson parker,covert chidester cal th,d,quoting matson dvorak th,d.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d,briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court has explained that a plaintiff must only prove the challenged cause of action has minimal merit.navellier sletten,supra,cal th at,d,wilson parker,covert chidester,supra,cal th at,d.
in reviewing the trial court order denying the special motion to strike,we use our independent judgment to determine whether the mauro engaged in a protected activity.mission oaks ranch,county of santa barbara,supra,th at,d foothills townhome christiansen th,d,disapproved on another point in equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at,fn,d.the trial court can strike one or more causes of action and permit others to remain.kajima engineering construction,city of los angeles th,d shekhter financial indemnity th,d.
defendant burden 
mauro does not deny he made any of the statements attributed to him.nor does he seriously dispute his conduct was illegal,an issue we will discuss shortly.rather,mauro argues we can not evaluate the legality of his conduct in deciding whether the causes of action in the second amended complaint arose from his exercise of the rights of free expression and petition.mauro argues that the issue of illegality can only be considered as part of the second prong of section minimal merit issue and not as a threshold matter.mauro claims that support for this position may be found in a number of appellate court decisions.see lieberman kcop television,th,d claims of illegal newsgathering by television station arose from acts in furtherance of right of free speech because it was not the defendant burden in bringing a section motion to establish that the challenged cause of action is constitutionally protected as a matter of law contacts,steinberg th,d meetings cited in complaint to discuss legislative strategies to combat plaintiff practice of selling lenses to consumers whose prescriptions were not current were all acts in furtherance of defendant free speech or petition rights such that legality of the conduct must be decided in second prong kashian harriman th,d conduct that would otherwise come within the scope section does not lose its coverage simply because it is alleged to have been unlawful or unethical chavez mendoza th,d a court must generally presume the validity of the claimed constitutional right in the first step of the section analysis,and then permit the parties to address the issue in the second step of the analysis,if necessary.based on these decisions,defendant argues that in all cases the illegality question must be decided as part of plaintiff minimal merit showing.
we disagree with mauro contention that the foregoing decisions establish a rule of law that the section,subdivision b arising from determination can never entail a resolution of the legality of the defendant conduct.we reach this decision for several reasons.to begin with,nothing in the language of the special motion to strike statute imposes such a blanket prohibition against ever evaluating the lawfulness of speech or conduct as part of the section,subdivision b arising from requirement.further,mauro has not identified any legislative committee reports which suggest the legislature intended that the section,subdivision b analysis may never involve an assessment of the legality of the defendant conduct.
more critically,the controlling analysis is that in paul for council hanyecz th,d,disapproved on another point in equilon enterprises consumer cause,supra,cal th at page,footnote,d.in paul for council,our colleague,associate justice walter croskey described the relevant facts as follows plaintiff complaint alleged he was elected to the laguna niguel city council in.in,paul for council was the official committee acting on plaintiff behalf in his bid for another term on the council.the thrust of the complaint is that defendants interfered with plaintiff candidacy by influencing the election with illegal campaign contributions for one of his opponents.plaintiff alleged that defendants acts violated the political reform act of,et.paul for council hanyecz,supra,th at,d,orig.italics.the trial court agreed with the defendants contention that their conduct,raising campaign funds,arose from the exercise of their free speech rights.the court of appeal disagreed.associate justice croskey wrote we find the trial court erred when it ruled this is a slapp suit,and then required plaintiff,upon pain of dismissal,to demonstrate the probability of the suit success.we reach this conclusion because the record demonstrates defendants were not engaged in a valid exercise of their constitutional rights of freedom of speech or petition for redress of grievances.id.at,d,orig.italics.
in paul for council,associate justice croskey wrote that the initial burden requires a prima facie showing that the plaintiff causes of action arise from the defendant exercise of free expression of petition rights.associate justice croskey explained thusly to meet its burden,the defendant does not have to establish its actions are constitutionally protected under the first amendment as a matter of law.if this were so the second clause of subdivision b of section would be superfluous because by definition the plaintiff could not prevail on its claim.wilcox,supra,th at d,italics added.rather,the defendant must present a prima facie showing that the plaintiff causes of action arise from acts of the defendant taken to further the defendant rights of free speech or petition in connection with a public issue.ibid.only if the defendant makes this prima facie showing does the trial court consider the second step of the section,subdivision b analysis paul for council hanyecz,supra,th at,d original italics.in paul for council,our colleagues in division three held the de
