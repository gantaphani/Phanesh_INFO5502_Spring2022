in this original mandamus proceeding,we must determine whether a law firm should be disqualified from the underlying suit on the basis of a legal assistant work on the matter after previously having worked on the same matter while employed by opposing counsel.we have previously held that a firm can usually avoid disqualification when hiring an assistant who previously worked on a matter for opposing counsel if the firm instructs the assistant not to work on the matter,and takes other reasonable steps to shield the assistant from working in connection with the matter.in re am.home prods.we have not,however,set forth the types of other reasonable steps that are required,nor have we addressed whether disqualification is required when an assistant actually works on the matter for the second firm.
because the legal assistant employer did not take effective reasonable steps to shield the assistant from working on the case,and the assistant actually worked on the case at her employer directive,we hold that disqualification is required and direct the trial court to grant the defendant motion to disqualify and recuse plaintiffs counsel.
in the underlying case,the plaintiffs,yvonne and alberto leal the leals,brought a medical malpractice suit against columbia valley healthcare system,doing business under the name valley regional medical center valley regional.valley regional filed a motion to disqualify the leal counsel,magallanes hinojosa,because of its employment of legal assistant margarita rodriguez.
rodriguez had previously worked on the leal case while employed by valley regional counsel,william gault,at brin brin,assisting gault from the inception of the suit.while employed by brin brin,rodriguez was a custodian of records and was responsible for filing many privileged documents concerning the suit,including investigative material,discussions with consulting experts,defense strategy,settlement negotiations,strategy for adding other parties to the suit,and attorney notes.rodriguez also prepared correspondence to valley regional and its insurer.before leaving brin brin,rodriguez signed a confidentiality agreement obligating rodriguez not to work on any matter that she had previously worked on for brin brin.
approximately eleven months after leaving brin brin,rodriguez was hired by magallanes hinojosa,a firm,as a legal assistant for attorney magallanes.magallanes hired rodriguez with knowledge that she had worked on the leal case for brin brin.at the time rodriguez was hired,magallanes orally instructed her not to work on any case with which she had prior involvement,specifically including the cases she had worked on while at brin brin.the firm did not have any written screening policies in effect at the time of rodriguez hiring.the firm other legal assistant,luz castro,was assigned to handle the leal file.magallanes later suffered a brain aneurysm,requiring hospitalization.magallanes hinojosa associated with another firm to take over as lead attorneys,while magallanes role in the matter was significantly reduced.however,magallanes testified that he had continuing participation in the case after his hospitalization,such as attending a settlement hearing and that he anticipated involvement during trial.
despite the oral instructions from magallanes,rodriguez had contact with the leal file on a few occasions while working at magallanes hinojosa.according to rodriguez,her contact consisted of the following filing correspondence related to the leal case rescheduling a docket control conference preparing an order and sending correspondence to counsel concerning a docket control conference calling gault legal assistant regarding the docket control conference calendaring dates regarding the case on magallanes calendar and making a copy of a birth certificate and social security card in the case at magallanes directive on one occasion.when magallanes learned that rodriguez had scheduled the docket control conference,he again orally instructed her not to work on the case,and held a meeting where he informed both rodriguez and castro that they would be dismissed if this happened again.
after this admonition,rodriguez had continued contact with the file,albeit marginally,filing correspondence for magallanes and handling magallanes calendar.magallanes also directed rodriguez to make a copy of a birth certificate and social security card in the leal case in his presence on one occasion.
when gault learned that opposing counsel employed rodriguez,he filed a motion on valley regional behalf to disqualify and recuse magallanes hinojosa as counsel for the leals.the trial court held an evidentiary hearing at which both magallanes and rodriguez testified.after the hearing,the trial court denied valley regional motion to recuse and disqualify magallanes hinojosa,while ordering rodriguez not to be involved in any of the cases on which she worked while at brin brin.valley regional sought mandamus relief in the court of appeals,complaining that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion.the court of appeals denied the petition,concluding that magallanes hinojosa took sufficient precautions to guard against any disclosure of confidences by rodriguez.lexis at,wl at.
valley regional now petitions this court for mandamus relief,urging that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion and that it has no adequate remedy on appeal valley regional argues that magallanes hinojosa has failed to overcome the rebuttable presumption that confidences were shared,insisting that the informal screening done at the firm was ineffective to ensure rodriguez did not work on the matter.valley regional also argues that rodriguez actual work on the case at magallanes hinojosa should make the presumption of shared confidences conclusive.
magallanes hinojosa counters that its screening measures were sufficient,and the confidentiality agreement rodriguez signed before leaving brin brin adds an additional layer of protection against the sharing of confidential information.magallanes hinojosa further suggests that magallanes limited participation in the leal matter,and rodriguez minimal work on the case at magallanes hinojosa,renders rodriguez actual contact with the leal file de minimis.
