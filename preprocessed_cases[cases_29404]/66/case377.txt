wiley county of san diego cal th,d,wiley held that factual innocence is an element of a legal malpractice action stemming from representation in an underlying criminal trial.later,coscia mckenna cuneo cal th,d,coscia held that the legal malpractice plaintiff must obtain postconviction exoneration in the underlying case in order to establish the element of factual innocence required by wiley.addressing an issue left open in sangha labarbera th,d sangha,we now hold that a legal malpractice plaintiff must prove factual innocence and exoneration as to all transactionally related offenses comprising the basis for the underlying criminal proceeding in order to maintain a malpractice action.
plaintiff and appellant jaleh wilkinson was convicted by jury of one felony and two misdemeanors while represented by defendant and respondent garrett zelen and the law offices of garrett zelen zelen.the judgment was affirmed on direct appeal by the california supreme court,but an order to show cause returnable in the trial court was issued by the court of appeal on wilkinson petition for writ of habeas corpus,which alleged that zelen provided incompetent representation at trial.the prosecution did not oppose the habeas corpus petition,which was granted,and conviction on all three counts was vacated.pursuant to a plea bargain,wilkinson then entered no contest pleas to two misdemeanors.
wilkinson filed the instant action for legal malpractice and breach of contract against zelen the trial court sustained zelen demurrer to the operative first amended complaint fac without leave to amend,on the basis that wilkinson could not plead she was factually innocent and she was not exonerated by postconviction relief,as required by coscia and wiley.we hold the demurrer was properly sustained without leave to amend.
allegations of the fac 
wilkinson alleged she retained zelen to represent her in a criminal action,in which she was convicted by jury in october of all battery on a custodial officer,misdemeanor driving under the influence,subd.a and failing to stop at the scene of an accident,subd.a.wilkinson was immediately remanded to custody following the verdict and ultimately sentenced to days in county jail,where she suffered severe beatings by other inmates.the convictions were due to the incompetence of zelen in preparing and assessing the case,attempting to reach a settlement with the prosecutor,and failing to communicate settlement offers.as a result of the conviction,wilkinson was terminated from employment with a bank and her petition for naturalization,which had been previously approved,was subsequently denied and revoked.
wilkinson filed a direct appeal and a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the court of appeal.the court of appeal found a prima facie case for relief based on incompetence of trial counsel and ordered further proceedings in the superior court,where the court exonerated wilkinson of all charges on which she was convicted.the fac alleged that wilkinson is factually innocent of all charges of which she was convicted.
zelen demurrer and wilkinson opposition 
zelen demurred to the fac on the ground wilkinson failed to allege factual innocence and could not make such an allegation because of a lack of substantial evidence.wilkinson filed an opposition to the demurrer,arguing that she did specifically allege factual innocence.she contended her convictions were reversed as a result of the habeas corpus petition alleging incompetence of counsel,the felony conviction was the gravamen of the malpractice action,and that charge was dismissed and she entered a plea to a violation of penal code section.wilkinson also argued she can demonstrate actual innocence of the two charges to which she plead no contest.
in connection with the demurrer,zelen and wilkinson both filed requests for judicial notice of various records from the underlying criminal action against wilkinson,her appeal,and proceedings on her petition for writ of habeas corpus the judicially noticed records reveal the following.
on wilkinson direct appeal from her criminal convictions,the court of appeal held that the punishment provision of penal code section violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the law,with one justice dissenting.the court of appeal also held that wilkinson was entitled to an evidentiary hearing regarding the admissibility of polygraph evidence.on the habeas corpus petition,the court of appeal concluded wilkinson had alleged a prima facie case for relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel and issued an order to show cause returnable in the trial court.
the california supreme court granted the attorney general petition for review on wilkinson direct appeal.no petition for review was filed as to wilkinson habeas corpus petition.the supreme court reversed the judgment of the court of appeal,holding that the punishment provision of penal code section does not violate equal protection,and wilkinson was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the admissibility of her proffered polygraph evidence in view of evidence code section.people wilkinson cal th,d.the supreme court expressed no opinion on the habeas corpus claim as it was not within the scope of the grant of review.id.at,fn,d.
the habeas corpus petition was then addressed in the trial court pursuant to the court of appeal order to show cause.the prosecution did not file a return to the order to show cause.the prosecutor orally stated she did not oppose relief and was interested in disposing of the case through a negotiated settlement with wilkinson.with no opposition,the trial court granted wilkinson habeas corpus petition,finding the allegations in the petition were sufficiently made out.the convictions on all three felony and two vacated.as part of a negotiated case settlement,wilkinson entered no contest pleas to the original vehicle code section,subdivision a charge,as well as an added misdemeanor violation of penal code section,subdivision a.the two remaining felony violation of penal code section and misdemeanor violation of vehicle code section,subdivision a were dismissed on the people motion.
probation was granted on the two misdemeanor counts.the trial court immediately found wilkinson had successfully completed probation,which was ordered terminated.the convictions were ordered expunged under penal code section.
ruling on the demurrer and judgment 
the trial court sustained zelen demurrer without leave to amend.the court indicated wilkinson had not been found innocent of all charges relating to the action.the court rejected the argument that the felony charge of battery on a custodial officer could be separated from the misdemeanor charges,as all charges arose from the same incident.the court was of the view wilkinson failed to show she was factually innocent of all the charges and that she had been exonerated.judgment was entered in favor of zelen.wilkinson filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
wilkinson argues the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to the first amended complaint.she reasons that the postconviction relief,based on ineffective assistance of counsel at trial,satisfies the pleading requirement that a legal malpractice action stemming from a criminal case can not be pursued without proof of actual innocence.wilkinson contends her legal malpractice action is not barred by her no contest pleas to two misdemeanors.she also contends that she should be allowed leave to amend if the order sustaining the demurrer is affirmed.we hold the demurrer was properly sustained,as the judicially noticed court records demonstrate that wilkinson can not establish factual innocence or exoneration,and leave to amend was properly denied.

supreme court description of the facts in the underlying action 
as noted above,the california supreme court granted review of the decision of the court of appeal on wilkinson direct appeal.the following is the supreme court summary of the facts from wilkinson criminal trial.
at trial,the prosecution presented evidence that,in the early morning hours of february,a motorist observed defendant driving erratically on a street in the city of santa monica.defendant vehicle crossed over the center divider,struck a parked car,and continued down the street,swerving between lanes.defendant eventually stopped her car at a curb and placed her head on the front passenger seat.after the motorist telephoned the police,officers responded and tapped on the window of defendant parked car,whereupon defendant looked at one of the officers and drove off.the police gave chase for three blocks before defendant stopped.defendant,who smelled strongly of alcohol and exhibited slurred speech,indicated she had consumed some drinks but not many.she could not complete a field sobriety test and did not respond when told she was required to submit to a blood or breath test for alcohol.
officers transported defendant to the police station.she was belligerent during booking and resisted a pat search.at one point,defendant grabbed a custodial officer arm with both hands,causing a visible welt.when taken to a holding cell,defendant charged at an officer and yelled,kicked,and banged at the door.after the police reminded defendant that she would have to submit to a blood or breath test,defendant covered her ears,stated i ca hear you,and began running around inside the cell.an officer testified defendant appeared to be under the influence of alcohol but not of drugs.
defendant testified in her own defense as follows.on the night in question,defendant,a bank,went to a bar,where she met a man who offered to buy her a drink.she accepted and eventually consumed two glasses of wine.the man invited defendant to dinner,and they agreed to meet at a santa monica restaurant.at the restaurant,defendant consumed three alcoholic beverages over the course of three hours while she waited for the man,but he never arrived.she left her drink several times to use the restroom and to smoke a cigarette outside.she eventually left the restaurant,driving away without feeling any signs of intoxication.the next thing she remembered was waking up in jail,with no recollection of her encounter with the officers.after her release from custody,defendant filed a police complaint alleging she had been drugged.
a toxicologist,testifying on behalf of the defense,expressed the opinion that on the night in question defendant was under the influence of alcohol and gamma hydroxy butyrate hereafter ghb,commonly known as a date rape drug,basing his opinion on a review of the police report and a videotape of defendant conduct in the holding cell.ghb depresses the nervous system,exaggerates the effects of alcohol,and may cause drowsiness and memory loss.depending upon a person personality,the drug may make a person more emotional and combative.the toxicologist also suggested that if defendant was not under the influence of ghb,she must have been visibly drunk when she left the restaurant in order for her to exhibit the effects of intoxication so long after her last drink.a city of concord police officer,testifying for the defense as a drug recognition expert,stated that defendant symptoms appeared much more severe than what would be expected of someone who had consumed five alcoholic drinks over the course of several hours.
the jury convicted defendant as charged,and the trial court placed defendant on formal probation for three years.people wilkinson,supra,cal th at,d.
the requirement of factual innocence 
factual innocence is an element of a legal malpractice cause of action stemming from representation in a criminal action.the failure to provide competent representation in a civil or criminal case may be the basis for civil liability under a theory of professional negligence.in a legal malpractice action arising from a civil proceeding,the elements are the duty of the attorney to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as members of his or her profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the breach and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the attorney negligence.budd nixen cal d,schultz harney th,d.in a legal malpractice case arising out of a criminal proceeding,california,like most jurisdictions,also requires proof of actual innocence.wiley county of san diego,supra,cal th at d.coscia,supra,cal th at,d.if the defendant has in fact committed a crime,the remedy of a new trial or other relief is sufficient reparation in light of the countervailing public policies and considering the purpose and function of constitutional guaranties.wiley,supra,cal th at,d.
the court in wiley explained that safeguards built into the criminal law proof beyond a reasonable doubt,the exclusionary rule,and the availability of postconviction malpractice actions relating to criminal defendants from those involving parties to civil litigation,where a simple test of causation is sufficient.in the criminal malpractice context,by contrast,a defendant own criminal act remains the ultimate source of his predicament irrespective of counsel subsequent negligence.any harm suffered is not only because of attorney error but principally due to the client antecedent criminality.wiley,supra,cal th at,d.
as a result,postconviction relief is often sufficient to afford a criminal defendant what he or she otherwise would have received if competent representation had been provided,including dismissal of the charges,a reduced sentence,or an advantageous plea bargain if the defendant has in fact committed a crime,the remedy of a new trial or other relief is sufficient reparation in light of the countervailing public policies and considering the purpose and function of constitutional guaranties.wiley,supra,cal th at,d.
wilkinson can not allege factual innocence under wiley.to the contrary,she entered no contest pleas to two misdemeanors in order to compromise the charges which resulted in her conviction by jury,a result inconsistent with factual innocence in that defendant has in fact committed a crime.wiley,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,wilkinson obtained the type of postconviction relief envisioned by wiley as sufficient to cure the harm of incompetent representation,since the trial court granted her habeas corpus petition and wilkinson received a more favorable disposition that did not include a felony.the postconviction relief obtained by wilkinson was sufficient to cure the harm,in that she was able to successfully seek dismissal of the charges,a reduced sentence,or an advantageous plea bargain.id.at,d.
it bears emphasis that no court has ever suggested that wilkinson is factually innocent of any of the charged offenses,including the felony battery on a custodial officer.to the contrary,she was convicted by a jury and her conviction as to all counts was affirmed on appeal.her habeas corpus petition did not raise an issue of factual innocence,but was based on constitutionally inadequate representation by zelen.after obtaining relief by her habeas corpus petition,wilkinson voluntarily entered no contest pleas to two misdemeanors,one of which was part of the original judgment in the criminal action,and both were based on the same course of conduct for which she was originally charged.given this record,the trial court did not err in sustaining the demurrer on the basis wilkinson could not establish factual innocence.
the requirement of exoneration 
in coscia,the supreme court addressed an issue left open in wiley whether a former criminal defendant must obtain exoneration by postconviction relief as a prerequisite to obtaining relief for legal malpractice.coscia,supra,cal th at,d.coscia plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate federal securities laws.he later brought a malpractice action,but the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend.coscia argued he should have been afforded leave to amend to allege that he plead guilty although he was factually innocent.the court of appeal reversed the order sustaining the demurrer,concluding that a plaintiff in a criminal malpractice action who pleaded guilty to the underlying offense is not collaterally estopped from proving actual innocence.coscia,supra,at,d.the supreme court granted review and reversed the court of appeal,holding exoneration by postconviction relief is a prerequisite to recovery for legal malpractice arising out of a criminal proceeding.see also redante yockelson th,d.
separate and apart from wilkinson failure to establish factual innocence under wiley,the decision in coscia serves as an independent bar to wilkinson action for legal malpractice,as she did not obtain exoneration by her habeas corpus petition.as discussed,public policy considerations require that only an innocent person wrongly convicted be deemed to have suffered a legally compensable harm.unless a person convicted of a criminal offense is successful in obtaining postconviction relief,the policies reviewed in wiley preclude recovery in a legal malpractice action.coscia,supra,cal th at,d.for all these reasons,we conclude that a plaintiff must obtain postconviction relief in the form of a final disposition of the underlying criminal example,by acquittal after retrial,reversal on appeal with directions to dismiss the charges,reversal followed by the people refusal to continue the prosecution,or a grant of habeas corpus a prerequisite to proving actual innocence in a malpractice action against former criminal defense counsel.id.at,d,fn.omitted.
the coscia requirement of exoneration was applied in sangha to a situation close,but not identical,to that presented in the instant case.while represented by labarbera,sangha plead guilty to felony vandalism in exchange for dismissal of a criminal threats charge.he later obtained new counsel,who successfully had the plea set aside with the prosecutor stipulation.sangha then entered a guilty plea to misdemeanor vandalism,a lesser included offense to the felony vandalism charge.sangha was placed on informal probation and days later,the trial court granted sangha petition to expunge the misdemeanor conviction under penal code section.sangha then sued labarbera for legal malpractice,alleging negligence in the investigation and handling of the action resulting in the felony plea,and further alleging factual innocence of the felony charge.sangha,supra,th at,d.
the trial court granted labarbera summary judgment motion on two grounds sangha could not establish factual innocence,and he failed to show postconviction exoneration as required by coscia.sangha,supra,th at,d.applying the policy factors discussed in wiley and coscia,we conclude sangha must show actual innocence on the misdemeanor vandalism offense,even though sangha limited his malpractice claim to the representation he received on the felony vandalism charge.sangha,supra,at,d.moreover,p ostconviction exoneration is a final disposition of the underlying case.coscia,supra,cal th at d.probation,however short,is not a final disposition exonerating the criminal defendant.here,sangha failed to introduce any evidence he received postconviction relief on his misdemeanor conviction.sangha,supra,at,d.
the only distinction between sangha and the instant case is that sangha ultimately entered a plea to a necessarily included offense,while wilkinson driving under the influence and interfering with an officer in the performance of his or her transactionally related offenses that did not qualify as necessarily included offenses of battery on a custodial officer the court in sangha specifically left open the issue of whether coscia requirement of exoneration applies to transactionally related offenses.because the issue has no bearing on our decision,we do not decide whether the actual innocence requirement applies to all transactionally related offenses.sangha,supra,th at,fn,d 
turning to the issue left open by sangha,we hold that wilkinson must be exonerated of all transactionally related offenses in order to satisfy the holding in coscia.because the judicially noticed facts unequivocally demonstrate that wilkinson plead no contest to two offenses transactionally related to the felony charge of battery on a custodial officer in order to settle the criminal action,and she was placed on probation for those offenses,she can not in good faith plead exoneration,and the demurrer was properly sustained.
this conclusion is consistent with the thrust of both wiley and coscia that one who engages in criminal wilkinson undisputedly not recover in a legal malpractice action.other remedies,such as a new trial or a plea to a reduced offense,as happened here,are a sufficient remedy for legal malpractice in a criminal prosecution.wiley,supra,cal th at,d.there is nothing in wiley or coscia that suggests our supreme court has any inclination to carve out an exception that would parse transactionally related offenses in the manner urged by wilkinson so as to allow a person convicted of multiple offenses to maintain a malpractice action.to the contrary,the gist of wiley and coscia is that one who commits a criminal offense may not bring a legal malpractice action.
we reject the suggestion that because this case reaches us at the demurrer stage a different result is required.in coscia,the court affirmed an order sustaining a demurrer on the ground the plaintiff could not establish exoneration of a charge to which he had plead guilty or no contest.coscia,supra,cal th at,d.the only reason leave to amend was granted in coscia was because the demurrer was sustained before wiley held that factual innocence was an element of a legal malpractice action following a criminal conviction.id.at,d.in light of the undisputed facts that are properly before the court by way of judicial notice,wilkinson can not in good faith plead exoneration of all transactionally related criminal charges and the demurrer was properly sustained.
as coscia,wiley,and sangha make clear,a plaintiff in a legal malpractice action based on an attorney handling of a criminal action may not prevail unless he or she is factually innocent and exonerated of criminal liability.wilkinson fails on both levels and the demurrer was properly sustained.
leave to amend 
wilkinson asks for leave to amend the complaint in the event this court determines the complaint was too broad and should be limited to a claim for damages on the felony penal code section charge.the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying leave to amend.
it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend a complaint after a demurrer is sustained if there is a reasonable possibility that the pleading can be cured by amendment.lee los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority th,d.the burden is on the plaintiff to demonstrate how he or she can amend the complaint.blank kirwan cal d.a plaintiff can make this showing in the first instance to the appellate court.lee los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority,supra,th at,d roman county of los angeles th,d.
the problem with wilkinson complaint is not that it is too broad in that it encompasses both the felony and misdemeanor charges against her.the difficulty with the complaint is that,given the immutable facts,wilkinson can not in good faith plead factual innocence of a crime or exoneration.
disposition 
the judgment is affirmed.zelen is awarded his costs on appeal.
