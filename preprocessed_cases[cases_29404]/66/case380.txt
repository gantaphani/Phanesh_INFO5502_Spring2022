petitioner alan marc freedman,hereafter defendant,seeks a writ of mandate ordering the trial court to vacate its order granting real party in interest steven charbonneau hereafter plaintiff motion to amend his medical malpractice complaint to add a punitive damages claim.see code civ,subd.a section a.the court excused plaintiff from the statutory deadline requiring him to file his motion no later than nine months before the first scheduled trial date.it did so pursuant to the test set forth in goodstein superior court th,d goodstein.and the court eliminated any prejudice to defendant by continuing the trial date and extending the discovery cutoff to provide ample opportunity for additional discovery and a summary judgment motion.
despite this facially reasonable ruling,we are compelled to set the ruling aside in deference to the deadline established by the legislature.even if we apply goodstein here,plaintiff failed to meet two of its prongs.plaintiff knew sufficient facts to file the motion before the statutory deadline.and to the extent plaintiff desired additional evidence,he did not conduct reasonably diligent discovery before the deadline.writ relief is warranted.
plaintiff had a cancerous tumor on one of his kidneys.he consented to surgery,including removal of the entire kidney if necessary.defendant performed the surgery on december,removing the tumor and leaving the kidney in place.after the operation,plaintiff suffered pain and unexpectedly high urine output through a surgically inserted drain.defendant concluded plaintiff ureter was obstructed,preventing urine from flowing normally from the kidney to the bladder.
plaintiff consented to defendant placing a stent between the kidney and the bladder on december.plaintiff was placed under general anesthetic as defendant inserted a scope to visualize the ureter.the ureter was completely blocked,preventing stent placement.as plaintiff lay in the recovery room,defendant obtained consent from plaintiff next of kin to perform exploratory surgery.
while performing the exploratory surgery,defendant discovered a surgical towel in plaintiff abdomen.the towel was compressing the ureter.defendant could not reopen the compressed ureter or insert a stent.he removed plaintiff kidney.
after the operation,defendant told plaintiff and his family about removing the kidney,but not about the surgical towel.defendant spoke again with plaintiff the next morning,still without mentioning the towel.defendant then discussed the matter with the hospital risk manager.immediately after their discussion,defendant and the risk manager met with plaintiff and his family to tell them about the towel.
plaintiff,represented by lawyer james daily,filed his complaint on november.he asserted causes of action against defendant and others for professional negligence,battery,and fraudulent concealment.he alleged defendant acted with malice,oppression,and fraud,but did not assert a claim for punitive damages.
the court held a case management conference on march,at which it set a trial date of february.the last date for plaintiff to timely move for leave to add a punitive damages claim was thus may.a.the record does not suggest plaintiff objected to the trial date.
the record shows no discovery by plaintiff over the next few months.in march,the court sustained defendant demurrer to the first amended complaint with leave to amend.plaintiff filed a second amended complaint,without a punitive damages claim.on april,daily moved to be relieved as plaintiff counsel.on may,daily wrote to defendant counsel to confirm a continuance of the hearing on defendant demurrer to the second amended complaint and a continuance of plaintiff deposition.
daily continued representing plaintiff as of may,deadline.the record lacks any evidence he had propounded any written discovery or deposed any witnesses on plaintiff behalf by that date.he did not file a motion for leave to amend to add a punitive damages claim.
in late may,plaintiff substituted in daniel hodes as his counsel.on may,hodes noticed defendant deposition for june.after discussion between counsel,the deposition was continued to a mutually convenient date in october.hodes deposed a codefendant,reed,on november.reed signed his deposition transcript on december.
plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a punitive damages claim on december.he asserted defendant acted with malice,oppression,or fraud by concealing the discovery of the surgical towel until the day after the exploratory surgery,and removing the kidney without obtaining consent from plaintiff or his next of kin before or during the exploratory surgery.defendant contended the motion was untimely and lacked merit.
the court granted the motion and continued the trial date to september.defendant filed a petition for an extraordinary writ,which we denied.the california supreme court granted defendant petition for review,transferred the matter to this court,and directed us to vacate our prior order and issue an order to show cause,which we have done.
discussion 
section a bars a plaintiff from filing a complaint containing a punitive damages claim based upon a health care provider professional negligence.it protects against the routine inclusion of sham punitive damage claims in medical malpractice actions.it apparently seeks to alleviate this problem by shifting to the plaintiff the procedural burden that would otherwise fall on the defendant to remove a frivolous or unsubstantiated claim early in the suit.goodstein,supra,th at,d.to assert a punitive damages claim based on medical malpractice,the plaintiff must file a motion for leave to amend the complaint and show a substantial probability of prevailing on the punitive damages claim.a.
section a imposes a strict deadline upon plaintiffs.any motion for leave to amend must be filed within two years after the complaint or initial pleading is filed or not less than nine months before the date the matter is first set for trial,whichever is earlier.a.f rom the language used in the statute,we can reasonably infer that the legislature provided the nine months prior to trial limitation for at least two important reasons to provide a health care defendant with adequate notice of the claim and an ample period to conduct appropriate discovery and to prevent the last minute insertion of a punitive damages claim into a case that has been prepared for trial without consideration of that issue.the adverse impact of such a tardy assertion on both trial preparation and settlement negotiations is obvious.goodstein,supra,th at,d.
goodstein crafted a narrow exception to the statutory deadline.there,due to fast track rules,trial was set at a status conference for a date less than nine months away.goodstein,supra,th at,d.the plaintiff conducted discovery and filed a section motion,which was denied as untimely.id.at,d.the goodstein court issued a writ directing the trial court to vacate its order.id.at,d.it explained,if in fact a plaintiff,by virtue of the quick trial setting practices of fast track courts,is placed in a position where she can not reasonably comply with the narrow time limits set out in section,then surely the court must retain the inherent power and authority to make an appropriate order to avoid injustice or unfairness.id.at,d.
the plaintiff bears a heavy burden to be excused from the statutory deadline,goodstein explained.goodstein,supra,th at,d.relief from the time limits specified in section should be granted only in those situations where a plaintiff has moved with reasonable dispatch and diligence and,through no fault of his or her own,has been placed in a position where compliance with the time mandate is impossible or reasonably impracticable.ibid.
goodstein set forth a test that,i n the context of the factual circumstances presented by this case,the plaintiff must satisfy to obtain relief.goodstein,supra,th at,d.the plaintiff must be able to show she was unaware of the facts or evidence necessary to make a proper motion under section more than nine months prior to the first assigned trial date,she made diligent,reasonable and good faith efforts to disco
