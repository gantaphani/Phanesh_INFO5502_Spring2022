this is a diversity action,a,in which the real party in moises mu√±iz salvador rovira for medical malpractice the case was tried to a jury from may through may,culminating in a verdict for in compensatory damages.after reducing the award to take into account sums paid by other defendants,see supra note,the court entered judgment for the plaintiff in the amount of.this appeal ensued.
winning battles often involves choosing one battleground.that maxim applies with particular force in adversarial litigation.we have made it transparently clear that the rule can neither be ignored nor brushed aside as a pettifogging technicality or a trap for the indolent.ass of soc.workers harwood,cir.rather,it is a prudential rule founded upon important considerations of fairness,judicial economy,and practical wisdom.id.thus,if a party forgoes objections in the district court,it becomes exponentially more difficult for him to mount those objections on appeal.see,united states bongiorno,cir admonishing that matters not squarely presented below generally can not be advanced on appeal teamsters union superline transp,cir describing as settled the principle that,with only a narrow band of exceptions,legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court can not be broached for the first time on appeal clauson smith,cir noting that we have regularly declined to consider points which were not seasonably advanced below.
the case at hand presents a textbook example of the rule in operation.it simultaneously illustrates just how rigorous a gauntlet an appellant must run if he has failed to raise below the points that he hopes will carry the day in the court of appeals.
briefly stated,the evidence at trial,taken,as required,in the light most favorable to the verdict,showed that the plaintiff mother had come under the care of rovira an obstetrician that she was a that the doctor knew as much and that this condition,together with her age and other factors,made her a patient.the jury heard testimony from which it could have found that,despite these looming risks,rovira failed adequately to monitor either the mother or the fetus during the latter stages of the pregnancy,he did not regularly record or control the mother blood sugar levels,he eschewed oxytocin challenge tests,and he neglected to order serial ultrasound examinations.when the baby moises was born,he was quite twelve pounds.the jury could have found that rovira did not properly manage the birthing process,he attempted a vaginal delivery despite the baby size and,even then,he did not use a series of specific maneuvers that would have minimized the risk of injuring the infant.in all events,the plaintiff was born with a brachial plexus injury,erb palsy,and a shoulder dystocia.there was competent medical evidence that these conditions were likely to be both permanent and painful.
on appeal,the defendant advances four assignments of error.in the present procedural posture of the case,none has the slightest merit.
as an opening salvo,the defendant attempts to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence.in the best of circumstances,insufficiency challenges confront a daunting standard of review.an inquiring court must construe all the evidence in the light most hospitable to the verdict.municipality of san juan,cir.in so doing,the court may not judge the veracity of witnesses,resolve testimonial conflicts,or assay the weight of the evidence.gibson city of cranston,cir.the evidence will be deemed insufficient only if the record,viewed from this perspective and without regard to credibility or weight,is such that reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome,at.
in this case,rovira faces an even more demanding standard.he neglected to file a motion for judgment as a matter of law in the district court when both sides had rested by like token,he abjured the filing of a motion for a new trial subsequent to the verdict.given these defaults,he has forfeited his right to test the sufficiency of the evidence in the usual way.see hammond litle,cir la amiga del pueblo,robles,cir jusino zayas,cir.this lapse leaves open only the narrowest avenue of possible relief.absent a timely motion either for judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial,the court of appeals can pay heed to an insufficiency challenge only if it finds that the verdict,if allowed to stand,will work a clear and gross injustice.hammond,at.
there is no hint of a clear and gross injustice here.to prevail in his medical malpractice action under puerto rico law,the plaintiff was required to show i that the defendant failed to follow basic precepts of knowledge and medical care applicable to a practitioner in his speciality,and ii that his acts or omissions caused the plaintiff injuries.lama borras,cir,at.taken at face value,the expert testimony offered by the plaintiff fully satisfied these requirements.
one expert,nathanson,stated unequivocally that the defendant deviated from the applicable standard of care by neglecting to perform the type of prenatal monitoring that is customary for patients.the same witness opined that the defendant failed adequately to manage the plaintiff shoulder dystocia during labor and,thus,caused the nerve damage that led to his brachial plexus injury and erb palsy.another expert,hausknecht,offered opinion evidence sufficient to meet the causation prong and,in addition,testified that the harm inflicted by the defendant lack of due care will affect the plaintiff for the remainder of his life.although the defense presented contradictory expert testimony,that does nothing to vitiate the sufficiency of the plaintiff proof.united states alicea,cir reaffirming,in connection with an insufficiency challenge,that credibility determinations are for the jury,not for an appellate court.
when the record as a whole plausibly supports more than one answer to a question of fact,the evidence is said to be sufficient no matter which way the jury decides.see,la amiga,at.that principle controls here.the defendant challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence is,therefore,a lost cause.
the defendant asserts,in retrospect,that the plaintiff counsel engaged in misconduct by making inflammatory comments during both his opening statement and his closing argument.we say in retrospect because,when the comments were made,the defendant interposed no contemporaneous objection to any of them.hence,our review is only for plain error.doty sewall,cir united states,cir.
the plain error hurdle is high.review for plain error entails four showings that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the appellant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.the defendant can not conceivably vault that hurdle here.
we need not dwell on the allegedly improper statements.they consist,for the most part,of references to the plaintiff as a little boy,descriptions of the extent of his injuries,allusions to the importance of the case,and so on and so forth it suffices to say that we have conducted a painstaking review of the transcript.that review makes it abundantly clear that the plaintiff counsel gave no quarter.he took full advantage of the sympathetic nature of his case and,on occasion,he sailed close to the wind.we find no indication,however,that counsel crossed the thin line that separates vigorous advocacy from impermissible appeals to passion or prejudice.see supra note.by like token,we find no indication that improper rhetoric influenced the outcome of the trial.there is a critical difference between a lawyer who hits hard and a lawyer who hits below the belt.berger united states.w hile an attorney may strike hard blows,he is not at liberty to strike foul ones.the plaintiff opening statement and closing argument in this case both were,but neither was manifestly improper.
to say more on this point would be supererogatory.we conclude,without serious question,that the defendant has not demonstrated plain error with respect to either the plaintiff opening statement or the plaintiff summation.see united states taylor,cir explaining that reversal is not justified unless the illegitimate portion of the closing argument so poisoned the well that the trial outcome was likely affected quoting,at.
the defendant next argues that the district court erred in failing to give a stronger instruction concerning the jury obligation to render a verdict solely on the basis of the evidence and uncontaminated by undue passion,prejudice,or sympathy.but the specter of procedural default again looms large the defendant did not request such an instruction at the charge conference,nor did he object to the charge as given.under these circumstances,he is at a huge if disadvantage in this venue.see.see also moore murphy,cir holding that a failure to object to jury instructions at the time,and in the manner,designated by rule is treated as a procedural default.silence after instructions ordinarily constitutes a forfeiture of any objections,putnam res.pateman,cir and this case is within the.
to be sure,even absent proper compliance with rule,we can review jury instructions for plain error.see,chestnut city of lowell,cir en banc per curiam wells real estate,greater lowell bd.of realtors,cir.in this context,however,the plain error doctrine requires the appellant to show,at a bare minimum,that the alleged error seriously affected the fairness or integrity of the trial.see toscano chandris,cir.the defendant has made no such showing here.
the district court charge was fair and balanced.while it did not contain the exact terminology that the defendant now says he would have preferred,the court did tell the jury that a ll cases and all parties must be measured only under the rule of law,without reference to anything else.this instruction followed hot on the heels of an instruction in which the court noted that i n the business of judging,there is no place for such feelings,which,in context,was a reference back to the court cautionary language about the role of sympathy,prejudice,passion or public opinion.
we discern no plain error.the trial court locution,though perhaps a trifle awkward,made the same point as the phrasing that the defendant belatedly endorses.given the standard of review,that nuanced difference is of no moment.
there are few,if any,magic words in jury instructions beyond a reasonable doubt may be an exception,but it is hard to think of others.in the main,a party does not possess a right to insist that the trial court instruct the jury in the particular phraseology that he desires.see,united states destefano,cir putnam,at.it stands to reason,then,that a party has no right to criticize the court for using one roughly equivalent formulation rather than another when the party has not,by a timely request objection,made its preference known.trial judges are not expected to be mind readers.united states barnes,cir.the defendant unpreserved challenge to the jury instructions must,therefore,fail.
this leaves the defendant last,and most loudly bruited,asseveration that the jury award of damages was grossly excessive.this asseveration has two facets.
first,the defendant contends that the parents neglected to ensure that moises received prompt neurologic attention and physical therapy,and,thus,that the award is too munificent because moises failed to mitigate damages.the district court,responding to this contention,charged the jury as follows 
mitigation is a concept requiring the victim of a damage sic to take reasonable steps to reduce the damages suffered mitigation is,therefore,a concept to be considered in calculating damages if deemed applicable to the facts of this case.
the defendant did not object to this instruction and it is,therefore,the law of the case milone moceri family,cir.the plaintiff did object to the instruction,but he has not taken a.
it must be remembered that,in this case,the parents filed no claims to their own behoof.see supra note.given that circumstance,the brunt of the defendant mitigation argument falls squarely on the minor child.we question whether the law requires a minor plaintiff to bear some legal onus because his parents dallied in securing medical attention for him.see,young ex rel.young washington,concluding that when parents bring an action solely on behalf of their minor child,the parents failure to mitigate damages is irrelevant.this question looms especially large because the court carefully limited its charge on mitigation to the victim here,a reference to moises,not to his the defendant interposed no objection.
in all events,we do not need to answer this intriguing question today.for one thing,the jury apparently rejected the defendant claim we say apparently because the jury made no special finding on the point.for another thing,the defendant has presented his mitigation claim to us in skeletal form,without citation to any pertinent authority.it is a bedrock appellate rule that issues raised perfunctorily,without developed argumentation,will not be considered on appeal.see united states zannino,cir.we deem that rule apposite here.
the remaining facet of the defendant asseveration is more conventional.he argues or attempts to argue that the verdict is simply too large to warrant a judicial imprimatur.the barriers that stand in the way of this argument are formidable.
if a defendant properly preserves an objection to the amount of a compensatory damage award,we inquire whether the nisi prius court committed an abuse of discretion in refusing either to trim or to set aside the verdict.mcdonald fed,cir.we long have recognized that t ranslating legal damage into money in cases which involve few significant items of measurable economic a matter peculiarly within a jury ken.wagenmann adams,cir.when,as now,a plaintiff injuries fall within this sphere and no objective way to measure pecuniary damages exists,courts must defer broadly to the jury judgment unless the amount of damages awarded is grossly excessive,inordinate,shocking to the conscience of the court,or so high that it would be a denial of justice to permit it to stand.segal gilbert color,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
such a standard is,by its very nature,is no scientific formula or measuring device that can be applied to place an exact dollar value on noneconomic doubts typically are resolved in favor of the verdict.see,wagenmann,at mcdonald,at.thus,abuses of discretion are not easily established in this context.
here,however,the defendant neither asked for a new trial nor sought a remittitur in the lower court.he thereby deprived the district had seen and heard the witnesses at first any opportunity to the award.by the same token,he deprived us of the benefit of the district judge informed evaluation.these omissions render rovira claim of excessiveness forfeit.see ortiz velez,cir,cert.denied,d huard,cir braunstein.bank trust,cir.forfeited claims are reviewed only for plain error,at.at most,then,our review is limited to correcting an award that is totally unsupported by the evidence or so as to constitute a miscarriage of justice.
the verdict before us easily passes this screen.in dealing with unpreserved claims of excessiveness,an appellate court must view the evidence of damages in the light most favorable to the verdict winner.the plaintiff,who was only three years old at the time of trial,has a long life expectancy.the record contains expert testimony,particularly that of hausknecht,to the effect that the plaintiff left arm and shoulder are permanently afflicted with erb palsy and that,notwithstanding several surgical interventions,they are functionally impaired.the record is also replete with evidence of the pain endured and to be endured by the plaintiff.taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,a tapestry of significant,painful,and permanent injuries emerges.silhouetted against this tapestry,the jury award of damages seems large,but not unacceptably so.
the short of it is that the verdict derives at least a modicum of support from the evidence.on this chiaroscuro record,we can not say that the award was so extravagant as to exceed the outermost total which,by a process of rational appraisal,could fairly be said to flow from the evidence adduced at trial.ruiz gonzalez c
