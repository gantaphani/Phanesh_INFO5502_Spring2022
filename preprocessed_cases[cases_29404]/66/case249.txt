appellant robert mosier is the court appointed receiver for private equity management group,and its interrelated subsidiaries and affiliates collectively,pemgroup.mosier was appointed after the former directors and mangers of pemgroup used the companies to defraud investors of approximately million in what the district court called a massive ponzi scheme.
mosier sued appellee stonefield josephson,the cpas who audited the financial statements for six of pemgroup fraudulent offerings.mosier contends that stonefield reports and related conduct materially misrepresented pemgroup financial condition,allowing pemgroup management to prolong the life of their scheme and to loot and to dissipate assets from pemgroup.according to mosier,if stonefield had performed its audits competently or simply resigned after it caught wind of management fraud,pemgroup could not have attracted new investors.mosier seeks million from stonefield in compensation for damages the firm allegedly caused to pemgroup.
mosier first amended complaint stated three causes of action professional negligence,aiding and abetting the wrongful conversion of pemgroup assets,and unjust enrichment.on summary judgment challenging all three claims,the district court dismissed the first two,holding that mosier had not raised a genuine issue as to the existence of an essential aspect of his case proof of causation.specifically,the district court held that to show causation,mosier ultimately would have to demonstrate that either pemgroup or its investors relied on stonefield audits,but that mosier had utterly failed to satisfy this legal requirement.moreover,the court concluded that any reliance on the audits by the investors would have been unreasonable.as to claim three for unjust enrichment,the court also granted summary judgment.although stonefield challenged this cause of action in its motion,mosier did not respond to or defend it in his response.
we have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to,and we affirm.
background 
danny pang founded pemgroup.together with pemgroup directors and management,pang established genesis voyager equity corporation gvec and its related entities gvec ii and gvec iv as subsidiaries of pemgroup.these entities,known as special purpose vehicles,eventually became parts of an integrated swindle.
gvec made debt and equity offerings in life insurance offerings allegedly raised million.in its offering memoranda,gvec told investors to expect a return on their investments of between approximately six to seven percent.however,eventually the returns gvec paid did not come from its investments.gvec fraudulently paid its investors with money from new investors and by selling gvec assets to gvec ii and gvec iv at prices.in addition to paying old investors with new investor money,management used the money from unsuspecting investors to prop up gvec by paying gvec overhead and retiring older offerings.management also looted money from pemgroup for their own personal benefit.
in,gvec hired stonefield to audit the financial statements for six of its offerings.stonefield issued ten audit reports for fiscal years through.mosier alleged that these reports fell below generally accepted auditing standards gaas in a variety of ways.however,stonefield cardinal sin in mosier eyes was stonefield alleged failure sufficiently to warn investors that gvec management had not accurately reported the value of its assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap.mosier estimates that gvec misstated the value of eighty to ninety percent of the assets in the financial statements.
beginning with its march report,a wary stonefield issued qualified opinions about their client operations.a qualified opinion states that,except for the effects of the matter s to which the qualification relates,the financial statements present fairly,in all material respects,the financial position,results of operations,and cash flows of the entity in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
extending through the end of stonefield relationship with pemgroup,each of stonefield audit reports expressed significant reservations about its client improper method of assigning value to its assets and the unknown effects of those questionable practices on its financial statements.for example,stonefield independent auditors report dated march,says,
t he company has valued certain investments growth special assets at a method similar to an amortized cost basis,which basis values the investment at historical cost.any potential unrealized gain resulting from these growth special assets is then amortized on a basis over their estimated life.in our opinion,accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require that all investments be presented at fair value,and all corresponding changes in fair value between balance sheet dates be recorded to the statement of operations.the company has elected to not disclose the exact nature of all of the special assets for confidentiality purposes,which is also a departure from accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.the effects on the financial statements of the preceding practice is not reasonably determinable.
in a summary note to stonefield report,the misgivings continued 
the company is recognizing unrealized gain resulting from the growth special assets on a basis method over the estimated life of the growth special assets,which method is not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap.us gaap requires that all investments be presented at fair value,and all corresponding changes in fair value between balance sheet dates be recorded to the statement of operations.the effects on the financial statements of this non gaap practice are not reasonably determinable.
in a letter dated april,addressed to board of directors and inventors genesis voyager equity corporation,stonefield warned that gvec 
r ecording of the sale of special assets were not in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.the special assets of the portfolio were sold to an affiliated entity that shares the same advisor as gvec.furthermore the valuation for the sale price of the special assets could not be concluded to be fair market value independently of management internal valuation.
in mosier opinion,however,stonefield series of qualified reports did not go far enough.given the extent to which gvec admittedly misstated asset values,mosier alleges that stonefield should have issued either an adverse opinion or refused to issue any opinion at all and simultaneously to unload gvec as a client.an adverse opinion states that the financial statements do not present fairly the financial position,results of operations,or cash flows of the entity in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.au,supra.
stonefield involvement with gvec and pemgroup went beyond issuing qualified audit reports.stonefield attended a meeting with at least one investor,although the record does not reveal what stonefield said during the meeting.also,stonefield authored comfort letters,which stated that its qualified audit reports were prepared in accordance with gaas and fairly described the quality or reliability of the relevant financial statements.two of stonefield auditors served as a character reference for danny pang and another of pemgroup managers.finally,stonefield prepared for gvec board of directors and investors net asset valuations and limited reports concerning two of the sales between gvec and its affiliates.
stonefield never had an entirely comfortable relationship with gvec.early on,stonefield learned that its predecessor had resigned as gvec cpa after gvec misrepresented the predecessor involvement with gvec initial funding period.furthermore,the manner in which pemgroup structured gvec and its offerings,soliciting only chinese investors,basing its operations in the british virgin islands,and promising seemingly unsustainable rates of return raised stonefield concerns.as time went on,stonefield began seriously to question gvec operations,management integrity and competence,and whether stonefield should resign.ultimately,stonefield did resign,but not until april,after it learned that the sec had filed a complaint against pang and pemgroup,and that the fbi had arrested pang.
on whose behalf may mosier sue stonefield 
to understand this controversy,some focus is useful.
at the early stages of the litigation,stonefield moved to dismiss mosier first amended complaint pursuant to.b on the ground that mosier lacked standing to sue on behalf of the defrauded investors.the court concluded that mosier had standing to sue stonefield,but not to do so on behalf of the investors.the court explained its analysis and ruling as follows 
in general,a receiver has capacity to bring only such actions as could have been brought by the entity or individual whose property is in a receivership,and thus may sue only to redress injuries to the entity in receivership.grant leach.see also scholes lehmann,cir.in contrast,equity receiver or trustee of an entity can not pursue claims where the alleged harm was suffered only by investors in that entity.see williams california bank,cir hays adam,d,noting that third party investors may nonetheless indirectly benefit from the receiver action as creditors of the receivership.as the ninth circuit has noted,a lthough the line between claims of the debtor,which a trustee or equity receiver has statutory authority to assert,and claims of creditors,which caplin marine midland grace trust,d bars the trustee from pursuing,is not always clear,the focus of the inquiry is on whether the trustee is seeking to redress injuries to the debtor itself caused by the defendants alleged conduct.smith arthur andersen llp,cir.
here,upon reviewing the fac,the court finds that the allegations show that,in bringing this action,the receiver seeks to redress injuries caused to pemgroup and its affiliate entities by stonefield alleged misconduct.the receiver,for example,has alleged that stonefield owed,and breached,a contractual duty of care to pemgroup and gvec to conduct and audit of the company financial statements using the appropriate industry standards.fac.he goes on to assert that stonefield breach of this duty allowed the pemgroup principals to dissipate gvec assets through transfers to other tranches when gvec was unable to pay its operating expenses,which ultimately led to the retirement of gvec portfolios once those portfolios had been looted of their assets.fac.further,according to the pleading,h ad the misuse of funds been revealed earlier,pang and the pemgroup management team would have been stopped and investigated,preventing millions of dollars of additional losses.fac.
while certain allegations in the fac could conceivably be said to allege injury to investors as well,this does not necessarily vitiate the receiver standing to pursue claims on behalf of the receivership entities.rather,as the ninth circuit has acknowledged,so long as an entity in receivership has suffered harm,an equity receiver has standing to pursue a claim for such injuries even if the creditors of the receivership entity may also have a claim arising from the same underlying misconduct.smith arthur andersen llp,cir noting that the dissipation of assets limited the firm ability to repay its debts is not,however,a concession that only the creditors,and not the corporate entity itself,have sustained any injury.i t is a recognition of the economic reality that any injury to an insolvent firm is necessarily felt by its creditors.
here,similarly,the receiver has alleged that stonefield failures to conduct rigorous audits in accordance with gaas standards,fac to make disclosures regarding,inter alia,allegedly improper transfers,fac,and stonefield allegedly false and misleading audit reports were all significant factors in concealing pang and pemgroup principals misuse of investor funds.fac.according to the pleading,had the misuse of funds been revealed earlier,additional losses would have not been incurred.id.the court finds that,as in smith,these allegations qualify as a corporate injury traceable to stonefield conduct for which the receiver is authorized to seek recovery.additionally,while stonefield contends that pemgroup use of funds from later tranches to purchase life insurance policies from earlier gvec tranches at inflated prices actually benefitted gvec in that it served to maintain the illusion of the financial and operational strength of pemgroup,reply,evaluation of this assertion requires the court to look beyond the pleadings.at this stage in the proceedings,however,the court must take as true the receiver allegations that the pemgroup and gvec entities were harmed by,inter alia,their inability to repay various note and debenture holders as a result of stonefield alleged misconduct.see cousins lockyer,cir.
the consequences of the district court rule b holding on standing,which mosier does not challenge on appeal,is that his lawsuit requires a viable cause of action not on behalf of the investors,but on behalf of pemgroup.
accordingly,there are two avenues mosier as a receiver might pursue against stonefield on behalf of the derelict pemgroup.the first is a professional negligence claim,that stonefield provided pemgroup with substandard and misleading audit reports which wrongly enabled pemgroup to continue to exist as it plundered its own assets.this path alleged a breach by stonefield of its contractual duty to pemgroup.the second avenue is an aiding and abetting claim,that stonefield created substandard and misleading audit reports which caused investors to continue to pour money into pemgroup,and which kept it alive,facilitated its illicit fundraising activities,pumped up the enterprise,gave it a badge of legitimacy,and brought in millions of dollars which danny pang and associates then stole.
reasonable reliance is a necessary component of mosier professional negligence and aiding and abetting claims.
no matter which avenue mosier pursues,his professional negligence as well as his aiding and abetting claims require mosier to prove that stonefield tortious conduct was a proximate cause of pemgroup harm.see williams wraxall,th,d causation in a professional negligence claim requires proof that the defendant conduct was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm to the plaintiff.emphasis added neilson union bank of california,d,c ausation is an essential element of an aiding and abetting claim,plaintiff must show that the aider and abettor provided assistance that was a substantial factor in causing the harm suffered.emphasis added cited with approval in american master lease llc idanta partners,th,d.
given mosier case,in order to prove causation he must ultimately prove reasonable reliance,even though reliance per se is not a technical element of his causes of action.stonefield work could not have been a substantial factor or given substantial assistance to pemgroup in soliciting new investors unless the potential investors relied on stonefield reports.the district court therefore properly concluded that to survive summary judgment,mosier would have to offer substantial evidence meaning sufficient evidence to justify a verdict in his favor that investors reasonably relied on stonefield audits in order to show causation.the cases the district court cited support that conclusion.see smolen deloitte,haskins sells,cir see also in re nm holdings,llc,cir although gold is correct in pointing out that reliance is not per se an element of professional negligence,proof of reliance is necessary here in order to show that deloitte allegedly deficient audits were the cause in fact of venture tenuous financial position and resulting bankruptcy.emphasis added ernst young,cir if nobody relied upon the audit,then the audit could not have been a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.internal quotation marks omitted.
mosier disagrees that proof of reasonable reliance is necessary in order to show causation,relying on smith arthur andersen llp,cir.there,the bankruptcy trustee alleged that the debtor auditors committed professional malpractice by concealing the debtor deepen
