for over years,courts have been grappling with the following issue,appearing in various factual scenarios when a person seeking medical care contracts with a health care provider to resolve all medical malpractice claims through arbitration,does that agreement apply to the resolution of wrongful death claims,when the claimants are not themselves signatory to the arbitration agreement to resolve this issue,we must consider on the one hand the fact that wrongful death claims in the state are not derivative claims but are independent actions accruing to a decedent heirs,as well as the fact that generally arbitration can be compelled only when a party has consented to the arbitration.on the other hand,we must address code of civil procedure section which as explained below,contemplates that all medical malpractice claims,including wrongful death claims,may be subject to arbitration agreements between a health care provider and the patient.
we hold that all wrongful death claimants are bound by arbitration agreements entered into pursuant to section,at least when,as here,the language of the agreement manifests an intent to bind these claimants.this holding carries out the intent of the legislature that enacted section and related statutes.
factual background 
the facts of this case relevant to this opinion are not in dispute.rafael ruiz attended an appointment at the office of anatol podolsky,an orthopedic surgeon,on july,about the treatment of a fractured hip.on the same day,they both signed a arbitration agreement.the agreement provided for the arbitration of any malpractice claims,consistent with the language of section,further described below.the agreement further provided that it was the intention of the parties that this agreement binds all parties whose claims may arise out of or relate to treatment or service provided by the physician including any spouse or heirs of the patient and any children,whether born or unborn,at the time of the occurrence giving rise to the claim.elsewhere the agreement specifically provided for arbitration of wrongful death and loss of consortium claims.
ruiz died on july.in july,alejandra ruiz the wife and the four adult children,alejandro,ana,diana,and samuel collectively referred to as the adult children filed an action against podolsky,and other health care providers who are not parties to this appeal,alleging claims for medical malpractice and wrongful death.they maintained that podolsky and the other named defendants failed to adequately identify and treat rafael hip fracture resulting in complications,and eventually his death.
podolsky filed an answer to the complaint,and attached a copy of the arbitration agreement he made with rafael.a few months later,podolsky filed a petition to compel arbitration.the wife conceded she was subject to the arbitration agreement.however,she and the other heirs argued that because only one plaintiff was bound to arbitrate,the court should allow the parties to proceed in the trial court to avoid inconsistent verdicts,unnecessary delay,multiple actions,and duplicative discovery.podolsky responded that the adult children were swept up into the arbitration agreement along with the wife due to the one action rule for wrongful death suits.
the trial court disagreed.it denied the petition as to the adult children,and granted the petition as to the wife.the court stayed the action pending resolution of arbitration to avoid the possibility of inconsistent rulings.it set a date by which arbitration must be completed and also scheduled a postarbitration status conference date.podolsky appealed the order denying arbitration.the wife did not appeal.
the court of appeal concluded that the wife was bound by the arbitration agreement through principles of equitable estoppel and invited error.nonetheless,it concluded the trial court was correct to deny the petition to compel arbitration as to the adult children.it concluded that because the adult children had not consented to the arbitration,they were not now required to arbitrate.nor did the court of appeal find any reason for compelling the adult children to arbitrate their claims simply because the wife was so compelled.we granted review.
ii.the statutory background 
because the case requires us in some sense to reconcile the special health care arbitration statute with the wrongful death statute,we begin with a review of these two statutes.
section,subdivision a provides any contract for medical services which contains a provision for arbitration of any dispute as to professional negligence of a health care provider shall have such provision as the first article of the contract and shall be expressed in the following language it is understood that any dispute as to medical malpractice,that is as to whether any medical services rendered under this contract were unnecessary or unauthorized or were improperly,negligently or incompetently rendered,will be determined by submission to arbitration as provided by california law,and not by a lawsuit or resort to court process except as california law provides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings.both parties to this contract,by entering into it,are giving up their constitutional right to have any such dispute decided in a court of law before a jury,and instead are accepting the use of arbitration.italics added.
subdivision b of the same statute states immediately before the signature line provided for the individual contracting for the medical services must appear the following in at least bold red type 
notice by signing this contract you are agreeing to have any issue of medical malpractice decided by neutral arbitration and you are giving up your right to a jury or court trial.see article of this contract.
as we stated in reigelsperger siller cal th,reigelsperger section was enacted as part of the medical injury compensation reform act of micra.stats,ch.micra was a response to a perceived crisis regarding the availability of medical malpractice insurance.the problem arose when the insurance companies which issued virtually all of the medical malpractice insurance policies in california determined that the costs of affording such coverage were so high that they would no longer continue to provide such coverage as they had in the past.some of the insurers withdrew from the medical malpractice field entirely,while others raised the premiums which they charged to doctors and hospitals to what were frequently referred to as skyrocketing rates.as a consequence,many doctors decided either to stop providing medical care with respect to certain high risk procedures or treatment,to terminate their practice in this state altogether,or to go bare,to practice without malpractice insurance.the result was that in parts of the state medical care was not fully available,and patients who were treated by uninsured doctors faced the prospect of obtaining only unenforceable judgments if they should suffer serious injury as a result of malpractice.citation.the purpose of section is to encourage and facilitate arbitration of medical malpractice disputes.citations.accordingly,the provisions of section are to be construed liberally.in other words,the encouragement of arbitration as a speedy and relatively inexpensive means of dispute resolution moncharsh heily blase cal th,furthers micra goal of reducing costs in the resolution of malpractice claims and therefore malpractice insurance premiums.
because section,subdivision a contemplates arbitration agreements to resolve disputes concerning professional negligence,the definition of that term is particularly critical to the understanding of this case.professional negligence is defined in section,subdivision g as a negligent act or omission to act by a health care provider in the rendering of professional services,which act or omission is the proximate cause of a personal injury or wrongful death,provided that such services are within the scope of services for which the provider is licensed and which are not within any restriction imposed by the licensing agency or licensed hospital.italics added.
b.the wrongful death statute 
section authorizes a wrongful death action by specified persons including the decedent spouse and children.unlike some jurisdictions wherein wrongful death actions are derivative,code of civil procedure section creates a new cause of action in favor of the heirs as beneficiaries,based upon their own independent pecuniary injury suffered by loss of a relative,and distinct from any the deceased might have maintained had he survived.citations.horwich superior court cal th,italics omitted horwich.
as was stated in san diego gas electric superior court th,any wrongful death recovery is in the form of a lump sum verdict determined according to each heir separate interest in the decedent life citation,with each heir required to prove his or her own individual loss in order to share in the verdict.citation.because a wrongful death action compensates an heir for his or her own independent pecuniary losses,it is one for personal injury to the heir.citations.thus,in a wrongful death action the injury is not the general loss of the decedent,but the particular loss of the decedent to each individual claimant.
iii.the case law 
courts have long struggled with the issue of whether arbitration agreements between health care providers and patients bind spouses and children of the patients who file wrongful death actions.a survey of the cases does not reveal a simple conflict,but rather a more complex taxonomy under varied factual circumstances.
in one camp are the health plan cases,in which one or more of the family members asserting the wrongful death claim belong to the same health plan as the decedent,and in which the decedent signed the arbitration agreement on behalf of himself and those other family members.in hawkins superior court d the decedent had enrolled himself and his family in the kaiser foundation plan.id.at.he agreed to a contract containing an arbitration provision applying to any claim arising from the violation of a legal duty incident to this agreement.ibid.when he died of cancer his wife filed a wrongful death action against the plan and others and defendants petitioned to compel arbitration.the court affirmed that the wife was bound by the arbitration agreement signed by the husband.it acknowledged the general rule that a person can not be compelled to accept arbitration of a dispute he has not agreed to submit to arbitration.id.at.but it recognized that the rule had been qualified.the hawkins court relied on doyle guiliucci cal d,in which this court held that a parent who contracted with a health plan to cover a minor child was empowered to bind the child to an arbitration agreement when the minor asserted a malpractice claim.id.at.hawkins also relied on madden kaiser foundation hospitals cal d madden,in which this court held that a state employee was bound by an arbitration provision that was part of an agreement negotiated between the health care plan and the state employees retirement system.similarly,the decedent had the power to agree to a health care contract that would bind both his wife and himself.hawkins,supra,d at.
in herbert superior court d herbert,perhaps the leading case in this area,petitioners were the widow and children of decedent clarence herbert.herbert and his wife and five minor children were members of the kaiser foundation health plan.herbert three adult children were not members.he agreed to arbitrate malpractice claims and the question was whether his widow and children were bound by that agreement in a wrongful death action.id.at.
the court first determined that the wife and minor children were bound to arbitrate under the reasoning of doyle and hawkins for reasons stated in those opinions.herbert,supra,d at.the court then considered whether the adult children not a part of the health plan should be bound by the arbitration agreement.the herbert court concluded in the affirmative,for reasons both doctrinal and pragmatic the reasons requiring the nonsigning heirs to be bound by the agreement are far more convincing than any arguments in support of the trial court order that would require two separate and distinct proceedings.first,we can not ignore the established law that a single cause of action exists in the heirs for the wrongful death of a decedent.mayerhoff kaiser foundation health plan,d.this requirement alone should prevent a splitting of the litigation into different tribunals where differing rulings and results could destroy the legislature policy enunciated in mayerhoff.second,it is obviously unrealistic to require the signatures of all the heirs,since they are not even identified until the time of death,or they might not be available when their signatures are required.furthermore,if they refused to sign they should not be in a position possibly to delay medical treatment to the party in need.although wrongful death is technically a separate statutory cause of action in the heirs,it is in a practical sense derivative of a cause of action in the deceased.decedents are able to bind their heirs through wills and other testamentary dispositions so the concept is not new or illogical.instead it is the only pragmatic solution in such a situation.herbert,supra,d at.
also critical to the herbert court determination was the enactment of section,providing for arbitration of professional negligence claims,including wrongful death.subdivisions a through c of that section set forth strict requirements for a valid medical malpractice arbitration provision in an individual contract for medical services.although these requirements are inapplicable to health care service plans such as kaiser code civ,subd.f,this is only because such plans must contain alternative means for notifying plan members of arbitration provisions in the plan agreements.under section,arbitration of wrongful death or other professional negligence claims may not be compelled if the requirements of that section are not met.it logically follows that arbitration provisions may be enforced where,as here,proper notice of the arbitration provision is given.herbert,supra,d at,fn.omitted see also drissi foundation hospitals,d following herbert clay permanente medical group d,same.
on the other hand,when a wrongful death or loss of consortium claim is asserted,but none of the plaintiffs are bound to the arbitration agreement by common plan membership,courts are divided as to whether nonsignatory plaintiffs are obliged to arbitrate.in baker birnbaum d baker the wife brought suit against a health care provider for malpractice.although she was a signatory to the arbitration agreement,the husband who sued for loss of consortium was not.only the husband appealed from the trial court order to arbitrate the loss of consortium claim.baker,supra,at.thus baker unlike herbert and hawkins was not a wrongful death case.
after affirming that binding arbitration requires the consent of the parties,the baker court distinguished hawkins.the agreement in hawkins was worded broadly to encompass all claims,whereas baker contracted for medical care solely on her own behalf,and the agreement to arbitrate related only to such services as would be provided to her under that contract.baker,supra,d at.the baker court also distinguished herbert,inasmuch as the latter case involved a group plan negotiated between parties possessing parity of bargaining strength baker,supra,at and that herbert acknowledges that an individual contract for medical services,as is involved here,should be more rigorously analyzed and less quickly applied to the claims of a nonsignatory.id.at.
the baker court went further,however,and declined to follow herbert.baker,supra,d at.we must expressly decline to follow herbert,however,in that it,as appellant argues,would apparently attempt,even in this situation,to force respondent herein to arbitrate solely to avoid litigation of these claims in two different tribunals.ibid.
in gross recabaren d,gross,the husband filed a medical malpractice complaint related to his surgery,and his wife,a nonsignatory to the arbitration agreement,filed a loss of consortium claim.id.at.therefore gross,like baker and unlike herbert and hawkins,was a loss of consortium rather than wrongful death case.the gross court was persuaded by herbert construction of section.most significant for the court in gross was the fact that a requirement that persons other than the patient sign the arbitration agreement in order to be bound by that agreement would result in a substantial loss of privacy to the patient.t o authorize an intrusion into a patient confidential relationship with a physician as the price for guaranteeing a third person,even a spouse,access to a jury trial on matters arising from the patient own treatment,poses problems of a particularly serious nature.one might hope that spouses will voluntarily communicate with each other regarding their respective medical treatment,whether it involves a routine matter or a most intimate and sensitive procedure such as a vasectomy or the termination of a pregnancy.nonetheless,it would be impermissible to adopt a rule that would require them,or their physicians,to do so,or that would permit one spouse to exercise a type of veto power over the other decisions.yet construing section to require a spouse concurrence in an arbitration agreement would,in certain situations at least,have exactly that effect.gross,supra,d at,italics omitted.
based on these considerations,the gross court stated its holding broadly we therefore hold that where,as here,a patient expressly contracts to submit to arbitration any dispute as to medical malpractice,and that agreement fully complies with code of civil procedure section,it must be deemed to apply to all medical malpractice claims arising out of the services contracted for,regardless of whether they are asserted by the patient or a third party.gross,supra,d at,italics omitted accord,bolanos khalatian d.
mormile sinclair th mormile also relied on section to conclude that a nonsignatory husband loss of consortium claim was encompassed by his wife arbitration agreement.i f a spouse with a loss of consortium claim were allowed to litigate that claim,the purpose of section would be defeated,for the patient would be compelled to arbitrate,but the physician would still have to answer in a civil suit for claims dependent on identical facts regarding the professional standard of care,its breach by the defendant and causation of injury to the patient.no savings would be effected,and there would be the potential for an anomalous result the patient might fail to establish liability in arbitration,while the nonsignatory spouse might prevail in the loss of consortium action.mormile,supra,th at.
in buckner tamarin th buckner the nonsignatory adult children sued the health care provider for the wrongful death of their father.buckner distinguished herbert.in herbert,the wrongful death claimants fell into three groups.for two of those widow and minor decedent right to bind them to arbitration rested on legal principles involving spouses and parents and children.for the third group,children who did not belong to the health decedent had no authority to act.the herbert court nevertheless found that practical considerations involving the indivisibility of wrongful death claims permitted the arbitration agreement to sweep up the adult children.herbert rationale is inapplicable here because respondents are not dividing their wrongful death claims between different forums.accordingly,herbert does not apply.buckner,supra,at.
the court also rejected out of hand the broad language in mormile suggesting that a wrongful death claimants could be bound by the patient arbitration agreement,concluding that such language was dicta and that mormile was distinguishable in that it involved a spouse rather than the adult children.buckner,supra,th at see also goliger ams properties,th,following buckner in holding that an adult can not sign away the arbitration rights of another adult if not in an agency relationship.instead,buckner affirmed the primacy of the rule that a party can not be compelled to arbitrate a dispute that he has not agreed to resolve by arbitration.buckner,supra,at.
iv.discussion 
like the courts of appeal in herbert,gross and mormile,we are persuaded that section,construed in light of its purpose,is designed to permit patients who sign arbitration agreements to bind their heirs in wrongful death actions.there are several reasons supporting this conclusion.first,it is clear that section was intended to include the arbitration of wrongful death claims.as noted,section,subdivision a contemplates arbitration of any dispute as to professional negligence of a health care provider.professional negligence is defined in section,subdivision g as a negligent act or omission to act by a health care provider in the rendering of professional services,which act or omission is the proximate cause of a personal injury or wrongful death.italics added.also as noted,section was part of micra efforts to control the runaway costs of medical malpractice,and that statute does so by promoting arbitration of malpractice disputes,while at the same time ensuring that patients are adequately informed of the consequences of entering into arbitration agreements.reigelsperger,supra,cal th at.the definition of professional negligence to include wrongful death was used throughout all the statutes enacted pursuant to micra.see bus,subd.c,subd.c code civ,subd.in light of the purpose and scope of the statute,it is not surprising that section does not distinguish between malpractice claims asserted by the patient or the patient estate,and wrongful death claims arising out of alleged malpractice committed against the patient it is evident that both sorts of claims are intended to be encompassed by agreements entered into pursuant to section.it is also clear that other provisions of micra apply to wrongful death actions arising from medical malpractice.see yates pollock d,cap on medical malpractice noneconomic damages applies in wrongful death actions.
given this purpose of authorizing the arbitration of medical malpractice and wrongful death claims,we find persuasive the arguments advanced by the courts of appeal discussed above that requiring potential wrongful death claimants to be signatories to an arbitration agreement is highly problematic.
first,there is the matter of practicality i t is obviously unrealistic to require the signatures of all the heirs,since they are not even identified until the time of death,or they might not be available when their signatures are required.furthermore,if they refused to sign they should not be in a position possibly to delay medical treatment to the party in need.herbert,supra,d at.
second,there are substantial privacy concerns,potentially authoriz ing an intrusion into a patient confidential relationship with a physician.gross,supra,d at.as we have recognized,the explicit right of privacy protected under the california constitution,article i,section,protects two classes of privacy interests interests in precluding the dissemination or misuse of sensitive and confidential information informational privacy and interests in making intimate personal decisions or conducting personal activities without observation,intrusion,or interference autonomy privacy.hill national collegiate athletic cal th.both types of privacy interests are implicated here.requiring patients to obtain the signatures of heirs would require to some degree the disclosure of confidential medical information regarding the condition a patient seeks to treat the disclosure of such sensitive medical information is at the core of the protected informational privacy interest.see id.at.the need to have other parties signatures before obtaining medical treatment also fundamentally intrudes on the patient interest in autonomy privacy.see american academy of pediatrics lundgren cal.because the legislature contemplated the inclusion of wrongful death claims within arbitration agreements drafted pursuant to section,but obviously could not have intended that the patient heirs be signatories to these arbitration agreements,we conclude the legislature intended to permit patients to bind any heirs pursuing wrongful death actions to these agreements.
moreover,although section is merely a permissive statute allowing patients and health care providers to enter into arbitration agreements with certain standards of disclosure,we agree with the court in mormile,supra,th at page,that if a spouse or adult children were permitted to litigate wrongful death or loss of consortium claims the purpose of section would be defeated,for the patient would be compelled to arbitrate,but the physician would still have to answer in a civil suit for claims dependent on identical facts and that n o savings would be effected.stated in other terms,section,construed in light of its purpose,intends to give patients and health care providers the option of entering into an agreement that will resolve all medical malpractice claims,including wrongful death claims,by arbitration.requiring that wrongful death claimants be bound by arbitration agreements only when they themselves have been signatory to them effectively forecloses that option for practical and public policy reasons.
on the other hand,the purpose behind the wrongful death statute,section,would not be undermined by construing section to permit the binding of wrongful death litigants to arbitration.although a wrongful death claim is an independent action,wrongful death plaintiffs may be bound by agreements entered into by decedent that limits the scope of the wrongful death action.thus,for example,although an individual involved in a dangerous activity can not by signing a release extinguish his heirs wrongful death claim,the heirs will be bound by the decedent agreement to waive a defendant negligence and assume all risk.madison superior court d,scroggs coast community college dist.d.wrongful death plaintiffs may be bound by defenses applicable to the decedent if the statute giving rise to the defense is construed to intend such application.horwich,supra,cal th.
it is true we have emphasized that arbitration derives its legitimacy from the fact that the parties consent to resort to the arbitral forum rather than to litigation,with its possibility of a jury trial.baker,supra,d at.such consent is generally required.but as discussed,the case law has recognized a number of instances in the health care setting in which agreements to arbitrate have bound nonsignatory third parties,including children both born and not yet born,spouses,and employees who are the beneficiaries of health care agreements between an employer and a group health plan.see mormile,supra,th at,and cases cited therein county of contra costa kaiser foundation health plan,th,county of contra costa.although these cases rely on common law principles such as fiduciary duty and agency,here the legislature appears to have intended to have created through statute for public policy reasons a capacity of health care patients to bind their heirs to arbitrate wrongful death actions.to so bind wrongful death plaintiffs does not in any sense extinguish their claims nor make them dependent on the outcome of the decedent estate litigation,and does not even restrict the scope of the wrongful death plaintiff claims as in the above release cases,but merely requires that the claims be resolved by a common,expeditious and judicially favored method.madden,supra,cal d at.
plaintiffs point to our dictum that the right to trial by jury is considered so fundamental that ambiguity in the statute permitting jury trial waivers must be resolved in favor of according to a litigant a jury trial.grafton partners superior court cal th.they argue that section does not explicitly provide for parties to an arbitration agreement pursuant to that section to bind their heirs who file wrongful death claims,and that we should require such explicit statutory authorization before requiring nonsignatories to be bound by arbitration agreements.as explained above,section,construed in light of its overall purpose,is sufficiently clear in its inclusion of wrongful death claims to be understood as intending to permit patients to bind their heirs to health care arbitration agreements.
finally,plaintiffs suggested in their briefs,and more explicitly at oral argument,that a rule permitting a person to bind his or her adult children to arbitration agreements would violate the state constitutional right to a jury trial.cal,art.i.that constitutional provision reads in pertinent part in a civil cause a jury may be waived by the consent of the parties expressed as prescribed by statute.ibid.in madden,we considered an employee challenge to an arbitration agreement the board of administration of the state employee retirement system board entered into on behalf of the employee as part of a larger agreement with a health plan for the provision of group medical services.we noted that in the state employees medical and hospital care act,former et,the legislature entrusted to the board the authority to make group medical plans available to state employees,but neither expressly granted nor withheld authority for the board to agree to arbitration of employees malpractice claims.the madden court concluded that the board possessed this authority because it acted as an agent and fiduciary on behalf of the employees.madden,supra,cal d at at.madden further rejected the argument that the state constitutional right to a jury trial was violated by this arrangement,or by the failure to obtain from the employees a specific waiver of the jury trial right,recognizing that no such explicit waiver was required in civil cases.id.at,fn.
the right to a jury trial under the california constitution generally applies to actions for damages that would have been tried to a jury at common law see asare hartford fire ins.th,and wrongful death actions fall into that category.as madden demonstrates,however,the legislature may devise reasonable rules in civil litigation to permit the delegation to another party of the power to consent to arbitration instead of a jury trial.in madden,the relationship made the delegation reasonable.in the present case,the legislature by statute has created the right of certain heirs to a wrongful death action and may also by statute place reasonable conditions on the exercise of that right.as discussed,the prerogative of patients to contract with health care providers regarding the terms of their medical care without third party interference is itself a right of constitutional dimension.the legislature could reasonably delegate the authority to consent to arbitration of medical malpractice claims arising from patients medical treatment to the patients themselves,particularly when such delegation furthers an important public policy.moreover,as observed in herbert,supra,d at decedents are able to bind their heirs through wills and other testamentary dispositions,so the concept is not new or illogical.as in madden,we can not say that under these particular circumstances this reasonable delegation of authority to enter into arbitration agreements violates the state constitutional right to a jury trial 
turning to the present case,as noted,the arbitration agreement binds all parties whose claims may arise out of or relate to treatment or service provided by the physician including any spouse or heirs of the patient and any children as well as specifically providing for arbitration of wrongful death and loss of consortium claims we hold that the agreement can be enforced,and that a contrary holding would defeat podolsky reasonable contractual expectations.we therefore reverse the court of appeal and order a remand with directions that podolsky petition to compel arbitration be granted as to all wrongful death claimants,including the adult children.
disposition 
the judgment of the court of appeal is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to grant podolsky petition to compel arbitration of all wrongful death claims.
dissenting opinion by kennard,
according to plaintiffs,defendant anatol podolsky,an orthopedic surgeon,negligently failed to diagnose and treat plaintiffs father for a hip fracture,thereby causing his death.plaintiffs are not suing for the injury inflicted upon their father rather,they are suing for the injury that defendant inflicted directly upon them when he negligently deprived them of their father com
