the defendant,luis ortiz rodr√≠guez,received a month prison term after entering a guilty plea to one count of cocaine trafficking in violation of a.ortiz now challenges the procedural reasonableness of that sentence due to the district court upward variance from the applicable sentencing range under the sentencing guidelines with what ortiz contends was insufficient justification.for the reasons that follow,we vacate ortiz sentence and remand for.
at sentencing,the district court reviewed the guidelines calculation set forth in the investigation report.the report stated that the base offense level for an offense involving less than grams of cocaine was.see c.the report further stated that ortiz also was subject to a enhancement for the use of firearms,as well as a deduction for acceptance of responsibility in consequence of his plea.see id.b id.a.thus,the report set forth a guidelines calculation that produced a recommended sentencing range of to months.the statutory maximum for the offense is years.see b c.
the plea agreement,filed on july,contained an alternate guidelines calculation.the plea agreement calculation yielded a sentencing range of to months.the agreement then recommended a sentence of months.that recommendation was not binding,however,as the plea agreement provided that ortiz sentence would be left entirely to the sound discretion of the district court.see.c b.and,in any event,the plea agreement guidelines calculation was incorrect.the calculation included numerous sentencing enhancements that the record did not support 
the district court followed neither the recommendation in the report nor the recommendation in the plea agreement.the district court explained that even though ortiz did not plead guilty to a weapons offense,the court can not disregard the fact that he participated in an offense that involved firearms and that those firearms were fired during the offense.in that regard,the district court referenced the conduct of ortiz,who had fired guns into the air from a different vehicle while ortiz was driving nearby.
the district court then proceeded to describe the evidence found in ortiz car at the time of arrest.according to that summation,there was a bullet on the floor of the driver side of ortiz car.ortiz also had a fanny pack around his leg that contained rounds of caliber ammunition and a sandwich bag containing a leafy green substance that positive for marijuana.a leafy green substance that also positive for marijuana was also found on ortiz in his front pocket.in addition,there were two duffel bags in the trunk of the car,which contained clothing,marijuana,four rifle magazines,cocaine packaged for sale,a single drum magazine,a double drum magazine,and four pistol magazines containing ammunition.
the district court emphasized the firearms involved 
once again,we find ourselves in a case involving firearms in this district,involving a young man with firearms or ammunition,magazines,that sell pretty expensively on the streets,and the person who possesses them,like ortiz,appears not to have the means to purchase those type of things.everybody knows that gun crimes are pervasive throughout the island,and i have to consider deterrence as one of the factors,because it important to consider preventing criminal behavior by the population at large and not just by the defendant being sentenced.
the district court then found that the sentence to which the parties agreed,as well as the guideline imprisonment range reflected in the report,do es not reflect the seriousness of the offense,does not promote respect for the law,does not protect the public from further crimes by ortiz and does not address the issues of deterrence and punishment.at that point,the district court imposed the month sentence.
the government contends that ortiz failed to raise his challenge to the procedural reasonableness of the sentence below and thus that we may review only for plain error.but the record shows that defense counsel had no opportunity to raise a formal objection to the sentence prior to the sentencing hearing,as it was only at the sentencing hearing that the district court varied upwards from the guidelines range described in the investigation report.furthermore,defense counsel remarks both before and after the imposition of the sentence,though cut short,raised the same basic challenge to the reasonableness of the sentence that ortiz now makes on appeal.we thus review the sentence for abuse of discretion.united states king,cir.
ortiz argues that the stated grounds for the imposition of a sentence that so markedly exceeded the recommended guidelines range were neither sufficiently particularized nor compelling to survive the review for reasonableness.he relies on united states zapete garcia,where we found the district court had failed to justify a month sentence that was eight times greater than the top of the guidelines range,but was well below the year statutory maximum,cir.and ortiz also relies on united states ofray campos,where we overturned a sentence that was times greater than the top of the recommended guidelines range,but at the statutory maximum,because it,too,had not been adequately explained,cir.
here,as noted,ortiz sentence was well below the statutory maximum but three times greater than the top of the advisory guidelines range.under zapete garcia and ofray campos,therefore,the district court was obliged to explain how ortiz situation was different from the ordinary situation covered by,and accounted for,in the guidelines calculation and thus why such a significant variance was justified.see united states smith,cir the sentence is not a modest variance from the guideline range,and t he farther the judge sentence departs from the guidelines sentence the more compelling the justification based on factors in section a that the judge must offer in order to enable the court of appeals to assess the reasonableness of the sentence imposed.omission in original internal quotation marks omitted.but the district court failed to provide such an explanation.
the district court did discuss the quantity of firearms involved and the firing of the guns by the.but ortiz rightly relies on ofray campos for the proposition that w hen a factor is already included in the calculation of the guidelines sentencing range,a judge who wishes to rely on that same factor to impose a sentence above or below the range must articulate specifically the reasons that this particular defendant situation is different from the ordinary situation covered by the guidelines calculation.at quoting zapete garcia,at.and the district court description of the facts at the sentencing hearing does not explain why this case is so substantially outside the heartland of the guideline enhancement for the use of firearms that a variance of this magnitude is justified.see ofray campos,at the court reference to appellant possession of weapons as a triggerman lacks compelling force,in part because firearm possession had already been considered,and accounted for,in the enhancement applied in the calculation of appellant adjusted offense level under.b.
rather than offering any such explanation,if one were possible on these facts,the district court stated that o nce again,we find ourselves in a case involving firearms in this district.the district court also stated that even though ortiz did not plead guilty to a weapons offense,the court can not disregard the fact that he participated in an offense that involved firearms and that those firearms were fired during the offense.but the presence and use of firearms was accounted for in the enhancement for firearms the judge included in the guidelines calculation,and so the reference to the mere presence or use of the firearms can not justify such a significant variance.see ofray campos,at t hese factors mentioned by the district court were not so distinct from the firearm possession that was incorporated into the guidelines calculation as to justify a variance of such magnitude.zapete garcia,at t he guideline enhancement applies to any unlawful alien defendant who has previously been deported at least once a lthough some amount of
