jorge luis mendez,who was indicted in connection with a vast conspiracy to provide identification documents to undocumented aliens in the united states,pled guilty to various charges.he was sentenced to just over six years in prison.that sentence forms the basis for this appeal.mendez contends that it is too long and that various errors were made by the sentencing judge when handing it down.because our review of his claims is frustrated by an insufficient explanation from the district court,we vacate and remand for resentencing.
background 
a.the conspiracy 
mendez,along with cohorts,was part of a scheme to supply undocumented aliens in the continental united states with the identities of united states citizens residing in puerto rico the conspiracy extended over the course of almost three years april to january and spanned the country,with its members operating out of various states massachusetts,illinois,pennsylvania,and ohio,to name a few and puerto rico.
there were distinct jobs to be done,with puerto mendez operating as a savarona supplier.the savarona suppliers would procure unlawful document sets,a term defined in the indictment and presentence investigation report psr as puerto birth certificates and corresponding social security cards both pertaining to the same puerto rican person,as well as individual fraudulently obtained documents termed unlawful documents,like driver licenses and voter registration cards.
savarona suppliers,like mendez,then transmitted the documents to identity brokers who were the ones bringing in the customers and the brokers would then sell the sets for to a piece,with more money required for additional individual documents.the customers were undocumented aliens and others residing in the continental united states.
b.the indictment 
in december,mendez,along with,was named in a indictment.mendez was picked up the next month.at the time of his arrest,he had in his possession numerous identity documents in other people names,including eleven puerto rico birth certificates,ten social security cards,one puerto rico driver license,one puerto rico electoral card,and the personal identifying information including social security numbers for another eight individuals.
the vast majority of mendez ended up pleading guilty and,after some failed negotiations,mendez did the same.six days before trial was to commence,mendez pled guilty without a written plea agreement to count,conspiracy to possess,produce,and transfer identification documents in violation of count,conspiring to encourage an alien to reside in the united states in violation of and counts,and,aggravated identity theft,in violation of.
presentence dispute 
a debate about mendez appropriate sentencing range arose prior to the sentencing hearing with respect to counts and all involved probation and parties agreed that counts and should be grouped,meaning that the governing offense level would be the the highest offense level of the counts in the group.ussg a.the question was whether count or supplied the highest offense level.
the probation office thought count conspiracy to commit identity fraud did.the computation for count,as evidenced by the psr,went as follows.the relevant guidelines provision,ussg a,provided a base offense level of.that provision calls for the offense level to be increased by various levels based on the number of documents involved.ussg b.positing that the offense here involved or more documents,the psr increased mendez base offense level by.it then recommended a level enhancement because mendez was a manager or supervisor in a criminal activity involving five plus participants pursuant to ussg b.assuming a level decrease for acceptance of responsibility under ussg a,the psr projected the total offense level of for count.given mendez criminal history,this yielded a guideline sentencing range of to months on counts and.
mendez lodged no objection to the psr.the government,however,took exception.the government filed a sentencing memorandum,which mendez also did not object to,in which it argued that count conspiracy to encourage aliens to reside in the united states provided the higher offense level.we start with the government math and move on to its rationale.
the government began with a base offense level of,as provided by ussg a.like the guideline pertinent to count,this provision called for the offense level to be increased by various levels in certain circumstances.however,the determining factor was not the number of documents involved but rather the number of aliens induced or harbored.id.b.suggesting that there were sufficient facts to demonstrate that mendez had induced or harbored or more aliens,the government applied a level enhancement.id.b c.like the psr,the government added a level enhancement for mendez supervisory role and a level reduction for acceptance of responsibility.this placed the offense level for count at one level higher than count,which would mean mendez faced a guideline sentencing range of to months on counts and.given the mandatory sentence of months on the remaining counts,the ultimate range was to months with the government recommending the low end.
for our purposes,the important part of the government calculus is the level enhancement it proposed.basically and we will say more on the particular theories in a bit the government thought that mendez had not only trafficked documents,but had also induced or harbored aliens,therefore justifying the enhancement on count.according to the sentencing memorandum,this is why.the government,which suggested that the whole conspiracy involved over trafficked identities,noted that some of mendez had admitted in their plea agreements that they had worked with mendez,the conspiracy involved over documents,and the documents were being trafficked to undocumented aliens.one particular,pena,admitted that he was involved in trafficking at least documents,which had been sent to him by mendez,to undocumented aliens in massachusetts.the government also pointed out that on the day of mendez arrest,another identities were found in his home presumably slated for more undocumented aliens.furthermore,text messages intercepted from mendez phone during a month period contained approximately identities that he was trafficking.the government concluded that e xtrapolating over the conspiracy,this shows that well over identities were involved in this case.
the government thought the psr further supported its position.it reasoned that because the psr had found that or more documents had been involved,warranting the level enhancement for count under,it necessarily followed that over document sets pertaining to over aliens were involved.it based this claim on note of,which at least according to the government reads that one document is a set of documents intended for use by a single person.
the probation office responded to the government in an addendum to the psr.it stood by its position that count provided the higher offense level,indicating that the office was not convinced that mendez indeed harbored or induced over aliens.
sentencing 
at the sentencing hearing,the government emphasized its contention that the alien enhancement should apply,making count yield the higher offense level.for support,it simply reiterated the argument about note language,again extrapolating that a finding of documents is equivalent to aliens being induced or harbored.mendez made no comment on the government position.nor did the judge weigh in on the disagreement between probation and the government.
after some back and forth on issues not relevant to this appeal,the judge handed down the sentence.noting that counts and had been grouped,the judge found that the pertinent guideline was.recall,this is the provision applicable to count,the count that probation thought controlled and which yielded the lower offense level.the judge then went on to calculate the offense level in the same manner as the psr.he stated that there was a base offense level of and that since the offense involved or more documents,a level enhancement was warranted.the judge then applied the supervisory enhancement and the acceptance of responsibility reduction.this should have taken the grand total to,as it did for probation however,the judge completed his guidelines calculation by stating that the end result was a total offense level of.this,the judge indicated,yielded an imprisonment range of to months.
the judge continued,stating that the presentence investigation report had adequately applied the guideline computations and that those computations satisfactorily reflect the components of this offense by considering its nature and circumstances.he then briefly contemplated the factors,noting the mitigating factors,no history of drugs or prior convictions and the serious nature of the offense.the sentence was then handed down with mendez getting a sentence of months on counts and,and the mandatory agreed upon consecutive sentence of months on the remaining counts,for a total of months.
understandably confused by the fact that the judge calculated mendez offense level utilizing the psr calculations,but then came out with the offense level of as advocated for by the government,the prosecutor asked for clarification.counsel pointed out the discrepancy and then asked so,i just want to confirm that your honor,when coming to the did find that as to count the enhancement for over a hundred aliens should apply and that for count and count,count should control.the judge responded it does control.count controls.we have two out,plus is plus,minus,since there was no third point is the that i mentioned.mendez attorney did not object to this computation but did ask the court to reconsider its sentence,pointing out that mendez was a offender,he would face deportation,and some of his supposedly more culpable had received lesser sentences,albeit from different judges.the judge declined.this appeal followed.
sentences must be both procedurally and substantively reasonable.united states clogston,cir.mendez says his was neither.
on the procedural front,he first argues that the court erred in applying the level enhancement for the number of aliens induced or harbored.more to the point,he claims that the court failed to make an individualized finding as to the number of aliens attributable to mendez,even if the court had,the record did not support a finding of aliens,and the upward adjustment resulted in mendez second offering is that the judge failed to adequately explain why mendez deserved a sentence and instead impermissibly presumed it was reasonable because it fell within the guidelines range.
with respect to substantive reasonableness,mendez claims that his month aggregate sentence was too long.among other things,he points to the comparatively shorter sentences some of his cohorts got,his offender status,and the fact that the sentence exceeded the government recommendation.
we start,and ultimately stop,with mendez claim that the judge erred in applying a level enhancement for having induced or harbored aliens.we review this claim for plain error as mendez failed to preserve it below.united states ramos,cir.that is,we ask whether an error occurred the error was clear and obvious the error affected the defendant substantial rights and the error impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.id.at.
unfortunately,it is impossible to determine,based on this record,whether a clear and obvious error or for that matter,any error at all occurred.while we have on occasion gone to significant lengths in inferring the reasoning behind,and thus in affirming,some explanations by district courts,there are limits.united states gilman,cir citations omitted.if we are in fact wholly unable to discern the court rationale,appellate review is unworkable and a remand is necessary.id.at.that is the case here.
the judge did not make any finding with respect to whether mendez had indeed induced or harbored aliens.in fact,the judge said not a word about how he determined this particular enhancement was warranted.he simply stated that count controls.notably,this little tidbit came out not during the handing down of mendez sentence,but only when the understandably confused prosecutor asked for clarification.
we simply have no idea why the judge applied an enhancement,rather than a enhancement as suggested in the psr,or why an enhancement should apply at all.perhaps the judge found the evidentiary proffer suggested by the government at the colloquy sufficient to bring the attributable number of aliens induced or harbored up to.or maybe he latched on to the government questionable theory,advanced both in its sentencing memorandum and at the sentencing hearing,that one can extrapolate from note of that probation finding of documents is tantamount to a finding of aliens.there is also the prospect that the judge was,as mendez suggests,attributing the harm to mendez 
on top of this,we have the confusion caused by the judge utilizing probation calculation minus the correct sum total,stating that the offense involved or more documents,and indicating that the psr got it right.emphasis added.there is also the fact that the record does not make it irrefutably clear that mendez did in fact induce or harbor aliens.notably,probation and the government,though faced with the same record,disagreed on this point.indeed to reach the aliens mark,in the government own words,some extrapolating is required 
all that being the case,we would be hard pressed to apply the maxims that the government emphasizes here.yes,it is true that a court reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the report with what the judge did.united states rodríguez,cir.and indeed,the law does not require a district court to be precise to the point of pedantry.united states fernández cabrera,cir.but this only takes us so far and invoking these axioms here would effectively render our review meaningless.i n the end we must be able to figure out what the court found and the basis for the findings to the extent necessary to permit effective appellate review.united states zehrung,cir citation omitted.we can not do that here and,therefore,are unable to effectively consider even the first prong of plain error review.
conclusion 
let us be perfectly clear.we recognize that the plain error hurdle is high,united states hunnewell,cir,and the administration of justice has been over the years by our strict enforcement of this standard.here,however,the inscrutable footing on which the district court sizeable enhancement stands thwarts our ability even to conduct plain error review.we caution then that this decision should not be read as a relaxation of the plain error standard but,rather,as a reminder to sentencing courts that,where the basis for an enhancement is neither obvious nor inferable,some explanation should normally be forthcoming.
for the reasons laid out above,we vacate the sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.we do not take a stance on what the sentence should be,or whether a or enhancement or neither is warranted.that is,within wide limits,up to the sentencing judge.we leave untouched mendez claims that his sentence was substantively unreasonable,and that the judge failed to adequately explain his sentence,as these claims are inevitably tied to the enhancement the judge tacked on and,therefore,subject to change on resentencing.
the facts are derived from the colloquy,the undisputed portions of the presentence investigation report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states almonte nuñez,cir united states del valle rodríguez,cir.
there was no controversy surrounding the aggravated identity theft counts counts.the parties agreed that a mandatory term for those counts was to run consecutive to any sentences on counts and per a and ussg.mendez does not appeal that aspect of his sentence.
the government selectively quotes and then contorts the note language.in its entirety,it provides where it is established that multiple documents are part of a set of documents intended for use by a single person,treat the set as one document.ussg,note.the actual language makes the government theory suspect.there is no indication
