kermit rivera gonzález challenges his month sentence for a firearms offense.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
since this appeal trails in the wake of a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the plea agreement,the colloquy,the undisputed portions of the presentence investigation report psi report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states almonte nuñez,cir united states del valle rodríguez,cir.beginning in and continuing into,the defendant engaged in a conspiracy to distribute controlled substances at various drug distribution points in san juan,puerto rico.in carrying out his role in the conspiracy,he possessed and used firearms.
after a federal grand jury charged the defendant with various offenses,the government filed a supplemental information containing two additional counts arising out of the defendant possession,at the time of his apprehension,of four kilograms of marijuana supplemental count and four firearms supplemental count.although the defendant initially maintained his innocence,he soon entered into a plea agreement the agreement with the government.see.c b.
pursuant to the agreement,the defendant pleaded guilty to count of the indictment charging him with conspiring to possess with intent to distribute various controlled substances within feet of a protected location,see a,supplemental count charging him with possessing marijuana with intent to distribute,see id.a,and supplemental count charging him with possessing firearms in furtherance of a offense,see c a.the remaining five counts contained in the indictment were to be dismissed.
the agreement made clear the parties expectation that the guideline sentencing range gsr for count would be to months and that the gsr for supplemental count would be to months.these anticipated gsrs were based on the assumption that the defendant would be placed in criminal history category chc i.the parties agreed that,should this assumption materialize,they would jointly recommend a month sentence for count and a concurrent month sentence for supplemental count.with respect to supplemental count,they agreed to recommend the mandatory minimum month term of immurement,to run consecutively to the sentences on the underlying drug charges.the parties recommendation of a month consecutive term for the gun charge was not contingent upon the sentencing court chc designation.
some months after accepting the defendant guilty plea,the district court received the psi report,which grouped the drug charges.see ussg.using chc i,the psi report set the gsr at to months for the grouped counts.the report made only a passing reference to the gun charge,noting that the statute of conviction required a minimum month consecutive term of imprisonment.see c ussg b.
at the disposition hearing,the district court,without objection,adopted the guideline calculations limned in the psi report.the government acknowledged that grouping had resulted in a lower gsr for the drug counts but nevertheless pressed for the imposition of the previously agreed month sentence on count and a month sentence on supplemental count.the district court eschewed the sentencing recommendations contained in the agreement and imposed concurrent sentences of months on count and months on supplemental count.
the court then took up the gun charge.it again turned a deaf ear to the parties joint recommendation and levied an month sentence on supplemental count to run consecutively to the other sentences this timely appeal ensued.
on appeal,the defendant abjures any challenge to either the district court guideline calculations or the sentences imposed on the drug counts.instead,he focuses with intensity on the reasonableness procedural and substantive of the month sentence for the gun charge.
we review challenges to the reasonableness of a sentence in line with a pavane.see united states king,cir united states martin,cir.we begin by examining allegations of procedural error.see gall united states.if no procedural error is found,we then assess the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.see id.in carrying out these tasks,our review is for abuse of discretion.see united states narváez soto,cir,slip op.at.within this rubric,we review conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.see narváez soto,at,slip op.at united states walker,cir.
preliminary matters 
even though the agreement contained a clause,the defendant appeal is properly before us.such a clause only precludes appeals falling within its scope.see almonte nuñez,at united states murphy cordero,cir.here,the defendant waived his right of appeal to the extent that he was subsequently sentenced in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the sentence recommendation provisions of the agreement.the sentence imposed on the gun charge was not in accordance with the terms and conditions of the sentence recommendation provisions,which memorialized the parties joint recommendation of a month term of immurement.because of this digression from what the parties had proposed,the clause does not bar this appeal.
a few words about a second preliminary matter will help to put our merits discussion in perspective.the statute of conviction provides in pertinent part,with exceptions not relevant here,that any person who possesses a firearm in furtherance of a crime shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such drug trafficking crime be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years.c a i.this term of imprisonment shall not run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person,including any term of imprisonment imposed for the drug trafficking crime during which the firearm was possessed.id.c d ii.
the general rule is that convictions like this one that carry a statutory mandatory minimum term of immurement designed to run consecutively to any sentence on the underlying crime are to be sentenced independent of the guideline sentence on any other count.ussg a,cmt.a.consecutive sentences for violations of c are,moreover,to be calculated without regard to chapters three and four of the sentencing guidelines.see ussg b.
even so,a mandatory minimum sentence under section c is not wholly independent of the sentencing guidelines.rather,the statutory mandatory minimum sentence is deemed to be the guideline sentence see id.b united states millán isaac,cir.we hold,therefore,that since a mandatory minimum sentence under section c is the recommended guideline sentence,a reviewing court should treat any sentence above that statutory mandatory minimum as an upward variance.see,united states goodrich,cir united states gantt,cir united states lucas,cir.we proceed accordingly.
procedural reasonableness 
the defendant first contends that the district court failed to conduct an adequate individualized assessment of his history and characteristics.specifically,he contends that the court did not take into account mitigating factors,such as his relatively past,his age,and the duration of his sentence on the underlying drug counts.
this is whistling past the graveyard.the record makes pellucid that the court below focused appropriately on the defendant personal history and characteristics.with respect to the defendant particular complaints,we note that the court specifically acknowledged not only that the defendant criminal record was minimal but also that he was a good father and a good family man.so,too,the court recognized the defendant age.it is true that no extensive comment about the defendant age was made but none was required.age is normally relevant in sentencing only if considerations are present to an unusual degree,ussg,and distinguish a particular case in a meaningful way such as when a defendant is either very young or very old.no such special considerations obtain here.
in a nutshell,the sentencing court indicated its awareness of the defendant personal history and characteristics.the defendant real complaint is not that the court overlooked those factors but that it weighed those factors less heavily than he would have liked.but that type of balancing is,within wide limits,a matter for the sentencing court.se
