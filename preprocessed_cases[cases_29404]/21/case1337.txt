defendant appellant joel rodriguez rodriguez appeals from a judgment of conviction entered on june,by judge denise cote of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,at the conclusion of a jury trial.rodriguez was tried with carlos mejia and found guilty of two counts of conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine and one count of attempt to possess with intent to distribute cocaine,pursuant to b a and.rodriguez was sentenced to months of imprisonment on each count,to be served concurrently,followed by five years of supervised release,and in special assessments 
on appeal,rodriguez raises two objections to the district court admission of part of a recorded phone call in which he asked his sister francia to tell his brother to tell his attorney that he wanted to cop out to a plea before he was indicted.first,he argues that the district court erred in determining that the privilege did not apply or,in the alternative,that rodriguez had waived it.second,he argues that the district court failed to consider whether the recorded conversation was admissible under federal rule of evidence.both arguments are unavailing.
rodriguez was arrested on january,on the basis of a complaint charging him with conspiracy to distribute,or possess with intent to distribute,a controlled substance.on january,approximately one month before trial,the government filed a motion in limine for,among other things,permission to introduce at trial the recording of a telephone call that rodriguez had made to his sister francia on march,while rodriguez was imprisoned at the metropolitan detention center mdc during the call,which was conducted in spanish,rodriguez asked francia to tell tito,their brother,to inform rodriguez lawyer that rodriguez wanted to discuss whether he could cop out before the indictment francia told rodriguez that he should tell tito tomorrow because she forget s things like that.rodriguez explained that the sooner we talk to him the lawyer,the better.he told francia that a fellow inmate had explained that it was better to plead guilty before being indicted.rodriguez further explained the effect of pleading guilty before being indicted,which was to decrease his sentence let suppose,if i plead guilty to that complaint that five to years so,it turns out to be just five years,a little over three years.rodriguez then instructed his sister to call the lawyer and tell him to,to call the prosecutor and say that i wan na plead guilty to the complaint,that i accept the five to.
in its motion,the government argued that this conversation was admissible because a defendant expression of a willingness to plead guilty is evidence of his consciousness of guilt,citing to case law outside of our circuit.while the government acknowledged that rodriguez does not directly admit to the charged conduct,his statements regarding his willingness to enter a plea,indicate that he believes that he is guilty of activity.at a conference held on january,rodriguez argued that the recorded call was not admissible because the conversation concerned plea negotiations,and none of the cases cited by the government involve d any real plea activity involving people that ha d the power to involve themselves in plea activity.rodriguez did not contest the government argument that his willingness to enter a plea was probative of guilt.instead,rodriguez argued these are plea negotiations implicated by federal rules of evidence and.the court then indicated that it had a separate question regarding the communications whether or not that communication should be protected as privilege communication,the sister acting as an agent,since the defendant is able to just walk into the attorney office.
on january,rodriguez filed a letter arguing that his phone call to his sister was protected by the privilege.rodriguez acknowledged that the privilege typically attaches only to a lawyer and his or her client.however,rodriguez noted that the privilege may extend to include third parties if the communication is made in confidence for the purpose of obtaining legal advice from the lawyer.he explained that the privilege has been applied where communications were made through a hired interpreter,or one serving as an agent of either attorney or client to facilitate communication.
here,rodriguez argued,he was speaking to his sister,a close relative in whom he had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality,with a message that was intended strictly for his lawyer.moreover,rodriguez noted that he was imprisoned,and unable to contact his lawyer directly.rodriguez emphasized that h is only conceivable goal was to promptly facilitate plea discussions between his attorney and the government.given that,according to rodriguez,disclosure to his sister was necessary to obtain informed legal advice,he argued that the privilege applied and that the call should not be admitted into evidence.
the government responded the following day,arguing that the privilege did not apply because rodriguez made statements to a third party his sister with knowledge that another third party the bureau of prisons bop was recording the call.for the privilege to apply to rodriguez communication with his sister,the government argued that two elements must be satisfied that rodriguez had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality under the circumstances,and that disclosure to his sister was necessary in order to obtain legal advice.the government stated that in this case neither element was met.first,it argued that rodriguez had no reasonable expectation that his phone call would be confidential because inmates at bop facilities are repeatedly informed that their calls are not private and may be recorded.second,the government argued that rodriguez sister was not a necessary intermediary because rodriguez could have called his attorney just as easily as he called his sister had he wished to engage in privileged discussions with his attorney.furthermore,insofar as federal rule of evidence was implicated,the government argued it did not apply because the rule,by its terms,concerns only statements made in the course of plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority,and rodriguez sister was not related to the prosecuting authority in any way.
on the first day of trial,the district court granted the government motion in limine and ruled that rodriguez call was admissible.the court stated that it initially had requested the parties to brief whether the communication should be protected as privilege communication,the sister acting as an agent,since the defendant is able to just walk into the attorney office.at the hearing,however,the court explained that the submissions that the government has given,considered with the submissions from the defendants and their argument,suggest that the issue that was raised at the final pretrial conference does not govern here.instead,the court based its conclusion that the privilege did not apply on two principal findings that rodriguez was on notice that the call was being recorded and that he was represented by counsel at the time of the call.with regard to the first finding,the court stated that if such notice was disputed,it would accept further submissions on the issue.no submissions were provided,however,and rodriguez concedes on appeal that he does not contest the assumption that he was on notice.with regard to the second finding,the court explained that the privilege extends to third parties only where that communication is necessary to assist the attorney in rendering advice to the client.the court found that this was not such a case,given that rodriguez had counsel at the time of the call and t here is no suggestion he could call his counsel or was unable to communicate with him.
the court concluded that rodriguez telephone call was not covered by the privilege because there could be no reasonable expectation of confidentiality.the court underscored that what is vital to the privilege is that the communication be made in confidence for the purpose of obtaining legal advice from the lawyer,and we have no showing to support such a finding.
standard of review 
the parties disagree as to what standard we should apply in reviewing the district court ruling.rodriguez argues that we are faced with a question of law and should apply de novo review.the government argues that we must decide only whether the privilege applies and should therefore review the district court determination for abuse of discretion.the government is correct.
we have repeatedly held that t his court reviews rulings on claims of privilege for abuse of discretion.united states int l of teamsters,chauffeurs,warehousemen helpers of,afl cio,cir.there are,however,occasions where the privilege raises a question of law,which we review de novo.for instance,t he issue of the standard that governs an employee claim of privilege with respect to communications to corporate counsel on corporate matters is one of law,which we therefore review de novo.id.in general,a lthough the applicability of a privilege is a factual question,determining the scope of a privilege is a question of law,subject to plenary review.id.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,to determine the appropriate standard of review,we must establish whether the district court based its decision on a consideration of the application of the privilege to the communication or on an understanding of the privilege scope.
as rodriguez himself argues,the question in the instant case is whether rodriguez can be said to have waived the privilege by virtue of conveying information to his attorney,through his sister,on a recorded telephone line he knew was recording.while this is a question we have not yet squarely addressed,it is due to its factual,rather than legal,nature.that is,the question involves the application of the privilege as our case law has already developed it to the novel set of facts before us it does not require us to address the scope of the privilege itself in a novel way.thus,we review the district court decision for abuse of discretion.see in re grand jury proceedings,cir it is firmly established in this circuit that we review a district court finding of waiver of the privilege for abuse of discretion.accord united states adlman,cir we review district court rulings on claims of privilege for abuse of discretion.
a district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.sims blot,cir internal citations,alterations,and quotation marks omitted.following this standard,we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the privilege did not apply.
attorney client privilege 
the privilege protects communications between a client and his or her attorney that are intended to be,and in fact were,kept confidential for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.see in re county of erie,cir.the privilege underlying purpose has long been to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.upjohn united states.in order to balance this protection of confidentiality with the competing value of public disclosure,however,courts apply the privilege only where necessary to achieve its purpose and construe the privilege narrowly because it renders relevant information undiscoverable.in re county of erie,at quoting fisher united states.the party asserting the privilege,in this case rodriguez,bears the burden of establishing its essential elements.see von bulow ex rel.auersperg von bulow,cir.
while as a general matter the privilege applies only to communications between lawyers and their clients,we have held that u nder certain circumstances the privilege for communication with attorneys can extend to shield communications to others when the purpose of the communication is to assist the attorney in rendering advice to the client.adlman,at.we have,for instance,extended the application of the privilege to a communication between a client and an accountant,reasoning that a ccounting concepts are a foreign language to some lawyers in almost all cases,and to almost all lawyers in some cases and therefore that the presence of the accountant is necessary,or at least highly useful,for the effective consultation between the client and the lawyer which the privilege is designed to permit.united states kovel,cir.nevertheless,the extension has always been a cabined one,and t o that end,the privilege protects communications between a client and an attorney,not communications that prove important to an attorney legal advice to a client.united states ackert,cir.
turning to the circumstances before us,it is well settled that individuals retain their privilege when incarcerated or detained.see united states defonte,cir.moreover,we have indicated that the question of whether the privilege applies in this context continues to involve a determination of whether the claimant asserting the privilege treated the communications in question in such a careless manner as to negate her or his intent to keep them confidential.id.at see also in re horowitz,cir noting generally that o ne measure of the continuing confidentiality of communications is the degree of care exhibited in their keeping,and the risk of insufficient precautions must rest with the party claiming the privilege internal quotation marks omitted.we have not,however,directly addressed the question of whether a prisoner communication,which the prisoner knows is being recorded by prison authorities,is covered by the privilege.
the district court found that rodriguez was on sufficient notice that his telephone calls,including the telephone call with his sister,would be recorded.accordingly,it concluded that the telephone call was not covered by the privilege because there could be no reasonable expectation of confidentiality.we agree with the district court that,on the basis of the undisputed fact that rodriguez was aware that his conversation was being recorded by bop,rodriguez disclosure to his sister of his desire to engage in plea discussions with his attorney was not made in confidence and thus constituted a waiver of the privilege.
our sister circuits agree.courts that have been faced with the question have similarly decided that,where an inmate is aware that his or her calls are being recorded,those calls are not protected by a privilege.the eighth circuit,in united states hatcher,cir,held that t he presence of the prison recording device destroyed the privilege,reasoning that b ecause the inmates and their lawyers were aware that their conversations were being recorded,they could not reasonably expect that their conversations would remain private.the hatcher court explained that t he presence of the recording device was the functional equivalent of the presence of a third party.id.in the same vein,the seventh circuit ruled that the marital communications privilege does not survive where the communication took place during a recorded call from prison.united states madoch,cir holding that the marital communication privilege does not apply where the spouse seeking to invoke the communications privilege knows that the other spouse is incarcerated,because it was unreasonable to expect such communication to be confidential given the need for correctional institutions to monitor inmate conversations.
rodriguez does not dispute that he was aware that the calls he made during his incarceration were being recorded.instead,rodriguez argues that the application of the waiver in his case would discourage defendants from attempting to resolve cases with plea dispositions from jail,unless the defendant speaks with his attorney face to face or directly on an unmonitored telephone line.while his concern is undeniably valid in the abstract,it is not implicated here.bop regulations expressly allow inmates to communicate with their attorneys via telephone and mail,without monitoring.see,directing that correspondence marked as special mail,including legal correspondence,will be opened in the presence of the inmate and may not be
