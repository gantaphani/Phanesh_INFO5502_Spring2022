background 
in,a jury found hogan guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution of fifty grams or more of cocaine and cocaine base,in violation of and a,and possession of cocaine base,in violation of a.at hogan sentencing in,the district court determined his base offense level bol was.after applying a increase for an official victim enhancement and a increase for a leadership role enhancement,as well as a downward adjustment of two levels for acceptance of responsibility,the court found hogan total offense level tol was.although the presentence investigation report psr determined hogan criminal history category chc was vi,hogan requested and the court granted a downward departure pursuant to.the court departed to a chc of iii,on the basis that the chc of vi ed the seriousness of hogan criminal history.that departure reduced hogan advisory guideline range to to months and the court sentenced hogan to months and five years of supervised release.
six years later,hogan moved to reduce his sentence pursuant to c,which permits district courts to modify previously imposed sentences in certain circumstances to take into account retroactive guideline amendments hogan motion was based on a amendment to the sentencing guidelines which retroactively reduced base offense levels for offenses by two levels.see app.c,amends,effective,united states caraballo,cir noting the amendment adjust ed downward by two levels the base offense level ascribed to various quantities of crack cocaine in the guidelines manual drug quantity table.the government and hogan stipulated to the retroactive application of the sentencing guideline amendment and agreed hogan bol should be reduced from to,which reduced his tol from to,and yielded a guideline range of to months.the parties proposed the amended sentence should be months.the district court concluded that the version of in effect at the time allowed it to apply the same departure in hogan chc from chc vi to chc iii it had applied at his initial sentencing.see b pre amendments providing that i f the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing,the defendant could be granted a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range.applying the chc departure,the court determined the revised guideline range was to months and agreed with the parties that hogan sentence should be reduced to months.
in,the sentencing commission adopted amendments and,both effective november.amendment retroactively implemented the fair sentencing act of fsa,which reduced the statutory penalties for offenses.see fair sentencing act of a,stat.app.c,amend.effective.the change in drug amounts reduced the to ratio to to.dorsey united states.while amendment made further retroactive reductions to the guidelines,amendment limited the availability of relief for prisoners who received sentences in the first instance.
as part of amendment,the sentencing commission amended policy statement b.prior to amendment,b a prohibited reducing a defendant sentence under c to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range.b a.there was an exception to this rule under b b,which allowed a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range in cases where the original term of imprisonment imposed was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing.id.b b.amendment kept b a intact,but changed the exception found in b b under which a court could further reduce a defendant sentence.now,b b allows a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range only if the sentence was due to the defendant substantial assistance to the government.specifically,b b provides that if a defendant term of imprisonment was less than the term of imprisonment provided by the guideline range applicable to the defendant at the time of sentencing pursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant substantial assistance to authorities,a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range may be appropriate.b b.in addition,the commission amended application note to b which says that the guideline range consisting of the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to a is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the guidelines manual or any variance.id.cmt.
based on the retroactive application of the guideline amendments,hogan moved to reduce his sentence pursuant to c.this time,the district court denied hogan motion.the court concluded that although the retroactive application of the guideline amendments resulted in a reduction in hogan bol from to,and a corresponding reduction in his tol from to,the amended version of b did not entitle hogan to a reduction comparably less than his amended guideline because he had been sentenced to a sentence.united states hogan,cr pb,wl,at.
the revised version of b under amendment,the court said,did not permit it to apply the chc iii departure in calculating hogan guideline range the same departure the court had applied in at his initial sentencing and in when granting hogan motion to reduce his sentence based on the pre amendments the court applied hogan original chc vi,instead of the reduced chc iii,and a tol of reduced per the guideline amendments,resulting in an amended guideline range of to months.because the amended guideline range exceeded hogan modified sentence of months,the court found the language of the b prohibited any further reduction to the month sentence and that hogan was therefore ineligible for relief under c.this is hogan appeal.
discussion 
hogan says the district court erred in concluding he was ineligible under c for a sentence reduction.as best we can tell,hogan raises two arguments in his brief first,that the district court was wrong in finding the revised commentary in application note bars the district court from applying his reduced chc of iii from his original sentencing in calculating the amended guideline range and second,that the b does not prohibit the district court from considering his reduced chc in further reducing his sentence.
the sole issue on appeal is therefore whether hogan,who received a chc reduction at his original sentencing,is entitled to the application of the same or a similar reduction at under c in light of the sentencing guideline,b,and its commentary,application note.because this is a purely legal question,our review is de novo.see united states roa medina,cir.
our starting point is c,the statute under which hogan moved to reduce his sentence.under c,a district court may reduce a sentence previously imposed in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the sentencing commission.c.a court may reduce the sentence after considering the factors set forth in section a to the extent that they are applicable and if reducing the sentence is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.id.
the parties agree that the applicable commission policy statement on c sentence reductions is the b.section b outlines the approach courts are to take in determining whether and to what extent a sentence reduction under c and the policy statement is warranted.see b.under b,the court must first determine the amended guideline range that would have applied to the defendant if the guideline amendments specified in the policy statement which i
