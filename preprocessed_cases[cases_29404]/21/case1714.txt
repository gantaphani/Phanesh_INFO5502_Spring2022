john geibel,chad conner,and gordon allen,appeal from judgments of conviction entered on october,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york daniels,following a retrial.the jury convicted each defendant on each count in which he was named.the indictment charged defendants with conspiracy to commit insider trading,numerous counts of insider trading,conspiracy to commit commercial bribery,and commercial bribery.on october,the district court sentenced conner,allen and geibel principally to,and months incarceration,respectively.
background 
in late,john freeman,employed as a temporary word processor at goldman sachs,goldman sachs,a global investment banking and securities firm,and later credit suisse first boston csfb,another investment bank,began misappropriating nonpublic information concerning impending mergers and acquisitions.rather than trade in his own account,freeman disclosed that information to approximately to individuals with the understanding and agreement that they would share a portion of their trading profits with him.freeman began disclosing inside information to two individuals,james cooper and benton erskine,whom he met in an internet chatroom.freeman agreement with them,like with others,was that he would provide inside information for a percentage of their trading profits.the trio agreed that freeman would be paid a percentage,which varied from,to,to,of cooper and erskine trading profits.freeman initially met with cooper and erskine in an aol chatroom entitled the yak chatroom to provide them with tips.eventually,freeman used three different aol chatrooms,and later,upon growing concerns of detection,communicated with them through instant messaging.to further avoid detection,their communications were sometimes coded.
during the course of the scheme,cooper received freeman permission to tip other individuals that might be able to assist them.cooper asked and received permission from freeman to include his brother,benjamin cooper,who was an active stock trader.on some occasions,benjamin would communicate directly with freeman over the internet.cooper also asked and received permission from freeman to include charles deon benson,a wealthy dentist in smith grove,kentucky.because benson frequently traded large amounts of money in the stock market,he could assist the scheme by acting as a middleman to purchase securities.
cooper,however,also tipped certain individuals without freeman knowledge or consent.in september,cooper contacted defendant conner,who was a stockbroker at the bowling green branch office of morgan keegan company,morgan keegan,and told him that he met an unnamed source on the internet who was willing to share inside information for a percentage of the trading profits.conner indicated that he wanted to receive this information and told cooper that he knew how to trade on inside information without detection.conner told cooper that,for example,cooper should never purchase more than fifty call options at one time because larger purchases would appear suspicious.he also told cooper to collect research about securities purchased pursuant to freeman tips in case they were subsequently questioned about their trades.
cooper began regularly tipping conner without freeman knowledge.he eventually gave conner tips on approximately prospective deals at goldman sachs and csfb.conner,in turn,tipped numerous other brokerage clients,including gordon allen,without cooper knowledge.allen,in turn,tipped john geibel and government witness chan workman.
allen and geibel,both former stock brokers,were partners at conquest capital,an oil and gas exploration company in nashville,tennessee,and they employed workman as a bookkeeper.allen and geibel engaged in trading through personal brokerage accounts and through joint accounts they shared in the name of their company.workman testified that allen instructed him about how to discretely trade on freeman information.for example,allen told him not to purchase more than fifty options at one time.allen also instructed workman to compile phony research from the internet in case their trades were ever investigated.workman testified that geibel and allen both placed calls from conquest capital office to make securities trades using freeman tips.he also testified that,in his presence,allen shared information obtained from conner with geibel and that geibel received checks splitting profits from trades based on freeman information.finally,he testified that geibel engaged him in speculation about the identity of conner source,and eventually deduced that the source was employed at goldman sachs in new york.
in november,morgan keegan received an inquiry letter from the american stock exchange amex concerning options that several of conner clients,including cooper,had purchased in the company oregon metallurgical corporation soon before it announced that it was being acquired.conner told cooper about the inquiry and directed him to research this corporation over the internet to fabricate an alternative explanation for the trades.conner then falsely responded to the amex by stating after reading about the stock on aol,the client called and asked my opinion.upon review of the stock,i told the client technically and fundamentally the stock looked good.enclosed is a copy of the information the client read on the internet.sometime thereafter,morgan keegan again received another inquiry letter from the amex regarding the purchase of options by some of conner clients,including cooper,in dsc communications,shortly before it announced that it was being acquired.
between september and freeman arrest in january,freeman received approximately in cash as well as other gifts from individuals whom he tipped.cooper paid freeman a total of,of which came from conner.those payments typically arrived in birthday or greeting cards mailed by cooper to freeman at freeman daytime job at the phillip morris company in new york,new york.the government claims that allen and geibel also contributed to payments made to freeman.workman testified that allen solicited contributions from him for of the payment to freeman.it was his understanding that allen and geibel were also each contributing of the payments to freeman via conner.
interestingly,conner personally traded in only one of the csfb deals,earning a profit of.however,according to the government,conner tips generated millions of dollars in illegal profits for his friends and business clients.for example,on june,cooper,cooper brother,allen,geibel,workman,and other clients of conner each made large purchases of securities or options issued by dsc communications.two days later,on june,dsc communications announced that it was being acquired by alcatel,causing dsc share price to rise significantly.on this deal alone,the government contends that conner clients earned profits in excess of a million dollars.indeed,workman,whose annual salary ranged between,testified that he earned illegal profits of approximately during the course of the scheme.
in the early fall of,freeman left goldman sachs to work for csfb.while freeman continued to misappropriate information from csfb,defendants believed that the information they were now receiving was not as profitable as it had been in the past.specifically,csfb mergers and acquisitions appeared to involve smaller companies,and since stocks in such companies were not heavily traded,defendants could not purchase a large number of options or shares without raising suspicion.conner complained about this to cooper and told cooper that one of his clients was willing to pay the new york source to return to goldman sachs.cooper communicated this offer to freeman.allen advised both geibel and workman that conner was going to offer his new york source to return to goldman sachs.
prior to this,freeman had been apprehended by the fbi and had agreed to assist them.he permitted the fbi to monitor conversations and instant message exchanges with other tippees.consequently,cooper was arrested on february,and he also agreed to cooperate with the fbi.on february,defendants conner and cooper participated in a telephone and conversation with an fbi agent posing as freeman.during this telephone conversation,conner reiterated his offer to pay freeman to return to goldman sachs.the agent posing as freeman asked conner to personally deliver to atlantic city and conner agreed the atlantic city scheme.on march,fbi agents arrested conner in atlantic city and seized an envelope containing.geibel and allen were arrested several weeks later.
indictment cr.gbd charging defendants in counts was filed on january.the indictment charged conner,allen,and geibel with conspiracy to commit insider trading with each other and with cooper and freeman,among others,in violation of,and counts of insider trading,in violation of b and,and.the indictment charged allen and conner,but not geibel,with conspiracy to commit commercial bribery in violation of count and charged only conner with commercial bribery in violation of a count.conner was named in all substantive counts of insider trading.allen was named in substantive insider trading counts and geibel was named in insider trading counts.
the first trial against defendants before judge daniels began on june,and ended on july.judge daniels declared a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict against any defendant on any of the counts.the retrial of defendants,also before judge daniels,began on february,and ended on march.the second jury convicted defendants on all counts.on october,conner,allen and geibel were sentenced principally to fifty months,forty months and months imprisonment,respectively.
discussion 
conspiracy to trade on inside information 
all three defendants claim that the evidence presented at trial did not support the jury finding of the single,conspiracy charged in the indictment.instead,defendants claim that they participated in a much narrower scheme that did not involve freeman.we agree.
this court reviews de novo a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence supporting a criminal conviction,see united states reyes,cir,and must affirm if the evidence,when viewed in its totality and in the light most favorable to the government,would permit any rational jury to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states laspina,cir citing jackson virginia,d.
in order to prove a single conspiracy,the government must show that each alleged member agreed to participate in what he knew to be a collective venture directed toward a common goal.the need not have agreed on the details of the conspiracy,so long as they agreed on the essential nature of the plan.united states mcdermott,cir mcdermott i internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,a single conspiracy is not transformed into multiple conspiracies merely by virtue of the fact that it may involve two or more phases or spheres of operation,so long as there is sufficient proof of mutual dependence and assistance.united states berger,cir quoting united states,cir.
in united states carpenter,a reporter agreed to provide two stockbrokers with information prior to its appearance in the wall street journal.on several occasions,however,one of the stockbrokers,without the reporter knowledge,passed the information to his friend,stephen spratt,with whom the reporter had no agreement or knowledge.id.at.the court reversed the conspiracy conviction for the reporter to the extent that it was based on trades made by spratt.id.at.the court found that the reporter should not be liable for the trades of the unknown remote tippee because that tippee was not contemplated by the conspirators trading agreement.id.at.the fact that one of the used the information beyond the scope of the agreement did not make the remote tippee a joint member of the conspiracy.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
this court also addressed the issue of remote tipper liability in mcdermott i.it reiterated the principle that the essence of conspiracy is the agreement and not the commission of the substantive offense.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.james mcdermott,an investment banker,gave his mistress,kathryn gannon,confidential information.id.unbeknownst to mcdermott,gannon was passing the information to her other lover,pomponio.id.at.the court held that,since mcdermott had no reason to know of or suspect pomponio existence,the scope of the conspiratorial agreement involved only mcdermott and gannon,and not pomponio.id.at.in rejecting the government argument that all three individuals were part of the same conspiracy because they had the same purpose,which was to trade on inside information,the court emphasized that conspiracy is not defined by its purpose but rather by the agreement of its members to that purpose.id.at.accordingly,the court reversed the conspiracy conviction for mcdermott.id at.
it should be noted that both cases address whether the originating tipper the reporter in carpenter,the investment banker in mcdermott i was in a conspiracy with remote and unknown tippees.this case is the opposite.here,the issue is whether defendants,remote tippees,were in a conspiracy with freeman,the originating tipper.in determining the scope of the conspiracy,the roles played by defendants are significant.as unknown remote tippees,defendants were less able to appreciate the full scope of the conspiratorial enterprise.with respect to this observation,few of our decisions involve charges against unknown remote tippees.the one exception is the subsequent mcdermott case where this court discussed the liability of pomponio,the remote tippee.united states mcdermott,cir mcdermott ii.in mcdermott ii,the government conceded that pomponio,the remote tippee was not part of a single conspiracy involving mcdermott and gannon.id.at.on this point,which is central to the inquiry here,the decision says very little.the court only noted that the government failed to prove a single conspiracy amongst all three,and then moved to a variance analysis.id.
both mcdermott i and carpenter acknowledged three hypothetical avenues for establishing a single conspiracy if the scope of the trading agreement were broader to include trading by or for persons other than the small group of conspirators if the conspirators reasonably foresaw,as a necessary or natural consequence of the unlawful agreement,information being passed to remote tippees and actual awareness of the remote tippees.mcdermott i,at,see also carpenter,at.each of these three hypothetical situations is also relevant in considering the liability of a remote tippee.accordingly,each situation is addressed below,as well as one additional consideration mutual dependence or benefits among the.
scope of the agreement 
freeman and cooper agreement did not encompass disclosure of information to remote tippees,such as defendants.it is undisputed that cooper tips to conner,and then conner tips to allen and geibel,were without freeman knowledge or consent.none of the defendants ever communicated directly with freeman.freeman testified that both he and cooper were concerned with not spreading the information to too many individuals and took steps to maintain the scheme secrecy and exclusivity.although freeman disclosed the confidential information over the internet,this does not mean that he had no expectation of privacy.to the contrary,the trio communications over the internet were concealed and surreptitious.freeman used an aol chatroom named the yak chatroom to tip cooper and eskrine.in order for other aol users to access this chatroom,they would need to know the chatroom specific name,which was only known to the trio.to further avoid detection,the trio changed chatrooms twice and eventually began communicating through instant messaging.further,they often coded their communications.indeed,exclusivity was such a premium that cooper at one point told freeman that he wanted erskine out of the scheme because he felt that erskine was telling people about this information.as these measures make clear,the scope of the conspiratorial agreement between freeman and cooper was narrow and did not encompass disclosure of inside information to unknown remote tippees such as conner,allen,and geibel.
foreseeability of remote tippees 
in light of freeman and cooper safety measures,it was not reasonably foreseeable that inadvertent disclosures to remote tippees were a necessary or natural consequence of this trading scheme.again,freeman tips were not broadcast over the internet.at best,freeman disseminated information in a specific chatroom,in code,to two individuals.further,the reason that freeman and cooper endeavored to avoid unauthorized sharing by remote tippees was because they knew that trading by numerous individuals on freeman tips would directly undermine the scheme by increasing their chance of detection.accordingly,both freeman and cooper reasonably expected the other to be discrete with the precious information because the success of the conspiratorial scheme depended on exclusivity.contrast united states alessi,cir holding that,because the nature of the conspiracy,running stolen credit cards,necessarily required a large group of retailers,conspirators should have suspected that the scheme included remote and unknown members.
cooper actively took steps to conceal the number of his tippees from freeman.although cooper informed freeman about certain involvement in the scheme,such as his brother and charles deon benson,the wealthy dentist in kentucky,he did not tell him about conner.in fall,cooper deceptively told freeman that someone was willing to pay per quarter for information on prospective deals.in response,freeman asked i s this only the big d code name for benson cooper deceptively answered,only one.conner,in fact,made the offer.this exchange demonstrates that cooper felt compelled to deceive freeman about conner participation because he was aware that he was not authorized to spread the information to others.as a final note,if freeman knew or even suspected that cooper was passing the tips to others,he certainly would have sought additional trading profits and would have expected more than the paltry that he actually received from cooper.in fact,freeman testified that he was amazed when he learned after his arrest about all of the remote tippees that traded on his information and the amounts that they earned.
in short,unknown and remote tippees,such as defendants,were not contemplated by the conspiracy.instead,they received inside information in contravention of the conspiracy purpose and against its likelihood of success.accordingly,it was neither reasonable nor foreseeable that this information would end up in defendants possession.
actual awareness 
it is undisputed that freeman was unaware of defendants role in the scheme.on direct examination,freeman testified that he only tipped certain acquaintances whom he knew personally,with the sole exception of cooper and erskine,whom he met over the internet.defendants,however,were actually aware of freeman role in the scheme.the issue,then,is whether a single conspiracy exists where remote tippees are actually aware of the originating tipper,but the originating tipper is not aware of the remote tippees.in mcdermott i and mcdermott ii,the court was faced with a comparable situation involving three people an insider source,a tippee,and a third person with whom the tippee secretly shared information,who was unknown to the insider source but was himself aware of the insider source.we held there was no single conspiracy because there was no evidence that the agreement extended to the possible passing of insider information to third persons in that case.similarly,in this case,defendants awareness of freeman,the source of information,is not sufficient evidence to link them in a conspiracy with freeman because mere awareness does not satisfy the conspiracy requirement that two parties act in concert toward a common goal.see,united states rosenblatt,cir holding that federal definition of conspiracy retains traditional,common law requirement of bilateral formation which mandates a meeting of the minds.instead,defendants were merely the unintended and unknown recipients of confidential inside information.although they may have been vaguely aware of the source of their seeming good fortune,such awareness alone does not render them members of a conspiratorial enterprise,least of all in an enterprise that neither wanted nor needed their participation.
mutual dependence 
in determining whether a single conspiracy exists,the court may consider whether there was mutual dependence among the participants.united states williams,cir quoting united states vanwort,cir.in this case,defendants and freeman were not mutually benefitted by defendants participation in the scheme.instead,the sharing of information inured only to the benefit of the defendants,not freeman.while the government contends that freeman received kickbacks from remote tippees,the financial benefits that he actually received from defendants unknown participation in the trading scheme were trivial at most,freeman received,of which came from conner,especially compared to the substantial amount of money that remote tippees were making.any benefits given to freeman by defendants were informal and gratuitous,rather than disbursed pursuant to a formal exchange,such as a set percentage of the trading profits.although a significant or substantial contribution to a criminal enterprise is not required to establish a single conspiracy,we hold that in this case,the lack of mutual dependence between freeman and defendants weighs heavily in defendants favor.
in conclusion,the government failed to establish a single conspiracy between freeman and defendants as alleged in the indictment.the scope of the conspiratorial agreement between freeman and cooper did not encompass disclosing information to remote tippees in defendants position.freeman neither knew of nor should have expected defendants use of the information,and defendants vague awareness of freeman role in the scheme does not render them.further,freeman benefitted little from defendant use of the information.accordingly,defendants were not in a conspiracy with freeman to trade on inside information.
ii.variance and substantial prejudice 
although eight defendants were involved in a conspiracy with each other to trade on inside information.w hen a defendant is charged with a single conspiracy among multiple members,and the proof at trial shows that he conspired with some,but not all,of those members,the variance is subject to the harmless error rule.mcdermott ii,at.in order to merit reversal,the variance must have caused the defendant substantial prejudice at trial.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in evaluating substantial prejudice in this context,the essential question is whether the jury convicted the defendant on evidence unrelated to his own alleged activity.united states washington,cir.more specifically,a court will look at 
whether the court gave a pinkerton charge whether statements of persons not in the conspiracy were used against the defendant whether there was prejudicial spillover due to a large number of joined defendants and whether any inflammatory or shocking evidence came in against the defendant.
mcdermott,at citing united states johansen,cir,united states berger,cir,and pinkerton united states.
here,the district court gave a charge,which instructed the jurors that,in weighing the other charges,they could consider against that defendant acts that were done and statements that were made by claimed in the defendant absence and without his knowledge.however,considerations of other factors strongly militate against a finding of substantial prejudice.berger,at.only three defendants were tried together,thereby limiting the risk of prejudicial spillover due to an unwieldy number of defendants.further,the district court correctly instructed the jury that it could consider pinkerton liability only after it first found that the corresponding conspiracy existed.moreover,it also gave the jury a standard limiting instruction t here are three defendants on trial before you.you must,as a matter of law,consider each count of the indictment and each defendant involvement in that count separately.thus,the giving of a charge did not substantially prejudice the defendants.see berger,at united states harwood,cir finding that the giving of a pinkerton instruction did not prejudice the defendant because there was substantial other evidence supporting the conviction.
finally,to conclude that defendants were prejudiced by the variance,we must find that there was a substantial likelihood that the jury considered evidence of the broad conspiracy charged in the indictment in deciding defendants guilt of the more limited conspiracy established by the evidence.washington,at finding no reason to believe that the jury convicted defendant on evidence unrelated to his own alleged activity.a review of each defendant role in the scheme shows that none of them suffered substantial prejudice as a result of the variance.
conner was not substantially prejudiced 
conner was not substantially prejudiced by the variance because he was heavily involved in the trading scheme and the majority of evidence adduced at trial pertained to his conspiratorial activities.conner entered into an agreement with cooper,a direct tippee,and assisted the scheme by showing cooper how to purchase securities based on inside information without detection.for example,he told cooper that he should not purchase more than fifty call options at any one time and that cooper should collect research about the securities.further,in november,he assisted cooper in fabricating an explanation to amex inquiry into one of cooper trades based on freeman tips.he also participated in a recorded telephone and conversation with cooper and an fbi agent posing as freeman.finally,he was apprehended taking to atlantic city with the purpose of inducing freeman to return to goldman sachs.
thus,the evidence presented at trial relating to conner conspiratorial activities was overwhelming.because conner suffered little prejudice from being tried as freeman,his conspiracy conviction must be affirmed.
allen was not prejudiced by the variance 
allen claims that he was prejudiced by the variance because inclusion of freeman as a permitted the government to introduce highly damaging evidence about the conspiracy that was unrelated to the narrower conspiracy between defendants.as examples of such prejudicial or inflammatory evidence,allen cites to testimony regarding freeman misappropriation of information,freeman financial arrangement with cooper,freeman and cooper attempts to conceal their conduct by creating private chatrooms and coded instant messages,and freeman receipt of in illegal profits largely from sources other than defendants.
as a general matter,such testimony is not necessarily inflammatory or shocking.contrast johansen,at variance deemed substantially prejudicial where the unrelated conducted involved violence and organized crime activities.moreover,the central tenet of allen argument,that such information would not have been presented against him had he been tried for conspiring only with conner and geibel is unavailing because proof of the substantive insider trading charges required the government to establish that freeman had misappropriated inside information.carpenter united states,d misappropriation is an element for conspiracy to trade on inside information.because the government was required to introduce proof of freeman thefts and proof of criminal intent,allen was not substantially prejudiced by the inclusion of this testimony at trial.
moreover,although the government may not have been able to submit all of its evidence regarding freeman deceptive practices,payments,and other covert activities,the variance was still harmless because the government submitted substantial evidence of allen individual involvement in the scheme.for example,workman testified that allen solicited contributions from him to be sent to the new york source and he instructed him about what precautions they needed to take to trade on freeman information without detection.allen drove conner to the airport so that conner could travel to atlantic city and drop off,of which came from allen.thus,even if not all of the evidence regarding freeman conspiratorial conduct would have been admissible against allen,in light of the overwhelming evidence of allen involvement in the conspiracy,he suffered little prejudice as a result of the variance.accordingly,allen conviction for conspiracy to trade on insider information must be affirmed.
geibel was not substantially prejudiced by the variance 
whether geibel was substantially prejudiced by the variance is a closer case.there exists a large disparity between the government case against conner and allen and its case against geibel.without freeman in the scheme,the government would have been forced to limit its evidence regarding freeman and cooper conspiratorial activities.on the other hand,evidence of acts committed by conner and allen in furtherance of the conspiracy would still have been admissible.it is clear that geibel was,at minimum,in a conspiracy with conner and allen.it is axiomatic that all acts and statements committed by one in furtherance of the conspiracy are admissible against all members of the conspiracy.see united states russo,cir,cert.denied.thus,evidence regarding allen and conner statements and actions in furtherance of the conspiracy,including their payments and other gifts to freeman,and conner relationship to other tippees,could have been admitted against geibel.
while evidence regarding the atlantic city scheme may have been dramatic and inflammatory,this evidence was also admissible against geibel because it was committed by his in furtherance of their scheme.although geibel contends that he had stopped trading on freeman information approximately one year before this scheme was even hatched,his inaction does not amount to a withdrawal from the conspiracy.to withdraw from a conspiracy,a person must take some affirmative action either by making a clean breast to the authorities or communicating the abandonment in a manner reasonably calculated to reach.united states jackson.cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.since geibel did neither of the two,he is thus not relieved of liability for acts committed by his.the variance analysis here is solely limited to whether geibel was prejudiced by the inclusion of freeman in the conspiracy.even if the indictment should have excluded freeman as a,geibel would have been tried with conner and allen,and thus evidence surrounding the atlantic city scheme still would have been introduced.
finally,the government submitted sufficient evidence at trial establishing geibel conspiratorial conduct.specifically,trading records indicate that geibel purchased securities or options in deals that were the subject of freeman tips,and often within days of other freeman tippees making similar purchases.the government submitted by stipulation trading records showing that geibel purchased options in dsc communications options prior to dsc communications announcement that it was being by another corporation.workman testified that allen gave geibel inside information and that geibel placed calls from their office to trade on such information.further,workman testified that geibel had engaged him in speculation about the identity of conner tipper,and deduced that the tipper probably worked at goldman sachs in new york.
although geibel participation in the trading scheme was limited by comparison to allen and conner participation,the only evidence that would have been excluded evidence regarding freeman and cooper conspiratorial activities.geibel was not substantially prejudiced by the variance.accordingly,geibel conviction for conspiracy to trade on insider information must be affirmed.
this court reviews a district court ruling regarding venue de novo.see united states svoboda,cir.because it is not an element of the crime,the government bears the burden of proving venue by a preponderance of the evidence.united states smith,cir.this court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence as to venue in the light most favorable to the government,crediting every inference that could have been drawn in its favor.united states rosa,cir.
