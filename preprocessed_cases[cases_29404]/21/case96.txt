in this appeal,wendell,daviel,and miguel challenge various aspects of their trial and sentencing.for,this was his second of two trials,which were presided over by different district judges.having separately addressed challenges from the first trial in a decision simultaneously released herewith,we address in this opinion challenges,as well as those of and,as to the second trial only.
during trial,all three defendants were convicted of various federal drug and crimes for participating in drug deals that were staged as a part of the fbi sting operation operation guard shack,about which we say more in a bit.as a result of the convictions,each was sentenced to multiple years of imprisonment.in the present appeal,raises similar challenges,which we detail momentarily,to those he raised in his appeal of his first trial and sentencing.as for,he argues the district court erred in preventing him from presenting an entrapment defense.presses a similar argument,challenging the judge refusal to give an entrapment jury instruction,and also appeals the district court denial of his motion for acquittal.
for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
we begin with a broad overview of the facts,and later return to the specific details of the case as they relate to the individual defendants arguments.
operation guard shack,as we have explained in previous decisions was a investigation mounted by the fbi over several years in order to root out police corruption throughout puerto rico.each of the stings followed a similar pattern.undercover fbi informants recruited police officers to provide armed security at drug deals staged by the fbi.the deals took place at apartments wired with hidden cameras,and involved undercover officers posing as sellers and buyers of sham cocaine.in exchange for their armed security services,the police officers were paid about per deal.
and provided armed security at several of these operation guard shack sham drug deals between march and september of,who was not a police officer but who was recruited because he misrepresented himself to the fbi undercover informant as a prison corrections officer provided armed security at six deals,which took place on april,april,april,june,june,and september of.and,who were both police officers,participated in one deal each,on march,and july,respectively.
the government charged the three defendants with one count each of conspiracy and attempted possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance,as well as possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime.various other were also charged,but their cases are not before us.in this indictment,was charged for his participation in the april deal only.for his participation in the five later deals,had already been indicted separately,tried before a different district judge,and found guilty.the first judge sentenced to and imprisonment.
several months after first trial,he,and were tried together in a second proceeding,which is the subject of this appeal.the jury found guilty of all charges,and and guilty of the conspiracy and firearms counts it did not reach a verdict for either of them on the attempted possession count.after separate sentencing hearings,the district judge sentenced to imprisonment to be served consecutively with his first sentence,resulting in a combined prison sentence from two trials that totaled years and months.and were each sentenced to and imprisonment.
the defendants timely appealed.challenges various aspects of the trial and sentencing,and and of the trial only.we discuss below each defendant in turn,beginning with.
discussion 
as we have previously noted,we issue today a companion decision to this case affirming the district court in first trial and sentencing.challenges here are similar to those he raised in that first appeal.specifically,argues that the district court in this second case committed reversible errors when it failed to conduct a sua sponte inquiry to determine whether had received ineffective assistance of counsel during the stage gave erroneous jury instructions did not reduce his sentence on account of sentencing manipulation by the government and sentenced him to a grossly disproportionate sentence in violation of the eighth amendment.for the reasons we explain,each of these challenges fails in this second appeal,as well.
lafler claim 
reprises a lafler challenge that he made and lost in his first appeal,in which he argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during the phase.see lafler cooper,holding that a defendant sixth amendment right to competent counsel extends to the process.before getting to his arguments,we give a brief recounting of what happened below.
background 
we set what is quite the complicated stage by again reminding the reader that eventually stood two trials,which were presided over by different district judges.before the first trial began,was represented by attorney jose aguayo aguayo,who remained his lawyer throughout the stage.
aguayo attempted to negotiate a plea deal for all of charges across the six sham drug deals though had been indicted separately for the charges.when the negotiations resulted in no plea deal,the first case proceeded toward trial,this time with represented by different counsel.
three days before that first trial was set to begin,second attorney filed a lafler motion,alleging that aguayo had provided ineffective assistance of counsel at the stage.he argued that but for aguayo deficient performance,would have taken a plea deal that the government had previously offered during negotiations,and he requested that the court order the government to that deal.
on the morning of the day the first trial was scheduled to begin,the presiding judge held an evidentiary hearing on the issue.after considering the testimony and documentary evidence,the judge denied ineffective assistance of counsel claim.for reasons that we explain in detail in our companion decision and will not rehash here,we have already affirmed the judge denial of lafler claim as it pertains to his first trial.
some months after the first trial and sentencing,represented by the same attorney,stood trial a second time for the charged offenses stemming from his participation in the april deal only.at no time did trial counsel request that the second judge consider the lafler argument had raised and lost before the first judge.therefore,no ineffective assistance of counsel claim was raised by counsel or ruled upon by the judge in this second case.
on appeal,acknowledges that counsel during his second trial never raised the lafler issue,but he argues that the trial judge should nevertheless have made a sua sponte inquiry and independent ruling on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.the judge failure to do so,he claims,was reversible error 
never raised the lafler issue before the second presiding judge,and we assume his claim was forfeited and not waived.we thus review the judge purported failure to make a sua sponte inquiry on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim for plain error.united states,cir.a waived issue ordinarily can not be resurrected on appeal,whereas a forfeited issue may be reviewed for plain error.
reversal under plain error review is only proper if an error occurred it was obvious it affects the defendant substantial rights and it is sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness,integrity or public reputation of the proceedings.united states,cir.can not succeed in meeting these requirements.even assuming that he clears the first three of the plain error review hurdles,can not clear the fourth,because he can not show that the judge purported error was sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness,integrity or public reputation of the proceedings.
in order to meet this fourth requirement,would need to show that if the judge had made a sua sponte inquiry into his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,she would indeed have found that had received ineffective assistance at the stage,and was therefore entitled to appropriate relief.but,for reasons we explain in great detail in our companion decision to this case,and which we will not belabor here,we have already determined,on de novo review,that was not entitled to lafler relief,as he can not meet the ineffective assistance of counsel test laid out in strickland washington.see lafler,at.specifically,is unable to show either that aguayo performance was defective or that,even if defective performance were to be assumed,it prejudiced him.thus,any claimed error on the second judge part in failing to conduct a sua sponte lafler inquiry did not threaten the fairness or integrity of proceedings,and reversal on this ground is not proper.
alleyne issue 
we move on to appeal of the jury instructions at his second trial,the only one of claimed errors that we have not also addressed in our companion decision.challenges the jury instructions regarding the firearms charges only,so we focus our discussion accordingly.first,a discussion of what happened below.
background 
before we begin,we pause to remind the reader that at his first trial,among other offenses,had been charged with and convicted of one count of possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime for his participation in each of five sham drug deals which occurred on april,april,june,june,and september of.under c a,a defendant who is convicted of possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment on the first conviction,and then imprisonment for every subsequent conviction,id.c c i,to be served consecutively,id.c d ii.accordingly,following the trial,the first district judge sentenced to a total of years imprisonment for his firearms convictions years for the first c conviction,and for each of the subsequent four convictions.
at the second trial,was again tried,among other offenses,for possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime,this time for his participation in the april,drug deal only.notable for purposes,the government did not introduce at the second trial any evidence of prior convictions from his first trial.in addition,while the judge instructed the jury as to the elements of the firearms offense,neither the jury instructions nor the verdict form included prior convictions as an element of the offense,or otherwise made any mention of prior convictions after deliberating,the jury found guilty of all counts.
prior to sentencing,filed a sentencing memorandum in which he argued that notwithstanding his five previous convictions from the first trial the judge should impose the mandatory minimum sentence for a conviction under the firearms statute,and not the minimum for subsequent convictions.argued that the judge could not impose the enhanced mandatory minimum because the jury had not made a finding as to his prior convictions.
the judge disagreed,denying the request in a written order prior to sentencing.after a hearing,the judge imposed the minimum sentence for a subsequent conviction.now appeals.
because the sentencing memorandum filed before the district court preserved his alleyne challenge,our review of his argument on appeal is de novo see,at.
in order to explain argument,we must first give a bit of background on the relevant case law.at the time of second trial,the rule was and still is,as we explain in a moment that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum is an element of the offense to be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.apprendi new jersey,emphasis added.in making this exception for prior convictions in apprendi,the supreme court deliberately left undisturbed its holding in united states,which permitted the use of prior convictions to enhance sentences without a finding by the jury.
between trial and sentencing,the supreme court decided alleyne united states,in which it held that the apprendi rule applied not only to facts that increase the mandatory maximum sentence,but also to those that increase the mandatory minimum thus overruling its prior holding in harris united states,which had limited apprendi to the former.the supreme court explicitly stated,however,that its decision would leave untouched narrow exception for prior convictions.alleyne,at.
despite this language in alleyne itself,argues before us that alleyne made inapplicable to his case.he seems to argue that,because alleyne expanded the apprendi umbrella,bringing facts that increase mandatory minimums under its shelter,we should,in keeping with the spirit of alleyne,limit to its facts and determine that only prior convictions that increase the prescribed maximum are exempt from the apprendi rule that such facts be found by a jury.because his prior convictions increased the prescribed minimum,argues,they should be subject to alleyne requirement that they be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
but this is not the law.as we have already explained,this was not the supreme court holding in alleyne.moreover,we have already rejected,in a case,the argument that prior convictions must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states rodriguez,cir.holding that the jury was not required to make a finding as to the defendant prior convictions because remained good law.we therefore find no error.
sentencing challenges 
remaining two challenges concern his sentence.he argues,as he did in his appeal from the first trial,that the government engaged in improper sentencing manipulation,and that his sentence across the two trials,for a combined and imprisonment,violates the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.in raising these arguments in the present appeal,incorporates by reference the sections of his brief from his appeal in the first trial.as we have already discussed these arguments in detail in our companion decision,we keep our recounting of what happened concise.
background 
at the first trial,the jury found guilty of five counts each one for each of the five charged drug deals of conspiracy and attempted possession with intent to distribute kilograms or more of a controlled substance and of possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime.it also found guilty of one count of possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number.
at sentencing,argued that the fbi use of large quantities of sham cocaine at each of the drug deals,its request that he bring a firearm to each of the deals,its decision to allow him to participate in multiple deals,and its decision to charge him separately for each of the deals all constituted improper sentencing manipulation because,he claimed,the government made those choices for the sole purpose of exposing him to an enhanced sentence.the first district judge disagreed,and sentenced to years and months for the crimes.
at his second trial,was again found guilty,this time of one count each of three crimes for the remaining april drug deal only conspiracy and attempted possession with intent to distribute kilograms or more of a controlled substance,and possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime.
after a sentencing hearing,during which counsel did not raise a sentencing manipulation objection,the second district judge sentenced to the statutory minimum of imprisonment for the conspiracy and attempt counts and the statutory minimum of imprisonment for the firearms count.was thus sentenced to a total of imprisonment,to be served consecutively to his and sentence from the first trial.
sentencing manipulation 
because did not raise a sentencing manipulation challenge before the second district judge,we review for plain error see,at.
argues that the government engaged in sentencing manipulation by using unnecessarily high quantities of sham drugs during the deals,requiring to bring a firearm with him to each of the deals,and then allowing him to participate in a seemingly endless number of those deals.we need not tarry in our consideration of sentencing manipulation argument here.in our companion decision,we explain in detail why sentencing manipulation argument fails under a standard of review.in renewing his challenge as to this second trial,has added no new argument,choosing merely to incorporate by reference the sections of his brief from his first appeal.because has adopted his briefing from the first case wholesale,the only difference in our review here is that the more rigorous standard applies.given that sentencing manipulation challenge failed under the less exacting standard in the first case,it also fails here.
eighth amendment 
the same is true of final challenge his argument that his total sentence from the two trials of and imprisonment violates the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.here,again adopts by reference the eighth amendment section of his brief in the first appeal,which fails for the reasons we have already explained in our decision in that case.for the reasons stated in our companion opinion,sentence is affirmed.
we turn now to appeal.as we noted above,was indicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute and attempted possession with the intent to distribute more than kilograms of cocaine,as well as of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug crime,for his participation in one operation guard shack deal on march.the jury found guilty of the conspiracy and firearm counts,but did not reach a verdict as to the attempted possession count.was sentenced to a total of and imprisonment.
raises just one argument on appeal.he argues that the district court erred in preventing him from presenting an entrapment defense at trial.we begin with a discussion of what happened below.
background 
to the march deal 
on march,fellow police officers,alwin camacho camacho,and israel provided armed security at an operation guard shack drug deal.what did not know at the time was that camacho was working undercover as an fbi informant to recruit corrupt police officers for operation guard shack.
camacho had targeted after he heard bragging around the station that he knew drug traffickers and was basically a delinquent using up the uniform.it was who,in turn,recruited his friend.both and camacho were aware that had a daughter and was expecting another child,and that he was in a difficult financial situation.
originally,was supposed to participate in a drug transaction that had been planned for march.but,according to a recorded telephone conversation between and camacho on the night before that deal,seemingly referring to his child,backed out at the last minute,telling,sorry,it gon na be difficult for me because of the little girl and the like.hearing that would not make it to the deal,camacho postponed the scheduled transaction.
shortly thereafter,camacho was also recorded talking to carlos,yet another police officer who would himself participate in operation guard shack and be charged separately in a different case.during the conversation,camacho brought up.camacho asked,s ince you buddies with salinas,what do you think about salinas he went on to say,because,um,rullán approached him and later he gave me excuses that his daughter camacho told that had told him that was willing to do anything and he broke.
camacho also told that he had directed not to bring up that topic with anymore.but later in the conversation,camacho told to talk to and have him come by to see him.in response,told camacho that he would stop by house.camacho instructed to find out what days ha d available,but also directed,i f he gives you a lot of crap t his is compulsory,this is for those who want to and know what it is.
on march,in another recorded phone conversation with,camacho directed to get that guy that you tried to find last time,by which he meant.responded,l et me see if,if that dog is around here.camacho replied,well,but let me know for sure,do do the same shitty thing to me like you did last week.
three days later,camacho,who by then presumably knew had agreed to the job,called to double check that and were both on board for the upcoming march drug deal.in a exchange,camacho asked,you told salinas what it was,right,the devices at first told camacho yes,but then laughed and told camacho that would jump off the balcony when he sees the drugs.
the story ends,as we know,with the deal going down as planned,with and being arrested and brought up on charges,and with standing trial 
before trial,the government moved in limine to preclude from raising an entrapment defense in his opening statement.the district court initially denied the motion,but when the government filed a motion for reconsideration of the order,the trial court ordered to proffer his evidence supporting an entrapment defense.
proffered the following.first,he asserted that,at all relevant times,camacho had been aware of difficult financial situation because had previously asked camacho about opportunities at compusa,where camacho worked as a security guard,and camacho had told that he would let him know if any opportunities opened up.second,submitted a transcript of the recorded conversations between camacho and and,which argued showed that camacho had targeted and incited into participating in the sham drug deals.
finally,alleged that he had been wrongly induced into committing the crime because had told him that the march transaction was a legitimate business transaction involving the sale of diamonds,and that it was only after he had arrived at the location that it was revealed to him that it was a drug deal.however,at the court subsequent prompting,conceded that he did not have any evidence that the government through camacho had directed to tell that it was a legitimate transaction,or that camacho was otherwise responsible for the alleged misinformation.
by sealed ex parte order,the court held that this was an insufficient basis to allow defendant salinas to mention to the jury in opening statements a defense of entrapment,and vacated its previous order denying the government motion in limine.accordingly,was not permitted to mention entrapment in his opening statement.
at trial,over the objections of and our third in this appeal,who we will get to know better shortly,the district court declined to give the jury an instruction on the entrapment defense.did not join in that objection to the jury instructions.now appeals,arguing that the district court erred in preventing him from raising an entrapment defense.
the government argues that neither requested an entrapment instruction,nor joined in his jury instruction objection during trial,and that his claim is therefore unpreserved and subject to plain error review.see united states guevara,cir.argues that our review is de novo,presumably on a theory that his objection to the government motion in limine was sufficient to preserve his objection to being denied a jury instruction on entrapment as well.but even assuming,favorably to,that the claim was properly preserved,the argument still fails under de novo review.
the doctrine of entrapment exists to prevent abuse of the processes of detection and enforcement by government officials who might instigate an illegal act on the part of persons otherwise innocent in order to lure them to its commissions and to punish them.united states,cir.quoting sorrells united states,alteration and omission in original.a defendant seeking to present an entrapment defense at trial must satisfy an burden of production,at.he must produce evidence which fairly supports the claims that the government agents not only induced the crime but did so improperly,and that he was not already predisposed to commit the crime.id.at.
in determining whether a defendant has met this burden,a court is to examine the evidence on the record and to draw those inferences as can reasonably be drawn therefrom,determining whether the proof,taken in the light most favorable to the defense can plausibly support the theory of the defense.united states gamache,cir.if the defendant succeeds and the defense is introduced at trial,it becomes the government obligation to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that no entrapment occurred.
we begin by examining whether has satisfied the improper inducement prong of his burden.because did not deal directly with camacho the government agent in this case,see united states luisi,cir.explaining that an individual hired as a government informant constitutes a government agent for entrapment purposes but was brought into the deal by a middleman,must rely on a derivative theory of entrapment.under this theory,the conduct of a middleman is only attributable to the government where 
the government agent specifically targeted the defendant in order to induce him to commit illegal conduct the agent acted through the middleman after other government attempts at inducing the defendant had failed the government agent requested,encouraged,or instructed the middleman to employ a specified inducement,which could be found improper,against the targeted defendant the agent actions led the middleman to do what the government sought,even if the government did not use improper means to influence the middleman and as a result of the middleman inducement,the targeted defendant in fact engaged in the illegal conduct.
satisfies the first two of these requirements.the recorded conversations proffered by show camacho more than once asking and about,and encouraging them to get involved in the drug deals.viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to,a jury could conclude that camacho targeted and used at least,if not both middlemen to induce him to participate in the march transaction.
in order to meet the third requirement,however,must show that the government via its agent camacho encouraged to employ a specific improper inducement id.the key issue here is whether a specified improper inducement by or can be attributed to the government itself.the government would be responsible for any improper inducement by either middleman if its agent camacho had told or instructed the middleman or to apply the inducement later deemed improper.see united states rogers,cir.under the case law the government would be responsible if its agent told the middleman to apply the pressure or inducement later deemed improper,and perhaps if the government agent knowingly tolerated it,but not if the government agent were ignorant of it.luisi,at.
for example,in rogers,a government agent was introduced to a middleman who engaged the defendant in a conspiracy to purchase drugs with the intent to sell.the defendant argued that the middleman should be treated as an unwitting government agent.rogers,at.we disagreed,finding that there was insufficient evidence associating the government agent with any improper inducement by the middleman.id.we specifically noted that even if the middleman did act improperly,nothing in the record demonstrated that the government agent urged,suggested,or was even aware of the improper conduct referenced by the defendant.id.
similarly,here,the record negates a finding of improper inducement by the government itself via its agent,camacho.on multiple occasions,camacho told his intermediaries not to pressure to participate in the drug deals.while camacho repeatedly asked the middlemen to check on availability and willingness to participate,there is no evidence that he urged them to apply improper pressure on to join the enterprise.to the contrary,camacho specifically directed that if gives you a lot of crap t his is compulsory,this is for those who want to and know what it is.
and although camacho did direct to get that guy that you tried to find last time to participate and responded that he would see if that dog is around here,camacho never insisted that do whatever it takes to get to participate.instead,camacho reply do do the same shitty thing to me like you did last week appears to be a warning about adequate notice,given that had backed out of the first transaction at the last minute and camacho wanted to let him know for sure one way or another whether would participate.must show not only that camacho,through his middlemen,gave him the opportunity to commit the crime,but also a plus factor an inducement amounting to some kind of government overreach.guevara,at.even if we were to assume that actions of the middlemen here were improper,has failed to produce sufficient evidence of government overreach or in this case 
has thus failed to meet the improper inducement prong of his burden,and we need not proceed to the second question of whether he was already predisposed to commit the crime.the district court did not err in denying an opportunity to present an entrapment defense.
the last of the three defendants in this appeal,participated in an operation guard shack drug deal on july,and was tried for one count each of conspiracy to distribute and attempted possession with the intent to distribute more than kilograms of cocaine,as well as possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug crime.the jury found guilty of the conspiracy and firearm counts,but did not reach a verdict as to the attempted possession count.for his crimes,was sentenced to and imprisonment.
raises two issues on appeal.first,like,he appeals the district court ruling denying him a jury instruction on an entrapment defense.second,he appeals the district court denial of his motion for acquittal.we start again with what happened below.
background 
this has,by now,become a familiar scene with a familiar cast of characters,so we will do our best to keep our narration short.camacho and reprise the same roles here that they played in story,as confidential fbi informant and unsuspecting middleman turned,respectively.
as he had done with,with camacho blessing recruited for an operation guard shack drug deal.camacho was apparently aware in the to the deal that was,because during the phone calls in which they discussed bringing on board,told camacho that was in need of money.
on july,as planned,arrived with firearm in tow at the apartment where the sham drug deal would take place.unaware that he was being surveilled by the fbi,provided security services at the deal,where undercover officers posing as drug dealers exchanged sham cocaine bricks for large amounts of cash.after the deal was completed,was paid.this was all caught on film.
was arrested shortly thereafter,charged,and stood trial along with and.during trial,the prosecution introduced testimony from camacho,as well as the video footage of the deal.
toward trial end,the court held a jury charge conference.there,counsel for requested that the jury be instructed on an entrapment defense,which the judge denied.after deliberations,the jury found guilty of the conspiracy and firearm counts,but did not reach a verdict as to the attempted possession count.
about a week after trial,filed a motion for acquittal,in which he argued that his conviction should be vacated because the evidence had been insufficient to support the jury verdict on the conspiracy count.the judge denied the motion,and,after a sentencing hearing,sentenced to and imprisonment.now appeals both the sufficiency of the evidence and jury instruction issues.
sufficiency of the evidence 
argues,as he did in his motion for acquittal below,that both his convictions should be overturned because the government presented inadequate evidence at trial to support a guilty verdict on the conspiracy charge,and without the conspiracy conviction,there was no drug crime on which his conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug crime could be based.because preserved his sufficiency of the evidence argument,we apply de novo review.see united states,cir.
in order to return a conspiracy conviction under,the government must show that a conspiracy existed the defendant had knowledge of the conspiracy and the defendant knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy.united states maryea,cir.here,takes issue with the knowledge element,arguing that at trial the government presented insufficient evidence that he knew the transaction involved the distribution of drugs.he contends that the video footage shows that drugs were never explicitly discussed during the transaction,and that he never looked inside the wrapped packages to confirm that they,in fact,contained drugs.he also argues that camacho testified at trial that he did not know what had been told about the transaction by,and the government never put himself on the stand.thus,he claims,the government evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had knowledge of the nature of the conspiracy.
but a jury verdict will not be overturned so long as we find that a rational factfinder could have found that the evidence presented at trial,together with all reasonable inferences,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,established each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.united states poulin,cir.given this difficult standard,defendants raising this claim are rarely successful,united states moran,cir,and is no exception.
to sustain a conspiracy conviction under,the government need only prove that the defendant had knowledge that he was dealing with a controlled substance,not that he had knowledge of the specific controlled substance.united states woods,cir.here,the government introduced at trial video footage of,who the jury knew was a trained police officer,showing up for the july deal armed with his firearm and ready to provide security.
frisked the undercover buyer upon arrival at the deal site,and then watched as a substance packaged in bricks and marked with logos in the same manner as cocaine is usually packaged was exchanged for cash.see united states azubike,cir.explaining that where the jury was shown evidence that the modus operandi of the crime was the same as that of drug transactions sadly common in this geographic area,this support ed the jury conclusion that defendant knew he was transporting drugs.was then paid for what amounted to less than an hour of work.
the government also presented the jury with a recorded phone call in which told camacho that he had informed that they would be working a drug deal,as well as footage from the july deal in which camacho asks,rullán already explained it to you,and answers in the affirmative.on this evidence,a jury had a more than adequate basis to come to its conclusion that had knowledge of the nature of the conspiracy.we thus affirm.
entrapment defense 
we turn to appeal of the judge denial of an entrapment defense instruction.because he raised the objection below,our review is de novo.see azubike,at.
having already mapped out the doctrine of derivative entrapment in our previous discussion of appeal,we keep our discussion of entrapment argument short.recall that a defendant is only entitled to an entrapment defense if he can establish the government agents improperly induced a crime that he was not already predisposed to commit,at.here,the only evidence that has produced of improper inducement is that the government knew he was broke and needed money,and that the government knew that its middleman,was a delinquent and used him anyway to recruit.
awareness on the part of the government of a targeted defendant difficult financial situation does not,without more,constitute improper inducement.see,united states baltas,cir.as for suggestion that using as a middleman despite his shady reputation somehow constituted improper inducement,this misses the mark,too.as we explained above,the focus in an improper inducement inquiry is on the government tactics for recruiting the defendant.may have been of disreputable character,but has not identified any specific conduct on part,whether at camacho behest or otherwise,that constitutes improper inducement.thus,did not meet his burden of production on an entrapment defense,and was not entitled to an instruction at trial.
conclusion 
for the reasons we have stated above,we affirm.
the majority holds that,as a matter of law,repeated suggestions can not give rise to a defense of entrapment.i respectfully dissent.the purpose of sting operations is to bring willing perpetrators to justice,not to induce citizens to err.repeated suggestions are precisely one way to induce citizens to err especially where,as here,those citizens are in dire financial straits.
because the majority has already laid out the facts of this case,i summarize only the key facts here.was in debt,had a little daughter,and another child on the way his financial situation was difficult,to say the very least.both the government agent and the middlemen knew this.still,showed great reluctance to become involved in any illegal drug transaction.the middleman had to approach multiple times in order to induce him to participate in the drug transaction.although initially agreed,he later pulled out of the transaction on account of his little girl.it was only after being approached by the middleman again that finally gave in and reluctantly participated in the drug transaction.the middleman actions were all on the direct instructions of the government agent.indeed,the final instructions of the government agent to the middleman were hey,get that guy,find,find that guy,and,once more,f ind that guy all referring to.
i agree with the majority that we are here faced with derivative entrapment,and that the test for that has five prongs 
a government agent specifically targeted the defendant in order to induce him to commit illegal conduct the agent acted through the middleman after other government attempts at inducing the defendant had failed the government agent requested,encouraged,or instructed the middleman to employ a specified inducement,which could be found improper,against the targeted defendant the agent actions led the middleman to do what the government sought,even if the government did not use improper means to influence the middleman and as a result of the middleman inducement,the targeted defendant in fact engaged in the illegal conduct.
united states luisi,cir.
i also agree with the majority that the first two prongs of this test are satisfied but unlike the majority,i believe that the third prong is satisfied as well 
the majority takes great comfort in the fact that u nder the case law the government would be responsible if its agent told the middleman to apply the pressure or inducement later deemed improper,and perhaps if the government agent knowingly tolerated it,but not if the government agent were ignorant of it.united states rogers,cir.the majority then reasons that there are no indications that the government agent engaged in any improper inducement the majority emphasizes that even if the middleman somehow did engage in improper inducement,then there is no indication that the government agent had told the middleman to do so.
however,examples of improper inducement include the use of repeated suggestions which succeeded only when the defendant had lost his job and needed money for his family food and rent.united states gendron,cir.breyer,quoting united states kessee,cir.in the present case,the government agent told the middleman to engage in exactly this kind of improper inducement,for the government agent told the middleman to approach repeatedly about the drug transaction,knowing full well that had serious difficulties providing for his family,and that he had declined to participate numerous times 
other circuits have also found that repeated suggestions constitute improper inducement for entrapment purposes.see united states mayfield,cir.en banc holding that improper inducement may be repeated attempts at persuasion united states kessee,cir.the government agent induced the defendant to sell narcotics by repeated entreaties,which only became successful when the defendant had lost both his jobs and desperately needed the money a jury could have had a reasonable doubt as to inducement or lack of predisposition united states burkley,cir.t he trial judge correctly issued an entrapment instruction because the government agent repeated requests constituted sufficient evidence of inducement.
it is not surprising that our sister circuits have come out this way,because the supreme court has found entrapment even as a matter of law where repeated suggestions were involved.
retracing the supreme court key entrapment cases may help illuminate the problem in sorrells the court found that an entrapment instruction was warranted the informant persistent appeal to military camaraderie qualified as a potentially entrapping inducement.sorrells united states.in sherman the court found entrapment as a matter of law the inducement there consisted of repeated requests from an informant posing as a fellow recovering addict who had fallen off the wagon.she
