this appeal presents a series of questions,some of novel impression in this circuit,concerning various federal laws.those questions touch upon the quantum of evidence necessary to establish the existence of a conspiracy the necessity if any for a showing of reasonable foreseeability in a prosecution for selling heroin,death resulting and the type and kind of proof that the government must adduce to convict a defendant of selling drugs within feet of a school.we resolve most of these questions favorably to the government,but we resolve the last question favorably to the defendant finding that the government did not present evidence from which a rational jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that heroin sales occurred within feet of a school.accordingly,we affirm in part and reverse in part.
background 
we limn the facts in the light most favorable to the government,consistent with record support.united states houlihan,cir.
on the morning of july,five dudek,christopher stevenson,edward thompson,matthew lawrence,and granger at stevenson apartment in sunderland,massachusetts.the men drank heavily,and lawrence and fulton eventually passed out.despite having consumed between ten and twenty beers apiece,the other three drove to holyoke in search of cocaine.dudek,apparently the most of the three,directed thompson to drive to newton thompson remained in the car while his confreres climbed an exterior staircase at the back of the building.
dudek previously had purchased cocaine on the second floor,but this time he and stevenson ascended to the landing where a makeshift door,constructed of plywood and chicken wire,blocked further access.anibal soler met them at that point.when asked what they wanted,stevenson replied,worth.the appellant retreated inside and emerged with twenty plastic bags labeled me salve.he handed them to dudek in exchange for cash.
as matters turned out,the bags contained heroin,not cocaine.dudek apparently recognized that fact,but said nothing to the others.stevenson began to snort some of the heroin inside the car.the men drove to thompson apartment in chicopee,where all three proceeded to snort heroin until they collapsed.
thompson girlfriend appeared on the scene hours later and tried to revive him.failing in this effort,she called for help.dudek awoke before the paramedics arrived,but his two friends remained comatose.the paramedics rushed all three men to the hospital and,soon thereafter,thompson was pronounced dead.
the authorities immediately undertook an investigation and enlisted dudek cooperation stevenson did not awake from his coma until seven days later.upon learning the source of the heroin,they decided to dispatch an undercover state trooper,juan colon,to newton on the following day july,colon,posing as a customer,climbed the exterior stairs to the landing.when he called into the apartment,a pregnant female emerged and asked what he wanted.colon responded,two bags.the woman left the doorway momentarily as the appellant had done when dudek appeared and returned with two bags of heroin,one stamped e salve an obvious error in which the m in me salve presumably missed the bag surface during the stamping process and the other blunt.colon handed her a bill and departed.
later that day,colon revisited the landing.this time,the appellant responded and sold him two bags of heroin,both labeled blunt.once again,colon paid for the drugs with a bill.the authorities then executed a search warrant for the apartment.both the appellant and the pregnant woman were there when the police both attempted to flee.
a search of the premises yielded,among other things,thirty bags of heroin all labeled blunt and over in united states currency.stashed with the heroin was in cash,including the two bills that colon had used to pay for his purchases from the pregnant woman and the appellant,respectively.
in due course,a federal grand jury handed up a indictment.the indictment charged the appellant with distribution of heroin,death resulting,on july,in violation of a b c count possession of heroin with intent to distribute on july,in violation of a count possession of heroin with intent to distribute within feet of a school on each of those two dates,in violation of a counts and and conspiracy to possess and distribute heroin,in violation of a count following a trial,the jury found the appellant guilty on all five counts.on december,the district court imposed concurrent sentences of life imprisonment on counts,and,thirty years on count,and sixty years on count.the court sentences were enhanced because the government,pursuant to,appropriately brought to the court attention the appellant previous convictions for unrelated felonies.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.the conspiracy charge 
we turn first to the appellant conviction on the conspiracy count and to his contention that the evidence was insufficient to prove that charge.the appellant raised the same point in a timely motion for judgment of acquittal.see.the district court denied the motion,finding the evidence adequate.we review the district court denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo,applying the same standard as the lower court.this means that we must uphold the verdict unless the evidence,viewed in the light most hospitable to the government theory of the case,could not have persuaded a rational trier of fact,beyond any reasonable doubt,of the defendant guilt.united states lara,cir.in other words,the verdict can stand only evidence,viewed in the requisite light,suffices to establish each element of the offense of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
to prove the existence of a conspiracy under,the government must present clear evidence sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that an agreement to commit the substantive offense actually existed,and that the individual defendant knew of the agreement,had intent to agree,and had intent to commit the substantive offense.united states,cir.when direct evidence of any one or more of these elements is lacking,that element may be proven by circumstantial evidence.united states barnes,cir.
in this instance,the appellant claims that there is no significantly probative evidence to show that he and the pregnant woman who was taken into custody,but who was neither charged in this indictment nor called as a witness at the trial were acting in concert.although the appellant concedes that the jury could have found that each of them was selling drugs from the identical locus,he asserts that their mere presence in the same apartment is not enough to establish the existence of a conspiracy.see united states ocampo,cir holding that mere presence of two defendants in the same apartment is insufficient to prove that both knowingly participated in drug trafficking within that apartment.relatedly,he asserts that a conspiracy,by definition,requires more than one member,and that the woman participation in a single heroin sale does not establish her status as a coconspirator.see united states izzi,cir finding participation in a single drug sale,without more,to be inadequate to sustain a conspiracy conviction.
this argument is cleverly constructed,but it understates the force of the government proof.here,unlike in ocampo,the evidence showed that both occupants of the apartment were actively engaged in the sale of drugs.thus,the jury could have found that the pregnant woman was not merely present,but culpably present.united states ortiz,cir distinguishing between mere presence and culpable presence.and here,unlike in izzi,the proof did not show only a single drug sale,but,rather,three sales over a an inventory of heroin suggesting a readiness to engage in future transactions.
even apart from these distinctions,the government evidence is significantly more elaborate than the appellant suggests.the two alleged coconspirators were operating out of the same store and selling identically marked bags from the same inventory both of them were in the apartment at the time of the police both attempted to flee.finally,and perhaps most damagingly,the bills tendered to the pregnant woman and to the appellant,respectively,were found commingled in a p
