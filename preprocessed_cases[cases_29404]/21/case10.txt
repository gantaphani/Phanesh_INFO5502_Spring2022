under florida law,the maximum sentence a capital felon may receive on the basis of a conviction alone is life imprisonment.he may be sentenced to death,but only if an additional sentencing proceeding results in findings by the court that such person shall be punished by death.stat.in that proceeding,the sentencing judge first conducts an evidentiary hearing before a jury.next,the jury,by majority vote,renders an advisory sentence.notwithstanding that recommendation,the court must independently find and weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances before entering a sentence of life or death.
a florida jury convicted petitioner timothy hurst of murder for killing a and recommended the death penalty.the court sentenced hurst to death,but he was granted a new sentencing hearing on appeal.at resentencing,the jury again recommended death,and the judge again found the facts necessary to sentence hurst to death.the florida supreme court affirmed,rejecting hurst argument that his sentence violated the sixth amendment in light of ring arizona,in which this court found unconstitutional an arizona capital sentencing scheme that permitted a judge rather than the jury to find the facts necessary to sentence a defendant to death.
held florida capital sentencing scheme violates the sixth amendment in light of ring.
a any fact that expose s the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury guilty verdict is an element that must be submitted to a jury.apprendi new jersey.applying apprendi to the capital punishment context,the ring court had little difficulty concluding that an arizona judge independent factfinding exposed ring to a punishment greater than the jury guilty verdict authorized,at.ring analysis applies equally here.florida requires not the jury but a judge to make the critical findings necessary to impose the death penalty.that florida provides an advisory jury is immaterial.see walton arizona.as with ring,hurst had the maximum authorized punishment he could receive increased by a judge own factfinding.
b florida counterarguments are rejected.
in arguing that the jury recommendation necessarily included an aggravating circumstance finding,florida fails to appreciate the judge central and singular role under florida law,which makes the court findings necessary to impose death and makes the jury function advisory only.the state can not now treat the jury advisory recommendation as the necessary factual finding required by ring.
florida reliance on blakely washington,is misplaced.there,this court stated that under apprendi,a judge may impose any sentence authorized on the basis of the facts admitted by the defendant,at.florida alleges that hurst counsel admitted the existence of a robbery,but blakely applied apprendi to facts admitted in a guilty plea,in which the defendant necessarily waived his right to a jury trial,while florida has not explained how hurst alleged admissions accomplished a similar waiver.in any event,hurst never admitted to either aggravating circumstance alleged by the state.
that this court upheld florida capital sentencing scheme in hildwin florida,and spaziano florida,does not mean that stare decisis compels the court to do so here,see alleyne united states,sotomayor,concurring.time and subsequent cases have washed away the logic of spaziano and hildwin.those decisions are thus overruled to the extent they allow a sentencing judge to find an aggravating circumstance,independent of a jury factfinding,that is necessary for imposition of the death penalty.
the state assertion that any error was harmless is not addressed here,where there is no reason to depart from the court normal pattern of leaving such considerations to state courts.
so,reversed and remanded.

timothy lee hurst,petitioner florida 
on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of florida 
justice sotomayor delivered the opinion of the court.
a florida jury convicted timothy lee hurst of murdering his,cynthia harrison.a jury recommended that hurst judge impose a death sentence.notwithstanding this recommendation,florida law required the judge to hold a separate hearing and determine whether sufficient aggravating circumstances existed to justify imposing the death penalty.the judge so found and sentenced hurst to death.
we hold this sentencing scheme unconstitutional.the sixth amendment requires a jury,not a judge,to find each fact necessary to impose a sentence of death.a jury mere recommendation is not enough.
on may,cynthia harrison body was discovered in the freezer of the restaurant where she worked bound,gagged,and stabbed over times.the restaurant safe was unlocked and open,missing hundreds of dollars.the state of florida charged harrison,timothy lee hurst,with her murder.see so.
during hurst trial,the state offered substantial forensic evidence linking hurst to the murder.witnesses also testified that hurst announced in advance that he planned to rob the restaurant that hurst and harrison were the only people scheduled to work when harrison was killed and that hurst disposed of evidence and used stolen money to purchase shoes and rings.
hurst responded with an alibi defense.he claimed he never made it to work because his car broke down.hurst told police that he called the restaurant to let harrison know he would be late.he said she sounded scared and he could hear another person presumably the real murderer whispering in the background.
at the close of hurst defense,the judge instructed the jury that it could find hurst guilty of murder under two theories premeditated murder or felony murder for an unlawful killing during a robbery.the jury convicted hurst of murder but did not specify which theory it believed.
murder is a capital felony in florida.see.stat.a.under state law,the maximum sentence a capital felon may receive on the basis of the conviction alone is life imprisonment.a person who has been convicted of a capital felony shall be punished by death only if an additional sentencing proceeding results in findings by the court that such person shall be punished by death.ibid.o therwise such person shall be punished by life imprisonment and shall be ineligible for parole.ibid.
the additional sentencing proceeding florida employs is a hybrid proceeding in which a jury renders an advisory verdict but the judge makes the ultimate sentencing determinations.ring arizona.first,the sentencing judge conducts an evidentiary hearing before a jury.stat.next,the jury renders an advisory sentence of life or death without specifying the factual basis of its recommendation.notwithstanding the recommendation of a majority of the jury,the court,after weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances,shall enter a sentence of life imprisonment or death.if the court imposes death,it must set forth in writing its findings upon which the sentence of death is based.ibid.although the judge must give the jury recommendation great weight,tedder state,so,per curiam,the sentencing order must reflect the trial judge independent judgment about the existence of aggravating and mitigating factors,blackwelder state,so,per curiam.
following this procedure,hurst jury recommended a death sentence.the judge independently agreed.see so,at.on postconviction review,however,the florida supreme court vacated hurst sentence for reasons not relevant to this case.see so.
at resentencing in,the sentencing judge conducted a new hearing during which hurst offered mitigating evidence that he was not a major participant in the murder because he was at home when it happened.app.the sentencing judge instructed the advisory jury that it could recommend a death sentence if it found at least one aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was especially heinous,atrocious,or cruel or that it occurred while hurst was committing a robbery,at.the jury recommended death by a vote of to.
the sentencing judge then sentenced hurst to death.in her written order,the judge based the sentence in part on her independent determination that both the and robbery aggravators existed,at.she assigned great weight to her findings as well as to the jury recommendation of death,at.
the florida supreme court affirmed to.so.as relevant here,the court rejected hurst argument that his sentence violated the sixth amendment in light of ring.ring,the court recognized,held that capital defendants are entitled to a jury determination of any fact on which the legislature conditions an increase in the maximum punishment.so,at.but the court considered ring inapplicable in light of this court repeated support of florida capital sentencing scheme in cases.so,at citing hildwin florida,per curiam see also spaziano florida.specifically,in hildwin,this court held that the sixth amendment does not require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death be made by the jury.at.the florida court noted that we have never expressly overruled hildwin,and did not do so in ring.so,at.
justice pariente,joined by two colleagues,dissented from this portion of the court opinion.she reiterated her view that ring requires any fact that qualifies a capital defendant for a sentence of death to be found by a jury.at opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.
we granted certiorari to resolve whether florida capital sentencing scheme violates the sixth amendment in light of ring.we hold that it does,and reverse.
the sixth amendment provides in all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,by an impartial jury this right,in conjunction with the due process clause,requires that each element of a crime be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.alleyne united states,slip,at.in apprendi new jersey,this court held that any fact that expose s the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury guilty verdict is an element that must be submitted to a jury.in the years since apprendi,we have applied its rule to instances involving plea bargains,blakely washington,sentencing guidelines,united states booker,criminal fines,southern union united states,mandatory minimums,alleyne,at,and,in ring,capital punishment.
in ring,we concluded that arizona capital sentencing scheme violated apprendi rule because the state allowed a judge to find the facts necessary to sentence a defendant to death.an arizona jury had convicted timothy ring of felony murder,at.under state law,ring could not be sentenced to death,the statutory maximum penalty for murder,unless further findings were made.at.specifically,a judge could sentence ring to death only after independently finding at least one aggravating circumstance,at.ring judge followed this procedure,found an aggravating circumstance,and sentenced ring to death.
the court had little difficulty concluding that the required finding of an aggravated circumstance exposed ring to a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury guilty verdict.at quoting apprendi,at alterations omitted.had ring judge not engaged in any factfinding,ring would have received a life sentence.ring,at.ring death sentence therefore violated his right to have a jury find the facts behind his punishment.
the analysis the ring court applied to arizona sentencing scheme applies equally to florida.like arizona at the time of ring,florida does not require the jury to make the critical findings necessary to impose the death penalty.rather,florida requires a judge to find these facts.stat.although florida incorporates an advisory jury verdict that arizona lacked,we have previously made clear that this distinction is immaterial it is true that in florida the jury recommends a sentence,but it does not make specific factual findings with regard to the existence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances and its recommendation is not binding on the trial judge.a florida trial court no more has the assistance of a jury findings of fact with respect to sentencing issues than does a trial judge in arizona.walton arizona,accord,state steele,so,t he trial court alone must make detailed findings about the existence and weight of aggravating circumstances it has no jury findings on which to rely 
as with timothy ring,the maximum punishment timothy hurst could have received without any findings was life in prison without parole.as with ring,a judge increased hurst authorized punishment based on her own factfinding.in light of ring,we hold that hurst sentence violates the sixth amendment.
without contesting ring holding,florida offers a bevy of arguments for why hurst sentence is constitutional.none holds water.
florida concedes that ring required a jury to find every fact necessary to render hurst eligible for the death penalty.but florida argues that when hurst sentencing jury recommended a death sentence,it necessarily included a finding of an aggravating circumstance.brief for respondent.the state contends that this finding qualified hurst for the death penalty under florida law,thus satisfying ring.t he additional requirement that a judge also find an aggravator,florida concludes,only provides the defendant additional protection.brief for respondent.
the state fails to appreciate the central and singular role the judge plays under florida law.as described above and by the florida supreme court,the florida sentencing statute does not make a defendant eligible for death until findings by the court that such person shall be punished by death.stat.emphasis added.the trial court alone must find the facts t hat sufficient aggravating circumstances exist and t hat there are insufficient mitigating circumstances to outweigh the aggravating circumstances.see steele,so,at.t he jury function under the florida death penalty statute is advisory only.spaziano state,so.the state can not now treat the advisory recommendation by the jury as the necessary factual finding that ring requires.
florida launches its second salvo at hurst himself,arguing that he admitted in various contexts that an aggravating circumstance existed.even if ring normally requires a jury to hear all facts necessary to sentence a defendant to death,florida argues,ring does not require jury findings on facts defendants have admitted.brief for respondent.florida cites our decision in blakely washington,in which we stated that under apprendi,a judge may impose any sentence authorized on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.at emphasis deleted.in light of blakely,florida points to various instances in which hurst counsel allegedly admitted the existence of a robbery.florida contends that these admissions made hurst eligible for the death penalty.brief for respondent.
blakely,however,was a decision applying apprendi to facts admitted in a guilty plea,in which the defendant necessarily waived his right to a jury trial.see,at.florida has not explained how hurst alleged admissions accomplished a similar waiver.florida argument is also meritless on its own terms.hurst never admitted to either aggravating circumstance alleged by the state.at most,his counsel simply refrained from challenging the aggravating circumstances in parts of his appellate briefs.see,initial brief for appellant in no,not challeng ing the trial court findings but arguing that death was nevertheless a disproportionate punishment.
the state next argues that stare decisis compels us to uphold florida capital sentencing scheme.as the florida supreme court observed,this court repeatedly has reviewed and upheld florida capital sentencing statute over the past quarter of a century.bottoson moore,so,per curiam citing hildwin,spaziano.in a comparable situation,the florida court reasoned,the united states supreme court held
