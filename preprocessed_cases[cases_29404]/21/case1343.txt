defendant russell jennings appeals from two april judgments of the united states district court for the northern district of new york,thomas mcavoy,judge.the first judgment,dated april and entered on april following a conditional plea of guilty,convicted jennings of possessing child pornography in violation of a b and b and sentenced him principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by a life term of supervised release child pornography judgment ii.the second judgment,dated april and entered on april after jennings had admitted violating several conditions of a term imposed on him in a november,amended judgment convicting him of a prior a b offense child pornography judgment i,revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to months imprisonment,to be served concurrently with the prison term imposed in child pornography judgment ii,and to be followed by a life term of supervised release the supervised release violation judgment.on his appeal challenging child pornography judgment ii,jennings contends principally that the district court should have dismissed the indictment on the ground that it was procured by his probation officer or acting in excess of the statutory and constitutional authority and that,absent dismissal of the indictment,certain statements jennings made to his probation officer,as well as evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant obtained on the basis of those statements,should have been suppressed on the ground that his statements were protected by the fifth amendment privilege against.in challenging the supervised release violation judgment,jennings argues that the severity of the penalties it imposed reflected his new conviction and that those penalties should be reduced if child pornography judgment ii is vacated.finding no merit in jennings challenges to child pornography judgment ii,we affirm both judgments.
background 
except as indicated,the following events,which are reflected principally in records of the united states probation office probation office or uspo,in affidavits submitted by jennings probation officer at various stages,and in an affirmation submitted by jennings attorney,are not in dispute.
jennings conviction and his supervised release 
in the fall of,following his plea of guilty in the united states district court for the northern district of new york before david hurd,judge,jennings was convicted on one count of possession of child pornography in violation of a b and was sentenced principally to a term of months imprisonment,to be followed by a year term of supervised release the case.the specified terms of supervised release included the conditions that jennings shall not commit another federal,state or local crime shall answer truthfully all inquiries by the probation officer and follow the instructions of the probation officer and shall not use or possess any computer or any other device with online capabilities,at any location,except at his place of employment,unless he participates in the computer restriction and monitoring program.child pornography judgment i,at.paragraph of the special conditions of supervision also provided as follows

id.at emphasis added special condition.in april,jennings began serving his term of supervised release and moved into his brother home in afton,new york.
in january,the probation office filed a petition in the case for modifications consented to by jennings of his conditions in order to,inter alia,expand the permitted methods beyond polygraphs.the petition,signed by jennings probation officer,michael pierce,stated that jennings had failed as deceptive a polygraph examination in july and that jennings had admitted during the post test interview to sexual abuse of all four of his children two boys and two girls from a very early age.uspo request for modifying the conditions or term of supervision with consent of the offender modification petition at.the modification petition stated that although jennings was progressing in treatment and writing apology letters to his children,the probation officer believed that the defendant requires modification of his conditions to hold him accountable,aid in the monitoring process,and enhance the protection of the community.id.
judge mcavoy granted the petition.the second paragraph of special condition was renumbered a,the first sentence of which,as revised,read as follows 
your supervised release may include examinations using a polygraph,computerized voice stress analyzer,or other similar device to obtain information necessary for supervision,case monitoring,and treatment.
order dated january,modification order,at emphasis of modification added.the substance of special condition passages with regard to the preservation of fifth amendment rights during any such examination remained the same.id.

modification order at emphases added.
jennings admissions while on supervised release 
on february,pierce notified jennings that he was to appear for a computer voice stress analyzer cvsa examination the following week.around the time that jennings received that message,he attended a group therapy session at which a speaker,discussing his own addiction to child pornography,emphasized the importance of being honest about one behavior.inspired by the speaker message,jennings admitted during the therapy session that he had accessed pornography,including teen porn,on his brother computer five to seven times.
the counselor leading the therapy session instructed jennings to inform his probation officer of his actions the counselor said that if jennings failed to do so within a week,she would report jennings admission to pierce directly and she did contact pierce on february.in the meantime,on february,jennings left a telephone message for pierce,who returned the call the next day.during the february conversation,jennings admitted that he had previously lied to pierce about whether he had viewed pornography on his brother computer.pierce instructed jennings to come to the probation office to discuss the matter further.
on february,jennings reported to the probation office and made additional admissions.he told pierce that he had used his brother computer to,inter alia,access and view child pornography times since july,to search the internet for pornographic videos featuring teenagers,and to try in vain to access teen chat rooms.jennings was subjected to a cvsa examination,which he failed by showing deceptiveness with regard to,inter alia,having sexual thoughts about his year old daughter,being alone with his daughter or another minor since his release,and attempting to have a sexual relationship with a minor since his release.
later that day,pierce contacted federal bureau of investigation fbi agent james lyons and assistant united states attorney ausa miroslav lovric,to report and discuss jennings admissions.lovric viewed pierce information as providing probable cause to believe that jennings had violated a b and to believe that evidence of that crime was in the computer at jennings residence.although jennings conditions allowed pierce on the basis of reasonable suspicion,with or without the assistance of other law enforcement officers,to search jennings residence,lovric decided that a search warrant should be obtained because jennings lived in his brother residence.accordingly,the united states attorney office usao prepared a search warrant application for jennings brother home pierce,with lyons assistance,drafted an affidavit dated february,first pierce aff,in support of the search warrant application lovric reviewed the affidavit and pierce and lovric then went to judge mcavoy chambers to apply for the warrant,which judge mcavoy issued.
that evening,fbi and uspo officials executed the warrant and searched jennings brother home.among the items seized was jennings brother computer,which was sent to the broome county security division for forensic analysis.pending the results of that analysis,jennings remained on supervised release.
in june,pierce learned that the examination of jennings brother computer had revealed,inter alia,dozens of images of child pornography.pierce discussed the results of the forensic analysis with lovric in early july,and when jennings reported to the probation office for a regularly scheduled visit on july,pierce and another probation officer questioned him about the new evidence.confronted with various images of child pornography that had been found on the computer,jennings admitted,inter alia,that he had searched for,viewed,and possessed those images and that prior to february he had been viewing child pornography on a daily basis.
on august,lovric informed pierce that the usao planned to draft a criminal complaint on august and have jennings arrested on august.pierce reviewed the complaint,signed it,and provided an affidavit dated august,second pierce aff,in support of the complaint.jennings was arrested on august.
c.the and court proceedings 
on august,the probation office filed a petition in jennings case,which had been reassigned to judge mcavoy,seeking a warrant for jennings appearance in connection with that office recommendation that jennings supervised release be revoked the revocation petition.the revocation petition,signed by pierce and a supervisory probation officer,stated that jennings had violated three conditions of his supervised release that he not commit another federal,state or local crime,that he not use or possess any computer or any other device with online capabilities,at any location,except at his place of employment,unless he participate s in the computer restriction and monitoring program,and that,during his treatment and ensuing supervision,he not view,possess,own,subscribe to or purchase any material,including pictures,videotapes,films,magazines,books,telephone services,electronic media,computer programs,or computer services that depict sexually explicit conduct.judge mcavoy signed the warrant on august.
on august,a grand jury returned an indictment indictment charging jennings with one count of accessing with intent to view,and possession of,child pornography from july through february,in violation of a b see indictment at,and charging that because of his conviction he was subject to an enhanced penalty pursuant to s.b see indictment at.this case the case too was assigned to judge mcavoy.
in an omnibus motion in the case,jennings moved to dismiss the indictment and moved to suppress his february statements to pierce,as well as the evidence seized from his brother residence pursuant to the february search warrant.the motion to dismiss challenged the propriety of pierce actions in contacting the fbi and the usao and in assisting with the application for a search warrant,with the conduct of the search,and with the preparation of the criminal complaint.jennings argued that,b eing within the judiciary,probation officers have no authority to investigate new criminal conduct or initiate new criminal proceedings memorandum of law in support of russell jennings motion to dismiss the indictment and suppress evidence jennings memorandum at,and that the indictment was the product of the probation officer impermissible exercise of law enforcement authority id.at and the direct result of the probation office violation of the constitutionally required separation of powers id.at.
as a member of the judiciary,officer pierce was limited to supervising the conditions of jennings release.if he thought that jennings had committed a violation,he was free to notify the sentencing court of his findings by way of petition for revocation of supervision.however,he was not authorized to play law enforcement officer by obtaining a warrant to search and seize evidence of criminal behavior and then initiate criminal proceedings by filing a criminal complaint.those actions were reserved to law enforcement agents within the executive.
id.at footnote omitted.
jennings argued that if the indictment were not dismissed,at least the evidence supporting the indictment should be suppressed.to the extent pertinent to this appeal,he argued that his statements to pierce were compelled admissions,and thus were privileged under the fifth amendment,and that those statements should be suppressed,as should the physical evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant issued on the basis of those statements.see id.at.
in opposition to jennings motion,the government submitted an october,affidavit from pierce third pierce aff.and an affirmation from ausa lovric describing their actions in consequence of jennings february,admissions as to his use of his brother computer to search for and view child pornography.pierce stated,inter alia,that he had,as described in part above,contacted the fbi and lovric and informed them of jennings admitted conduct,and that pierce had put his information into affidavit form so that lovric could obtain a search warrant for jennings brother home.see third pierce aff.
lovric,in his affirmation,stated,inter alia,that on february,after receiving pierce information as to jennings admissions,it was lovric view that there existed probable cause to believe jennings was violating a b,and the usao immediately commenced an investigation of jennings.see affirmation of miroslav lovric dated october,lovric aff.lovric reviewed the affidavit that pierce had prepared in collaboration with fbi agent lyons,the first pierce aff,and lovric had the usao prepare the other papers he would need in order to obtain a search warrant.see lovric aff.lovric stated that his decision to s eek a search warrant was solely intended to address the circumstance that,while jennings was required to submit to a search without a warrant and on the basis of reasonable suspicion,jennings resided with his brother,who was not subject to the same requirements.id.lovric stated that after his office had prepared the necessary papers,he took pierce to the judge chambers to make the search warrant application.see id.
in a decision and order dated november,reported at wl,the district court,as set out in greater detail in parts.and.below,denied both of jennings motions.it ruled,inter alia,that because jennings february statements in his interview with pierce had been made without any assertion of the fifth amendment privilege against,the statements were voluntary and jennings had thus waived that privilege.see wl,at.
jennings and the government thereafter entered into a plea agreement with respect to the case,in which jennings admitted that c ommencing in july of,and while on federal supervised release,he had,inter alia,u s ed a computer to access,view,and possess child pornography.plea agreement dated december,a.jennings agreed,with the consent of the government and the approval of the court,to enter a conditional plea of guilty to the offense charged in the indictment,reserving the right to pursue on appeal only the district court determinations of the motions in his pretrial omnibus motion.id.a.child pornography judgment ii was entered on april,convicting jennings of possession of child pornography in violation of a b and b,and sentencing him principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by supervised release for life.
on april,a hearing was held on the revocation petition,and jennings admitted that he was guilty of violating the conditions imposed in child pornography judgment i as alleged in the revocation petition,by engaging in new criminal conduct,impermissibly using a computer,and viewing child pornography.the supervised release violation judgment was entered on april,revoking jennings supervised release and sentencing him to months imprisonment,to be served concurrently with the prison term imposed in child pornography judgment ii,and to be followed by a life term of supervised release.
jennings appealed both judgments the appeals were consolidated by this court.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,jennings contends principally that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that pierce actions in reporting to the fbi and the usao and his involvement in the procurement of a search warrant and the filing of a criminal complaint exceeded the uspo statutory and constitutional authority and denying his motion to suppress his february statements to pierce,as well as the evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant issued on the basis of those statements,on the ground that the use of those statements violated his fifth amendment privilege against.the arguments that are properly before us raise only issues of law.reviewing the district court legal conclusions de novo,see,united states bari,cir united states klimek,cir,we conclude that jennings contentions are meritless.
a.the arguments for dismissal of the indictment 
probation officers statutory authority 
jennings contends that although it was permissible for pierce to inform the government of violations and to seek assistance from law enforcement officers in executing the search of jennings residence,it was beyond pierce authority to meet with a federal prosecutor to discuss and plan the investigation of criminal activity,to swear out an affidavit in support of a search warrant,to apply for a search warrant,to execute a search warrant,to discuss the initiation of new criminal proceedings,to meet with the ausa to view evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant and discuss the collection of incriminating information from his supervisee,to interrogate a supervisee at the direction of the government and with the aim of collecting and sharing incriminating information concerning seized evidence,to discuss the crafting of a criminal complaint with the government,or to swear out a criminal complaint.jennings brief on appeal at.we disagree.
a person who is placed on supervised release following a term of imprisonment is required,during the term imposed,to be supervised by a probation officer to the degree warranted by the conditions specified by the sentencing court.section of title outlines the probation officer supervisory responsibilities,which include duties to 
instruct a probationer or a person on supervised release,who is under his supervision,as to the conditions specified by the sentencing court,and provide him with a written statement clearly setting forth all such conditions 
keep informed,to the degree required by the conditions specified by the sentencing court,as to the conduct and condition of a probationer or a person on supervised release,who is under his supervision,and report his conduct and condition to the sentencing court 
use all suitable methods,not inconsistent with the conditions specified by the court,to aid a probationer or a person on supervised release who is under his supervision,and to bring about improvements in his conduct and condition 
be responsible for the supervision of any probationer or a person on supervised release who is known to be within the judicial district 
keep a record of his work,
upon request of the attorney general or his designee,assist in the supervision of and furnish information about,a person within the custody of the attorney general while on work release,furlough,or other authorized release from his regular place of confinement,or while in prerelease custody pursuant to the provisions of section c 
keep informed concerning the conduct,condition,and compliance with any condition of probation,including the payment of a fine or restitution 
a when directed by the court,and to the degree required by the regimen of care or treatment ordered by the court as a condition of release,keep informed as to the conduct and provide supervision of a person conditionally released under the provisions of section or of this title,and report such person conduct and condition to the court ordering release and to the attorney general or his designee and 
b immediately report any violation of the conditions of release to the court and the attorney general or his designee 
perform any other duty that the court may designate.
the district court,in discussing jennings contention that pierce actions exceeded his statutory authority,noted imposition of the above duties and stated as follows 
in this case,all investigative activities by the uspo related to whether defendant was complying with the conditions of his supervised release.this is within the statutory duties of a probation officer.specifically,the uspo investigated whether defendant was accessing child pornography in violation of the terms of his supervised release.that the information obtained by the uspo also supported new criminal charges does not bring the uspo actions outside the scope of its statutory duties.
the fact that the probation officer may have sought the assistance of the fbi or the usao or reported the conduct to the usao does not change the result.the usao is permitted to petition the court for revocation of a defendant supervised release.united states bermudez plaza,cir r evocation hearings are not criminal proceedings and neither the attorney general nor any other officer is solely responsible for their initiation.see also united states mejia sanchez,cir united states davis,cir.given this authority of the usao,it is not unreasonable to expect probation officers,as part of their official duties,to share information with the usao to prepare revocation proceedings whether the usao decides to use that same information to commence criminal proceedings is within the sole discretion of the usao.see davis,at t he attorney retains discretion to file new criminal charges against the defendant arising from the defendant violation of conditions of release which was criminal in nature.accordingly,the court finds that the uspo did not exceed its statutory authority.

we agree.while supervised release is primarily intended to assist individuals in their transition to community life,united states johnson,s entencing courts,in determining the conditions of a defendant supervised release,are required to consider,among other factors,the need to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,and to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant,id.quoting a see d.thus,the probation officer has multiple responsibilities that include protect ing the public from persons whose release proves threatening to the community.united states reyes,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,and a probation officer is duty bound to report wrongdoing by the probationer when it comes to his attention,minnesota murphy,or murphy internal quotation marks omitted.neither the fact that pierce performance of his responsibilities involved providing information to other government agencies that enabled those agencies to perform their own functions,nor the fact that he put his information as to jennings admissions into the affidavit form that best allowed those agencies to perform their duties,placed pierce actions beyond the scope of his own statutory authority.
separation of powers 
under article iii of the constitution,the province of the judicial branch of the federal government is the adjudication of the rights and obligations of the parties to cases or controversies under the applicable laws.the uspo is a legally constituted arm of the judicial branch.united states inserra,cir see a a district court of the united states shall appoint qualified persons to serve as probation officers within the jurisdiction and under the direction of the court making the appointment.article ii of the constitution gives the executive branch of the government exclusive authority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case.united states nixon.
the doctrine of separation of powers prohibits any branch of the federal government from exercising control or coercive influence,direct or indirect,over either of the other branches.mistretta united states,internal quotation marks omitted.but t his is not to say that the three branches are not parts of one government and that each in the field of its duties may not invoke the action of the two other branches in so far as the action invoked shall not be an assumption of the constitutional field of action of another branch.hampton,united states,hampton.the framers of the constitution did not require and indeed rejected the notion that the three branches must be entirely separate and distinct.mistretta,at.in order to determin e what one branch may do in seeking assistance from another branch,the extent and character of that assistance must be fixed according to common sense and the inherent necessities of the governmental.hampton,at.
the district court,applying these principles,observed that 
t he uspo statutory duties of keeping informed of whether a probationer is complying with the conditions of release necessarily overlap some law enforcement duties that the results of the uspo duties may have dual uses forming the basis for a revocation of supervised release and the initiation of new criminal charges does not run afoul of the separation of powers.in this case,the undisputed evidence is that the usao was involved in the criminal investigation from an early stage.the record evidence is that the usao conferred with the uspo concerning obtaining a search warrant prepared the warrant application based on information obtained from the uspo presented the warrant to this court made the decision to file new criminal charges made the decision as to which criminal charges to pursue,see gov t mem.of law at prepared the felony complaint,see lovric aff.at filed the criminal charges presented the matter to a grand jury and continues to prosecute the charges against defendant.the probation officer has no role in how the information submitted to the usao is used by it.see united states hook,cir.inasmuch as the executive branch has been involved from an early stage and has made the critical determinations whether,and how,to proceed with new criminal charges against defendant,the court finds no encroachment that violated the separation of powers doctrine.

jennings contention that i f pierce thought that jennings had committed a violation,he could do no more than notify the sentencing court of his findings by way of petition for revocation of supervision jennings memorandum at emphases added falls of its own weight.any transformation of thought s into findings plainly required investigation the conditions expressly permitted pierce to search jennings residence and permitted him to enlist fbi assistance to do so and he was duty bound to report wrongdoing by his supervisee when it came to his attention,murphy,at.
jennings assertions that pierce usurped the executive branch prosecutorial function are conclusory.jennings proffered no evidence to contradict lovric affirmation stating that it was the usao that drafted and applied for the search warrant and that the usao drafted and filed the criminal complaint.the pierce affidavits and lovric affirmation,showing that pierce merely informed the fbi and the ausa of jennings admissions of wrongdoing and then provided the information under oath in order to allow the executive branch to perform its duties,were not called into question by any proffer of evidence by jennings.we conclude that there was no violation,substantially for the reasons stated by the district court.
delay in reporting jennings failure of the cvsa 
jennings also points out that pierce did not inform the district court of jennings failure of the february cvsa examination until february,and he contends that he is entitled to dismissal of the indictment on the ground that pierce violated a statutory requirement that he report any violation of a term to the court immediately.jennings reply brief on appeal at quoting b see also jennings brief on appeal at.as jennings did not make this argument in the district court,it is reviewable only for plain error.see,e.b united states brown,cir.
under the standard set by the supreme court for the application of rule b,before an appellate court is allowed to correct an error that was not timely raised in the district court four conditions must be met.t here must be error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights and i f all three of those conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson united states,quoting united states olano,other internal quotation marks omitted.
united states pescatore,cir.we doubt that jennings immediacy argument meets the first two parts of this test,and it surely does not meet the last two.
we question whether pierce delay in informing the district court that jennings had failed the cvsa violated for two reasons.first,although jennings could have violated a condition if he had refused to submit to the cvsa,it is hardly clear that he could violate a condition simply by giving answers that appeared to be deceptive.second,assuming that giving deceptive answers would constitute such a violation,it seems doubtful,given the structure of quoted in part above,that the immediacy requirement invoked by jennings here was applicable.a probation officer is in general required to keep informed of and report the supervisee conduct and condition to the sentencing court.given the purposes of supervised release,a requirement of appropriate promptness is implicit.see,guidelines policy statement any alleged violation punishable by imprisonment for more than one year should be reported by the probation officer to the court promptly other violations,unless required by the court,need not be reported promptly if the probation officer determines that they are minor,sporadic,and pose no undue risk to an individual or the public.in,only subpart b of subsection states any requirement of immedia cy.if congress had intended to require immediacy with respect to every report of a violation by any supervisee,we would have expected that requirement to be set out in each subsection requiring a report or in a subsection of its own,rather than as a subpart of one subsection.
further,in subsection in subpart b of which the immediate report ing requirement appears subpart a deals with the monitoring of persons condition
