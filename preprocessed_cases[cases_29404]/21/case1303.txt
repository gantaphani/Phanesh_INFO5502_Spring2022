anthony watkins appeals from a judgment of sentence entered june,in the united states district court for the northern district of new york kahn.watkins was convicted,after a guilty plea,of transporting a minor in interstate commerce with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation of a.the district court sentenced watkins principally to a month term of imprisonment.in reaching that sentence,the court applied three sentencing enhancements pursuant to of the united states sentencing guidelines or the guidelines because the offense involved the commission of a sex act,b a use of a computer to entice a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct,b a and misrepresentation of identity to persuade,induce,entice,or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct undue influence to engage in such conduct,b a and b.
on appeal,watkins challenges the three sentencing enhancements and contends that his month sentence is substantively unreasonable.for the following reasons,we conclude that the district court did not err in applying the sentencing enhancements and in imposing a month term of imprisonment.
background 
the following description of the conduct underlying watkins conviction is drawn from the findings of the district court,the court expressly having found the facts described in watkins presentence investigation report psr supported by a preponderance of the evidence.these facts are not disputed on appeal.
at the time of the conviction of the offense charged,watkins was years old,homeless,unemployed,and living in a baseball dugout at schenectady county community college in schenectady,new york.by his own account,he supported himself by selling drugs and stolen property.from the age of,he had spent his life in and out of jail.watkins was a frequent visitor to the public library in schenectady.he often went there to use the internet and to listen to free music on.jango encouraged social networking by identifying for each user other jango users with similar musical tastes.jango enabled its users to communicate with each other.in april,watkins began communicating through jango with a fifteen girl,jane doe,a resident of connecticut.the two shared an interest in rock music.watkins initially communicated with doe a few times a week using jango,as well as myspace and email.
on may,doe informed watkins that she was fifteen years old and had a boyfriend.she asked watkins if he wanted her to talk all sexy to him and get him all horny and shit.watkins said thanks,finally,of course i do want you to that the point remember i only live in new york so if you ever get brave enough watkins told doe that thinking about her at this innocent age is like an hour of wild sex already watkins asked doe if she was a virgin,and she stated that she was.watkins and doe repeatedly discussed sex and what it would be like to have sex,often in graphic detail.they had computer sex,phone sex,and they talk ed dirty to each other online.
in watkins initial communications with doe,he misrepresented his age,stating that he was years old when he was actually.he also misrepresented to doe that he had two children he actually had five and that he was a former drug addict by his own account,he smoked marijuana all day long,every day.watkins also repeatedly told doe that he loved her and said that he was waiting for her to get older so she could come live with him in new york.doe responded that she loved him too.
watkins made plans to travel to doe home in connecticut on october,but he canceled the trip,explaining that his check had not come.nonetheless,watkins promised doe that he would visit the next day,saturday,november,and sent doe an electronic message stating 
d o be depressed,i will be there you got that,girl i am sad cause my money fucked me up i would be in your panties by now i ca let you go so stay be my girl it only a age difference,it common for couples.
watkins also asked doe to keep her phone on so that when he arrived at her house she could jump out the window and he could teach her the differences between fucking and making love,adding that he would take great care of her wants and needs.
on november,watkins drove from schenectady to connecticut,where doe resided,and called doe cell phone when he arrived outside of her house.doe answered but did not invite him in,explaining that she and her family were members of the jehovah witness faith,and that her mother was very strict.instead,doe met watkins at the end of her long driveway in the car that he was driving 
the two began kissing as soon as doe got into the car.watkins asked doe to perform oral sex on him,and she did.he then performed oral sex on her,and the two engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse.doe mother then called her on her cell phone,and doe returned home,telling her mother that she had gone for a walk.
around that same night,watkins called doe and told her that he was at the end of her driveway again.doe sneaked out of her house and met watkins in his car.watkins then drove to a nearby park and parked near the woods,where he gave doe four necklaces and two rings.watkins and doe had vaginal intercourse on the back seat of the car,but the two were interrupted repeatedly by phone calls from doe mother.to get away from doe mother,watkins and doe suddenly decided to get on the highway and leave town.watkins suggested that they travel to new york.
watkins then drove doe to new york,where he could engage in sexual intercourse with doe without interruption.at some point along the way,watkins parked along the roadside,and watkins and doe had sexual intercourse.they arrived in new york around and stopped in the town of niskayuna,where watkins informed doe that the car had run out of gas.watkins and doe then abandoned the car in a parking lot and took a bus to schenectady.
in schenectady,watkins told doe that they should not go to his home because he feared that her mother or the police would find them there.he and doe therefore spent time at watkins friend house.they went for a free breakfast at a church and had lunch at a restaurant,which watkins told doe was also free.later that day,watkins took doe to the same library where watkins previously had accessed the internet.while there,watkins deleted all of his identifying information from the websites on which he and doe had communicated,including his area code,picture,and last name.
the next day,sunday,november,watkins and doe traveled to a salvation army store where they were given two sets of clothes and coats for free.doe boyfriend called her that day and tried to convince her to come home.doe then told watkins that she wanted to go home.watkins became jealous and unhappy with her.he told her that her boyfriend was not treating her well because he did not have sexual intercourse with her but only engaged in touching,which watkins said was kids stuff.nonetheless,watkins took doe to the bus station,though doe was informed eventually that it was closed on sundays.
that night,watkins took doe to the baseball dugout at schenectady county community college,where he kept three blankets.they spent the night in the dugout and had unprotected vaginal intercourse three times.when they awoke the next day,november,watkins and doe had vaginal intercourse again.they then returned to the salvation army store for breakfast.
later that same day,watkins told doe to call her family from his cellular phone,which she did.she told her father and sister that she was alright and that she would be home later in the week.watkins and doe then traveled back to the schenectady library.however,the police,acting on a tip,were at the library and arrested watkins.watkins refused to answer questions about whether he had engaged in sexual intercourse with doe,but a forensic examination of physical evidence found at the baseball dugout where doe and watkins spent the night was abundant with proof watkins sperm was found on a tampon worn by doe,and dna of both watkins and doe was found on the dugout blankets.
on november,watkins pled guilty to count one of a superseding indictment for transporting a minor in interstate commerce with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation of a the united states probation office thereafter prepared a psr,which calculated watkins offense level at and which included three enhancements,pursuant to the guidelines,because the offense involved the commission of a sex act,b a use of a computer to entice a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct,b a and misrepresentation of identity to persuade,induce,entice,or coerce a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct undue influence to engage in such conduct,b a and b the psr also recommended a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and a one level reduction for timely notification of intention to enter a guilty plea,pursuant to a and b,respectively.the psr further calculated watkins criminal history level at vi based on his prior state crime convictions,which included criminal possession of cocaine,theft,and possession of forged instruments and stolen property.
based on the foregoing,the psr determined watkins guidelines range to be to months imprisonment.in a letter dated may,watkins objected to the psr insofar as the base offense level included three enhancements pursuant to b,as set forth in more detail below.in an addendum to the psr,the probation office addressed watkins objections but maintained its original recommendations 
at sentencing on june,the district court expressly adopted the psr,and the government requested a sentence at the top of the guidelines range.the court then imposed a sentence of months imprisonment stating the c ourt finds a high range sentence to be appropriate in this case,based on the high risk of recidivism that the defendant presents,his lack of remorse for commission of the instant offense,his failure to grasp the gravity of his conduct and the future effect it may well have on the victim and,of course,his lengthy criminal history.the district court also imposed a of supervised release and ordered restitution to be paid to the new york state crime victims board in the amount of.this timely appeal followed.
on appeal,watkins challenges the procedural reasonableness of the three sentencing enhancements imposed by the district court and argues,in addition,that his month sentence is substantively unreasonable.with respect to his procedural challenges,watkins contends that the enhancement for commission of a sex act was applied in error because it constitutes i mpermissible double counting the enhancement for use of a computer was applied in error because watkins did not use a computer to facilitate the travel of doe and the enhancement for misrepresentation of identify to persuade,induce,entice,coerce,or facilitate the travel of,a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct for unduly influenc ing a minor to engage in such conduct was improperly applied.
as to the third contention,watkins argues that a his age misrepresentation did not constitute misrepresentation of a participant identity,b the misrepresentation was not made to facilitate the travel of a minor,and c the district court did not determine whether watkins overcame doe voluntariness.with respect to watkins substantive challenge,he contends that he should have received a less harsh sentence within the g uidelines range because,inter alia,he accepted responsibility for his actions,did not use force or violence against doe,and because doe was an active,willing and voluntary.

ii.procedural reasonableness 
enhancement for commission of a sex act 
watkins first challenges the district court imposition of a sentencing enhancement pursuant to b a.this subsection of the guidelines provides for a two level increase in a defendant offense level if the offense involved the commission of a sex act or sexual contact.watkins does not argue that the district court clearly erred by finding that he committed a sex act with doe during the course of the offense.rather,he argues that the b a enhancement constitutes i mpermissible double counting because it punishe s defendant for the same conduct which made up defendant offense under a.appellant.br.first alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.we disagree.
impermissible double counting occurs when one part of the g uidelines is applied to increase a defendant sentence to reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by another part of the g uidelines.united states volpe,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,when the challenged part of the guidelines aim s at different harms emanating from the same conduct,there is no impermissible double counting.id.e nhancements are not duplicative when they reflect different facets of the defendant conduct united states sabhnani,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,there was no impermissible.the district court set watkins base offense level at because of his violation of a,which prohibits the knowing transportation of an individual who has not attained the age of years in interstate or foreign commerce,or in any commonwealth,territory or possession of the united states,with intent that the individual engage in prostitution,or in any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense.a emphasis supplied.one may commit this offense without actually having committed a sex act.therefore,given that watkins transported a minor in violation of a,and the overwhelming and undisputed evidence demonstrates that he committed a sex act with doe,a minor,the district court application of the b a enhancement is not error,let alone clear error.the enhancement punishes watkins for committing a sex act,which would not otherwise be reflected at a base offense level of.accordingly,we reject watkins challenge to the district court application of the b a enhancement.
enhancement for use of a computer to entice a minor 
watkins also challenges the district court application of.b a,which provides for a enhancement if 
the offense involved the use of a computer or an interactive computer service to persuade,induce,entice,coerce,or facilitate the travel of,the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct 
here,an addendum to the psr,as expressly adopted by the district court,concluded that watkins utilized a computer to communicate with the minor victim in order to arrange to meet her and to persuade,entice,and coerce her to engage in sexual activities with him.the psr supported this conclusion by detailing the electronic messages that watkins sent to doe on october,the day before watkins traveled to doe home.in those messages,watkins asked doe to keep her phone on so that when he arrived at her house she could jump out the window and he could teach her the differences between fucking and making love.based on this electronic communication and the psr describes a number of other similar communications the district court did not commit clear error in finding that watkins used a computer to persuade doe to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.
we further reject watkins argument that the enhancement was applied in error because watkins did not use a computer to facilitate the travel of doe.appellant br.emphasis supplied.watkins contends that the term the travel of in b a is the object of the verbs persuade,induce,entice,coerce,or facilitate.however,the plain language of the sentence indicates that the phrase facilitate the travel of is meant to be read separately from the terms persuade,induce,entice,and coerce,as each term is set off by a comma.the comma after of makes clear that the travel of is not the object of all of the preceding verbs.further,it is linguistically awkward at best to refer to the use of a computer to persuade the travel of a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.a person does not persuade travel.rather,the enhancement applies where,as here,a defendant uses a computer to persuade,induce,entice,and coerce,a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.accordingly,we reject watkins challenge to the district court application of the b a enhancement.
enhancement for misrepresentation of identity 
watkins also challenges the district court imposition of a enhancement pursuant to b,which provides 
if a the offense involved the knowing misrepresentation of a participant identity to persuade,induce,entice,coerce,or facilitate the travel of,a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct or b a participant otherwise unduly influenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct,increase by levels.
section b sets forth a disjunctive test.therefore,application of the enhancement is proper if the district court did not commit clear error in finding that watkins conduct satisfied either subsection b a or b b.
subsection b a 
the psr determined that watkins likely misrepresented his age to doe in order to persuade her into having sexual relations with him,presumably in belief that if the age difference were not as great,she would be more likely to engage in such conduct.the record amply supports the district court adoption of this finding,and its application of the b enhancement was not error.
first,there is no dispute that watkins knowingly misrepresented his age to doe.early on in their communications,watkins told doe that he was years old when he was in fact.contrary to watkins assertion,this constitutes a knowing misrepresentation of a participant identity.see,application note a the misrepresentation to which the enhancement in subsection b a may apply includes misrepresentation of a participant name,age,occupation,gender,or status.see also united states walker,cir c ommentary in the guidelines manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the constitution or a federal statute,or is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that guideline.quoting stinson united states.
second,the evidence in the record supports a finding that watkins primary if not only objective in communicating with doe was to engage in prohibited sexual conduct with her.from the beginning of his interactions with doe,watkins made it clear that the purpose of his communications was sexual in nature.when doe asked watkins if he wanted her to get him all horny and shit,watkins said thanks,finally,of course i do want you to that the point remember i only live in new york so if you ever get brave enough he also told doe that when they met he would teach her the differences between fucking and making love.
finally,on october,the day before watkins had vaginal intercourse with doe for the first time,watkins sent doe the following electronic message i would be in your panties by now if i were with you i ca let you go so stay be my girl,adding it only a twenty years age difference,it common for couples.emphasis supplied.this communication which followed months of graphic sexual discussions provides direct support for the court finding that watkins misrepresented his identity,his age in order to persuade,induce,entice,or coerce doe to engage in prohibited sexual conduct,see b a.moreover,because the district court expressly adopted the psr,it was not required explicitly to spell out any further analysis.see united states ahders,cir the district court is required to rule on controverted matters that will affect sentencing,but it may do so by adopting the recommendations of the psr.
finally,given the clear sexual context within which watkins misrepresented his identity,we do not believe that the psr finding and the district court adoption thereof that watkins made such a misrepresentation to persuade doe into having sexual relations with him is speculative,or that we are unable to have a meaningful opportunity for appellate review.indeed,watkins concedes that misrepresentation of his age was part of his initial seduction of doe.def.br.accordingly,application of the b enhancement under subsection b a was not error 
subsection b b 
because we conclude that the district court did not err in applying the b enhancement pursuant to subsection b a,it is not necessary to ascertain whether the enhancement was in error under subsection b b.nonetheless,subsection b b,which provides for a enhancement where a defendant unduly influence s a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct,provides an independent basis for application of the enhancement.
application note b of b provides that i n determining whether subsection b b applies,the court should closely consider the facts of the case to determine whether a participant influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor behavior,provided that 
i n a case in which a participant is at least years older than the minor,there shall be a rebuttable presumption that subsection b b applies.in such a case,some degree of undue influence can be presumed because of the substantial difference in age between the participant and the minor.
b,application note b.
watkins acknowledges that there is a presumption of undue influence in this case.however,he claims that the presumption was rebutted by evidence of doe eagerness as a participant in watkins offense and that such evidence demonstrated that watkins failed to compromise the voluntariness of doe.he further contends that the district court erred in adopting,without further explanation,the psr conclusion that the b enhancement was applicable under the guidelines.we disagree.
watkins is years older than doe.therefore,the psr correctly concluded that there is a rebuttable presumption that watkins unduly influenced doe to engage in prohibited sexual conduct on the basis of their substantial age difference further,it is clear that watkins failed to offer any evidence rebutting the presumption on this basis and concedes that he misrepresent ed his age as part of his initial seduction of jane doe.def.br.therefore,the district court was free to make its finding of undue influence,without further explanation,on the basis of the unrebutted presumption alone 
watkins assertion that doe actively was pursuing a relationship with him does not require a different conclusion,an argument considered and rejected by the psr,and supported by a number of our sister circuits.see,united states lay,cir determining that the presumption of undue influence on the basis of substantial age difference was not overcome by,inter alia,evidence suggesting that the minor initiated communications and proposed meeting with the defendant united states miller,cir upholding undue influence enhancement on the basis of a substantial age disparity because the presumption was not rebutted by,inter alia,evidence that the minor had multiple prior sexual experiences and had taken the initiative in her relationship with the defendant.accordingly,given the substantial age difference between watkins and doe,the district court did not err in finding that the rebuttable presumption was not overcome by alleged evidence of doe eagerness to participate in watkins offense.
furthermore,and in addition to the degree of undue influence that can be presumed given the substantial age disparity between watkins and doe,see b,application note b,the evidence of record supports a finding of undue influence,given watkins numerous instances of manipulative behavior.see lay,at t he extent to which a defendant engaged in manipulative behavior bear s on the question of whether the defendant has rebutted the presumption that he unduly influenced the minor.here,watkins picked doe up at her home gave her gifts,including four necklaces and two rings took her to get free meals and clothing told doe that her boyfriend was not treating her well because he did not have sexual intercourse with her but only engaged in touching,which was kids stuff misrepresented himself as a former drug addict and as having only two children when,in fact,he smoked marijuana all day long,every day and had five children and,of course,misrepresented his age as part of his initial seduction of doe.united states wise,app x,cir summary order determining that the facts supported a finding of undue influence given that defendant provided the minor victim with clothes,meals,gifts,and picked her up at her home.
we also reject watkins assertion that the district court erred in adopting the psr conclusion that the b enhancement was applicable without further comment as to the factual findings included therein.a district court that adopts the factual findings of a defendant psr is not required explicitly to provide any further analysis.see ahders,at the district court is required to rule on controverted matters that will affect sentencing,but it may do so by adopting the recommendations of the psr.accordingly,we reject watkins challenge to the district court application of the b enhancement under subsection b b.
iii.substantive reasonableness of watkins sentence 
finally,watkins argues that his sentence of months imprisonment is substantively unreasonable.he argues that he should have been given a less harsh sentence within the g uidelines range because,among other reasons,he accepted full responsibility for his actions and attempted to undo the harm that he caused by openly and immediately confessing to the crime and by cooperating with authorities in securing his own conviction.appellant br.however,watkins sentence already includes a reduction for cooperation,pursuant to,and the record reveals that he may have exacerbated the damage he had done by sending antagonistic letters to doe and her family members after his arrest.
watkins also contends that his sentence is unreasonably excessive because it was not reduced in light of the fact that no violence or force was used against doe during the commission of the offense.def.br.however,this fact does not require a reduction and is already reflected in watkins sentence.had watkins used force against doe,his would have been higher.see c,under which watkins offense level would have been at least,taking into account watkins reduction for cooperation,regardless of the statute of conviction.
finally,watkins claims that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because he had no intention of harming doe and because doe was an active,willing and voluntary.however,as the district court found,watkins fail s to grasp the gravity of his conduct and the future effect it may well have on the victim.this finding is entitled to deference.it should also be added that the district court did not commit clear error by basing watkins sentence at least in part on his lengthy criminal history state crime convictions and what appeared to be a high risk of recidivism.
nothing in the record indicates that watkins sentence,which is at the top of the applicable guidelines range,is outside the range of permissible decisions.cavera,at internal quotation mark omitted.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a sentence of months imprisonment.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the judgement of sentence entered in the district court.
i respectfully dissent from the court decision to affirm the district court imposition of a sentence enhancement under section b of the united states sentencing guidelines manual or guidelines.the district court applied this enhancement to watkins sentence without finding that his conduct qualified for the enhancement.this case should thus be remanded to the district court so that the court has an opportunity either to make the necessary findings that justify imposing the enhancement or else to resentence watkins without it.
subsection b a 
a district court may apply the sentencing enhancement under section b if either one of two conditions is satisfied.the first condition,described in subsection b a,permits a district court to impose the enhancement if the offense involved the knowing misrepresentation of a participant identity to persuade,induce,entice,coerce,or facilitate the travel of,a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.b a.
a district court can not,however,simply conclude that the enhancement should apply without finding that the defendant conduct qualifies for the enhancement.see united states ahders,cir per curiam a district court must make specific factual findings,by a preponderance of the evidence,to support any sentencing enhancement under the guidelines.internal quotation marks omitted.with that said,a district court need not specifically recite all the facts relevant to its guidelines calculation rather,it is sufficient for the district court to adopt the findings in the presentence report if those findings are adequate to support the sentence imposed.id.
there is no dispute that watkins knowingly misrepresented his identity to jane doe by lying about his age.see,cmt.a.but such a misrepresentation,standing alone,does not provide a basis to apply the enhancement.subsection b a requires a knowing misrepresentation of a participant identity to persuade,induce,entice,coerce,or facilitate the travel of,a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.b a emphasis added.as the commentary accompanying the guidelines makes clear,the misrepresentation must be made with the intent to persuade,induce,entice,coerce,or facilitate the travel of,a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct,cmt.a emphasis added see also id.u se of a computer screen name,without such intent,would not be a sufficient basis for application of the enhancement.emphasis added.
the district court adopted the findings contained in the presentence report,an addendum to which stated 
the probation officer notes it is likely the defendant misrepresented himself as ten years younger than his actual age in order to persuade the minor victim into having sexual relations with him,presumably in belief that if the age difference were not as great,she would be more likely to agree to engage in such conduct.
app.emphasis added.but i do not believe that a district court finding that a defendant conduct likely,qualified for an enhancement is sufficient to support imposition of the enhancement.in order for subsection b a to apply,a district court must conclude that the offense involved the knowing misrepresentation of a participant identity to persuade,induce,entice,coerce,or facilitate the travel of,a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.b a.while watkins may have likely engaged in conduct that would justify the imposition of the enhancement under subsection b a,app,the district court never determined whether he did in fact misrepresent him
