marvin pereira appeals from a judgment entered on october,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york feuerstein,following a guilty plea.pereira,a citizen of el salvador,pled guilty to illegally reentering the united states after having been deported following his conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment and three years supervised release.pereira raises a host of challenges to his sentence.most significantly,he argues that the district court,when calculating the applicable sentence range under united states sentencing guideline,improperly increased his offense level on the basis of a conviction,for which he was adjudicated a youthful offender under new york state law.because we hold that the district court correctly determined that the conviction mandated a enhancement to the base offense level,and because we reject the remainder of the defendant challenges to his sentence,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
a.the guilty plea and prior offenses 
pereira,who first entered the united states on june,pled guilty to unlawful reentry following deportation after a conviction for the commission of an aggravated felony in violation of a and b.pereira predicate felony occurred on september,when he and two accomplices robbed an individual at gunpoint.when apprehended,the defendant,then sixteen years old,was found in possession of a stolen automobile.on january,he was convicted by an adult court of two counts of robbery in the first degree and one count of criminal possession of stolen property in the fourth degree.he was sentenced on each count to a term of years incarceration,to run concurrently.pursuant to new york law,he was adjudicated a youthful offender with respect to these convictions pereira served his sentence in an adult facility in upstate new york.following his release from prison and his commission of various parole violations,he was deported to el salvador on june.
on november,pereira was arrested in huntington station,new york for loitering and possession of a fraudulent social security card.he pled guilty to forgery in the third degree,a misdemeanor,and was sentenced to fifteen days in custody.after his arrest,immigration and custody enforcement ice agents interviewed pereira,who admitted to having been deported to el salvador in.upon investigation,the ice officials determined that pereira had not applied for,or been otherwise granted,permission from the attorney general to reenter the united states.a grand jury subsequently indicted pereira on two counts unlawful reentry following conviction for an aggravated felony,and possession of a forged document.he pled guilty to the first count on june.
b.the sentencing 
i.the presentence investigative report 
the united state probation office probation office prepared a presentence investigative report psr for pereira.it found that his base offense level was.on account of his robbery conviction,the psr recommended that the offense level should be increased by levels.the report acknowledged that pereira was adjudicated as a youthful offender for this offense but pointed out that pursuant to application note a iv of the commentary to guideline,and per the guidance found in united states cuello,cir,a new york state youthful offender adjudication may be considered an adult felony conviction for the purposes of calculating a defendant base offense level.it further noted that a ccording to state penal law,youthful offenders are treated as adults in many respects,despite the terminology,and those convicted of a felony are committed,as are adult felons,to the custody of new york department of correctional services.the psr then deducted points for acceptance of responsibility,for a total offense level of.the report determined that pereira offenses,including the robbery conviction,resulted in a total of criminal history points,and a criminal history category of ii.based on the total offense level of and this criminal history category,the report found the relevant guidelines range to be to months.the appellant objected to the report calculations in a letter he submitted to the sentencing judge.the government and the probation office both defended the calculations in responses to the appellant letter.
ii.the sentencing proceeding 
on october,judge feuerstein conducted the sentencing proceeding challenged here.pereira attorney brought up the issue of whether the youthful offender adjudication that occurred early on in his life should be counted.judge feuerstein stated that she believed the government interpretation of the case cited,apparently referring to cuello,was correct,and i would be inclined,particularly in light of the crime involved here,to view it as an adult conviction.the district judge proceeded to sentence pereira to months imprisonment,as well as three years supervised release with the special condition that he participate in treatment.subsequent to the judge imposition of the sentence,the following exchange occurred between the district court and the assistant attorney 
government now that the court has imposed the sentence,it obvious from the court sentence,the court understands that the sentencing guidelines which are to months are advisory.
the court of course.
government and,all the factors set forth.
the court i have.
government your honor,on appeal,and i expect there will be an appeal in this case because there was no waiver,the issue may be framed such that if the second circuit were to conclude that the point enhancement based upon the youthful offender conviction was somehow erroneous,the question will be whether or not that somehow appreciably affected the court sentence.so i would ask would the court be willing to state would you have imposed the sentence 
the court i would have.because the guidelines are only advisory,and i based my determination on prior conduct,including convictions,and the present course of conduct,and the person background and likelihood of rehabilitation,and their expression of remorse.
discussion 
we review both guidelines and sentences for reasonableness.united states fernandez,cir.a sentence may be deemed unreasonable for a variety of reasons.most obviously,if the terms of the sentence do not necessarily reflect the objectives of sentencing upon consideration of all the facts,the sentence may be set aside as unreasonable.see,united states rattoballi,cir.in addition,a sentence may but need not necessarily be vacated as unreasonable because some steps taken by the sentencing court in determining or imposing the sentence did not comport with the requirements of law,either substantive or procedural.for example,the court is required before passing sentence to consider how the prescriptions of the guidelines would treat the case.see united states crosby,cir.if the court fails to follow that required procedure,the sentence may be found unreasonable.see,united states fuller,cir.a finding of unreasonableness can result also from substantive errors made in the course of consideration of the guidelines standards.for example,in united states rubenstein,cir,we vacated a sentence for unreasonableness because,in considering what sentence the guidelines would have prescribed,the court erroneously concluded that a enhancement for permitless transportation of a hazardous or toxic substance applied,and that erroneous conclusion might have affected the court ultimate determination of the sentence 
pereira challenges only the reasonableness of his sentence.he contends that the district court erred in its identification of the correct guidelines range,in its consideration of the other a sentencing factors and in the adequacy of the explanation it gave for its sentence 
with respect to its determination of the applicable guidelines range,pereira argues that the district court improperly increased his offense level on the basis of the robbery conviction,for which he was adjudicated as a youthful offender,and double counted the robbery conviction.as to the district court consideration of the other a factors,pereira asserts that it failed to account for disparity between his sentence and those received by defendants convicted of unlawful reentry in jurisdictions with programs,and to consider fully all the a factors in determining his sentence.pereira further argues that the district court explanation of its decision to impose a sentence outside the guidelines range was insufficient to satisfy the requirements of c.
pereira raised only one of these one relating to the treatment of his youthful offender adjudication when calculating his offense the district court.it is unresolved in our court whether we review sentencing challenges that are made for the first time on appeal under the traditional,stringent plain error standard or under a less rigorous one.see united states lewis,cir noting the standard of review for unpreserved sentencing errors is unresolved see also united states khedr,cir.although we generally apply traditional plain error review when an appellant fails to raise an objection below,we have also held that when that situation occurs in the sentencing context there are circumstances that permit us to relax the otherwise rigorous standards of plain error review to correct sentencing errors.united states sofsky,cir.we need not decide here,however,what is the precise standard of review for the sentencing objections that pereira did not raise before the district court,for his claims fail under any relevant standard.
a.the district court correctly calculated the applicable guidelines range 
pereira argues that the district court miscalculated the applicable guidelines range in two respects,by finding that the enhancement for a prior aggravated felony applied based on pereira youthful offender adjudication and by double counting this prior offense.we conclude that the district court committed no such error.
the guideline governing sentencing of those convicted of unlawful reentry,the unlawful reentry guideline,requires a district court to increase a defendant base offense level by levels when he was convicted of unlawful reentry after being previously deported following a prior felony conviction that was a crime of violence.b a ii.the unlawful reentry guideline provides that a felony committed before the defendant was eighteen years old can not be the basis for this enhancement unless such conviction is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted,comment.the appellant argues that his robbery conviction is not classified as an adult conviction under the laws of new york because it resulted in a youthful offender adjudication.
the question whether a youthful offender adjudications is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of new york for the purposes of calculating a defendant offense level under the unlawful reentry guideline is open in this circuit but,although we have not addressed the issue with respect to the unlawful reentry guideline,we have examined it in the context of other guidelines that have identical rules governing when a prior felony conviction for an offense committed before the defendant was eighteen years old can be the basis for calculating the defendant sentence.see united states jones,cir considering,the career offender guideline united states cuello,cir considering,the unlawful receipt,possession,or transportation of firearms or ammunition guideline.
like the unlawful reentry guideline,the guidelines at issue in jones and cuello permit the sentencing court to take account of a prior felony committed before the defendant was eighteen years old only when the conviction is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted.see jones,at quoting comment.cuello,at quoting comment.in jones and cuello,we held that in determining whether a defendant youthful offender adjudications are classified as adult convictions under the laws of new york,the district court must look to the substance of the prior convictions and not merely how they are labeled by the state.jones,at cuello,at.on that basis,we concluded in both cases that the district court did not err in considering the respective defendant youthful offender adjudications as adult convictions.jones,at cuello,at.
we are persuaded that the analysis of youthful offender adjudications that we applied with respect to the guidelines at issue in cuello and jones pertains equally to the unlawful reentry guideline.the guidelines applied in cuello and jones contain the identical restriction,which is phrased in the exact same language,as the unlawful reentry guideline.and there is no basis for reading the language differently here.upon consideration of all the circumstances,with particular focus on the fact that the defendant was convicted in an adult court and served his sentence in an adult facility,we find that the district court treatment of his youthful offender adjudication as an adult conviction for purposes of calculating the offense level under the unlawful reentry guideline was a proper exercise of the court discretion.
the appellant also alleges that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court improperly double counted his robbery conviction in determining the applicable guidelines range for his offense.it is in this circuit that a district court does not err when it uses a prior offense to calculate both the offense level and the criminal history category to determine the correct guidelines range in unlawful reentry cases.see united states,cir rejecting a double counting challenge raised by a defendant who pled guilty to one count of illegal reentry by an alien deported as an aggravated felon united states campbell,cir same.as we explained in campbell,the offense level and criminal history category measure different things.the offense level represents a judgment as to the wrongfulness of the particular act.the criminal history category principally estimates the likelihood of recidivism.at internal citations omitted see also united states aska,cir i t is within the sentencing commission and congress prerogative to adopt double counting if it chooses.citing,at campbell,at.our decisions in these cases clearly control the resolution of pereira double counting claim.
b.the district court properly considered the a sentencing factors 
in addition to his objections to the calculation of the applicable guidelines range,pereira contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not adequately consider the other a sentencing factors.pereira argues that the district court failed to apply one factor in need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.he also asserts that the district court did not demonstrate that it had adequately considered the a factors as a whole.we address each argument in turn.
section a provides that one factor a sentencing court must consider is the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.pereira asserts that the district court did not consider the disparity between his sentence and those received by defendants convicted of unlawful reentry in jurisdictions with programs we recently held that a district court refusal to adjust a sentence to compensate for the absence of a program does not make a sentence unreasonable.united states mejia,cir.accordingly,the fact that the district court did not address disparity arising from arguendo that the silence in the record means that the district court did not consider it,and that the failure to do so was not render pereira sentence unreasonable.
pereira also contends that the record does not demonstrate that the district judge adequately considered all the a factors before imposing the sentence.we disagree.
in crosby,we held that,a district court must consider the factors listed in a in order for the sentence it imposes to be reasonable.at.we have,however,steadfastly refused to require judges to explain or enumerate how such consideration was conducted.see id.at w e will not prescribe any formulation a sentencing judge will be obliged to
