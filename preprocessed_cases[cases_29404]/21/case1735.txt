background 
norman stultz,a native and resident of jamaica,originally entered the united states on june,as a lawful permanent resident.on november,defendant was convicted in norwalk,connecticut superior court on six counts of selling marijuana,a felony,in violation of.b.he was sentenced on each count to five years after the sentences to run concurrently.in january the immigration and naturalization service ins instituted deportation proceedings against stultz on the grounds that his drug conviction made him subject to removal pursuant to a of the immigration and nationality act,a b.appellee failed to appear for his hearing and was ordered deported.he did not appeal the deportation order to the board of immigration appeals,and on november,he was removed to jamaica.
on april,the ins received a report that defendant was being held on state criminal charges at the bridgeport correctional center in bridgeport,connecticut.using fingerprint analysis,the federal bureau of investigation confirmed stultz identity,and the ins confirmed that he had neither sought nor received permission to reenter the united states.defendant was indicted on september,for reentering the united states after being deported without the attorney general having expressly consented to his reapplication for admission.
on july,stultz entered a guilty plea to one count of illegal reentry by a removed alien in violation of that provides criminal penalties for any alien who has been denied admission,excluded,deported,or removed and thereafter enters,attempts to enter,or is at any time found in,the united states.a.
in calculating defendant sentence,the district court began with the base offense level of.see a.it then applied a sentence enhancement under b a i,which mandates a increase i f the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for a felony that is a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded months.b a i.three levels were subtracted for acceptance of responsibility,see,resulting in a total offense level of.factoring in a criminal history category of iv with the total offense level,the guidelines provide a range of months of imprisonment.see id.ch,pt.a sentencing table.
the district court departed downwardly by five levels,a decision which is at the crux of this appeal.in so doing,the sentencing court commented that it had great reservations about applying a enhancement for a year old conviction for marijuana,especially as the enhancement would increase the sentence by a period greater than stultz entire sentence for the earlier marijuana conviction.it therefore ruled that the length of time between the prior conviction and the instant conviction,coupled with the nature of the prior offense marijuana were issues the sentencing commission did not fully consider when it created the enhancement.the district court accordingly reduced the offense level from to,thereby reducing the sentencing range to months.the court then sentenced stultz to months in sentence at the lower end of the guidelines range.from this sentence the government appeals.
discussion 
ia.standard of review 
we note at the outset that the standard of review for sentencing departures has been changed.previously,we reviewed a district court decision to depart from the sentencing guidelines for an abuse of discretion,in accordance with the analytical framework set out by the supreme court in koon united states,d.see,united states payton,cir.recently,however,congress passed the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act of protect act,stat,which,in amending the standard of review,requires us to review departures from the guidelines de novo.e.
the new law went into effect after stultz sentence was imposed,but while it was pending on appeal.we need not decide whether it applies retroactively for the purposes of this appeal,for whether the factor relied upon by the sentencing court is a permissible ground for departure has always been reviewed de novo.united states middleton,cir per curiam citing united states williams,cir.although discussion of the protect act is left for another day,we can not help noting that district courts enjoy,under the supreme court guidance,a distinct institutional advantage over appellate courts in determining sentences.this follows because of the vastly greater number of sentencing cases they are required to rule upon,only a small percentage of which are ever appealed.to move the various appellate courts from their traditional function of reviewing to the front lines of determining sentences de novo,will certainly at the least undermine the sentencing commission laudable goal of eliminating unjustified disparities in sentencing 
enhancement for prior drug trafficking offense 
prior to a defendant charged with illegal reentry after deportation was subject to the enhancement for any previous aggravated felony.b a.the term aggravated felony the definition at a,which provided a broad definition encompassing many crimes,application note.the commentary accompanying the amendments recognized the disproportionate penalties that resulted from applying a uniform enhancement for such a term.the disjunction,the sentencing commission noted,resulted in situations where a defendant who previously was convicted of murder,for example,receive d the same enhancement as a defendant previously convicted of simple assault.c,amend.reason for amendment supp.
the amendments replaced this uniform enhancement with a graduated system that applies different enhancements depending on the severity of the prior crime.the current guidelines provide the following five tiers of enhancements 
apply the greatest 
if the defendant previously was deported,or unlawfully remained in the united states,after 
a a conviction for a felony that is i a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded months ii a crime of violence iii a firearms offense iv a child pornography offense v a national security or terrorism offense vi a human trafficking offense or vii an alien smuggling offense committed for profit,increase by levels 
b a conviction for a felony drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed was months or less,increase by levels 
c a conviction for an aggravated felony,increase by levels 
d a conviction for any other felony,increase by levels or 
e three or more convictions for misdemeanors that are crimes of violence or drug trafficking offenses,increase by levels.
the district court correctly ruled that stultz prior conviction for dealing marijuana triggered the enhancement.the enhancement properly applies to stultz because his prior crime was a felony,a drug trafficking offense,and an offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded months.
first,connecticut laws plainly make stultz marijuana offense a felony for purposes of enhancement.felony is defined in the guidelines application notes as any federal,state,or local offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,application note b iv.the connecticut statute under which stultz was convicted provides 
any person who manufactures,distributes,sells,prescribes,dispenses,compounds,transports with intent to sell or dispense,possesses with i
