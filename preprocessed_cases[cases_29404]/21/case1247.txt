petitioner pedro gonzalez,who was convicted in,on his plea of guilty,of narcotics and bribery crimes and sentenced principally to months of imprisonment,appeals from an order of the united states district court for the northern district of new york,thomas mcavoy,judge,denying his motion pursuant to to vacate his conviction and sentence on the ground that his attorney provided ineffective assistance in connection with both the plea of guilty and sentencing.the district court denied the motion,ruling that gonzalez failed to show that his attorney deficient performance caused him prejudice.on appeal,gonzalez contends that the district court erred in its ruling and abused its discretion in determining the issues without ordering discovery or conducting an evidentiary hearing.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the order denying the motion we remand for the district court to vacate the sentence and to resentence gonzalez,with gonzalez represented by competent counsel.
background 
this appeal comes to us after a tortuous path encompassing gonzalez indictment in his plea of guilty and attempts to withdraw that plea in the ensuing judgment of conviction which following a first motion that was ultimately successful after gonzalez attorney had been disbarred was vacated and reentered in this court affirmance of the conviction and the reimposed sentence,accompanied by our grant of permission to file a second the present motion asserting ineffective assistance of counsel in connection with the plea of guilty and sentencing the filing of the present motion in the district court denial of that motion in and this court grant in of a certificate of appealability permitting gonzalez to appeal that denial.the record shows the following.
a.the proceedings in 
following an undercover operation in,conducted jointly by federal and new york state law enforcement agencies concerned with narcotics trafficking and immigration matters,gonzalez was one of some three dozen individuals indicted in.he was named in counts charging him with,inter alia,distributing and possessing with intent to distribute various quantities of cocaine and heroin,conspiring to traffic in more than one kilogram of heroin and more than five kilograms of cocaine,and conspiring to use drugs and cash to bribe a supposedly corrupt immigration and naturalization service ins official to provide certain aliens with documents evidencing permanent resident alien status also known as green cards.gonzalez was arraigned in july and pleaded not guilty.his retained attorney was carlos perez olivo perez olivo.
following his arraignment,gonzalez attended proffer sessions with government prosecutors and law enforcement agents.the prosecutors sought information about the involvement of codefendant gabriel ceballos,who was accused of being one of gonzalez drug suppliers,see generally united states ceballos,cir see id.at,reversing ceballos bribery conspiracy conviction and noting that ceballos had not challenged his narcotics conspiracy conviction.gonzalez hoped to reach a plea agreement to limit his offenses of conviction and to have the government move pursuant to of the sentencing guidelines or guidelines,which were then considered mandatory,for a reduced sentence for his offenses.
both sides aspirations were largely unfulfilled.the government found gonzalez statements in the proffer sessions to be unhelpful,and it ultimately did not agree to make a motion.the parties entered into a plea agreement dated january,plea agreement or agreement,in which gonzalez agreed to plead guilty to eight counts of the indictment counts i through viii to wit,both of the above conspiracy counts,one count of cocaine distribution,and five counts of heroin distribution.see plea agreement at.the agreement provided that the government would dismiss the other counts against gonzalez see id.at,but that if his plea were withdrawn,the government could reinstate and pursue any of those counts as to which the statute of limitations had not run as of the date of the agreement see id.at.
in the agreement,gonzalez admitted,inter alia,that he had knowingly and intentionally possessed with intent to distribute approximately grams of cocaine and approximately grams of heroin.see id.at.the agreement stated that his plea of guilty would expose him to various penalties,including a maximum of life imprisonment for the narcotics conspiracy and a maximum of years imprisonment for four of the substantive narcotics offenses.see id.at.gonzalez agreed,inter alia,not to appeal a sentence of imprisonment of months or less.see id.at.
on january,the day the plea agreement was signed,gonzalez changed his plea on counts i through viii of the indictment from not guilty to guilty see plea hearing transcript,january,plea tr.in response to questioning by the district court,gonzalez stated under oath that he was pleading guilty voluntarily,that no one had made any promises to him as to lenient treatment other than as indicated in the plea agreement,and that he had received no threats of a use of force to induce him to plead guilty.id.at.he also stated that he had spoken with perez olivo about his chances of winning or losing if he went to trial,trial strategy and defenses id.at,and that he was satisfied with what perez olivo ha d done for him so far id.at.gonzalez asked whether he could address the court to explain his situation perez olivo said he had advised gonzalez that gonzalez could instead speak at sentencing the court endorsed that and stated that it would be happy at the plea hearing to answer any of gonzalez questions.see id.at.
the assistant united states attorney ausa then recounted at length see id.at the government evidence that gonzalez had,inter alia,made deliveries of cocaine or heroin on specific dates,and that gonzalez trafficked in over four kilograms of cocaine,negotiated to produce over ten kilograms of cocaine,and produced over two kilograms of heroin throughout the course of this conspiracy,which lasted from approximately june of to june of id.at.when the court asked gonzalez,is that what you,in fact,did gonzalez answered,yes,your honor.id.at.
although the plea agreement had not included an estimate of the guidelines recommended range of imprisonment for the offenses to which gonzalez was pleading guilty,the ausa estimated at the plea hearing that if there were no applicable adjustments,such as for acceptance of responsibility,the prescribed range of imprisonment would be to months see id.at.
gonzalez attempt to withdraw his plea of guilty 
in may,the probation department sent its proposed presentence report psr to the government and perez olivo.sometime thereafter,but before the then scheduled october sentencing date,gonzalez wrote to the probation officer to request a copy of the psr,stating that neither he nor his wife had been able to reach perez olivo since january gonzalez stated that perez olivo was never at his office when gonzalez wife attempted to see him and that perez olivo never returned her telephone calls.gonzalez also asked the probation officer to forward to the court an enclosed letter.
gonzalez letter to the court stated that although gonzalez bore some responsibility for his actions,he had been drawn into the immigration scheme believing it was lawful and that after he had begun participating he was blackmailed and coerced to continue.see undated letter from pedro gonzalez to your honor gonzalez letter to the court at.the letter stated in part as follows 
i am not saying that i not guilty,i do have my responsibility in this case.everything started when one of my workers brought a friend to the construction site.i am a general contractor,i have my own crew of employees.a man by the name of jose manuel called my house a few weeks later and told me that he had something that can help my workers.upon meeting with him he told me he had an immigration sic lawyer that can provide permanent resident status in the.manuel assured me that everything was legal and the fee that would be charged was for his honorariums and the speedy process of the paperwork.since some of my workers need the green cards to be legal residents in this country,i agreed to help them.if i thought anything was illegal or would jeopardize anyone i would never had sic agreed to any of it.after a few people,including my,supplied their passports and paid two thirds of the fee,manuel brought us to a restaurant sic in albany.we were introduced to three people that he claimed worked for the immigration sic lawyer.from that moment on i was pushed around,set up,blackmailed,extorted,threatened and used.in all reality,they forced me to do what they wanted me to do.i was afraid for the lives of my children,my wife and all the people applying for the green cards some of who sic were also threatened.
at gonzalez sentencing hearing,perez olivo told the court that,some days earlier,gonzalez had informed him that gonzalez wishe d to withdraw his plea of guilty because it was not voluntary in the sense that he was threatened by the agents.sentencing transcript,november.
perez olivo stated that gonzalez said that,yes,he committed certain acts,but it was under duress id.at that he does feel that he guilty,that he feels that he was coerced and threatened id.at a nd that the only reason he waited until now to inform me or anybody else is because he was concerned for himself and his family.he has discussed it with his family after the presentence report came back with the recommendations and the fact that there would be no letter forth coming id.gonzalez clarified that he was asserting that during the events leading to his arrest he had been coerced by someone who he said turned out to be a government informant to make payments to men he later learned were undercover law enforcement agents 
the defendant the informant called me and told me if i did not get the drugs for him,they were going to kill me,and he spoke about the the ones who were in charge of collecting money,of the company.after that,i realize,when they brought me to court,that these gentlemen are agents,because i saw them here.
id.at see also id.at the threats that they have for my life were before i was arrested.
gonzalez stated that after he was arrested but before he pled guilty,one of the undercover agents,called danilo,told him at an interview session when perez olivo was not present that if gonzalez did not cooperate properly,they were going to condemn gonzalez to years id.at.the ausa informed the court that gonzalez had been debriefed by the government both prior to and after his plea of guilty see id.at but that the ausa was not aware of any threats at those sessions see id.at.the court quizzed gonzalez as to the threat he alleged was made by the agent 
the court so,you say danilo told you if you did plead guilty,you were gon na get a higher sentence 
the defendant yes.
the court and that the threat that you basing your motion on 
the defendant that was the threat that he gave to me when i was arrested already,yes.so,i should plead guilty and i should not go to trial because they were going to hang me.and the threats that they have for my life were before i was arrested 
the court and when you appeared before me,i asked ya if anybody had made any threats or promises,and you told me no.were you lying to me then 
the defendant supposedly sic.i have never been in situation like this and this is something that put me completely nervous,and i always was under the threat of those people,and i only was thinking sic my children.
id.at see also id.at i was not really understanding anything that was happening here.
the district court denied gonzalez motion to withdraw his plea of guilty.the court noted that it had received gonzalez pro se letter forwarded by the probation officer where he refers to threats,being pushed around and blackmailed,but the court noted that that letter had not said anything about threats from an agent and that the allegations about danilo were belated and unsubstantiated see id.at.the court also stated that the fact that somebody may have said if you do plea,you gon na get a higher sentence was not a sufficient ground for the court to allow the plea to be withdrawn.id.
the psr on gonzalez stated that gonzalez had knowingly and intentionally distributed and possessed with intent to distribute approximately grams of cocaine and grams of heroin,and it detailed dates on which and places to which gonzalez had delivered specified quantities of those substances to undercover law enforcement agents.the psr also stated,inter alia,that gonzalez had transported illegal aliens to various locations for the purpose of obtaining illegal green cards from a supposedly corrupt ins official,who was in fact an undercover ins agent,and that gonzalez had delivered the narcotics as payment for the cards.the psr stated that gonzalez total guidelines offense level was and his criminal history category was iii,making the guidelines recommended range of imprisonment months.
gonzalez and the government stated that they had no objections to the factual contents of the psr,and the court adopted those contents.see.after a statement from perez olivo urging that the court order imprisonment at the low end of the guidelines range,and a lengthier statement by gonzalez reiterating that his conduct had been coerced and was not knowingly illegal,the court imposed,inter alia,a prison term of months.see id.at.
gonzalez first motion,in pursuit of an appeal 
in january,represented by new counsel,gonzalez filed his first motion in this matter he requested that his sentence be vacated on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel because perez olivo had failed to file an appeal as requested by gonzalez.in support of this motion,gonzalez submitted,inter alia,an affidavit stating principally that immediately after being sentenced on november,he had informed perez olivo that he wanted to appeal to challenge the denial of his motion to withdraw his plea of guilty that that was the last date on which he had had any contact with perez olivo that gonzalez wife and son who provided supporting affidavits had made numerous inquiries of perez olivo with regard to gonzalez appeal and had received assurances from perez olivo that the appeal was going well and that gonzalez eventually learned that in fact perez olivo had never filed an appeal.see affidavit of pedro gonzalez dated november,gonzalez aff.
the district court denied gonzalez motion on the ground that it was procedurally barred by gonzalez appeal waiver in the plea agreement.see decision and order dated june,june order or gonzalez i,at.gonzalez had agreed not to appeal his sentence if his prison term was less than months he was sentenced to months imprisonment and the court found that he had proffered no reason for the court not to enforce that appeal waiver,see id.at.
gonzalez sought to appeal the june order.this court granted a limited certificate of appealability and remanded for further consideration.on remand,the district court instructed gonzalez to make an additional submission with respect to his allegation that he had requested perez olivo to file an appeal it ordered the government to respond and to provide any factual rebutting affidavits.gonzalez provided a sworn declaration detailing his discussions with perez olivo,his request that perez olivo file an appeal,and perez olivo assurances that he had filed an appeal.see declaration of pedro gonzalez dated august,gonzalez decl.the government,in opposition,submitted,inter alia,a paragraph affidavit from perez olivo,stating at length that he had not been paid see affidavit of carlos perez olivo dated september,perez olivo aff,and,far more briefly,that gonzalez had told perez olivo that gonzalez did not wish to appeal see id.
in a decision and order dated february,gonzalez ii,the district court found perez olivo affidavit to be credible and thus adhered to its decision in gonzalez i denying gonzalez motion.
perez olivo disbarment and gonzalez resentencing 
this court granted gonzalez a certificate of appealability for review of gonzalez ii on the issue of whether the district court properly decided the factual question,whether gonzalez asked perez olivo to file a notice of appeal solely on the basis of affidavits.before that appeal could be heard,however,perez olivo was disbarred in the state of new york,see matter of perez olivo,dep t.
the new york court found that perez olivo had previously,inter alia,misrepresent ed to a vulnerable client that her appeal was frivolous and had induc ed her to withdraw her appeal which had already been dismissed due to perez olivo default,id.at,at emphasis added fail ed to file a brief with the second circuit and,thereafter,misrepresent ed to his client that her appeal was meritless,id.emphasis added converted bail money belonging to the defendant family to his own use,id.at,at and engaged in conduct adversely reflecting upon perez olivo fitness as a lawyer,id.at,at.the appellate division also noted that perez olivo had been admonished in for similar misconduct and that he had forfeited his license to practice law in puerto rico at a time when he was facing disciplinary charges based upon allegations similar to those raised here.id.
the parties in this court thereafter stipulated that gonzalez case should be remanded to the district court in light of the fact of and the foundations for disbarment.by order dated november,we so ordered the stipulation to allow the district court to conduct such further proceedings as it may deem appropriate in the circumstances.
on remand,the district court,upon further consideration and without additional proceedings,granted gonzalez motion,stating as follows 
in light of the allegations resulting in perez olivo disbarment which include,among other things,taking money from clients for work not performed and missing appellate deadlines and then convincing his clients not to appeal and the affidavits submitted by petitioner in connection with his motion,the court hereby grants petitioner motion.
accordingly,petitioner sentence is hereby vacated on the ground of counsel failure to file a notice of appeal as requested by petitioner ineffective assistance of counsel.petitioner is hereby resentenced to the same terms as his previous sentence,thereby providing petitioner with an opportunity to appeal his sentence.
decision and order dated february,gonzalez iii,at.
the affirmance of gonzalez convictions on direct appeal 
on his direct appeal,gonzalez principally argued that he should be allowed to withdraw his plea of guilty or at least that he was entitled to be resentenced because he had received ineffective assistance of counsel.he argued that perez olivo had,inter alia,failed to investigate the facts surrounding gonzalez involvement in the conspiracy and hence failed to assess fully the ability to defend the case failed to assist gonzalez in securing a motion failed to inform gonzalez properly of the impact of a plea of guilty and failed to assist gonzalez in moving for the withdrawal of his guilty plea.gonzalez argued that although he had told perez olivo before sentencing that he wanted to withdraw the plea of guilty,perez olivo did not meet with gonzalez to discuss that desire,did not move to delay the sentencing,did not file a motion to withdraw the plea,did not accurately or adequately explain to the court at the sentencing hearing the basis for gonzalez desire to withdraw his plea,and acted more as an ally of the government than as an advocate for gonzalez.
gonzalez also argued that perez olivo had failed to render any assistance with respect to sentencing perez olivo,inter alia,did not file a sentencing memorandum in response to the psr did not respond to the government sentencing memorandum and,although the psr had been circulated in may,did not meet with gonzalez to discuss the psr until the day of sentencing in november.perez olivo also did not argue to the court that there was a coercion basis for a downward departure from the recommended guidelines range of imprisonment,as envisioned by the provision that such a departure may be granted i f the defendant committed the offense because of serious coercion,blackmail or duress,under circumstances not amounting to a complete defense,guidelines.nor did perez olivo suggest a horizontal departure from gonzalez calculated criminal history category of iii,notwithstanding the facts that gonzalez only prior convictions were two for drunk driving,that he was an older man who had conducted a licensed business in the united states for more than a decade,and that until he was contacted by the government confidential informant in gonzalez had had no involvement with drugs.
in november,this court summarily affirmed gonzalez convictions.see united states gonzalez,fed.app x cir gonzalez iv.although we noted that a motion for withdrawal of a plea of guilty may be granted if withdrawal would be fair and just,id.at citing.d b and cases interpreting the rule,we observed that gonzalez did not move to withdraw the plea until months after its entry that his motion closely followed the revelation that the government would not be providing him with a letter that he did not offer any corroboration for his assertions that he had been coerced to engage in drug trafficking and immigration fraud or that his plea had been induced by the threats of federal agents and that his claims of coercion contradicted statements he made under oath at his plea hearing,gonzalez iv,fed.app x at.we concluded that,t o the extent that gonzalez plea withdrawal argument stands apart from his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying gonzalez motion to withdraw the plea on the basis of the record at the time the district court ruled.id.we declined to reach gonzalez claims of ineffective assistance of counsel iac because the record as to those claims was not sufficiently developed.see id.
gonzalez did not petition for certiorari,and his conviction became final in february.
b.the present motion 
in gonzalez iv,we stated that gonzalez iac claims would be more appropriately addressed,in the first instance,in a collateral proceeding under before the district court where the record could be augmented.see fed.app x at.because gonzalez had already been forced to file a motion in order to pursue the direct appeal from his conviction,we construed his iac claims as a motion to file a successive motion,see b a,asserting those claims.we stated that i n view of the existence of facts,not previously available,that might relate to the performance of counsel including those that might bear on counsel effectiveness at the time of gonzalez guilty plea,gonzalez would be allowed to file a second motion.gonzalez iv,fed.app x at.
gonzalez filed his second motion in the present motion or motion.the motion itself,signed by counsel and containing both factual assertions and legal arguments,asserted that perez olivo had provided ineffective assistance at both the and sentencing phases and that perez olivo professional and personal history revealed a pattern of deceitful conduct,malfeasance,and ineffective assistance.the motion also drew the court attention to the new fact that in,perez olivo was convicted of murdering his own wife and was currently serving a prison term of years to life.
in support of the motion,gonzalez submitted a paragraph sworn affirmation see affirmation of pedro gonzalez dated december,gonzalez aff,describing in detail the events leading to his arrest,beginning with his being contacted by one of the government confidential informants see,id,and describing perez olivo lack of attention to gonzalez case despite having been paid a retainer of some see,id.gonzalez stated that perez olivo had had him sign the plea agreement without allowing him to read it or even explaining to him what it was see id.and had instructed him to agree with everything that was being said at the plea hearing in order not to upset the judge or risk losing benefits the government had promised id.
after the plea hearing,gonzalez did not see perez olivo again until the day of sentencing,some months later.see id.perez olivo did not attend gonzalez debriefing sessions with the government see.he did not attend gonzalez interview with the probation department see gonzalez aff.and he did not communicate with gonzalez about the proposed psr see,id.on the day of sentencing,perez olivo met with gonzalez for just minutes,showed him the psr but did not have him read it,and never fully explained it to him.see,id.
the motion also pointed out perez olivo failures to engage in any advocacy with respect to gonzalez sentencing,including the facts that perez olivo took no issue with the psr,did not file a sentencing memorandum,did not respond to the government sentencing memorandum,and did not point out to the court even orally the feasible grounds for a vertical or horizontal departure from the guidelines recommended range of imprisonment.gonzalez requested that the court either vacate his conviction and sentence and hold a trial,or vacate his sentence and conduct a new sentencing proceeding.
in,in light of the supreme court then recent decision in padilla kentucky,gonzalez was allowed to add to his motion an ineffectiveness claim asserting that perez olivo had never advised him that pleading guilty would expose him to deportation the padilla claim.that claim has now been mooted by the supreme court decision in chaidez united states,holding that the ruling in padilla is not applicable on collateral review of a conviction that was final at the time of the padilla decision but,as discussed below,the padilla claim was one of the main foci of the district court decision on the motion.
in a decision and order dated august,august order or gonzalez v,the district court denied gonzalez motion.although largely agreeing that perez olivo performance with respect to gonzalez sentencing was deficient,outside the range of professionally competent assistance,the court ruled,with respect to both the plea of guilty and sentencing,that gonzalez did not demonstrate prejudice,that there was a reasonable probability that,but for perez olivo unprofessional performance the results of the proceedings would have been different,see,strickland washington.
as to the claim that perez olivo had provided ineffective assistance with respect to gonzalez decision whether or not to plead guilty,the district court in gonzalez v principally addressed gonzalez padilla claim.the court accept ed gonzalez allegations that counsel failed to inform him of the deportation consequences of his guilty plea as true,august order at,and found that that performance fell below an acceptable level of competence,see id.at but the court concluded that gonzalez could not show prejudice as a result of that failure,see id.at.with respect to prejudice,the court stated that gonzalez a must show a reasonable probability that,but for counsel errors,he would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial,august order at quoting hill lockhart,b must corroborate his statements with some objective evidence other than defendant own assertions,august order at quoting pham united states,cir and c must show that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances,august order at citing roe flores ortega.in concluding that gonzalez had not established prejudice,the judge who not only had heard the government description of the evidence against gonzalez and gonzalez admission of the acts described see plea tr,but also had presided over the trial of ceballos,which prominently featured evidence of pervasive illegal conduct by gonzalez,see,united states ceballos,at,stated that gonzalez could not 
show that a decision to go to trial rather than accept the plea offer would have been rational.at trial,petitioner would have faced overwhelming evidence of guilt based on testimony from undercover agents that petitioner personally delivered large quantities of drugs to them,as well as video and conversations between petitioner and undercover dea and state police agents petitioner therefore faced an overwhelming likelihood of conviction at trial and a significantly longer term of imprisonment than his actual sentence of months,followed by mandatory deportation under these circumstances,petitioner can not show that a rational defendant would have chosen to go to trial.
august order at emphases added.
with respect to gonzalez claims,his allegations that perez olivo had failed to investigate potential affirmative defenses,failed to seek discovery,and failed to request a bill of particulars,the court stated that t he same analysis and conclusion applies id.at.
as to sentencing,the court found,and noted that the government does not contest,that perez olivo performance did not meet an objectively reasonable standard of representation.id.at.the court noted that perez olivo had 
failed to submit a sentencing memorandum in support of his client,to seek any benefit based upon petitioner attempts to cooperate with the government,to challenge the imposition of an aggravating role enhancement,and to seek a downward departure the court not es also that counsel pattern of representation of criminal defendants is well established,and that counsel has since been disbarred in the state of new york and in puerto rico after allegations of providing ineffective assistance and violating professional standards in those jurisdictions.
however,with respect to sentencing too,the court concluded in gonzalez v that gonzalez had failed to show that the deficient performance caused him prejudice.the court stated that 
an analysis focusing solely on mere outcome determination,without attention to whether the result was fundamentally unfair or unreliable,is defective.lockhart fretwell.the court notes also that setting aside a sentence solely because the outcome would have been different but for counsel error may grant the defendant a windfall to which the law does not entitle him.united states cronic.
consequently,the court examines whether counsel inadequate assistance at sentencing had an adverse effect on petitioner sentence and whether this adverse effect rendered the proceeding fundamentally unfair or unreliable.
august order at emphases ours.although noting that gonzalez had describe d a number of practical and effective trial strategies that counsel should or could have pursued,id.at,the court concluded that gonzalez fail ed to show that the deficient representation he received from trial counsel adversely affected the length of his sentence,id.at.see also part.below.
judgment was entered denying the motion.this court granted a certificate of appealability.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,gonzalez contends principally that the district court erred a in ruling that he suffered no prejudice as a result of perez olivo deficient performance with respect to the plea of guilty and sentence,and b in failing,pursuant to,to allow discovery and to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the iac claims.gonzalez brief on appeal requests that we vacate his conviction and sentence or vacate his sentence and conduct a new sentencing proceeding or in the alternative remand for an evidentiary proceeding.gonzalez brief on appeal at.at oral argument of the appeal,gonzalez counsel,after stating that gonzalez would like to withdraw his plea a nd go to trial,stated that i f he could be vindicated on appeal by a finding of some other ineffective assistance of counsel,i do think that he necessarily would need to go to trial.oral argument transcript,at.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that gonzalez is not entitled to discovery,a hearing,or vacatur of his conviction based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to his plea of guilty but we conclude that he is entitled,represented by competent counsel,to be resentenced.
general principles governing proceedings and constitutionally required assistance of counsel 
a defendant in criminal proceedings has a right under the sixth amendment to effective assistance from his attorney at all critical stages in the proceedings,which include entry of a plea of guilty,see,hill lockhart,see generally missouri frye,and sentencing,see,glover united states,mempa rhay.the attorney has an overarching duty to advocate the defendant cause.strickland,at.
in order to succeed on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,a claimant must meet the test established by strickland 
he must show that counsel performance was deficient,strickland,at,so deficient that,in light of all the circumstances,the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,id.at and he must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense,id.at,in the sense that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,id.at.
bennett united states,cir.b oth the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of law and fact,and we review a district court conclusions on those issues de novo.id.at quoting strickland,at.the iac claim must be rejected if the defendant fails to meet either the performance prong or the prejudice prong.bennett united states,at see,strickland,at.
in order to satisfy the prejudice prong with respect to a claim focusing on a plea of guilty,the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel errors,he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.hill,at.with respect to a claim of ineffective assistance in sentencing,the defendant must show a reasonable probability that,but for counsel substandard performance,he would have received a less severe sentence.see generally lafler.cooper,glover united states,authority does not suggest that a minimal amount of additional time in prison can not constitute prejudice.quite to the contrary,our jurisprudence suggests that any amount of actual jail time has sixth amendment significance.
in ruling on a motion under,the district court is required to hold a hearing u nless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.see,pham united states,cir does not permit summary dismissals of motions that present facially valid claims.however,the filing of a motion pursuant to does not automatically entitle the movant to a hearing that section does not imply that there must be a hearing where the allegations are vague,conclusory,or palpably incredible.machibroda united states,see,chang united states,cir.to warrant a hearing,the motion must set forth specific facts supported by competent evidence,raising detailed and controverted issues of fact that,if proved at a hearing,would entitle him to relief.see,machibroda,at united states aiello,cir.
in determining whether the assertions in a motion warrant discovery or a hearing,the court must also take into account admissions made by the defendant at his plea hearing,for s olemn declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity.blackledge allison.s ubsequent presentation of conclusory allegations unsupported by specifics is subject to summary dismissal,as are contentions that in the face of the record are wholly incredible.id.compare id.at allegations that the plea was induced by an unkept promise were not vague or conclusory where the motion indicated exactly what the terms of the promise were when,where,and by whom the promise had been made and the identity of one witness to its communication emphasis added,with united states patasnik,cir patasnik allegations that the plea resulted from substandard advice because the attorney failed to investigate patasnik background and prior record,failed to listen to patasnik version of the case,failed to prepare properly for possible defenses available to the defendant,and did not properly investigate defendant case and prepare himself for trial were conclusory where the defendant point ed to nothing in his background,prior record or version of the case that would have made a lawyer optimistic about taking the case to trial,and did no t explain what possible defenses he ha d in mind that might have caused the attorney to give different advice emphasis added.
we review for abuse of discretion a district court decision as to what kind of hearing on a motion is appropriate,see,chang united states,at,or its decision that the defendant allegations do not warrant an evidentiary hearing at all,see,pham united states,at.a court abuses its discretion when it takes an erroneous view of the law,makes a clearly erroneous assessment of the facts,or renders a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.see,united states figueroa,cir.
gonzalez iac claim with regard to pleading guilty 
gonzalez claim that he received ineffective assistance with respect to his decision to plead of any padilla claim,because his conviction became final before padilla was decided is principally that perez olivo failed to adequately investigate potential affirmative defenses,to seek discovery,and to request a bill of particulars see,gonzalez brief on appeal at,motion at.although we conclude that the district court properly rejected this iac claim,we reach that conclusion on a ground apparently different from that adopted by the district court.see generally headley tilghman,cir.we are free to affirm a decision of the district court on any ground for which there is support in the record,regardless of the ground on which that court relied,cert.denied.
the alleged prejudice with respect to entry of the plea 
although it is clear that the district court ruled that gonzalez had failed to establish prejudice as a result of the alleged substandard performance by perez olivo with respect to his advice leading gonzalez to enter a plea of guilty,the court conclusion appears to have been based solely on the strength of the government case and the likelihood of a longer sentence upon conviction.the court noted that the trial evidence would include a testimony by undercover agents that gonzalez personally delivered large quantities of drugs to them,and b video and conversations between gonzalez and undercover dea and state police agents,see august order at,and that gonzalez would face a significantly longer term of imprisonment than his actual sentence of months,id.it concluded that gonzalez thus could not show that he would have declined to plead guilty if provided with adequate advice by perez olivo,because going to trial would not be rational.
while a district court assessment that proceeding to trial would be irrational may be an adequate basis for a finding of in connection with some iac claims,the court should,before reaching a conclusion as to prejudice,take into account all relevant factors.in reaching its rationality conclusion in the present case,the district court took into account one factor that we consider irrelevant,and it did not mention one that we consider relevant in these circumstances.
the fact that the prison term actually imposed on gonzalez was months seems an inappropriate factor in the court consideration of whether going to trial would be rational.while the actual sentence would be a valid consideration if there had been a plea agreement for that specific sentence,accepted by the court pursuant to.c c court acceptance of such a plea agreement pursuant to this rule would bind the court,there was no such agreement on a month sentence here.indeed,there was not even a tentative agreement on a sentencing range close to months.the plea agreement contained no estimate as to a range of imprisonment and at the plea hearing the ausa predicted that,in the absence of adjustments,the range for gonzalez in light of his plea of guilty would be to months.thus,gonzalez,so far as he knew,faced a term of imprisonment significantly longer than months even upon his decision to plead guilty.the fact that the court would eventually impose a prison term of months,being unknown to gonzalez,could not be a factor in his decision.
