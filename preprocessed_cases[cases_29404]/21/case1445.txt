background 
in late,a drug supplier sent approximately kilograms of cocaine to a man who turned out to be a government informant ci.as a result of those shipments,the ci owed the cocaine supplier million.defendant garcia was a truck driver tasked with retrieving this money from the ci on the east coast and transporting it across the country to either california or texas.
on february,garcia called the ci in the bronx,and the two arranged to meet at exit on the new jersey turnpike for the ci to transfer the funds to garcia.having detected police presence in the designated meeting area,garcia altered the plan,and the meeting was moved to the parking lot of an abandoned diner in levittown,pennsylvania.when the ci arrived at the diner parking lot,he encountered garcia and another man waiting in a.the ci gave the men two duffle bags filled with sham united states currency,vacuum sealed and wrapped in clear plastic.after receiving the bags,garcia and the other man drove away in the trailer.they were apprehended by federal agents shortly thereafter.
a federal grand jury indicted garcia on one count of conspiracy to launder money in violation of h,the object of the conspiracy being to conduct a financial transaction with property represent ing the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity in violation of a b i.on august,garcia pled guilty to the money laundering conspiracy charge.during the plea colloquy,the district judge described the elements of the money laundering conspiracy charge,and explained that the indictment charged that garcia had conspired with others to transfer and deliver a large amount of cash proceeds from unlawful activity,knowing that the transactions were designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,location,source,ownership or control of the proceeds.the judge specifically described the allegation that as an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy,garcia in february collected what he believed to be million in cash from a person in pennsylvania.
the judge asked garcia to state what he did that made him think he was guilty of the charged offense.garcia responded that he went to get some money,which he believed was the proceeds of some illegal activity,but that he did not know that it was drug proceeds or how much money was involved.the judge probed whether garcia understood that picking up the cash on that occasion would help disguise the source of that illegal money.id.garcia asked the judge to repeat the question,whereupon the judge reiterated that the money laundering conspiracy charge involves an agreement to engage in the transfer or delivery of cash with the intent to conceal or disguise the nature,location,source,ownership or control of the proceeds of some specified unlawful activity.the judge then asked whether garcia understood that going to pennsylvania on that occasion to pick up that cash was in fact part of a larger scheme to conceal or disguise the source or ownership of those funds id.garcia responded no.id.
at that point,the district judge asked defense counsel to assist with the colloquy.defense counsel stated that 
garcia role was that he was contacted by an individual that is now known to the i do want to mention it on the record for obvious garcia and he agreed to and picked up monies.he did know the amount that was wrapped up and packaged to be looked sic like regular truck cargo that he was supposed to deliver back to an individual.and he knew that those funds were the proceeds of illegal activity,not specifically drug proceeds,but he knew that it was.so concealment of the funds was to be included with the regular shipment of cargo within a truck,taken from point a to point b,not to be declared or a part of any income and taken to an individual,not locally but somewhere back in california,or texas.
id.garcia acknowledged that counsel recitation of garcia involvement was accurate.the judge then confirmed that garcia understood that the packages of money were wrapped so as to conceal their contents.after both the government and defense counsel agreed that this was a sufficient factual predicate,the judge accepted garcia guilty plea.
prior to sentencing,the district court conducted a hearing pursuant to united states fatico,cir,to resolve the contested factual issue of whether garcia knew or believed that the funds at issue were narcotics proceeds,so as to trigger a enhancement under section b of the sentencing guidelines.two witnesses testified at the hearing,both for the government a certified translator who authenticated two recordings of conversations between garcia and the ci that were introduced as exhibits,and the ci.the ci testified to the sequence of events concerning the underlying conduct described above.at the conclusion of the hearing,the court found that a preponderance of the evidence established that garcia knew that he was transporting narcotics proceeds.
on march,garcia counsel wrote to the district court requesting an adjournment of garcia sentencing pending the supreme court anticipated decision in cuellar united states,d granting certiorari,which counsel described as concerning whether hiding funds with no design to create the appearance of legitimate wealth is sufficient to support a money laundering conviction.counsel stated that he believed that the facts of cuellar were similar to garcia case.the district court denied the request,and on march,sentenced garcia to months in prison,to be followed by years of supervised release,and a special assessment.
cuellar was decided on june.as discussed in more detail below,cuellar rejected the appearance of legitimate wealth requirement,but held that the concealment element of the money laundering statute is satisfied only where the purpose,not merely the effect,of the transportation of funds is to conceal or disguise a listed attribute of the money.cuellar.at.on appeal,garcia contends that his plea to a money laundering conspiracy lacked a sufficient factual basis under cuellar and must be vacated.alternatively,garcia attacks the length of his sentence on a number of grounds.

legal standardsa.rule 
rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure requires that the district court,b efore entering judgment on a guilty plea,determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.b.in making that determination,the court is not limited to an examination of the defendant plea allocution,but may look more broadly to any facts on the record at the time of the plea proceeding.united states adams,cir,citing irizarry united states,cir.the overarching requirement is that the court assure itself simply that the conduct to which the defendant admits is in fact an offense under the statutory provision under which he is pleading guilty.united states maher,cir.requiring this examination of the relation between the law and the acts the defendant admits having committed is designed to protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge,quoting mccarthy united states,d,in turn quoting.advisory committee note

money laundering conspiracy 
conspiring to launder money requires that two or more people agree to violate the federal money laundering statute,and that the defendant knowingly engaged in the conspiracy with the specific intent to commit the offenses that are the objects of the conspiracy.united states huezo,cir,quoting united states monaco,cir the charged object of the conspiracy here is transaction money laundering in violation of a b i,which prohibits certain financial the transfer or delivery of the proceeds of certain unlawful activities when the defendant knows that the transaction is designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.a b i interpreting the analogous transportation provision of the money laundering statute,which prohibits the transportation of certain criminal proceeds into or out of the united states knowing that such transportation is designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the funds,a b i,the supreme court held in cuellar that the statute requires proof that the merely the transportation was to conceal or disguise a listed attribute of the funds.cuellar.at.
in cuellar,the jury convicted cuellar of transportation money laundering after police found approximately in narcotics proceeds hidden in cuellar car as he drove towards mexico.the money was hidden in a secret compartment of the vehicle,under the rear floorboard,bundled in plastic bags and duct tape,and covered with animal hair.id.at.a divided panel of the fifth circuit reversed the conviction,holding that the statute requires a showing that defendant attempted to create the appearance of legitimate wealth and that the evidence failed to show that defendant had intended to do so.cir.the fifth circuit granted rehearing en banc and,with three judges dissenting,affirmed the conviction.cir en banc.the en banc court rejected the requirement of an intent to create a legitimate appearance of wealth,and held that cuellar extensive efforts to conceal the funds during transportation sufficed to show an intent to conceal or disguise a listed attribute of the funds.id.at.
the supreme court reversed the conviction,rejecting the holdings of both the fifth circuit panel decision and its later en banc opinion.cuellar.at.first,the supreme court rejected cuellar argument,adopted by the fifth circuit panel,that the statute requires that a defendant take steps to make the funds appear legitimate.id.at.then,however,the court also rejected the government argument,adopted by the fifth circuit en banc,that the statute could be violated by a defendant who simply concealed the money during transportation,holding that merely hiding funds during transportation is not sufficient to violate the statute,even if substantial efforts have been expended to conceal the money.id.at.rather,the supreme court focused on the word design in the statutory requirement that the transportation be designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise a listed attribute of the money,and reasoned that design in that context must mean purpose or plan,the intended aim of the transportation.id.
thus,cuellar held that the money laundering statute requires that the merely the transportation be to conceal or disguise a listed attribute.id.at.although hiding funds during transportation may,in certain contexts,provide circumstantial evidence that the purpose of the transportation is concealment,the supreme court emphasized the difference between concealing something to transport it,and transporting something to conceal it that is,how one moves the money is distinct from why one moves the money.evidence of the former,standing alone,is not sufficient to prove the latter.id.at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
the facts of the case highlighted the distinction although cuellar had clearly concealed the money to facilitate its transportation,there was no evidence that the purpose of the transportation was concealment of any sort.id.rather,the government own expert witness testified that the purpose of the transportation was to compensate the leaders of the drug trafficking operation.id.at.as the government evidence was limited to establishing that cuellar concealed the funds en route to mexico,the supreme court reversed the conviction.id.at.
although cuellar arose in the context of transportation money laundering,we have found its holding equally applicable in the context of transaction money laundering,in light of the identical language used in the two provisions.huezo,at see also united states ness,cir.compare a b i transaction money laundering,with a b i transportation money laundering.as we have previously stated,cuellar confirms that a conviction for transaction money laundering,like a conviction for transportation money laundering,requires proof that the purpose or intended aim of the transaction was to conceal or disguise a specified attribute of the funds.huezo,at.
in ness,we encountered a man who transported millions of dollars of narcotics proceeds via his armored car carrier business by hiding the proceeds in packages of jewelry being transported to europe,avoiding any paper trail,and using code words for the delivery of the funds.all of this,we found,shows only an intent to conceal the transportation,not an intent to transport in order to conceal,and accordingly reversed his convictions for both transaction and transportation money laundering.ness,at.the distinction may sound narrow and verbal,but it goes to the heart of the very idea of money laundering,which is that the transaction itself operates in some way to conceal the nature,source or ownership or the like of the funds,and thus to launder the illicit proceeds.
ii.application 
garcia argues that the transaction at issue here is a straightforward and unsophisticated payment in exchange for a past shipment of drugs,done with the purpose of compensating the leaders of the drug operation,and that because the plea was founded solely on his admission that the funds were packaged so as to hide them during transport,the plea lacks a sufficient factual basis under cuellar and its progeny.in arguing to the contrary,the government highlights the fact cuellar and ness,which arose following jury acknowledged during his plea allocution that he understood the nature of the charge,including the concealment element,and admitted to engaging in conduct in ac
