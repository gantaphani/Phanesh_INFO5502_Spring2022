john pakala appeals his conviction and resulting sentence for possessing and selling stolen firearms.after careful consideration,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
at trial,robert boudrow,a deacon and pastoral counselor of a church in revere,massachusetts,testified that on june,he hired pakala to help with church renovations.boudrow,who served as one of the government main witnesses,invited pakala to stay at his house in chelsea for a few days because pakala appeared to be living in his truck.on wednesday,june,after working at the church,the two men returned to boudrow home where boudrow observed that two gun cases stored in his bedroom closet,which contained five guns,appeared undisturbed.that afternoon,boudrow left for work while pakala remained in the boudrow residence,but when boudrow returned home around,pakala and the guns were gone.boudrow testified that in looking for pakala,he smelled cigarette smoke near the bedroom closet that contained the gun cases.while neither boudrow nor his wife smoked,boudrow had observed pakala smoke.boudrow also noticed that keys to the gun cases,a black suitcase,and some other items were missing.boudrow then called the police to report the stolen items.pakala never returned to the boudrow residence even though he left behind his truck and dog.
pauline hassett,a friend of pakala,also testified for the government,as a cooperating witness sometime in,pakala told hassett that he had secured a job at a church in revere and was staying in the home of a church guy.pakala informed hassett that he had seen several guns in an upstairs bedroom and planned to steal them after he was paid at the end of the week.hassett testified that on wednesday,june,pakala told her that he had stolen the guns she recalled the day because it was raining and they did do no painting and stuff that day.over pakala objection,the government introduced two weather reports that showed that it had rained on wednesday,june.the weather reports were admitted into evidence as exhibits and but were not published to the jury at trial.
on that day,pakala and hassett planned to buy drugs but got into a disagreement over who would pay and separated.hassett alone procured drugs and returned to her apartment in chelsea around noon.at,pakala appeared at her apartment with a wad of cash and told her he alone had stolen and then sold five guns with a mutual friend known as porky.hassett and pakala left her apartment,bought more drugs,and stayed at a hotel for one night.
a few weeks later,after a dispute during which pakala threw a coffee table at hassett,hitting her on the head,hassett contacted the police and was taken to the hospital.once there,in addition to discussing the altercation,hassett told the police about the stolen firearms.officer chris borum confirmed at trial that hassett told him that pakala had bragged to her that he and another man had sold five guns.hassett gave the police a black suitcase which pakala had left on her back porch,an item among those taken from the boudrow residence on june.
pursuant to a grant of immunity,angel acevedo offered testimony that he and a group of his friends bought guns from porky,later identified as angel gonzáles,and a tall,skinny,white man,identified by acevedo as pakala,on wednesday,june.police apprehended several of the five firearms.pakala case later was severed from gonzáles.
pakala ultimately was tried on two counts being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g and possession and sale of stolen firearms,in violation of j.prior to trial,on june,pakala filed a motion to suppress.the motion was denied on august,and a trial date was set for september.on august,he requested a continuance of the trial date because of a scheduling conflict,and the district court permitted the motion by electronic endorsement.defense counsel filed a second motion to continue on november,in order to seek the transcripts from gonzáles trial.the next day,the district court allowed the motion by electronic endorsement with the trial continued to january.one week before the trial date,pakala moved to dismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds.the district court denied the motion.
the jury convicted pakala on both counts on february.pakala report psr found that pakala was subject to the armed career criminal act acca based on three prior convictions for crimes of attempted burglary in nevada and two counts of third degree burglary of an unoccupied structure in florida under.stat.a.pakala total offense level of,combined with a criminal history category of vi,resulted in a guidelines sentencing range gsr of to months imprisonment with pakala subject to a statutory minimum of months imprisonment.
prior to sentencing,pakala challenged the use of his two florida convictions for purposes of the acca classification.he argued that the florida statute was broader than a generic burglary and that the specific section of the statute to which he pled guilty did not warrant treatment as a violent felony.he also claimed that the court could not rely on complaint applications or police reports in determining whether pakala had committed a violent felony pakala also objected to the psr on the grounds that he deserved a downward departure because his criminal history category overstated the seriousness of his criminal history,was the result of substance abuse and a bipolar disorder,and did not show violence.he further argued that he was subjected to extreme mental and physical distress and that he had been denied adequate medical and psychological treatment while incarcerated.the government filed a written response which opposed pakala arguments and urged the court to impose a sentence,about halfway between the low end and the midpoint of the applicable gsr.
at sentencing,the government stated that it had obtained the florida information the information to which pakala pled guilty and provided it to defense counsel.for each of the two florida offenses,the information specifically alleged that the defendant did unlawfully enter or remain in a structure,to wit,a building or the curtilage thereof,and identified the specific address of the property.defense counsel did not claim that the court had insufficient evidence to determine to which portion of the statute pakala pleaded guilty but,rather,insisted that the crime did not constitute a violent felony because it did not involve an assault or a dangerous weapon.the district court overruled pakala objections,classified him as an armed career criminal,and sentenced him to months imprisonment,the lowest sentence within the gsr.pakala now appeals his conviction and his sentence.
ii.discussion 
pakala raises four issues on appeal.we discuss each in turn.
admission of weather reports 
pakala first contends that the district erred by admitting two weather reports into evidence,exhibits and,which showed that it was raining on wednesday,june,in boston and the surrounding area.as pakala adequately preserved his objection to the weather reports at trial,we review the trial court rulings admitting or excluding evidence only for abuse of discretion.united states gobbi,cir.
pakala first contends that the weather reports were never properly admitted,and thus it was reversible error for the prosecution to reference them in its closing arguments and to make the reports available to the jury.see,virgin islands joseph,cir finding plain error when two incriminating documents,including a signed written confession,were inadvertently provided to the jury.however,the record demonstrates that the reports were,in fact,properly admitted.when the government offered the documents,the court,after hearing from both parties,stated 
the court okay.you know,sometimes you should be careful what you wish for.i am going to let it in and see what happens 
the government is that for both fourteen and fifteen,your honor 
the court yes.
emphasis added.in addition,pakala argues that the district court committed error because the weather reports were never published to the jury during trial.but there was no requirement for the government to do so after they were admitted,and pakala points to nothing to suggest otherwise.
pakala also contends that the weather reports were not admissible because their probative value was substantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect on the jury.pakala argues that because there was no evidence establishing that the work set for pakala that day was outdoors,rather than indoors,the fact that it was raining on wednesday,june,could not be used to establish that pakala did not work that day.thus,pakala argues that the weather reports were irrelevant and,moreover,prejudicial,as they improperly bolstered the credibility of hassett.pakala contends that the government hammer ed away at the evidence and harp ed on the reports in its closing argument.we give deference to a district court determinations regarding whether evidence is more probative than prejudicial.see united states adams,cir.even if the district court erred,we will not reverse if the error was harmless.see united states,cir.
although the government makes a number of arguments supporting the relevancy of the weather reports,we need not address them because,as the government correctly contends,any error here was harmless.a evidentiary error is harmless 
if it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.see united states piper,cir.the government bears the burden of establishing harmless error.see united states rose,cir.the harmless error inquiry is.among other factors,it requires consideration of the centrality of the tainted evidence,its uniqueness,its prejudicial impact,the use to which the evidence was put,and the relative strengths of the parties cases.see united states sepúlveda,cir.
at citations in the original.
the government easily meets its burden here.to establish its case,the government not only included the testimony of hassett,but also the testimony of boudrow,who testified at length concerning the day both the guns and pakala went missing.although hassett and boudrow testimony concerning the timing of the events on the date of the,june,not entirely consistent,their testimony coincided substantially,such that the jury was free to credit the salient portions of their testimony and conclude that pakala took the guns and sold them.see united states lara,cir j urors are not required to discard testimony that appears to contain internal inconsistencies,but may credit parts of a witness testimony and disregard other potentially contradictory portions.the jury also heard from acevedo,who purchased the guns and whose testimony was corroborated by the stolen guns later recovered.more importantly,like boudrow and hassett,acevedo essentially provided the same account of the events of wednesday,june,pakala stole firearms and later sold them.thus,the relative strength of the government case was overwhelming.
in addition,the weather reports were not sufficiently prejudicial to merit reversal.see,at noting factors to consider as including the evidence prejudicial impact.as pakala admits,the weather reports were never published to the jury at trial,limiting any impact they may have had.moreover,despite pakala claim that the government hammer ed away at the evidence and harp ed on the reports in its closing argument,the government only referred to the reports in a smattering of places.finally,the reports only corroborate a small part of hassett testimony,her mention of the fact that it was raining the day pakala came to her with the stolen guns at best,the impact of the weather reports was minimal.
the strength of the government case and the miniscule impact of the weather reports,taken together,make it highly probable that the assumed error did not influence the verdict.id.since we find that any possible error here was harmless,we hold that the district court did not err in admitting the weather reports.
whether prior burglaries are crimes of violence under the acca 
pakala next contends that the district court erred when it considered his two prior convictions under florida state law as violent felon ies for purposes of classifying him as an armed career criminal under the acca.
under the acca,an individual convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm under g,as pakala was here,is subject to a sentencing enhancement as an armed career criminal if he has three previous convictions by any court for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,or both.see e emphasis added.the acca defines a violent felony as a crime that is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.id.e b ii emphasis added.the determination of whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for purposes of the acca is a legal question subject to de novo review.united states richards,cir,cert.denied,d.
pakala argues that the district court erred in considering his two convictions under.stat.a violent felonies for purposes of the acca.section provides 
burglary is a felony of the third degree,if,in the course of committing the offense,the offender does not make an assault or battery and is not and does not become armed with a dangerous weapon or explosive,and the offender enters or remains in a 
a structure,and there is not another person in the structure at the time the offender enters or remains or 
b conveyance,and there is not another person in the conveyance at the time the offender enters or remains.
in taylor united states,d,the supreme court addressed what burglar ies constitute violent felon ies under e b ii of the acca.see id.at.noting that the statute takes a categorical approach,id.at,the court held that a generic burglary constitutes a violent felony for purposes of the acca,and defined a generic burglary as any crime,regardless of its exact definition or label,having the basic elements of unlawful or unprivileged entry into,or remaining in,a building or structure,with intent to commit a crime,id.at.
pakala argues that the statute under which he was convicted covers more than a generic burglary because structure as defined by.stat.includes curtilage.specifically,the statute provides that structure means a building of any kind,either temporary or permanent,which has a roof over it,together with the curtilage thereof.stat.emphasis added.for that reason,pakala claims that the convictions do not constitute violent felonies under the acca because it covers places other than buildings.see taylor,at.addressing the separate issue of statutes that define burglary more broadly,by including places other than buildings.we agree.
pakala is correct that the florida statute under which he was convicted includes curtilage as part of the definition of structure.moreover,nothing on the face of the information excludes the curtilage.in fact,the information states that pakala did unlawfully enter or remain in a structure,to wit,a building or the curtilage thereof.emphasis added.because,on this record,his convictions may involve the curtilage of a structure,they can not constitute generic burglaries for purposes of the acca.see united states matthews,cir holding that two third degree burglary convictions under.stat.were not generic burglaries under the acca because on this record,one can not determine whether either of his two burglary convictions was for burglary of the roofed portion of a structure,rather than the curtilage.
pakala is not out of the woods just yet.the acca contains an otherwise clause,which defines a violent felony as a crime that,along with burglary,otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.e b ii.we continue to apply a categorical approach to the otherwise clause of the acca.see united states giggey,cir en banc.
in matthews,the eleventh circuit addressed whether convictions for third degree burglary under.stat.a are violent felon ies under this otherwise clause.at.it held that since florida case law narrowly defines the curtilage of a structure to include only an enclosed area surrounding a structure,a burglary of a structure curtilage is a crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.see id.at.accordingly,it held in that case that even if matthews burglary convictions are not convictions for generic burglary,they are convictions for violent crimes under the acca because they satisfy this alternative definition.id.
similarly,in james united states,d,the court addressed a conviction under florida attempted burglary law,which defined d welling to include both the structure and the curtilage thereof.see id.at.discussing.stat.there,the supreme court concluded that a burglar who illegally attempts to enter the enclosed area surrounding a dwelling creates much the same risk of physical confrontation with a property owner,law enforcement official,or other third party as does one who attempts to enter the structure itself.id.accordingly,the supreme court held,following matthews,that s uch an attempt presents a serious potential risk that violence will ensue and someone will be injured for purposes of the otherwise clause.id.citing matthews,at.
both matthews and james answer in the affirmative that a burglary of the curtilage of a structure under florida law presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another for purposes of the otherwise clause of the acca.it follows that pakala two convictions for third degree burglary under.stat.a,which also involve,according to the information,a building or the curtilage thereof,constitute violent felon ies under the otherwise clause of the acca.thus,no error occurred 
sentencing 
pakala also challenges his sentence.he first claims that the district court failed to make findings to support the sentence imposed in violation of c,which requires a court to state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.he argues,in particular,that the district court failed to discount his long criminal history,since it was devoid of violent crime,and failed to take into account his long history of substance abuse.as pakala failed to challenge the adequacy of the district court explanation at sentencing,plain error review applies.see united states,cir but see united states,cir lipez,concurring questioning use of plain error review in challenge under section c.
we find no error,plain or otherwise.we previously have recognized that sentences require a lesser degree of explanation than those that fall outside the guideline sentencing range,and we think that observation is all the more true when the sentence is at the very bottom of the guidelines range.see united states arango,cir quoting united states,cir.although the district court did not explicitly address pakala grounds above,it heard pakala arguments,as well as the government recounting of pakala lengthy criminal history and the fact that he committed serious offenses in different states.thus,one can infer that,in imposing the sentence,the district court was not swayed by pakala mitigation evidence and found more compelling the government arguments in favor of a guidelines sentence for pakala.see united states,cir w e find it easy to infer that the sentencing court did not find vázquez arguments persuasive and that it thought that a sentence based on the guidelines recommendation was warranted.
pakala finally contends that his sentence was otherwise unreasonable because the district court failed to grant a downward departure for his sentence we have held that review of a denial of a downward departure is unavailable,as the decision is discretionary.united states,cir see also united states kornegay,cir holding that if the defendant claim is only that the district court unreasonably declined to exercise its discretion to grant a departure,we may not review it.
in any event,to the extent that pakala challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence,the sentence here was amply supported by the record,and the sentence imposed was the lowest within the gsr.as pakala does not present any fairly powerful mitigating reasons that suggest that the district court was unreasonable in balancing pros and cons,we see no basis for disturbing his sentence.see united states beatty,cir requiring such powerful mitigating reasons for any defendant who wishes to attack an sentence as excessive.quotation marks omitted.
speedy trial act 
after briefing,but prior to oral argument,pakala raised a new argument that the district court erred in failing to articulate its reasons for granting two ends of justice continuances sought by pakala prior to denying his motion to dismiss under the speedy trial act,the speedy trial act or the act.pakala points to zedner united states,d,where the supreme court,interpreting the act,required district courts to se t forth,in the record in the case,either orally or in writing,its reasons for finding that the ends of justice are served and they outweigh other interests in deciding a motion for an ends of justice continuance.id.at.quoting h a 
pakala argues that the district court failed to follow zedner,and,accordingly,that his conviction should be dismissed under the act.see a if a defendant is not brought to trial within the time limit required by section c as extended by section h,the information or indictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant emphasis added see also zedner,at.noting that t he sanction for a violation of the act is dismissal.
as an initial matter,the government contends that pakala waived the issue because he failed to raise it in his initial brief.we have consistently held that arguments not raised in the initial appellate legal brief are considered waived.see united states capozzi,cir.however,the record is fully developed with respect to pakala claim,such that no additional factfinding is necessary,and thus no special prejudice to the government would result in addressing the claim.see ass of social workers harwood,cir noting that a failure to raise an issue to the district court can be excused where,among other things,the appellant did not deprive the court of appeals of useful factfinding and the claim is,not,such that there is no special prejudice or inequity to the other side see also united states laguardia,cir permitting review of an issue raised for the first time on appeal where,among other things,the point can be resolved with certitude on the existing record,a factor that often inclines a court to entertain a pivotal argument for the first time on appeal.
we review the district court denial of a motion to dismiss based upon the speedy trial act de novo as to legal rulings and for clear error as to factual findings.united states maxwell,cir citation omitted.we also review de novo the calculation of days included and excluded for purposes of the speedy trial act.see united states barnes,cir.
we begin with the basics.the speedy trial act requires a district court to try a defendant within seventy days from the filing date and making public of the information or indictment,or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending,whichever date last occurs.c.the act mandates the exclusion of certain dates,such as delay reasonably attributable to any period,not to exceed thirty days,during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court.see,id.h j.the act also permits the exclusion of days resulting from the granting of a motion to continue,if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.id.h a emphasis added.the act provides a number of factors a court shall consider in considering an ends of justice continuance,such as whether a failure to grant the continuance would unreasonably deny the defendant continuity of counsel or would deny counsel for the defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation.see id.h b iv.
because pakala does not challenge the exclusion of any delay up to the august,denial of his motion to suppress,we start the clock there.from that date until the filing of pakala motion to dismiss on speedy trial act grounds on january,days had passed.see united states connor,cir a motion for dismissal under the speedy trial act is effective only for periods of time which antedate the filing of the motion.subsequent periods of delay,whether includable or excludable,are inconsequential.
in the interim,pakala counsel filed two motions for a continuance that resulted in ends of justice exclusions.the first motion,filed on august,sought to exclude august,through november,due to a scheduling conflict for defense counsel and because pakala sought the transcripts from the trial of the severed.the second motion,filed on november,sought to exclude november,through january,as defense still awaited transcripts and the transcripts were necessary for pakala to adequately prepare,with his counsel for trial.the district court allowed both motions by electronic endorsement.the allowance of these motions excluded all of the days between the start date for speedy trial act purposes august,and the end date january.
pakala does not challenge the allowance of these motions.rather,pakala contends that the district court erred because,up to and including the denial of pakala motion to dismiss,the court never articulated its reasons for allowing these two motions for ends of justice continuances and,moreover,failed to calculate and articulate the days excluded.instead,in allowing the two motions for ends of justice continuances and in denying pakala motion to dismiss,the district court only entered electronic endorsements that did not even hint at the days excluded or the reasons why.
for support,pakala relies on zedner,where the supreme court similarly reversed the denial of a motion to dismiss on speedy trial act grounds where the district court failed to articulate the reasons for exclusion and the days excluded.but the facts there were extreme.there,the defendant,at the time seeking a third continuance,entered into a waiver for all time that prospectively waived his speedy trial rights.see zedner,at.in addition,the defendant was borderline incompetent to stand trial.id.at.four years after being indicted,the district court denied the defendant motion to dismiss on speedy trial act grounds based on the defendant prospective waiver.id.at.the court of appeals affirmed.id.
in reversing the denial of the defendant motion to dismiss,the supreme court held,among other things,that the prospective waiver signed by the defendant was unenforceable,see id.at,and that judicial estoppel did not bar the defendant speedy trial act claims.see id.at.more importantly,the court concluded that the speedy trial act required the district court to se t forth,in the record of the case,either orally or in writing,its reasons for finding that the ends of justice are served and they outweigh other interests.id.at.quoting h a.the supreme court further held that at the very least the act implies that those findings must be put on the record by the time the district court rules on a defendant motion to dismiss under a,and that t he best practice is for a district court to put its findings on the record at or near the time when it grants the continuance.id.at.as the district court in that case failed to do so,the supreme court reversed,finding such an error not harmless because the rule would also tend to undermine the detailed requirements of the provisions regulating continuances.id.at.
although no prospective waiver is at issue in this case,pakala argues that the result in zedner equally applies here,since the district court similarly failed to articulate the basis for allowing the ends of justice continuances.
but a closer reading of zedner reveals otherwise.in zedner the supreme court declined to apply judicial estoppel to preclude the defendant from both enjoying the benefit of a continuance and then challenging such a continuance on the ground that it was not supported by an on the record finding as required under h a.although noting that this estoppel doctrine is equitable and thus can not be reduced to a precise formula or test,the court articulated several factors to consider in applying judicial estoppel 
first,a party later position must be clearly inconsistent with its earlier position.second,courts regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party earlier position a third consideration is whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.
zedner,at.quoting new hampshire maine,d.thus,the court declined to apply judicial estoppel since,among other things,the defendant position in support of the continuances was not clearly inconsistent with the position that he now takes in seeking dismissal of the indictment.id.at.
however,the supreme court noted that t his would be a different case if petitioner had succeeded in persuading the district court that the factual predicate for a statutorily authorized exclusion of delay could be established.id.in particular,the court noted,with respect to a crucial january status conference,that 
i n fact,however,the discussion at the january status conference did not focus on the requirements of the act.rather,the court and the parties proceeded on the assumption that the court waiver form was valid and that the act could simply be disregarded.nothing in the discussion at the conference suggests that the question presented by the defense continuance request was viewed as anything other than a question that lay entirely within the scope of the district court discretion.under these circumstances,the best understanding of the position taken by petitioner attorney at the january status conference is that granting the requested continuance would represent a sound exercise of the trial judge discretion in managing its calendar.this position was not clearly inconsistent with petitioner later position that the continuance was not permissible under the terms of the act.accordingly,we hold that petitioner is not estopped from challenging the excludability under the act of the continuance.
id.at.emphasis added.
in contrast,this case supports a finding of judicial estoppel.in his two motions for ends of justice continuances,pakala each time asserted statutorily authorized exclusions of delay.the first was for continuity of counsel given a scheduling conflict,and the second was for reasonable time necessary for effective preparation to allow pakala defense counsel the opportunity to obtain the transcripts from angel gonzáles trial,and thus provide pakala defense counsel with adequate time to prepare for trial.see h b iv noting both grounds for allowing an ends of justice continuance.
moreover,it was clearly obvious that the district court,in granting the motions,necessarily adopted both grounds.see united states bruckman,cir holding that the basic facts and justifying grounds for the requested continuance and excludable time under the speedy trial act are clearly obvious as explained in the government motion and memorandum,which was allowed by the trial court.we have held that it is not necessary for the court to articulate the basic facts when they are obvious and set forth in a motion for a continuance.united states rush,cir.thus,the district court actions support a finding that the district court was persuad ed that the factual predicate for a statutorily authorized exclusion of delay could be established.zedner,at.
accordingly,we conclude that pakala position in his motion to the district court failed to credit its grounds for granting pakala ends of justice clearly inconsistent with its prior position concerning the district court granting of its two motions for ends of justice continuances for the reasons stated within those motions.moreover,pakala would obtain an unfair advantage by benefitting from his continuances and then later claiming that he was somehow prejudiced by the district court actions.see id.at.thus,judicial estoppel applies to pakala claims.
in so holding,we stress that the far better course for the district court would have been to articulate its reasons for granting the ends of justice continuances.whatever administrative ease is obtained in simply allowing motions for ends of justice continuances by stock electronic order,it is
