background 
on october,acosta used an american express card in the name of nelson barrera to purchase three gift cards from a penney store in nashua,new hampshire.store security officer mark kidd witnessed the purchase,followed acosta into the parking lot,and observed him enter the sears store.acosta purchase aroused kidd suspicions because the store had recently experienced losses arising from multiple gift card purchases through counterfeit credit cards.at the time he observed acosta,kidd was unaware that the defendant was using a fraudulent card.sears security videotaped acosta as his card was denied when he attempted to purchase similar gift certificates.kidd then observed acosta enter a car,which,it developed,was registered to acosta girlfriend,delva castanos.security officer kidd contacted american express and learned that nelson barrera was not a valid american express account holder.
on october,acosta purchased two more gift certificates from a target store in nashua,new hampshire,using a mastercard also in the name of nelson barrera.eleven days later,investigators from the nashua police department and secret service went to the apartment of acosta girlfriend delva castanos.castanos identified the man in the sears videotape as acosta and consented to a search of her apartment and vehicle.
about the same time,officer karen becotte of the nashua police department stopped acosta as he was driving castanos car in the parking garage of the building in which she had an apartment acosta showed her a new hampshire driver license in the name of pedro lozada.becotte falsely informed acosta that his vehicle was suspected of involvement in a accident,and acosta accompanied her to the police station in castanos car.
in an interview at the police station,acosta admitted to the use of a number of aliases and stolen credit cards.he said he had obtained the cards from an individual he knew as fat john.he also indicated that castanos apartment contained evidence including items purchased with these cards,receipts,and additional fraudulent credit cards.acosta accompanied investigators to the apartment,showed them the evidence,and provided them with seventeen credit cards in several different names.
prior to acosta interrogation,officer kidd also learned of fraudulent credit card charges at a penney store in concord,new hampshire,on february and.these charges,on a card issued to rafael vila,consisted of four gift card purchases and a merchandise purchase,totaling.the government linked acosta to these transactions through his use of an american express card to fraudulently purchase gift cards at a penney in salem,new hampshire,on january.later,an individual using the name joseph trimpin redeemed the penney gift cards purchased by both vila and acosta at a store in miami,florida through trimpin actions,the government linked acosta to the vila transactions.
procedural history 
on november,acosta was indicted on one count of possession of,with intent to defraud,fifteen or more counterfeit or unauthorized access devices credit cards,in violation of a.acosta filed a motion to suppress,arguing that he had been illegally arrested,questioned absent miranda warnings,and questioned after he had requested an attorney.the district court granted the motion,suppressing all of acosta statements and all evidence derived therefrom,including a number of credit cards and receipts found at castanos apartment.after this,the district court granted the government motion to dismiss the indictment.on march,the government reindicted acosta on one count of fraudulently using and attempting to use one or more unauthorized access devices including,but not limited to,american express card,to fraudulently obtain property and other items of sic with an aggregate value of more than one thousand dollars between january,and october,in violation of a and b.acosta filed another motion to suppress,which the district court dismissed as moot based on the government representations that it would not rely on any evidence covered by the earlier suppression order to prove the charge in the second indictment.the district court also dismissed as moot acosta motion to dismiss or,in the alternative,for a bill of particulars because the government has represented that the indictment reference to other access devices refers to those credit cards identified in its objection to defendant motion to dismiss and that its evidence will be limited to the access devices identified in the indictment and in its objection.the government represented in this motion that n one of the information in the second indictment is subject to the suppression decision and that it would not attempt to use the suppressed evidence without the court permission.
acosta pled guilty to this new indictment and signed a binding plea agreement stipulating that the amount of loss from his charged conduct did not exceed.
the government also filed a sentencing memorandum with attachments in support of its sentencing positions.this report incorporated the results of a secret service inquiry into the use of american express card number,which found that the card had been legitimately issued to olgamarina de tunez of miami,florida.the memo report contained a list of fraudulent charges on this credit card.three entries reflected the october transactions that officer kidd had witnessed at the penney store in concord,new hampshire.other charges included transactions at henri bendel,a business in new york city,on september,in north miami,florida,and sam goody in salem,new hampshire,all on september,sears roebuck in manchester,new hampshire,on september,scoop east in new york city and lenscrafters and sears roebuck in nashua,new hampshire,all on september,as well as myriad other transactions at new hampshire and massachusetts businesses.the fraudulent charges to this account,an account known to investigators prior to their obtaining the suppressed evidence on october,totaled.
at sentencing,the district court ruled that the suppressed evidence could not be used to calculate offense level because the police had acted egregious ly in obtaining it.the court attributed the purchases made by vila to acosta and included them to calculate total loss.the court included the in purchases by vila,in american express card purchases,from acosta fraudulent use of a mastercard,and from acosta purchases at sears to calculate total loss for acosta guideline range.the resulting total,yielded a total offense level of ten with a guideline sentencing range gsr of six to twelve months.applying a criminal history category of i,the court sentenced acosta to ten months imprisonment and three years of supervised release.it also ordered restitution of,an amount that included the suppressed transactions.without any defense objection as to accuracy,the court adopted this restitution figure from the government august,letter to the probation office,which referred to affidavits of loss provided by the credit card companies.
ii.discussion 
acosta appeals the district court calculations of loss,along with its resulting offense level,and restitution.on loss,he contests both the american express figure,arguing it should be,and the figure,claiming no part of it should be attributed to him.he contends that his sentence should be based on a loss figure of less than,resulting in an offense level of six,and a gsr of zero to six months.he also contests the restitution amount,arguing that the district court should not have considered the suppressed transactions.we reject both arguments.
loss calculation 
acosta argues that the district court erred in calculating his offense level by including unsuppressed credit card charges that the government did not prove acosta personally made.we review the district court findings of fact for clear error.united states brewster,cir.this court grants great deference to a district court calculation of the amount of loss for sentencing purposes 
calculating the amount of loss for purposes of the sentencing guidelines is more an art than a science a party dissatisfied with the sentencing court quantification of the amount of loss in a particular case must go a long way to demonstrate that the finding is clearly erroneous.
united states rostoff,cir citations omitted.the government must prove the amount of loss under by a preponderance of the evidence.united states vaknin,cir united states keifer,cir.the sentencing must be based on information bearing sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.a.
acosta argues that the district court and government were merely speculating that he was the only person with access to the unauthorized american express card number.he points out that because the card was not a stolen card,but rather a card manufactured fraudulently using an card number,the likelihood was very low that a person would go to the trouble of fraudulently obtaining a credit card number only to produce just one fake card and then take that card from florida to new england to sell it.further,acosta points out that when faced with evidence that the same credit card number was used on the same day at a in north miami,florida and at sam goody in salem,new hampshire,the government explained the potential problem by saying that the miami use was erroneously classified as fraudulent and was in fact a legitimate transaction acosta argues that it is possible that other uses were similarly classified as fraudulent by mistake.
acosta also highlights the two instances where a fraudulent card was used in new york and new hampshire on the same date to further suggest that another person was using the same account number,and points out that no evidence was offered to refute this possibility.while conceding that it was theoretically possible that the new york purchases were made by telephone or that he traveled to both states on the same day,acosta argues that these scenarios are highly unlikely and the government evidence linking him to these purchases is insufficient.
accordingly,acosta argues,he should be held responsible only for the three of the uses of american express card number that occurred on october,at penney in nashua,new hampshire.in contrast,the government argued,and the court found,that all uses of this card,totaling,were attributable to acosta.
at the sentencing hearing,the district court judge concluded that the government had met its burden under the preponderance of the evidence standard 
i find that the government has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the of attributable losses is correct.i satisfied that there no evidence that there were multiple cards with the same number.there certainly some questionable charges here,but there are myriad explanations as to how that could happen c ertainly it not inconceivable at all,in fact it very plausible,that the defendant could easily have made phone calls to these new york stores and ordered whatever was ordered.you do have to be personally there.it could be phone calls.it could be whatever.he had the card in his possession.he was in the area.there no evidence that convinces me or satisfies me that there a real plausibility of another duplicate card out there other than the original card,so i think the government met its burden of proof with respect to that number.
excluding the suppressed evidence to calculate loss for sentencing purposes,the court eliminated and adopted the figure as charges to american express card number.this excluded the miami,florida,charge.
indeed,most of the charges attributed to acosta occurred in a tight geographical hampshire and many were gift cards.the court concluded that the preponderance of the evidence demonstrated acosta likely made the purchases.further,of the transactions charged to american express card number,only three were made in new york,which is outside the tight geographical area.the district court concluded that acosta could have made these charges himself,likely over the phone or in person.
considering the argument that the purchases made on the card issued to vila should not be attributed to acosta,the district court recognized that the question was a close one but determined that the government had met its burden,establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the charge made by vila,independently of the suppressed evidence,was made by acosta.the district court included this amount in the calculation of loss.
given the high level of deference we accord to a trial court calculation of loss for sentencing purposes and the judge reasoned explanations on both figures,we see no clear error in the district court loss calculation.
restitution 
acosta argues that the district court erred in using the suppressed evidence to calculate restitution.we review this claim of legal error de novo.united states collins,cir united states neal,cir united states savoie,cir.
use of suppressed evidence 
this circuit has yet to decide whether a court may use evidence suppressed under the fourth amendment in the context of sentencing guidelines proceedings.united states raposa,cir addressing but declining to decide the issue.we have noted,however,that all the courts that have addressed this issue have held that there is no blanket prohibition on the consideration of illegally seized evidence for the purposes of making the findings required under the guidelines.id.at.indeed,ten other circuits have ruled that in most circumstances,the fourth amendment exclusionary rule does not bar the introduction of suppressed evidence during sentencing proceedings united states ryan,cir citing united states brimah,cir holding exclusionary rule at sentencing should not bar introduction of evidence seized in violation of fourth amendment,but leaving open question of whether the rule applies when police intentionally act illegally to enhance defendant sentence united states,cir holding the exclusionary rule does not apply at sentencing united states kim,cir admitting evidence from illegal search and seizure at sentencing,but leaving open the question of whether the rule applies when police intentionally act illegally to enhance defendant sentence or had an undue incentive to so act united states,cir holding exclusionary rule is generally inapplicable to sentencing proceedings,but suggesting that illegally seized evidence could be excluded if it was seized for the sole purpose of enhancing defendant sentence united states jenkins,cir permitting the use of illegally seized evidence after finding no indication that evidence was obtained to enhance defendant sentence united states tejada,cir absent a showing that officers obtained evidence expressly to enhance a sentence,a district judge may not refuse to consider relevant evidence at sentencing,even if that evidence has been seized in violation of the fourth amendment.united states lynch,cir admitting illegally obtained evidence and reserving question of whether suppression would be necessary if illegal search was done with purpose of increasing defendant sentence mccrory,same united states torres,cir same.nine of these circuits have added or left open the possibility that the exclusionary rule will still apply if there is an indication that the police violated the defendant fourth amendment rights with the intent to secure an increased sentence.ryan,at brimah,at kim,at,at jenkins,at tejada,at torres,at lynch,at mccrory,at.
these other circuits have carefully reasoned that,inter alia,the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule does not outweigh the detrimental effects of excluding reliable evidence on the court ability to meet its goal of proper sentencing,tejada,at concluding that allowing illegally obtained evidence to be considered at sentencing would not provide greater incentives for police to violate the fourth amendment lynch,at.they have also recognized that the sentencing court needs to have the fullest information available to fashion an appropriate remedy and that the sentencing guidelines allow the sentencing court to consider,without limitation,any information concerning the defendant background,character,or conduct,mccrory,at see also united states robins,cir noting that i t is a fundamental principle of sentencing that a district court may conduct an inquiry broad in scope,largely unlimited either as to the kind of information it may consider,or the source from which such information may come citing united states campbell.
while never having spoken directly on this issue,the supreme court has recognized the exclusionary rule as 
a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard fourth amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect,rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.despite its broad deterrent purpose,the exclusionary rule has never been interpreted to proscribe the use of illegally seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons.
united states calandra,d weighing the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule on police misconduct against the potential benefit of extending the rule to grand jury proceedings.
it is clear that in sentencing,consideration of evidence suppressed under the fourth amendment is consistent with the caselaw on the exclusionary rule and follows the practice of receiving evidence relevant to sentencing from a broad spectrum of sources.torres,at.given the great weight of the precedent and following the unanimous,reasoned approach of our sister circuits,we hold that the exclusionary rule does not bar the use of evidence seized in violation of a defendant fourth amendment rights in sentencing we leave open the question of whether the exclusionary rule would bar the use of evidence when police intentionally act in violation of the fourth amendment in order to increase a defendant sentence.therefore,the district court was not required to exclude the suppressed evidence in the context of sentencing in this case,even though it chose to do so in calculating the loss.this is not a case where the officers acted with intent to enhance acosta sentence.the district court found no such intent and neither side disputes this conclusion.determining that the district court could properly have considered the suppressed evidence in acosta sentencing proceedings,we next examine whether the restitution order was otherwise valid.
legal requirements of a restitution order 
the victim and witness protection act vwpa authorizes a district court to order in addition to or in lieu of any other penalty authorized by law,that the defendant make restitution to any victim of the offense.a.the purpose behind the statute is to insure that the wrongdoer make good,to the degree possible,the harm he has caused to the victim.vaknin,at citation and internal quotations omitted alteration in original.the supreme court has held that this statute limits restitution awards to the loss caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.hughey united states,d.in addition,where the criminal conduct includes an offense that involves as an element a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity,a victim is defined as any person directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,conspiracy,or pattern.a.in such cases,the district court may order restitution without regard to whether the conduct that harmed the victim was conduct underlying the offense of conviction,united states hensley,cir.
it is undisputed that restitution is part of a sentence.see,united states wallen,cir referring to restitution imposed by the court as part of the defendant sentence a a the court,when sentencing a defendant may order that the defendant make restitution emphasis added.thus,under the vwpa and hughey,the suppressed evidence in this case may be included in the restitution award only if the offense involved a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity or the evidence represents conduct that was the basis of the offense of conviction.we address each issue in turn.
scheme or conspiracy 
under a,any conduct that is in the course of the scheme,conspiracy,or pattern may be considered in calculating restitution.thus,if this case involved a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity,the district court could properly include the suppressed evidence in the restitution order regardless of whether it was conduct of conviction.
it is clear from the record that the offense with which acosta was charged was not one involving a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity.acosta pled guilty to knowingly and with intent to defraud traffic king in or us ing one or more unauthorized access devises during any period,and by such conduct obtain ing anything of value aggregating or more during that period.a.it is clear that this offense does not include as an element a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity.united states blake,cir stating that the offense of fraudulent use of unauthorized access devices in violation of a does not include as an element a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity.
conduct of conviction 
we now turn to the question of whether the suppressed credit cards represented conduct that was the basis of the offense of conviction.surprisingly,none of the proceedings below considered whether this evidence was conduct of conviction.rather,this evidence was treated as relevant conduct throughout the distinction between relevant conduct and conduct underlying the offense of conviction is an important one.unless the offense involves as an element a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity,relevant conduct may not be taken into account for calculation of restitution only conduct of conviction may be considered.united states benjamin,cir.nevertheless,the responsibility to bring this issue to the court attention rested with the defendant.because acosta failed to raise the issue below,he has forfeited it we therefore review the court use of the suppressed evidence in calculating restitution for plain error only.united states olano,d.establishing plain error requires a showing that there was error that it was plain that the error affected the defendant substantial rights and that the error adversely impacted the fairness,integrity,or public repute of judicial proceedings.united states saxena,cir.we see no plain error here.
acosta argues that in light of the references to the suppressed transactions as relevant conduct below,and the fact that the government proffer at the change of plea hearing included only the unsuppressed evidence,the evidence does not support the argument that the suppressed credit cards represented conduct of conviction.he further contends that because the district court declined to use the suppressed evidence in calculating the offense level as a due process matter because the violation of his rights was egregious,it should likewise not have used the evidence to calculate restitution 
the government counters that the district court could have found that the suppressed transactions were conduct underlying the offense to which acosta pled guilty.the indictment to which acosta pled guilty was very broad charging him with using and attempting to use one or more unauthorized access devices during a period and obtaining value of at least from this conduct.it specifically noted that this conduct included,but was not limited to,american express card number.the government points out that charging the use of more than one credit card to obtain the statutory jurisdictional amount of is common practice.
further,the government argues,acosta reliance on hughey,d,to contend that the loss associated with the suppressed evidence is not conduct of conviction,is misplaced.in hughey,the defendant pled guilty to one count of a indictment for using stolen credit cards.id.at.the supreme court reversed the district court restitution order because it had included the use of other credit cards to which the defendant had not pled guilty.i
