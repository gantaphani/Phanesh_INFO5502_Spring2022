background 
on november,moreno was indicted for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and one kilogram or more of heroin within feet of a public housing in violation of,and,and conspiring to unlawfully possess,use,or brandish a firearm in furtherance of or during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of c a and o.
moreno initially pled not guilty to the charged counts,but later moved to change his plea.on april,at a change of plea hearing,moreno pled guilty to both counts and filed a plea agreement.as filed with the magistrate judge,the plea agreement between moreno and the government stipulated to a total offense level of.this calculation stipulated that moreno was accountable for at least kilograms but less than kilograms of cocaine,yielding a base offense level of pursuant to.in addition,it reflected a level enhancement for possession of a firearm under b and a level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under.the agreement also stated that a safety valve reduction was inapplicable and assumed but did not stipulate to a criminal history category chc of taken together,these factors yielded a sentencing guidelines range of to months of imprisonment and a statutory maximum sentence of years imprisonment.ultimately,the agreement recommended months imprisonment and years of supervised release for moreno.
during the change of plea hearing,the presiding magistrate judge informed moreno that the submitted plea agreement,rendered pursuant to.c a b,was precatory in nature,that his sentence would ultimately be within the sound discretion of the sentencing judge,and that the sentencing court would not be able to determine the guideline sentence until moreno presentence investigation report psr was completed.the magistrate judge also explained to moreno that the sentencing court could impose a sentence as high as permitted by the statutory maximum and that moreno could not withdraw his guilty plea if this happened.moreno stated that he understood the rights he waived and expressed that he was satisfied with his attorney,rafael anglada anglada,whom moreno said had provided effective legal assistance.on april,the magistrate judge submitted a report recommending that the district court accept moreno guilty plea,an action the district court took on april.
although the proceedings relating to moreno were otherwise executed in fashion up to this point,a problematic oversight uncorrected by the magistrate judge,anglada,or the government is crucial to moreno appeal at the time moreno pled guilty,his plea agreement did not fully account for moreno potential sentence exposure.specifically,a level sentence enhancement under a relevant to moreno because the charged drug offense took place within one thousand feet of a housing facility owned by a public housing authority,a,and clearly applicable on the indictment terms was omitted from moreno plea agreement with the government.had this enhancement been factored into the agreement calculations,it would have shown the proper sentencing guideline range as to moreno to be to months imprisonment with a minimum supervised release term of years.
on may,anglada filed a motion to withdraw moreno guilty plea and withdraw his representation.the motion explained that moreno wished to withdraw his plea because he had learned from his brother,one of his,that the government evidence against him contained many lies.the motion further averred that moreno had not seen the entered plea agreement until the day of the hearing and that moreno no longer agreed with the agreement contents.the district court rejected anglada request to withdraw as counsel and denied the motion to withdraw moreno guilty plea,noting that moreno did not describe the alleged lies in the government evidence,that moreno had stated that he was satisfied with his representation during the change of plea hearing before the magistrate judge,and that,contrary to what his motion alleged,moreno remarks and admissions at the plea hearing undercut his claim that he was pressured to plead guilty.
on november,moreno psr was issued.unlike the plea agreement,the psr correctly calculated moreno sentencing exposure and included the level enhancement under a,assigning moreno a total offense level of instead of,and a sentencing guidelines range of to months imprisonment 
moreno sentencing hearing was then held on november.the government and moreno counsel objected to the psr inclusion of the protected location enhancement,explaining that the parties had not contemplated it in their plea negotiations the court overruled these objections,noting that the plea agreement stipulated facts and the indictment both explicitly referenced the fact that the charged offense had taken place in a housing project,a protected location.the district court also concluded that the objections were not preserved because they were either never filed or were untimely.the district court then sentenced moreno to months imprisonment,the minimum term within the range,for each charged offense,to be served concurrently,as well as years of supervised release for the first offense and years supervised release for the second offense,to be concurrently served.
moreno challenged the validity of his plea on direct appeal to this court,claiming that the factual predicate for his guilty plea was inadequate.moreno espada,slip op.at cir,unpublished opinion.on september,we rejected moreno claims along with those of two of his.in doing so,we explained that moreno and his failed to meet their burden of establishing that the flaws in the disclosure of their full sentencing exposure prejudiced their substantial rights.id.reviewing under a plain error standard because neither moreno nor his moved to withdraw their guilty pleas once their psrs revealed the flaws in their plea agreements,we held that the appellants could not establish a reasonable probability that the outcome of their cases would have been different in the absence of error.id.
undaunted,moreno subsequently filed the present claim to vacate,set aside,or correct his sentence under,now contending that anglada failure to consider the full effects of the charged offense on the sentence that the district court could impose constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.because anglada did not advise him that a guilty plea could result in a sentence within a range of to months imprisonment instead of the to months reflected in his plea agreement,moreno claimed that he did not understand the consequences of pleading guilty.in addition,moreno motion alleged that anglada failed to communicate to him that he had the right to withdraw his plea before sentencing if he believed he had a fair and just reason to do so,or risk bearing a greater burden on appeal to this court.see.d b united states delgado hernández,cir noting defendant claim subject only to plain error review on direct appeal where defendant failed to call the district court attention to the alleged errors in the plea proceedings see also united states mercedes mercedes,cir the barriers to withdrawal of a guilty plea become more formidable when the request is not made until after sentence has been imposed.
the district court denied moreno petition,dismissing it with prejudice on june.moreno espada united states,wl june.the district court concluded that even if deficient representation was assumed under the first prong of the ineffective assistance of counsel test prescribed by strickland washington,d,moreno still could not show that he was prejudiced by anglada performance,in large part because moreno was told during the plea colloquy that the district court was not bound by the parties plea agreement.this appeal followed.

under,a convict in federal custody may petition the sentencing court to vacate,set aside,or correct his sentence on the ground that the court had imposed the sentence in violation of federal law ellis united states,cir.on appeal,we review the district court legal determinations de novo and the court findings of fact for clear error.parsley united states,cir.
moreno alleges that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.this claim requires a court to first assess whether counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.padilla kentucky,d quoting strickland,at.second,we inquire whether there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.id.quoting strickland,at.in the guilty plea context,this means moreno has to demonstrate a reasonable probability that,but for counsel errors,he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.united states colón torres,cir quoting hill lockhart,d.
objectively reasonable performance by counsel 
the first inquiry is whether anglada performance fell below the objective standard of reasonableness that can be expected of proficient counsel.we have noted in the past that this assessment must be a fairly tolerant one because the constitution pledges to an accused an effective defense,not necessarily a perfect defense or a successful defense.scarpa dubois,cir.
we need not determine whether anglada conduct fell below this tolerant standard for performance.as we explain below,whether anglada conduct amounted to objectively unreasonable advocacy or not,moreno has failed to satisfy strickland prejudice requirement.see tevlin spencer,cir a defendant failure to satisfy one prong of the strickland analysis obviates the need for a court to consider the remaining prong.however,to the extent we find it necessary to comment on anglada performance,we note that if he has not fallen through,he may nonetheless still be positioned on the thinnest of ice.in failing to account for the level sentence enhancement that prescribes,anglada overlooked a weighty sentencing factor clearly applicable to his client on the express terms of the charging instrument.though we need not determine whether such an oversight rises to the level of objectively deficient performance under strickland,anglada advocacy for his client on this particular issue in sentencing certainly left much to be desired.
whether moreno was prejudiced by anglada performance 
we conclude that moreno has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by anglada conduct.in considering the merits of moreno claim under the second prong of strickland,we first note that anglada failure to properly calculate moreno sentence exposure,by itself,does not amount to prejudice see united states labonte,cir,on other grounds,d an attorney inaccurate prediction of his client probable sentence,standing alone,will not satisfy the prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance test.
moreno contends that anglada conduct prejudiced him in two ways.first,moreno claims that anglada oversight regarding the full extent of his sentence exposure denied him the opportunity of arguing at the district court that he sought to withdraw his guilty plea on the grounds that he was unaware of the consequences of pleading guilty.second,because a motion to withdraw a guilty plea brought before sentencing is reviewed under a more liberal standard than a motion filed after sentencing,united states laliberte,cir,moreno posits that anglada misadvise prejudiced him by making it more difficult to withdraw his guilty plea on direct appeal to this court.
moreno arguments are unavailing because they fail to establish that but for anglada conduct,moreno would have foregone a guilty plea and run the gauntlet of trial.see united states isom,cir a defendant must show that by counsel inadequate performance,appellant was induced to enter guilty pleas which he otherwise would not have entered.quoting united states austin,cir.moreno first attempt to withdraw his guilty plea before the psr showing his correct sentence exposure was issued,upon which he perfunctorily relies as evidence of his alleged intent to go to trial,does not settle the matter in his favor.after the district court denied this motion,the record shows that moreno was made aware of the fact that he actually faced a potentially harsher sentence and had repeated opportunity to again move to withdraw his guilty plea before the district court held its sentencing hearing each time,moreno opted not to do so and instead proceed to sentencing.most notably,at the sentencing hearing held on november,moreno acknowledged that he understood the psr and its contents which included the level enhancement the parties overlooked in their agreement and affirmed that he wished the district court to impose a sentence 
moreno unsupported assertions that he would have proceeded to trial if not for anglada allegedly inadequate assistance are similarly ineffectual,and we find that the district court did not err when it dismissed moreno petition based on the parties filings.a district court may dismiss a section petition without holding an evidentiary hearing if it plainly appears on the face of the pleadings that the petitioner is not entitled to the requested relief,or if the allegations consist of no more than conclusory prognostication and perfervid rhetoric labonte,at.moreno did not so much as file sworn statements or affidavits to support his contention that but for anglada conduct he would have sought trial,and has instead buttressed his case on groundless affirmations that evidence in the record bears out his claim of prejudice.we have rejected such bare averments in the past and do so again today,as such statement s unaccompanied by either a claim of innocence or the articulation of any plausible defense that could have been raised had a defendant opted for a trial,are insufficient to demonstrate the required prejudice under strickland id.at.
working within the four corners of moreno brief to this court,we also find statements that subvert moreno claim that he would have taken his chances at trial if he had been permitted to withdraw his guilty plea before sentencing.for example,noting that who pled after him received less severe sentences,moreno reasons that the record suggests that had trial counsel asked the court to withdraw the plea a better plea could have been renegotiated.further,claiming the government evidence against him was flimsy,moreno posits that if he had requested the withdrawal of the plea he could have received a more lenient sentence finally,moreno brief to this court attempts to clarify that references to the possibility of negotiating a more lenient sentence do not mean that moreno would have opted to go to trial,and that he will not do so,if given the chance.moreno was willing to go to trial,and will go to trial,unless a favorable agreement is reached.
these affirmations betray that what truly drives moreno appeal may be the fact that he received a more onerous sentence than the months imprisonment he was perhaps led to anticipate.the sentence of months imprisonment that the district court ultimately imposed,however,was always within the range of possible sentences moreno could receive under his plea agreement and was significantly less severe than the year statutory maximum to which moreno thought he exposed himself by pleading guilty.in any case,it is well settled that buyer remorse is not a valid basis on which to dissolve a plea agreement and the fact that a defendant finds himself faced with a stiffer sentence than he had anticipated is not a fair and just reason for abandoning a guilty plea.mercedes mercedes,at quoting united states torres rosa,cir see also miranda gonzález u
