in september,ronald goergen pled guilty to four counts of sexual exploitation of children,a.the charges were that over a period of several years,goergen arranged for and took still pictures and videos of three minor girls engaged in explicit sexual activities or poses and then distributed the material.georgen received a sentence of years in prison,and he now appeals to challenge only his sentence.the relevant background follows.
the government charged goergen in an information with four counts,three covering two videos and one image,each one depicting a different one of the three minors in a sexually explicit pose or activity the fourth count was based on a still image that,in the same manner,depicted two of the minor victims together.at the plea hearing,the government stated that images of the girls have featured in over a thousand investigations of child pornography worldwide.in september,goergen waived indictment and pled guilty to all counts without a plea agreement.
the report,prepared in november,described yet another video depicting one of the children engaged in oral sex with the defendant at his behest.the report also described numerous other images and a handful of videos depicting goergen extensive,continued sexual abuse of the three minor victims.the report,using the edition of the federal sentencing guidelines see note,below computed the total offense level,after applying required adjustments,as.at level or above,the recommended guideline sentence is life in prison regardless of criminal history.ch,pt.a,sentencing table.
goergen very high offense level reflected the facts that multiple children were abused over a significant period that two of the victims were under twelve years old that one video involved sadistic or masochistic conduct and that goergen distributed the images.the recommended guideline sentence of life imprisonment exceeded the statutory maximum of years,e,making years goergen maximum possible sentence,a.
at the sentencing hearing on january,goergen counsel urged a sentence of years the government,years.the district court,explaining its reasons in detail,sentenced goergen to years.as goergen was then age,he is likely to spend the rest of his life in prison.he now appeals,urging two points a claim under the ex post facto clause,art.i,cl,that an earlier,more lenient guideline edition should have been used,and a set of claims that the sentence is unreasonable in premises and result.
the ex post facto issue presents an issue of law reviewed de novo.united states neto,cir,cert.denied,d.goergen predicate is that the offense levels for counts,and,which contributed to the final offense level,were computed under the guidelines which were in turn made more severe by the protect act of the act,stat.the related guideline changes became effective on november.app.c,amend.
goergen then argues that his conduct under those three counts occurred prior to the act effective date of april,that the changes raised the base offense level for his crimes from to app.c,amend,at and that they added new enhancements,including a enhancement applied to count for material portraying sadistic or masochistic conduct.id.if the guidelines were employed,he says his adjusted offense level would have been only.
under the instructions provided in the guidelines themselves,the court must ordinarily use the guideline manual in effect at the time of sentencing,a,unless this would violate the ex post facto clause,in which event the manual in force on the date that the offense was committed is ordinarily used,b only one edition of the manual is to be used for all of the crimes,id.b the one book rule and where the defendant is convicted of multiple offenses,some before but one or more after a guidelines revision,the latter manual governs all of the offenses.id.b.
here,goergen concedes that his count offense took place in after the guidelines change.if the one book rule and multiple offense instructions prevail,the use of the guidelines was permissible for all counts.why the court used the guidelines rather than some other edition is unclear but goergen makes no issue as to that possibly the edition was the one closest to sentencing that raised no ex post facto issue 
in all events,goergen brief although opaque on this issue may be arguing that the guidelines instructions themselves particularly the one book and multiple offense rules violate the ex post facto clause insofar as they authorized use of level.but even assuming such an argument for using level could be considered by the panel in the teeth of contrary circuit precedent,united states silva,cir,any such mistake would be harmless error.united states gerhard,cir.
as goergen concedes,the difference between a total offense level of and is immaterial to the recommendation made by the guidelines it is a life sentence in either instance.in fact,because the guidelines sentencing table only goes up to offense level,the application notes go on to say emphasis supplied 
in rare cases,a total offense level of more than may result from application of the guidelines an offense level of more than is to be treated as an offense level of.
ch,pt.a,cmt.the offense level of and goergen preferred offense level of are both treated as an offense level of.
a colloquy between the judge and the probation officer at sentencing confirms that the judge focused on the life sentence recommendation and not the raw guideline number underpinning it.the probation officer noted that 
when you have a level,the highest level you can have in the book is a,so that what we use.it directs you to use that.but it is a total offense level of.
the court then responded emphasis supplied 
all right.criminal history category is i s o the guideline provisions yield a sentence of life.the statutory maximum for these offenses would be years.
this is not a case of a computational error leading to an incorrect sentencing range,see united states rodriguez,cir,nor is there any hint that the judge was influenced by the proposed level of rather than.most important,the district judge own detailed substantive explanation for choosing years as the sentence discussed below relies on factors independent of the offense level.
goergen next contends that his sentence was unreasonable because the district court improperly assessed his risk of recidivism.among the reasons given by the district court when it imposed the year sentence was the finding that 
the defendant is very much at risk for recidivism,and the likely potential victims of such recidivism would be underage females.
goergen claims that this finding was improper because the only record evidence on this issue was an expert evaluation concluding that he fell in a moderate risk category to reoffend.
ordinarily,review of factual determinations at sentencing is for clear error.united states rivera calderón,cir,cert.denied,d.where,as here,the defendant did not preserve any objection to the determination,our review is for plain error,united states gonzález castillo,cir,a more demanding standard.however,our conclusion would be the same in this case under the clear error test.
the expert evaluation identified factors suggesting a low risk of reoffense and other factors suggesting a high risk of reoffense.while the expert conclusion was that goergen presented a moderate risk,the district judge was entitled to make his judgment based on the report and the evidence before him as to goergen conduct.the report itself pointed to factors at both ends of the spectrum.the judge had authority to make his own evaluation that we may overturn only if persuaded that he was clearly wrong.
the risk of recidivism was just one of many reasons given by the district court for imposing the year sentence.it is highly unlikely that eliminating the very much from very much at risk for recidivism essentially,what goergen asks us to do would have changed the sentence imposed.however,given the length of the sentence,we do not rely on lack of prejudice but rather on the lack of any clear error in the district judge evaluation of the risk.
finally,goergen contends that the district court did not properly assess the totality of the
