in september,orlando carrero hernández carrero pled guilty in federal district court to two felony drug charges stemming from his involvement in a scheme to import large quantities of cocaine into puerto rico.on appeal,carrero raises two challenges to the sentence he received.first,carrero contends that the district court improperly imposed a sentencing enhancement to his base offense level based on the court finding that he recklessly endangered others during a flight from the police.second,he argues that the district court improperly imposed a enhancement based on its finding that he led or controlled others in the scheme.after considering the issues presented,we now affirm.
the facts are largely uncontested.in the early part of,carrero was involved in a plot to smuggle cocaine into puerto rico.on january,carrero met with richard avilés abdul avilés,an undercover puerto rico police officer posing as a not entirely upstanding boat captain.the meeting was arranged by a criminal informant named david quesón,el gordo.at the meeting,carrero sought avilés aid in importing a large discussions were for six hundred cocaine from the dominican republic.carrero offered avilés to retrieve the cocaine from a dominican ship at a meeting point located some miles out in open water during this meeting,carrero and avilés discussed logistics for the transfer,as well as avilés compensation.in addition,carrero told avilés that he had used the same offloading point to import previous drug shipments,that he did not hire young boys,that one of his other boat captains could not work on account of a hand injury,and that as long as avilés deal t well with him,he would guarantee him work for a long time.the following day,carrero advised avilés that they had reduced the shipment to three hundred kilograms,but according to carrero presentence report psr that there were two thousand kilograms of cocaine waiting to be brought over from the dominican republic in subsequent trips,presumably if the initial run was successful.in light of the reduced size of the shipment,the two agreed to reduce avilés compensation to.
a few days later,carrero informed avilés that the transfer was scheduled to occur the following day,and arranged for el gordo to deliver to avilés to cover the cost of fuel for the trip.the next day,however,carrero had to inform avilés that the transfer had to be called off because the ship from the dominican republic had been unable to secure the necessary permits.carrero agreed to pay avilés for his troubles,and they arranged to meet with el gordo and carrero associate and eventual,joaquín lassalle velázquez lassalle later that day.at the meeting,lassalle paid avilés the.
shortly thereafter,on january,lassalle phoned avilés to tell him that the permit problem had been resolved,and that the was scheduled for january.later that day,avilés met with lassalle in person to receive the precise coordinates and code word for the transfer.avilés,accompanied by law enforcement officers,traveled to the exchange point at the designated time,but the dominican ship never arrived and avilés returned.after some back and forth,carrero agreed to reimburse avilés for his expenses,including damage sustained by the boat.lassalle paid avilés the at a meeting on january.when avilés complained about the amount,lassalle responded that he could not pay avilés more than because he needed to pay the boys,and that the costs of the delayed shipment would come out of his own profits,whereas for avilés the profit is solid.lassalle further indicated that his employees were not paid if they returned,and that he had recently fired one of his employees for failing to count the kilos after receiving the transfer.
avilés met again with el gordo,lassalle and carrero two days later.at this meeting,lassalle once again gave avilés the coordinates for the,now scheduled for later that evening,and carrero paid avilés for his anticipated fuel costs.this time the dominican ship arrived and,after avilés pronounced the code word,its four crew members loaded nine bales of cocaine onto avilés boat.an aircraft from the air and marine unit of united states customs and border protection was following the transaction and obtained photographs and video of the events,and vectored the coordinates to a united states coast guard cutter.after leaving the rendezvous point,the coast guard cutter intercepted the dominican vessel,arrested its four crew members and seized several items,including a handgun and ammunition.
meanwhile,avilés headed back to puerto rico,stopping en route to exchange the real cocaine for a fake substitute.as he neared the coast,avilés phoned carrero to ask if he was ready to take delivery of the cocaine.carrero indicated that both he and lassalle were present at the offload site.police surveillance at the offload site detected the presence of six individuals.just as the offloading was set to begin,the police sprung the trap and moved in to make arrests.unfortunately,however,things did not go according to plan and a shootout ensued.lassalle beat a hasty retreat in his red pickup truck,firing parting shots at the police as he fled.both he and carrero managed to evade capture that evening.arrest warrants were issued,and a search began.
early in the evening of january a few days after the failed was spotted driving around aguadilla.the police,including avilés,took up the pursuit.once carrero realized he was being pursued,he quickly accelerated,reaching speeds later estimated by avilés of around forty to miles per hour.carrero was at this point driving on small back roads in the early evening,in a residential neighborhood in which one could assume that people might be out and about.carrero did not stop or slow at intersections.after hitting a dead end,carrero abandoned the truck and fled on foot through the woods.the police followed suit,and one police officer fell and injured his chin in the process.carrero again managed to evade arrest,and was not finally run to ground until some two months later.carrero was ultimately arrested without incident on april.
at sentencing,avilés testified that carrero was driving too fast for the area,that the pursuit went over a large hill with obstructed sight lines,and that the police lost him because it would have been pretty irresponsible for them to pursue him at the speed he was driving.when asked whether pedestrians were present during the chase,avilés replied t his happened very fast.i can tell you that after he left,abandoned the vehicle the area got full of kids,of females,males,everything,everybody.
carrero and lassalle,along with four,were charged with two felony drug counts,and a joint trial began on september,carrero and lassalle entered straight guilty pleas prior to the trial conclusion,and the four remaining were convicted.
carrero psr recommended the two sentence enhancements that are the subject of this appeal.the first was a enhancement for reckless endangerment during flight,pursuant to united states sentencing guidelines manual,relating specifically to carrero flight from the police on the evening of january.second,the psr recommended a enhancement on account of his role in the offense pursuant to a.carrero objected to both sentencing enhancements.at sentencing,the district court entertained testimony and arguments on both issues.the court overruled both of carrero objections the court then sentenced carrero to months imprisonment and a term of supervised release.judgment was entered on february,and carrero appealed that same day.
carrero claims the district court made two mistakes in sentencing him.the first,he claims,is that the district court should not have increased his base offense level by two steps,pursuant to,on account of his flight from the police.
section provides that 
if the defendant recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer,increase by levels.
recklessness requires that the defendant was aware of the risk created by his conduct and the risk was of such a nature and degree that to disregard that risk constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in such a situation,cmt.see id,cmt.
as we have previously noted,the sentencing commission promulgated in order to adopt the view that mere flight from arrest was not sufficient for an adjustment,but that flight plus endangerment was enough.united states bell,cir.the question is what level of endangerment is called for.
carrero contends that his conduct driving miles per hour in a residential neighborhood was not nearly so dangerous as other enhancement cases.he further points out that avilés conceded that the chase was brief,and that the street filled with people after carrero had abandoned the truck,presumably implying that the streets were quiet during the chase itself.therefore,carrero urges,his flight did not create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury,and it was error to apply the enhancement.
we review a district court interpretation of the legal meaning and scope of a sentencing guideline de novo.united states thompson,cir.however,we review the court factfinding for clear error,giving due deference to the court application of the guidelines to the facts.id.
it is true that cases often involve rather more egregious conduct.see united states cruz,cir affirming a enhancement because the defendant led police officers on a chase,rammed several police vehicles,drove onto the sidewalk and crashed his vehicle united states alicea,cir affirming enhancement involving similar conduct as in cruz,with the additional excitement of gunshots fired at the pursuing officers.we have not held,however,that such wildly dangerous conduct is the minimum required under.
other courts have concluded that less egregious,though still reckless,conduct can indeed qualify under.for instance,united states fernandez,d,involved very similar facts to the present case.the court there imposed a enhancement after the defendant led the police on a mile chase that did not greatly exceed the posted speed limit,reached a dead end and then,for reasons that are not immediately apparent from the record,abandoned his vehicle,climbed an embankment and jumped into lake michigan,from which he later had to be retrieved by a k unit.id.in united states luna,cir,the ninth circuit upheld a enhancement after the defendant led the police on a short car chase and then fled on foot,abandoning the car in a residential area with the engine running finally,in united states chandler,cir,the seventh circuit upheld a enhancement after a car chase that passed through a residential neighborhood at dusk,and during which the defendant traveled at speeds that ranged from to fifty miles per hour while swerving from lane to lane to prevent the police from going around him.id.at.the court noted that this conduct might very well have resulted in injury to others.id.
returning to the facts of the present case,it is surely relevant that the chase,even if brief and not conducted at stupendously high speeds,occurred on small back roads in a heavily populated area during the early evening.the record indicates that the streets along which carrero was driving were lined with houses,and that carrero took several turns at a high rate of speed.indeed,avilés testified that the pursuing officers had to basically stop at those corners to make sure that they themselves did not cause injury,and that continuing the chase at the speed carrero was going would have been pretty irresponsible.avilés further testified that carrero led the pursuing officers over a large hill,and that when you more or less in the middle of the hill,you ca see absolutely nothing what in the other side.absolutely nothing.under these conditions,the risk of serious injury or death could hardly have been more obvious.as the district court recognized,carrero driving created a high likelihood of collision with pedestrians oncoming traffic,with what could very well have been disastrous results.in imposing the enhancement,the court noted that although the chase c ould have been a lot worse,still carrero could have killed somebody with a car.the agents could have killed some pedestrian with a car.and other things could have happened,a crash,god knows what.we agree 
carrero also contends that the district court erred in imposing,pursuant to a,a enhancement based on its finding that he was a leader or organizer in the drug running scheme.
section a of the guidelines authorizes increasing a defendant offense level i f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.government agents and criminal informants are not participants under the guideline,cmt.see also united states ramos paulino,cir.enhancement under a requires a district court to make a status determination,that the defendant acted as an organizer or leader of the criminal activity,as well as a scope determination,that the criminal activity met either the numerosity or the extensiveness benchmarks established by the guideline.united states tejada beltrán,cir.here,carrero has not contested the scope requirement,and so the only question before us is status.
in order to meet a status requirement,the defendant must have either organized or led at least one other participant in the offense.a,cmt.as we have noted on an earlier occasion,
section does not apply to a defendant who merely organizes or supervises criminal activity that is executed without the aid of others.instead,the defendant must have exercised some degree of control over others involved in the commission of the offense or he must have been responsible for organizing others for the purpose of carrying out the crime.
united states fuller,cir.while a defendant may be classified as an organizer,though perhaps not as a leader,if he coordinates others so as to facilitate the commission of criminal activity,tejada beltrán,at,our cases distinguish between organizing criminal activities and organizing criminal actors only the latter may be used to ground an enhancement under a.see united states jones,cir i t is not enough that the defendant merely controlled,organized,or managed criminal activities he must instead control,organize,or manage criminal actors.see also united states cruz,cir en banc noting that upward adjustment under c requires a finding that the defendant,in committing the offense,exercised control over,organized,or was otherwise responsible for superintending the activities of,at least one of those other persons emphasis added.
carrero maintains that the evidence did not establish that he exercised control over any of the other participants,that his role was rather limited to coordination of activities,and that lassalle was actually the leader of the organization.carrero insists that his role was only to recruit boat captains to pick up the drugs.although carrero clearly exercised supervisory authority over avilés he recruited him into the venture,negotiated his cut,paid his expenses,and told him where and when to make the pick notes,correctly,that neither avilés nor el gordo can be considered participants under a,as the former was a government agent and the latter a criminal informant.as for the other participants in the scheme,carrero insists that a the dominican crew members were supervised by the sender in the dominican republic,not carrero and b the offload crew in puerto rico was under lassalle control,as according to carrero,lassalle was the one who actually owned the drugs and made those staffing decisions.carrero concedes that he played an important role in the conspiracy insofar as his role was to make contacts and provide information and coordinates,but argues that this role constitutes organization of the scheme activities,not of its bona fide participants.
at sentencing,the burden is on the government to show that an upward adjustment is appropriate by a preponderance of the evidence.united states al rikabi,cir.we have cautioned that a ssessing a defendant role in the offense is a task,requiring that considerable respect be paid to the views of the nisi prius court.tejada beltrán,at citing united states mcd
