after accepting his guilty plea,the district court sentenced angel ocasio cancel to serve months in prison.in his ensuing appeal,the defendant asseverates that his guilty plea was neither voluntary nor knowing and,in any event,the district court sentencing methodology was flawed.after careful consideration of this asseverational array,we affirm both the defendant conviction and his sentence.
because this appeal follows a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the plea agreement,the colloquy,the unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report psi report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states calderón pacheco,cir united states dietz,cir.
in july of,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico charged a multitude of persons including the defendant with participation in a widespread conspiracy.the government alleged that,as part of the charged conspiracy,the defendant acted as a seller and distributed narcotics at sundry drug points within public housing projects.
shortly before his scheduled trial,the defendant opted to plead guilty to the conspiracy charge.see a.the government and the defendant executed a nonbinding plea agreement.see.c a b.the district court accepted the change of plea and ordered the preparation of a psi report.
the guideline calculation,incorporated in the plea agreement and reiterated in the psi report,started with a stipulated base offense level added two levels for proximity to a protected location,see ussg a subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility,see ussg and settled upon a total offense level of.the plea agreement was silent as to the defendant criminal history category chc.filling this void,the psi report noted that in a puerto rico court had sentenced the defendant to four years of probation for violations of the controlled substances act of puerto rico,see laws ann.tit,and that in the court had revoked his probation and sentenced him to serve a term of imprisonment.based on this information and the fact that the defendant had committed the offense of conviction while on escape status,the psi report recommended placing the defendant in chc iii.the defendant total offense level,combined with his chc,yielded a guideline sentencing range gsr of months.
at the disposition hearing,the guideline calculations limned in the psi report went unchallenged.in mitigation,defense counsel urged the district court to take into account the fact that the defendant was already facing a sentence in the local courts.the district court nonetheless imposed a sentence months to run consecutively to the undischarged local sentence.this timely appeal followed.
to begin,we think it appropriate to remark that the plea agreement contained a provision,which stated in pertinent part that if the district court accepts this agreement and sentences the defendant according to its terms,conditions,and recommendations,the defendant waives and surrenders the right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.at the disposition hearing,the district court referred to this provision and suggested that it operated to limit any appeal to the correctness of the exercise of my discretion to sentence the defendant to the higher end of the guidelines.we do not agree.
the plea agreement states that if the district court placed the defendant in chc i,ii,or iii,he could request a sentence of imprisonment at the lower end of the applicable guideline range and in that event,the government would request a sentence of imprisonment of months.the district court placed the defendant in chc iii,but nonetheless eschewed the month sentencing recommendation and imposed a stiffer sentence.
plea agreements should be given their plain meaning.under the unambiguous language of the plea agreement in this case,the district court rejection of the sentencing recommendation vitiated the provision in its entirety.see united states murphy cordero,cir.consequently,that provision does not operate to circumscribe the defendant appellate rights in any way.see id.
with this preface,we turn to the defendant flagship contention that the district court failure to advise him that his federal sentence would run consecutively to his undischarged local sentence renders his guilty plea invalid.this omission,he says,denotes that his plea was neither knowing nor voluntary because had he been aware that the court intended to impose a consecutive sentence,he may have insisted on proceeding to trial.appellant br.at.
this contention is raised for the first time on appeal.accordingly,our review is for plain error.see united states vonn,united states ramos mejía,cir,slip op.at.plain error is a redoubtable standard of review to surmount it a defendant must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.
it would serve no useful purpose to do a plain error analysis here.after all,it is clear beyond any hope of contradiction that the defendant must,at a bare minimum,show a reasonable probability that but for some error,he would not have pleaded guilty.see united states davila,united states dominguez benitez.there was no error here.
a defendant guilty plea must be voluntary,knowing,and intelligent.see ramos mejía,at slip op.at united states negrón narváez,cir.this means that a defendant must be informed of the direct consequences of his plea.see brady united states.nevertheless,a defendant need not be informed of all the collateral consequences of a guilty plea.see steele murphy,cir.in this setting,the distinction between a direct consequence and a collateral consequence turns on whether the consequence represents a definite,immediate,and largely automatic effect on the range of a defendant punishment.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
before us,the defendant concedes as he must that the decision about whether to impose a concurrent or consecutive sentence normally lies within the district court discretion see a explaining that if a term of imprisonment is imposed on a defendant who is already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment,the terms may run concurrently or consecutively see also united states carrasco de jesús,cir.this discretion is broad and,at the time of the plea,it was anybody guess whether the district court would opt to impose the sentence concurrently or consecutively.because a consecutive sentence was neither automatic nor definite in the circumstances of this case,it was not a direct consequence of the defendant guilty plea.therefore,the district court had no obligation to inform the defendant,at the hearing,about the possibility that a consecutive sentence might be imposed.see united states hernandez,cir.
in an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,the defendant asserts that the district court was laboring under the mistaken impression that it had no choice but to impose a consecutive sentence.building on this foundation,the defendant argues that the consecutive sentence was a direct consequence of his guilty plea.but as we explain below,the record is pellucid that the district court did not labor under any such misimpression.thus,we need not grapple with the theoretical possibility that a sentencing court mistaken belief in the inevitability of a consecutive sentence suffices to transmogrify a collateral consequence into a direct consequence.
at the disposition hearing,defense counsel urged the court to take into account the fact that the undischarged local sentence arose out of the operations of the same conspiracy that was charged in the federal case.the court flatly rejected this exhortation,observing that t hese are different cases in different jurisdictions.the court went on to explain that it would not impose a concurrent sentence because the undischarged local sentence involved a different crime.this explanation indicates to us that the district court imposed a consecutive sentence because it viewed such a sentence as warranted not because it thought that it had no other choice.
