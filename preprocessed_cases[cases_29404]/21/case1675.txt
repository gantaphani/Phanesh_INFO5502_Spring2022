on petition for rehearing 
for the reasons stated below,joseph martin petition for rehearing is denied.
martin argues that we could not find probable cause because the redacted affidavit contains no particularized information regarding whether martin,or the account registered to his home,possessed child pornography,as required by ybarra illinois,d,and it is error to conclude that the primary purpose of the was to trade child pornography because the site also supported the exchange of textual messages and therefore allowed its members to engage in protected speech.upon review,we adhere to our view that probable cause existed because there was a fair probability that contraband or evidence,fruits,or instrumentalities of a crime would be found at martin residence.
after we announced our decision in this case,another panel of this united states coreas,cir addressed the validity of a related search warrant,which was also executed in connection with operation candyman.the coreas panel,however,was presented with the separate question whether the redacted affidavit was sufficient to support a showing of probable cause where the defendant was a member of the candyman,not the.and the coreas panel review was limited to those features associated with the candyman site,including its far less descriptive title and welcome message 
the coreas panel recognized these distinctions 
arguably,martin might be distinguished from the instant case on the ground that the defendant there had joined a different group.even a visitor,according to the martin majority,would have instantly recognized the unlawful nature of,since its welcome message,longer and more detailed than candyman,unabashedly announced that its essential purpose was to trade child pornography.
coreas,at.nonetheless,the coreas panel determined that this panel did not regard such distinctions as decisive because we noted,in a separate part of our opinion,that the internal operational characteristics of the two sites were indistinct.id.the coreas panel concluded that we viewed the differences between the websites as immaterial and regarded the candyman welcome message as explicit enough to warrant an inference of unlawful purpose.id.based in part on this perception of our holding,the coreas panel held that the martin decision compelled it to uphold the denial of suppression of the evidence of activity on the candyman site.id.at.
although the candyman welcome message was not before this panel,we need to clarify that we do not view the differences between the two welcome messages as immaterial.to the contrary,the welcome message was an integral component of our probable cause determination.
as we explained in our prior decision,the probable cause standard simply requires a practical,decision whether,given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before the magistrate,there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular case.illinois gates,d.two interrelated points,however,are worth emphasizing.first,probable cause only requires the probability,and not a prima facie showing,of criminal activity.id.at.quoting spinelli united states,d.second,o nce it is established that probable cause exists to believe a federal crime has been committed a warrant may issue for the search of any property which the magistrate has probable cause to believe may be the place of concealment of evidence of the crime.zurcher stanford daily,d alteration in the original emphasis added quoting united states mfrs.bank of detroit,cir.thus,it is untenable to conclude that property may not be searched unless its occupant is reasonably suspected of a crime and is subject to arrest.id.at.rather,valid warrants to search property may be issued when it is satisfactorily demonstrated to the magistrate that fruits,instrumentalities,or evidence of crime is located on the premises.id.
with these standards in mind,we turn to the two principal arguments advanced by martin in his petition for rehearing first,that because the supported lawful functions,we could not conclude that the group primary purpose was to facilitate the trade of child pornography and second,that the redacted affidavit can not support a finding of probable cause because it contains no particularized information regarding whether martin,or the account registered to his home,possessed child pornography.
as our earlier decision held,we have no difficulty concluding from the redacted affidavit that the primary purpose of the was to facilitate the generation,inventory,and exchange of child pornography.the redacted affidavit states that individuals that sought membership in the were presented with the name of the group and its detailed welcome message,which unabashedly announced that the group essential purpose was to trade child pornography,and that the members were actively uploading and downloading child pornography on the site and exchanging with illicit attachments.
the fact that this technology could also have been put to innocent or protected uses does not alter our conclusion.thus,the fact that the majority of exchanged on the site was only textual does not diminish the fact that a significant quantity of contained of child pornography,and that hundreds of picture and were readily available for download on the site.united states fama,cir the fact that an innocent explanation may be consistent with the facts alleged,however,does not negate probable cause.
in any event,we can not accept that the level of wholly textual somehow suggests that the group website was being used for predominantly lawful,or even protected,activities.all text is not protected by the first amendment.that helps others meet,chat up,and sexually exploit children is not protected speech.and the first amendment offers no protection to those that use to promote the exchange of child pornography in violation of the statute at issue in this case.b proscribing attempt and conspiracy.moreover,the redacted affidavit and record before us on this appeal establish that the vast majority of textual messages sent to the members of the were generated automatically each time a new file was uploaded onto the site.the purpose of this function was straightforward it was to inform members of the name of the file,the date and the time that the file was posted,the location of the file on the web site,and the address of the individual who posted it.berglas aff.at.far from suggesting a robust forum for protected speech,these alerted members to new child pornography available for download and are themselves powerful evidence of criminal activity.a prohibiting the reproduction of child pornography for distribution by computer.
we also have no difficulty concluding that the activity of subscribing to the,after being prompted by its name and welcome message,and adhering to membership despite the site contents,was sufficient to support a finding of probable cause.in reaching such a finding,we need not conclude that there was probable cause to arrest martin we need only conclude that there was a fair probability that the premises to be searched contained contraband or evidence,fruits,or instrumentalities of a crime.zurcher,at.
in this case,the redacted affidavit established that individuals that sought membership in the were presented with the name of the group and its detailed welcome message that members of the were actively uploading and downloading child pornography on the site and exchanging with illicit attachments and that a large majority of the was generated automatically as a means to inform members that new child pornography had been uploaded onto the site.finally,the affidavit stated that an address associated with martin household was enlisted and remained on the membership rolls until the group was suspended by.from these statements,a reasonable magistrate could conclude that there was a fair probability that contraband or evidence,fruits,or instrumentalities of a crime would be found at the premises where a computer was used to access the site.
the facts in martin are analogous to joining a collective organization that may happen to include members who advocate for t
