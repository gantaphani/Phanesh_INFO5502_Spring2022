rafat zakhary was convicted in the eastern district of new york sterling johnson,judge of one count of conspiracy to traffic in unauthorized access,credit violation of b.in now appealing his november,judgment of conviction,zakhary does not dispute his guilt,nor does he challenge the validity of his guilty plea or the court sentence of one year and one day incarceration,two years supervised release,and a special assessment.zakhary single appellate challenge is to that part of the judgment of conviction ordering him to pay in restitution zakhary argues that the restitution order is invalid because it was not based on a determination of each identifiable victim losses,as required by c b and f a.the government concedes error on this point and consents to our vacating that part of the judgment and remanding the case for resentencing as to restitution.
where the parties sharply differ is on the appropriate scope of the remand.relying on d,which requires identifiable victims losses to be determined no later than ninety days after sentencing,zakhary argues that this time bar precludes the district court from now identifying further victims or their losses.he submits that restitution must be limited on remand to the only identified victim loss determined within the statutory period a fraudulent charge paid by providian national bank.mindful that this court has previously held that a failure to determine losses within the d time period will be deemed harmless error unless a defendant can show actual prejudice from the delay,see united states stevens,cir accord united states catoggio,cir,cert.denied,d,zakhary urges us to limit this rule to cases where the defendant contributes or consents to the delay.we decline this invitation and hold that a presumption of harmlessness applies to any error in the timely identification of victims losses.because zakhary has not demonstrated prejudice from the error in his case,we remand for resentencing on restitution without imposing the requested limit on the district court ability to determine each identifiable victim losses and to order full restitution as required by law.
background 
a.the crime of conviction 
rafat zakhary was named,together with twelve other persons,in a indictment charging conspiracy to commit credit card fraud in violation of b.in furtherance of the conspiracy,various individuals supplied their credit cards and personal histories to brokers,who used the information to obtain additional credit cards.the brokers then brought the new credit cards to corrupt merchants who processed fraudulent charges on the accounts.after receiving payment for these charges,the merchants shared a percentage of their illicit receipts with the brokers,who,in turn,provided a portion of the payment to the original credit card holders.
zakhary participated in the scheme both as a supplier of credit cards and as a broker of other persons cards.further,zakhary permitted another broker in the scheme to process fraudulent charges on a credit card terminal registered in the name of his wife manicure business.the indictment attributed a single overt act to zakhary his december,use of a credit card in queens,new york,to incur a fraudulent charge of on a visa card issued by providian national bank.
on april,zakhary pleaded guilty to the indictment.both the prosecution,in the plea agreement,and the district court,at allocution,advised zakhary that at sentence he could be ordered to pay restitution to victims of the conspiracy.apparently,it was never contemplated that zakhary would be obligated to make restitution for the total loss caused by the conspiracy.rather,the district court would determine the losses fairly attributable to zakhary own criminal conduct.
in allocuting to his guilt,zakhary admitted that his activities had likely caused in losses,and that his personal share of the scheme profits was approximately.
b.the restitution order 
in its initial report psr to the district court,the probation department probation reported that a government agent had roughly estimated zakhary conduct to have caused to in victims losses.both in calculating zakhary guideline sentencing range and in recommending a restitution amount,probation relied on the lower figure,which was closer to zakhary own loss estimate at his plea allocution.probation advised the district court that an order of restitution was mandated in zakhary case by,but that no more specific accounting of victims losses was then possible because the government had failed to provide victim contact information.
in written objections to the psr,zakhary challenged,inter alia,the restitution recommendation because of the absence of the complete accounting of the losses to each victim provided for in a,including an accounting as to whether victims had been reimbursed for losses by their insurers.in its responsive psr addendum,probation maintained that zakhary was accountable for in restitution,although it acknowledged that the only specifically identified victim loss to date was the fraudulent charge paid by providian national bank.
when zakhary appeared for sentencing on november,the government reported that it had recalculated the loss attributable to him and determined the amount to be.defense counsel did not dispute this lower figure,but continued to object to any order of restitution in the absence of an accounting of specific victims losses.the government responded that the victims of zakhary fraud were credit card companies,which it insisted had been identified.without further findings,the district court ordered zakhary to pay in restitution to the eastern district clerk of court,such payment to be made at the rate of per month when zakhary began his term of supervised release.
the question of restitution arose again on november,when the parties appeared before the district court for a correction in the sentence term of supervised release.defense counsel reiterated his argument that the government had not identified the specific credit card companies that had sustained losses from transactions engaged in by zakhary.the government responded that if it was mistaken in its understanding that a list of victims losses had been provided to probation,it would supply the necessary information.upon confirming that the defense did not dispute the total loss figure of,the district court adhered to its original restitution order,modifying it only to permit repayment at the rate of of zakhary gross income rather than a fixed per month.
the government now concedes that it did not supply probation or the district court with a list of victims losses attributable to zakhary either before november,or ninety days thereafter.at oral argument before this court,it suggested that it could do so on remand.indeed,government counsel observed that the identifiable losses presently attributable to zakhary might be as high as.
ii.discussion 
mandatory restitution to identified victims
