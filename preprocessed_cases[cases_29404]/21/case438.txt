following resentencing,josé garcía ortiz challenges his conviction and sentence on one of three counts of conviction on the ground that the challenged conviction and sentence violate the double jeopardy clause.he simultaneously challenges his sentence on another count as unreasonably high,castigating the district court for denying him a mitigating role adjustment.in a pro se supplementary brief,he augments this asseverational array by challenging both the legitimacy of his conviction and the sentencing court failure to reduce his sentence based on rehabilitation.after careful consideration,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for resentencing.
the background facts,taken in a light consistent with the jury verdict,are easily catalogued.those who hunger for more exegetic detail should consult our earlier opinion in this case.see united states garcía ortiz,cir.
on december,the defendant and several confederates assaulted and robbed two employees of a food warehouse in puerto rico.in an ensuing gunfight,one of the robbers was killed and the defendant himself was wounded.later the same day,local police officers recovered the car that had been used by the robbers.through dna analysis,the federal bureau of investigation identified blood found inside the car as the defendant blood.
presented with these facts and other evidence,a federal grand jury indicted the defendant.the operative charging document,a superseding indictment handed up on september,contained three counts.count charged the defendant with hobbs act robbery,see a count charged him with aiding and abetting the unlawful carrying and use of a firearm during and in relation to the robbery,see id.c a and count charged him with aiding and abetting the death of an accomplice in the commission of an armed robbery,see id.j.the defendant maintained his innocence,but a trial jury convicted him on all three counts.
the district court originally sentenced the defendant on may,the details of that sentence are irrelevant here.on appeal,we upheld the convictions but vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing.see garcía ortiz,at.
once the case had been returned to the district court,the defendant filed a sentencing memorandum urging,among other things,downward adjustments for his mitigating role and his rehabilitation.he later filed a supplementary memorandum,arguing that the offense charged in count was a lesser included offense of that charged in count and that,therefore,sentencing him independently on count transgressed the double jeopardy clause.
at a resentencing hearing held on august,the district court rejected the defendant lesser included offense argument,his request for a mitigating role adjustment,and his request for a reduced sentence based on rehabilitation.the court did,however,grant a reduction of the base offense level from to,concluding that a base offense level of would be too severe in the absence of any evidence that the defendant intended to kill his accomplice.when all was said and done,the court imposed a month incarcerative sentence on count,a concurrent month sentence on count,and a consecutive sentence on count the court repeatedly stated that,in imposing the sentence,it had evaluated the factors enumerated in a.
this timely appeal followed.the defendant claims of error are fourfold.in his counselled brief,he renews his double jeopardy and mitigating role arguments.then,in his supplementary pro se brief,he attempts to attack his conviction frontally and to reassert his claim of rehabilitation we deal with these claims of error sequentially.
the defendant principal plaint is that his conviction and sentence on count violate the double jeopardy clause,const.amend.v,because his conviction on that count is for a lesser included offense of the crime for which he stands convicted under count.we review this claim de novo.see united states gerhard,cir united states decologero,cir.
w henever a defendant is tried for greater and lesser offenses in the same proceeding neither legislatures nor courts have found it necessary to impose multiple convictions rutledge united states.even so,n ot all multiple punishments run afoul of the double jeopardy clause.united states henry,cir.congress may authorize punishment under two separate statutes,even if those two statutes proscribe the same conduct.missouri hunter,albernaz united states,whalen united states.
here,the elements of section c,collectively,are elements of section j that is,a conviction under section j necessarily includes a finding that the defendant violated section c.see j.the only meaningful difference is that section j requires proof of one additional fact the death.accordingly,section c is a lesser included offense of section j.see united states flores,cir.the government now concedes as much,and the case law amply supports this concession.see,united states catalán roman,cir united states jiménez torres,cir.
the analysis,however,does not end there.although traditionally legislatures have not authorized cumulative punishment for lesser included offenses,see rutledge,at,there is no direct bar against such legislation.see albernaz,at in determining the permissibility of the imposition of cumulative punishment for the crime of rape and the crime of unintentional killing in the course of rape,the court recognized that the dispositive question was whether congress intended to authorize separate punishment for the two crimes.quoting whalen,at.in other words,congress could have authorized cumulative punishments for convictions under sections c and j had it chosen to do so.see hunter,at.but the plain language of section j indicates no such desire.it follows that,in line with the principles limned in rutledge,the conviction and sentence on count must be annulled.see rutledge,at adhering to the presumption that congress intends to authorize only one punishment when a defendant is convicted under two different statutes that proscribe the same conduct see also whalen,at noting that without a clear indication that congress intended cumulative punishments for the same offense under two different statutes,courts must presume that congress authorized only one punishment.
we turn next to the defendant contention that the sentencing court should have awarded him a reduction in his offense level for his minor role in the offenses of conviction.under the applicable guideline provision,a sentencing court may reduce a defendant total offense level by two levels and thus lower his guideline sentencing range if it finds that the defendant played a minor role in the offense of conviction.ussg b.a request for a minor role adjustment is addressed to the sound judgment of the sentencing court,and a defendant who seeks that balm bears the burden of proving his entitlement to it by a preponderance of the evidence.united states vargas,cir.the essential predicate is a showing that the defendant is both less culpable than his confederates or,at least,most of them and less culpable than the of those who have committed similar crimes.united states ocasio,cir.
recognizing,as we do,that the determination of a defendant role is factbound,we review a district court resolution of the facts relative to a minor role adjustment for clear error,applications of law to those raw facts somewhat less deferentially,and purely legal questions de novo.united states quiñones medina,cir.absent an error of law and we discern none here the battle over a defendant role in the offense will almost always be won or lost in the district court.united states graciani,cir.
in this instance,the lower court concluded that the defendant had not demonstrated an entitlement to a mitigating role adjustment.in the court view,the defendant was a direct participant in the robbery and,as such,did not satisfy either prong of the test.the proof of the defendant direct participation in the robbery and gunfight was quite strong the jury verdict,affirmed on appeal,see garcía ortiz,at,conduces to that view and the inference drawn by the district court seems eminently reasonable.see,quiñones medina,at upholding denial of mitigating role adjustment where facts demonstrated defendant
