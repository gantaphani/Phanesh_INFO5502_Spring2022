appellant tennyson marceau pled guilty to stealing guns from a maine firearms dealer.the district court imposed the statutory maximum prison sentence of ten years.on appeal,marceau claims that his sentence is unreasonable,especially when compared to the sentence imposed on his partner in the crime.he also argues that the district court made certain errors and that two of the guideline provisions applied to him were improperly enacted.we affirm.
background 
in the early morning hours of april,police officers in brewer,maine responded to an alarm at maine military supply mms,a firearms dealer.the responding officers found several signs of a and theft of firearms.a video surveillance system captured the images of two men,one of whom threw a projectile through the premises glass door.both men were recorded as they placed several handguns and assault rifles into a duffel bag before leaving the scene in a white jeep.the store owner reported that fifteen guns were rifles and seven pistols.several of the stolen firearms were and capable of accepting large capacity magazines.
investigation led police to the owner of the jeep,sayer tamiso,and eventually to tamiso girlfriend,who told police that she overheard tamiso and marceau make plans to commit the robbery.part of the plan was that marceau would bring the stolen guns to his home in vermont,remove their serial numbers,and eventually sell them.she also said that she confronted tamiso after seeing a television news account of the robbery,and that he admitted the two men involvement.other witnesses and physical evidence also connected tamiso and marceau to each other and to the crime.
a subsequent search of marceau vermont home yielded gun tags corresponding to items stolen from mms after learning that marceau occasionally stayed at his grandmother home,police also conducted a search there and recovered several rifles from the maine robbery.in addition,two stolen guns were recovered from a friend of marceau.authorities determined that of the fifteen guns stolen,marceau brought thirteen to vermont,nine of which were recovered.marceau said he gave the other four to an individual he would not identify.tamiso told authorities he kept two of the stolen guns,but later threw them into a river.although tamiso provided a location for his disposal,the two guns were never recovered.finally,vermont authorities recovered a gun with an obliterated serial number from a man who said he bought it from marceau.this gun was not connected to the mms robbery.
marceau was arrested in may.he pled guilty the following month to a information charging him with theft of firearms,in violation of u.
in the psr,the probation department first recounted the facts of the burglary and then turned to the guidelines calculation.citing a b,the psr determined marceau base offense level bol to be opposed to the default level of twelve,a because the theft involved firearms capable of accepting large capacity magazines and because marceau was a prohibited person at the time of the crime by virtue of his ongoing drug use,see g.four levels were added due to the number of firearms stolen.b b.an additional four levels were added pursuant to b because marceau was carrying a weapon at the time of the mms caliber pistol.yet another four levels were added because marceau was trafficking the stolen firearms,id.b,and four more levels were added as a result of his possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number,b b.from this total adjusted offense level of,a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was applied,for a total offense level of.
when combined with a criminal history category of ii marceau recommended guideline range was to months.the applicable statutory maximum,however,was months.the district court adopted the findings of the probation officer and sentenced marceau to months imprisonment.approximately one month later,the same district court judge sentenced tamiso to months imprisonment.
ii.analysis 
marceau appeal takes aim at various specific components of his offense level calculation,and also at the overall reasonableness of his sentence.we discuss each contention in turn.we review de novo the district court reading of guideline provisions.united states stoupis,cir.factual findings are reviewed for clear error.id.
offense level increase for firearms 
weapon ban 
marceau first argues that the offense level increase from twelve to twenty for theft of weapons should not have been applied because congress allowed the statutory proscription against possessing such weapons to expire in.thus,marceau argues,the sentencing commission exceeded its authority in april when it voted to retain the enhancement.we disagree.before detailing our reasoning,we sketch the relevant background.
the violent crime control and enforcement act of made possession of various firearms illegal,but contained a sunset provision under which the ban expired september,ten years after its implementation.see v declaring weapons unlawful repealed a defining semiautomatic assault weapon repealed see also defining firearm.responding to directives within the act,the sentencing commission adopted amendment,which amended to enhance base offense levels for possession of assault weapons,without regard to their use in another offense.also enacted was amendment,which prescribed an upward departure for firearms with a capacity exceeding ten cartridges possessed in connection with a crime of violence or controlled substance offense.both amendments became effective november.
courts responded to the expiration of the weapons ban in different ways.some questioned whether the expired ban could continue to support sentence enhancements,see,united states serna,cir questioning whether possession of an assault weapon was a crime of violence for guidelines purposes,while others applied the enhancement without regard to the present legality of the weapon,see,united states ray,cir united states vega,cir.
in response to what it described as inconsistent application of the enhanced base offense level following the expiration of the weapons ban,the commission subsequently adopted amendment,which deleted the explicit statutory reference to the weapons ban,and instead applied the enhanced offense level in a b to a semiautomatic weapon capable of accepting a large capacity magazine.amendment took effect november,and was in effect at the time of marceau sentencing.marceau argues that enactment of amendment after the expiration of the assault weapon ban violated the commission obligation to promulgate guidelines consistent with all pertinent provisions of any federal statute.a.
while it is true that congress has granted the commission broad discretion with respect to guideline formulation,the commission must nevertheless bow to the specific directives of congress.united states labonte,d mistretta united states,d.thus,if amendment is at odds with a statute plain language,it must give way.labonte,at.in this case,however,we agree with the district court that the enhanced bol in amendment is not at odds with any statute because it does not penalize the mere possession of legal firearms,but only possession by certain prohibited persons.
the district court approvingly cited ray,in which the eighth circuit affirmed the district court application of the section a b enhancement to a defendant who possessed a weapon which remained legal due to a grandfather clause in the act.rejecting the argument that the enhancement could only be applied to illegal weapons,the ray court concluded that t hrough a b,the sentencing commission decided to punish more severely the possession of semiautomatic firearms,even those of the variety,by those who have lost the right to possess firearms.id.at see also cmt.g,n.
we took a similar approach in united states,cir.there,we rejected the defendant argument that possession of a grandfathered,weapon could not form the basis of a conviction under c for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug offense.instead,following the course laid by ray,we concluded that the grandfather clause created an exception only with respect to the separate crime of simple posse
