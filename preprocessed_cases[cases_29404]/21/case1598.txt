the defendant,fanta kaba,is a native of the nation of guinea who entered the united states illegally in.although illiterate,she was able to establish a successful restaurant business in new york city.on october,however,she pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin in violation of.at sentencing,the parties agreed that under the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines,the conviction warranted an adjusted base offense level of,which,combined with a criminal history category of i,yielded a guidelines range of to months kaba conviction was further subject to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of ten years incarceration under the controlled substances act.see b a.
on april,one day prior to her scheduled sentencing,kaba counsel filed a submission that included a videotape of kaba family in kaba country of origin,guinea,a statement made by kaba mother,several photographs,and kaba medical records from the metropolitan detention center in brooklyn,new york,indicating that kaba suffered from an umbilical hernia.kaba counsel also wrote a lengthy and detailed letter urging the district court to show mercy and leniency,letter from kaba counsel to the district court dated,at kaba letter,because of the extreme conditions of her childhood and young adulthood in guinea.she was one of nineteen children sired by her father with three wives.kaba,who is unable to read or write in english,french,which is guinea official language,or the indigenous bambara language,received little formal education,inadequate nourishment,and frequent,severe beatings at the hands of her father.at the age of nine,she endured crude genital mutilation.seven years later,her father forced her to become the second wife of a man who routinely beat and otherwise abused her.the government disputes none of these assertions.
counsel letter also explained that the parties agreed that kaba was not fully truthful during her proffer session with the government in connection with her pursuit of a reduced safety valve sentence under f the government therefore was not prepared to recommend that the safety valve be applied,which would have permitted the district court to sentence the defendant to less than the mandatory minimum sentence of ten years in prison.
kaba counsel persuaded the government to entertain a second safety valve proffer session with kaba,which prompted the district court to continue the sentencing hearing.after this second proffer,the government recommended that kaba be given the benefit of the safety valve.
during the subsequent sentencing hearing,on june,defense counsel pleaded for leniency because of kaba difficult childhood,the fact that she would not see her three children in guinea for the duration of her sentence,and the particular difficulties the children would face in their mother absence.kaba counsel also urged the court to consider her assertedly difficult months in custody prior to the sentencing,during which time she endured the pain and discomfort of the untreated hernia.no one has,during the course of these proceedings,questioned the very serious nature of kaba crimes.
in response to the arguments on kaba behalf,the assistant united states attorney assigned to the case told the court that the government biggest concern was the message that the sentence sends to other people in this community.she continued 
agent grey has spent the better part of several years investigating the west african community that is involved in international heroin smuggling into the united states.
it is a very difficult community to infiltrate because of language barriers.it is a very community,and too often people in this community,like in other drug organizations,get pretty small sentences and they deported and agent grey informs me his information is that they will come back and it will start all over again.
i think that word of your honor sentence today is going to get out very quickly,and i think it is important that the message sent is one of deterrence because our investigation in this case demonstrated that there are many people involved in this activity in new york and elsewhere in the united states and in the world and that they are aware of one another criminal cases,and word will get out probably by this afternoon.
i do think it is important that the sentence reflect the seriousness of this offense and have deterrent effect not just on her but other people who would consider engaging in this kind of behavior.
sentencing,united states kaba,june,at.
after a short recess,the district court began its sentencing allocution by noting that it had a bunch of mixed feelings about kaba.id.at.observing that the safety valve applied and that he would sentence kaba to months imprisonment,the district court continued 
what i am hearing,i do often say that deterrence is a major factor,sometimes it is,but rarer than we might wish,but from what i hear from roth the assistant attorney,it is entirely reasonable to assume that people from the guinea community are going to say gee,do you hear what happened to kaba i do want that to happen to me.
i hope that that has some effect here that will deter other people from that background from doing what you done here,and you certainly had the brains not to do it to start with.
the sentence is one that i do think people coming here from guinea are going to want to say i want to put in that kind of time being stupid about american laws.we see.maybe it will have the effect and maybe it wo.
the court concluded 
kaba,i suggest that you go around telling people,look,watch yourself here.if you come to this country,it gives you great opportunity to build a restaurant and make a life for yourself,but if you violate our laws,they going to dump on you.they dumped on me and i back here.this is when you are talking from across the atlantic.
kaba appeals on the sole ground that the district court impermissibly based its sentence on the defendant national origin and thereby rendered the sentence invalid.we agree.we therefore reverse and remand for.
discussion 
i.the district court consideration of kaba national origin 
as noted,kaba narrowly focuses her argument on appeal on the district court discussion of her membership in the guinean or,more broadly,community,which constituted much of the court explanation for kaba sentence.she contends that the district court thus improperly at least improperly appeared to national origin in determining her sentence.
