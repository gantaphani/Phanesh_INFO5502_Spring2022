garry collins appeals his conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base,in violation of a.he does so by challenging the district court denial of his motion to suppress evidence.he also appeals his month prison sentence on the ground that the district court erroneously applied the united states sentencing guidelines career offender enhancement to him.we affirm.
at approximately on june,john morin,an officer with the portland police department,responded to a report that two individuals on emery street in portland,maine were fighting about drugs those two individuals were collins and kristie parsons.when officer morin arrived at the scene,collins was seated in the driver seat of parsons car,and parsons was standing next to the car.
upon running a check on the license plate on parsons car,officer morin discovered that parsons was on bail,and he concluded that her bail conditions permitted the search of her vehicle.and so officer morin searched her vehicle.he found a hypodermic needle protruding from under the driver seat,two or three key cards from the clarion hotel where parsons said she was staying in the center console,and a blue gym bag in the back seat.
morin asked collins and parsons to whom the gym bag belonged,and collins and parsons each denied that the bag was theirs.parsons said that the bag belonged to t he guy from room with some weird name.officer morin searched the bag,which contained not only men clothing,underwear,and sneakers,but also cocaine,empty sandwich bags,and razor blades.
collins was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base,in violation of a.prior to trial,he moved to suppress the evidence found in parsons car,including the evidence found in the gym bag.after an evidentiary hearing at which no one including collins claimed ownership in the gym bag,the district court denied the motion.collins then entered a straight guilty plea to the single count charged,but he reserved the right to challenge the district court denial of his suppression motion.
the case proceeded to sentencing,and the district court sentenced collins as a career offender,pursuant to of the united states sentencing guidelines.the resulting sentencing range under the guidelines was to months imprisonment,but the district court imposed a sentence of months.collins appeals both the conviction and the sentence.
in challenging the conviction,collins argues that the search of the gym bag violated his fourth amendment rights and that the district court therefore should have suppressed the evidence found in that bag and collins further contends that,with that evidence out of the case,the conviction can not stand.
the district court rejected the motion to suppress on the ground that collins had not asserted an ownership interest in the bag or the contents of the bag at the evidentiary hearing.we review the district court conclusions of law de novo and findings of fact for clear error.united states belton,cir.
collins proceeds with his argument on the understanding that the evidence at the suppression hearing showed that the bag belonged to someone else the guy from who had some weird name.but collins argues that even accepting that fact,officer morin should have ceased searching the bag when he discovered male clothes,as at that point morin would have known that the bag did not belong to parsons and therefore that her bail conditions did not permit its search.
collins argument,however,is beside the point.the district court correctly held that fourth amendment rights are personal and that collins may successfully challenge the search of the bag on fourth amendment grounds only if he has a legitimate expectation of privacy in that bag.united states sanchez,cir citing rakas illinois,d.because collins does not challenge the district court finding that he did not claim the bag was his,he can not show he had an expectation of privacy in the bag.thus,his fourth amendment argument fails.and while collins contends that he can not be forced to admit his guilt in order to preserve his fourth amendment rights,the law is clear that,at a suppression hearing,a defendant may assert ownership of property without that assertion later being used against him at trial.see united states symonevich,cir w e have long held that testimony given to meet standing requirements can not be used as direct evidence against the defendant at trial on the question of guilt or innocence.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of the suppression motion.
collins challenge to his sentence is also without merit.he argues that the district court erred when it sentenced him as a career offender pursuant to.under that guideline,a defendant is a career offender and subject to a potentially greater offense level than would otherwise be applicable,so long as three conditions are met.only one of those conditions is at issue here that the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.a 
the parties agreed at sentencing that collins prior conviction for drug trafficking qualified as a controlled substance offense,and the district court proceeded on this understanding as well.but the parties disagreed as to whether the second of the government proposed predicate offenses criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon qualified as a crime of violence.collins argued that the offense did not qualify as a crime of violence and therefore that he should not be sentenced as a career offender.
the sentencing guidelines define crime of violence as any offense under federal or state law,punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,that 
has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,or 
is burglary of a dwelling,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
a.the district court concluded that collins prior state court conviction for criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon qualified as a crime of violence under subsection of this definition,the force clause.and it is to this conclusion that collins now objects.
we review the district court decision on this purely legal question de novo.see united states curet,cir and we affirm.
the parties agree that collins prior offense of conviction constitutes a crime of violence only if its elements are such that we can conclude that a person convicted of the offense has necessarily been found guilty of conduct that meets the a definition.united states ramos gonzález,cir quoting united states martínez,cir alteration in original.in other words,under this categorical approach,the elements of the statute of conviction,not the facts of collins conduct,determine the proper classification of the offense of which collins was convicted.id.quoting united states fish,cir omission in original.
the parties also agree that,pursuant to the statutes under which collins was convicted,a person is guilty of criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon if he intentionally or knowingly places another person in fear of imminent bodily injury,a,with the use of a dangerous weapon,id.maine law defines use of a dangerous weapon as the use of a firearm or other weapon,device,instrument,material or substance,whether animate or inanimate,which,in the manner it is used or threatened to be used is capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.id.a.
putting these statutory definitions together,we conclude that collins prior conviction for criminal threatening with a dangerous weapon qualifies as a crime of violence under the force clause.the statutory elements are such that his conviction required proof that collins intentionally or knowingly placed his victim in fear of imminent bodily injury through use of an instrument which,in the manner collins used or threatened to use it,was capable of producing death or serious bodily injury.this necessarily constitutes threatened use of force capable of causing physical pain or injury against the person of another.united states johnson,d def
