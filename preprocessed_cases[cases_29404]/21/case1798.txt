background 
tomasi was tried in december,along with frank barrett and jimmy tomasi the appellant cousin,on charges related to the distribution of heroin.on the third day of trial,tomasi pled guilty to distribution of heroin in violation of a.the also pled guilty.
tomasi presentence report psr recommended a base offense level of for grams of heroin,see c,minus two points for acceptance of responsibility,see,for a total offense level of.the psr calculated a total of grams of heroin grams based on tomasi sales of heroin to two witnesses,and an additional grams based on tomasi participation with barrett in trips.in calculating the gram figure,the psr relied on the trial testimony of diane hulphers,the girlfriend of barrett and a drug addict,who stated that barrett and tomasi made trips approximately twice a week during the summer of,and that during this time period she would see barrett with six or eight bundles of heroin at a time 
tomasi criminal history score was calculated at seven points,placing the defendant in criminal history category iv.one of the seven points came from a vermont state conviction on september,for driving with a suspended license and giving false information to a police officer vermont conviction.for that offense,the vermont state court had sentenced tomasi to days,suspended,with an indefinite term of probation that was continued by the sentencing court for over three years before he was discharged.
at tomasi sentencing hearing,judge sessions indicated that he was interested in developing a sentence that would encourage this defendant to participate in the hour drug and alcohol rehabilitation program,but that he did not intend to impose a sentence that was longer than necessary to get the defendant through that program.the court rejected tomasi argument that the vermont conviction should not result in a criminal history point under c and c a.under these provisions,a criminal history point is added for each prior sentence involving less than days of imprisonment,but misdemeanors and petty offenses of specified categories including tomasi vermont conviction are not counted under c a unless they resulted in a sentence of a term of probation of at least one year or a term or imprisonment of at least thirty days.c a.because tomasi had served over a year on probation,the court concluded the point should be added.tomasi contests that decision on appeal.the court also rejected the defendant argument that hulpher testimony was too vague to be reliable,noting that grams is a conservative estimate of what this defendant was involved in.finally,the court found that the defendant was sufficiently actively involved in the offense that he was not entitled to a adjustment.using an offense level of and criminal history category iv,the court sentenced the defendant to months of the bottom of the guidelines range of to by three years supervised release.
discussion 
we address the question whether in sentencing the court properly added a criminal history point placing the defendant in criminal history category iv by reason of his vermont conviction.c a provides that certain misdemeanor and petty offenses,including driving with a suspended license and giving false information to a police officer,will result in a criminal history point under c only if the sentence was a term of probation of at least one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days.
the defendant first argument is that the sentence for his vermont conviction was days probation,and that the district court therefore erred in concluding it involved a year probation.
we disagree.the defendant characterization of the sentence does not conform to its description in the record.the record below does not contain the exact text of the vermont sentence.the district court relied on the summary in the presentence report,which described the sentence as to days all suspended and probation from which the defendant was satisfactorily discharged on november.we see no basis for reading this as a sentence of up to days of probation as tomasi counsel suggests.what is clear is that the sentence of to days was suspended,and that probation was imposed,which lasted for over three years.the governing vermont statute,under which the sentence was passed,states that the court may suspend all or part of the sentence and place the person on probation for such time as it may prescribe in accordance with law or until further order of court.stat.ann.tit,emphasis added.reading the psr summary of the sentence against the governing statute,it is clear that tomasi prison term was suspended and that he was placed on probation either for a term that exceeded a year,or for an indefinite term that was maintained in effect for more than a year.that is how the district court read the sentence.
the probationary term began when tomasi was placed on probation on september,and ended when he was discharged from probation on november.the district court,relying on the amount of time tomasi actually served on probation,concluded that the sentence of probation was of greater than one year,with the consequence that the defendant received one criminal history point.
tomasi second argument is that an indefinite term of probation should not be counted as a term of probation of at least one year,within the meaning of c,even if the probation is continued for over a year.in united states rich,cir,we considered the same question.the sentence imposed by the vermont court in that case was nine to twelve months imprisonment,suspended,with probation until further order of the court.although we did not decide the issue,we examined arguments on both sides.see id.at.the defendant in rich argued that since the sentence is the term of imprisonment or probation imposed by the court,rather than the length of time actually served,c a should be interpreted to exclude a specified offense for which an indefinite term of probation is imposed.see rich,at.rich argued in addition that the sentencing guidelines are designed so that criminal history points will take into account the relative severity of prior offenses.see id.section c a reflects the assessment that certain offenses are serious enough to warrant a point only if the sentence imposed reflects the sentencing court determination that the offense was relatively serious.see united states hardeman,cir section c uses the penalty imposed as a surrogate for severity in determining whether or not the listed offenses should be included in the criminal history score.because the actual time served on probation under vermont indefinite probation scheme may reflect factors other than the seriousness of the underlying rich case the failure to comply with the terms of his may not be a reliable indicator of whether the underlying offense was sufficiently serious to warrant a criminal history point.see rich,at,application note when calculating the length of a prior sentence of imprisonment,criminal history points are based on the sentence pronounced,not the length of time actually served.tomasi adopts the arguments advanced by the defendant in rich.
the government position in rich,as here,was that the amount of time actually served on probation should be the measure used to determine whether an indefinite term of probation imposed by vermont for a c a offense is a term of probation of at least one year,resulting in a criminal history point.see rich,at
