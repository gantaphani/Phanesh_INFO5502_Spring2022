background 
the facts are largely undisputed.on july,reyes robbed a bank in manhattan.after threatening an employee with what appeared to be an explosive device,reyes absconded with approximately.without the benefit of a plea agreement,reyes pleaded guilty to one count of bank robbery in violation of a and d.
shortly before reyes pleaded guilty,the government submitted a letter pursuant to united states pimentel,cir.that letter outlined the government position on the application of the guidelines to reyes case.as relevant here,the government stated that,in its view,reyes was a career offender under a because he had been convicted of two previous crimes of violence battery on a law enforcement officer in violation of florida statute section,and robbery in violation of florida statute section.as a career offender convicted of two prior crimes of violence and facing a charge that carried a maximum of years imprisonment,reyes would have his offense level elevated to level.contemplating a level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under and that reyes would be placed in criminal history category vi,the government advocated for a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.
the probation department prepared a psr in advance of reyes sentencing.the psr begins by correctly summarizing the government pimentel letter and its conclusion that reyes was a career offender under.in paragraph of the report,however,the psr states inarticulately that reyes was a career offender because he had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence.psr.then,in paragraph,the psr states that reyes is a career offender under the guidelines because he has prior felony convictions involving a crime of violence and a controlled substance offense.psr.the psr later repeats this statement in its recommendation section.
although the psr never explicitly identifies the prior convictions on which it relies to classify reyes as a career offender,it lists the following,among several other convictions,in detailing reyes criminal history a january conviction in puerto rico for a controlled substance offense a may florida conviction for robbery and a may florida conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer.the psr also provides a description of the conduct underlying reyes battery conviction.it states,on march,the defendant was detained at falkenburg road jail when he caused a disturbance in the pod.a detention deputy responded and spoke with the defendant.the defendant then struck the deputy in the nose with a closed fist.psr.the psr does not provide the source of this information.
on april,reyes appeared before the district court for sentencing.in his sentencing memorandum,reyes counsel did not object to the facts contained in the psr,the psr classification of reyes as a career offender,or the psr calculation of the guidelines range.indeed,at the sentencing hearing,reyes counsel noted that he had n o objections to the facts or the g uidelines calculations set forth in the.in the absence of an objection,the district court accepted the psr findings,including those that contained inaccuracies and inconsistencies regarding which crimes served as predicates for the career offender enhancement.
the government noted that reyes had a very long and very violent criminal history and highlighted for the district court a number of reyes prior offenses,including both his robbery conviction and his conviction for battery on a law enforcement officer.app.the district court then sentenced reyes to months incarceration.the court characterized reyes very lengthy and very violent criminal history as the driving force behind the sentence.app.the district court did not,however,specifically discuss reyes status as a career offender.
reyes timely appealed the district court judgment.in january,reyes filed an appellate brief in this court.in his brief,he claims that the district court committed plain error in adopting the psr conclusions regarding his status as a career offender under.specifically,he argues that he does not have a prior conviction for a controlled substance offense that counts towards his classification as a career offender under the supreme court decision in johnson united states,a florida battery conviction does not necessarily constitute a crime of violence and there was insufficient evidence in the record to determine whether his particular battery conviction constituted a conviction for a crime of violence.in support of the latter point,reyes contends that the district court was not entitled to rely on the psr uncontested description of his conduct that resulted in his conviction for battery of a law enforcement officer to determine whether the battery was a crime of violence.he notes that this court left open that question in united states rosa,cir.
in april,the government moved to remand for resentencing in light of johnson.a panel of this court rebuffed the government request.the panel directed the government to file a brief addressing 
whether reyes failure to object to the facts contained in his psr describing the offense conduct underlying his prior conviction for battery of a law enforcement officer constituted an admission of those facts whether a sentencing court may use such an admission to find that a prior offense constitutes a crime of violence under a and if so,whether the district court committed plain error in adopting the psr conclusion that reyes qualified as a career offender.
united states reyes,cr cir,motion order.following our directive,the government argues that vacatur of reyes sentence is inappropriate and that his sentence should be affirmed.
discussion 
because reyes failed to object below to his classification as a career offender under,we review his classification as such for plain error only.see united states morris,f d,cir.plain error exists where the district court committed error the error is plain the error affects the defendant substantial rights and the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states greer,cir.
pursuant to a,a defendant is a career offender if 
the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense and the defendant has at least two prior convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.
as is relevant here,the guidelines define a crime of violence as an offense punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.a.the crime of violence convictions must be sustained prior to the defendant committing the offense for which he is being sentenced.c.
here,the district court committed an error that was plain it adopted findings in the psr that conclude that reyes is a career offender because he has convictions for both a crime of violence and a controlled substance offense.psr.reyes sustained the controlled substance offense after he committed the instant offense.therefore,that conviction was not a proper predicate offense for the application of the career offender enhancement.see c.
but to prevail on plain error review,reyes m
