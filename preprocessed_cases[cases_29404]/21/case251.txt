after kevin hill pled guilty to distributing oxycodone,the district court found that other uncharged drug sales by hill were relevant to determining his guideline sentencing range.hill appeals,arguing that the district court applied both the wrong standard and the wrong method of comparison in determining what uncharged drug sales were relevant to his sentence.we affirm.
background 
in december,kevin hill pled guilty without a plea bargain to one count of distributing oxycodone in violation of u.a and b c.according to the government version of the facts,on june,agents from the drug enforcement agency dea,along with a confidential informant ci,decided to purchase worth of oxycodone pills from hill.the ci called him,arranged for the sale,and drove with a dea task force agent to the location in augusta,maine,where the sale was to take place.shortly thereafter,a blue mustang arrived.hill emerged from the mustang,climbed into the rear passenger seat of the dea agent car,and handed the ci oxycodone pills.the agent then gave hill,and hill left.
in addition to the facts as we have described them,the presentence investigation report psr related that on the day of the controlled buy,the ci had contacted hill in an effort to purchase cocaine and oxycodone.hill agreed to sell oxycodone to the ci,but stated that he did not have any cocaine at that time.hill did note that he could obtain cocaine in several hours.the psr also noted that the ci had identified hill as a trafficker of oxycodone and cocaine in central maine.hill does not challenge this information on appeal.section a of the united states sentencing guidelines requires the sentencing judge,in calculating the guideline sentencing range,to take into consideration certain relevant conduct other than the offense of conviction.such relevant conduct includes,for certain offenses such as that to which hill pled guilty,other drug sales that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.sentencing guidelines manual a.
paragraphs and of hill psr described several other drug sales that the parties agreed constituted relevant conduct for purposes of calculating hill guideline sentencing range.first,the psr described a controlled buy on april,when another confidential source pulled up to the home of thomas flynn in augusta.hill got into the car and sold the source net grams of cocaine base for.second,the psr explained that a ci the same one,it appears,who participated in the controlled buy on june,recounted that he or she bought oxycodone from hill three times in one week sometime in april or may of.each time,the ci bought ten mg oxycodone pills from hill.all told,the offense of conviction and the undisputed relevant conduct resulted in hill being held accountable for selling grams of cocaine base and roughly grams of oxycodone.
paragraph of the psr also attributed to hill a series of drug sales totaling an additional grams of oxycodone.hill contested both that the sales were established by sufficiently reliable evidence and that they were relevant conduct under the guidelines.the section of the psr discussing the sales reported as follows 
several confidential informants were interviewed regarding hill drug distribution activities.they consistently stated that hill was a oxycodone and cocaine base trafficker,who received those substances via shipments from new york.the confidential informants reported that hill distributed the drugs in the augusta and waterville areas of maine along with four or five other individuals from new york.they describe hill as the leader of this group of individuals one confidential informant hereinafter ci advised that obtained mg oxycodone pills from hill between january and at least may,which subsequently resold.ci reported that in january,received a conservatively estimated mg oxycodone pills per day for the days in january.therefore for the month of january,it is conservatively estimated that purchased mg oxycodone pills from hill.ci advised that from february through may,purchased an estimated mg oxycodone pills per day from hill.since that period contains a total of days,it is estimated that purchased mg oxycodone pills from hill between february and may.therefore,hill is accountable for distributing a total of mg oxycodone pills to ci sic.
in disputing that the sales discussed in paragraph of the psr constituted relevant conduct for sentencing purposes,hill presentence memorandum emphasized that all of the transactions other than those in paragraph have certain similarities they are for small quantities of drugs consistent with personal use,purchased with cash and apparently not intended for resale.they are isolated in time and do not involve continuing agreements to purchase further drugs.finally,they are relatively close in time.he argued that the conduct described in paragraph of the psr is not relevant conduct to the offense of conviction in that the nature of the conduct set forth in paragraph is different in kind from that in and as to quantities,methods of distribution,participants,and nature of the transactions.he argued that the transactions could not be relevant conduct because they were neither part of a common scheme or plan nor the same course of conduct as the offense of conviction.
in a lengthy and detailed order,the district court rejected hill arguments and so included the paragraph information in calculating his base offense level.this decision increased the guidelines sentencing range from months to months.the court ultimately sentenced hill to months imprisonment.hill timely appealed.
hill pointedly does not argue on appeal that the guidelines,as properly applied,would not have allowed the district court to find that the sales described in paragraph of the psr were relevant conduct for the purposes of sentencing on his offense of conviction.rather,he argues only that,in two respects,the district court reached its conclusion by misapplying the guidelines standards.he argues,first,that the district court applied the wrong legal standard because,according to hill,the district court rested its finding that the sales described in paragraph were relevant conduct on a test applicable only to conspiracy offenses or offenses in which the conduct of someone other than the defendant is attributed to him for sentencing purposes.he argues,second,that the district court erred because it focused its attention and findings on whether the conduct reported in paragraph was sufficiently connected only to the other undisputed relevant conduct,rather than directly to the offense of conviction.
ii.standard of review 
hill makes no claim that he presented to the district court the two arguments he now advances on appeal,and we have found no such presentation.accordingly,we review for plain error.united states tavares,cir.under that standard,s uccess on appeal requires hill to demonstrate an error that was plain or obvious and which affected his substantial rights and also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.united states santiago burgos,cir.
iii.analysis 
a.the district court found that the paragraph conduct was part of the same course of conduct as the offense of conviction.
guidelines section a provides that,with fungible item crimes like drug dealing,united states blanco,cir internal quotation marks omitted,a defendant base offense level should be calculated based not merely on the offense of conviction,but also on,among other things,all acts and omissions committed,aided,abetted,counseled,commanded,induced,procured,or willfully caused by the defendant that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.a.common scheme or plan and same course of conduct are two closely related concepts.id.cmt.the guidelines commentary specifies that f or two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan,they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor,such as common victims,common accomplices,common purpose,or similar modus operandi.id.moreover,
