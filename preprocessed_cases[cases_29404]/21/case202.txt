the ostrich undeserved claim to fame is that it buries its head in the sand instead of facing danger parties to litigation sometimes act like this,too.case in point is our appellant,miguelito arroyo blas arroyo blas,who by ignoring a plea agreement clear waiver of appeal provision fares no better here than we imagine our proverbial ostrich does when confronted by a predator in the wild.
background 
this case has its genesis in arroyo blas guilty plea pursuant to a written plea agreement to count i of a indictment charging him and several others with various drug crimes.in entering his plea,arroyo blas admitted that he was an organizer and leader of a drug conspiracy that imported five or more kilograms of cocaine into puerto rico from june to january.
center stage in this appeal is occupied by the plea agreement,not the facts of the offense.the agreement was made pursuant to federal rules of criminal procedure c a and c.because these rules loom large over what to come,we set them out now.
rule c provides,as important here,the following 
in general.an attorney for the government and the defendant attorney may discuss and reach a plea agreement.the court must not participate in these discussions.if the defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense,the plea agreement may specify that an attorney for the government will 
a not bring,or will move to dismiss,other charges 
c agree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case,or that a particular provision of the sentencing guidelines,or policy statement,or sentencing factor does or does not apply such a recommendation or request binds the court once the court accepts the plea agreement.
c.such a plea the parties to bind the district court to a sentence if the court accepts the plea.united states rivera mart√≠nez,cir.
arroyo blas plea agreement stated that he would plead guilty to count i and that the government would dismiss the remaining counts against him.he agreed to accept responsibility for more than fifty kilograms but less than one hundred fifty kilograms of cocaine for sentencing purposes.the parties applied the drug quantity to the united states sentencing guidelines guidelines to come up with a suggested offense level and sentencing range.the parties calculations factored in arroyo blas role as an organizer and leader in the conspiracy as an aggravating circumstance,and his acceptance of responsibility as a mitigating one.all told,the drug quantity and adjustments translated to a total offense level of and a sentencing range of months,assuming that arroyo blas would be in criminal history category 
after calculating the guidelines range,the parties agree d on a range of to months of imprisonment,where the defendant may argue for a sentence of months of imprisonment and the government may argue for a sentence of months of imprisonment.a separate section of the plea agreement indicated that p ursuant to rule c c of the federal rules of criminal procedure defendant understands that the parties have agreed to a specific sentence because all parties understand that it is the appropriate disposition of this case.it further stated that i f the court accepts this plea agreement,the court is bound by the parties sentencing recommendation.
the plea agreement also contained a waiver of appeal 
the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives the right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case,provided that the defendant is sentenced in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the sentence recommendation of this plea and forfeiture agreement,that is,with a sentence within the range of to months of imprisonment.
at the change of plea hearing before a magistrate judge,arroyo blas answered with an unambiguous yes when asked whether he understood that he was agreeing to waive his right to appeal should he receive a sentence in accordance with the terms,conditions,and recommendations set forth in the agreement.the magistrate judge recommended that arroyo blas plea pursuant to the plea agreement be accepted,which the district judge did 
the presentence investigation report psr,prepared after the district judge accepted arroyo blas guilty plea,set forth the probation department view of how the guidelines should apply.the psr calculations tracked those of the plea agreement with respect to the nature of the offense and applicable enhancements and adjustments.unlike the plea agreement,the psr went on to address arroyo blas criminal history,which included a conviction on a charge of failure to report monetary instruments.thanks to this conviction,the psr set arroyo blas criminal history category at ii,which called for a guidelines sentence between and months.
at sentencing,the district judge recognized right off the bat that arroyo blas plea allows for a sentence within that range of to months.the judge expressed his understanding that he could sentence arroyo blas anywhere in between that range.defense counsel replied by saying,w e understand that,your honor.
defense counsel main argument at sentencing and one he continues to press on appeal was that arroyo blas criminal history category should be i,not ii.the district judge disagreed and decided to consider that arroyo blas has a criminal history category of ii which does alter in any way your plea agreement because the plea agreement allows for the court to sentence him anywhere between and months.thus,the district judge did consider the criminal history category interaction with the guidelines range months with it set at i,and months at ii to have any effect on the actual range of time to which arroyo blas was exposed.ultimately,after running through the facts of the offense and taking arroyo blas personal history and characteristics into account,the judge found that a sentence at the lower end of the applicable guideline range was appropriate,and imposed a month sentence.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
arroyo blas wants to be able to tell us that the district judge erred in putting him in criminal history category ii,which subjected him to a higher guidelines range.he believes this error worked to his detriment,as by choosing months,the district judge clearly applied the bottom of the month guideline range.had he been put in category i,arroyo blas believes he would have received a shorter sentence.
the plea agreement waiver of appeal,however,may bar his appeal in its entirety.accordingly,we must first conduct a threshold inquiry to determine whether arroyo blas appeal falls within the scope of the provision contained in his plea agreement.united states okoye,cir.
when considering the scope of a waiver of appeal,we interpret the parties agreement under basic contract principles.see also united states ocasio cancel,cir plea agreements should be given their plain meaning.should we find any ambiguities in the waiver provision,we resolve them in favor of allowing the appeal to proceed.okoye,at.but,i f a plea agreement unambiguously resolves an issue,that usually ends the judicial inquiry.united states alegria,cir.and,as in contract law,we will not conjur e up an ambiguity in a plea agreement where none legitimately exists.united states anderson,cir.
despite the importance of the waiver of appeal issue,arroyo blas opening brief fails to address it in any meaningful way.indeed,the only time it is mentioned is in his statement of subject matter and appellate jurisdiction.and this treatment is confined to just two sentences one acknowledging the waiver existence,and the second making the conclusory statement that the waiver does not bar this appeal as the claimed errors are misapplication of the sentencing guidelines followed by a cite,with no explanation,to our opinion in united states mccoy,cir.he makes no other argument as to why the waiver of appeal should not result in dismissal of his appeal.
the government starts off its brief by telling us that we should enforce the waiver of appeal.first,it takes aim at arroyo blas briefing,saying that his argument about the waiver enforceability is so cursory that it has been waived.the government then turns to the merits and explains why the waiver of appeal is enforceable.implicit throughout its brief is the idea that the waiver applies because arroyo blas appeal falls within its scope.
having reviewed the terms and scope of arroyo blas waiver of appeal ourselves,they could hardly be more clear.arroyo blas unambiguously agreed to waive his appeal provided he was sentenced to prison for somewhere between and months.and that is exactly what happened.so it would appear that the plain language of his waiver operates to bar this appeal.
the only case arroyo blas cites in support of his position that the waiver does not apply,united states mccoy,cir,is readily distinguishable.waivers of appeal,we observed in mccoy,vary considerably in their language,and the scope of the waiver is simply a matter of what the parties agreed to in the particular case.id.at.the plea agreement in mccoy provided for a waiver of appeal that set forth no proposed sentence or sentencing range.id.at.rather,the parties agreed that the government would request i ncarceration within the guideline range.id.alteration in original.this language,we found,preclude d mccoy from challenging any sentence that falls within the guideline range.id.
but the parties in that case left open the question of what that guideline range was.when mccoy appealed his sentence,he argued that by both a legal error and a mathematical mistake,the district court the loss suffered by the victim of his fraud and so misapplied the guidelines.id.this particular argument was not barred,we found,because if mccoy position was correct,then his sentence was not within the guideline range.id.the takeaway is that language in a plea agreement waiving the right to appeal only when the sentence imposed is within the guidelines does not waive the right to appeal an alleged misapplication of the guidelines.id.quoting united states bowden,cir.
arroyo blas appeal waiver is quite different.instead of leaving the sentencing range up to the district judge determination,arroyo blas and the government were right up front about what they wanted arroyo blas agreed to waive any appeal provided he received a sentence falling anywhere between and months in length.he quite clearly did not reserve the right to appeal should the district judge place him in anything other than criminal history category and,because it was a plea agreement,the parties knew that if the district judge accepted it,it would be bound to impose a sentence within the range agreed to by the parties.this is reflective of the parties overriding and pragmatic concern being the amount of arroyo blas would get.
as we have said,p lea agreements should be given their plain meaning.ocasio cancel,at.because arroyo blas agreed to forgo an appeal should he be sent to jail anywhere between and months,and because months is within that range,we find that the waiver applies here to bar arroyo blas appeal.
this brings an end to our analysis.after all,arroyo blas relied solely on his contention that the waiver of appeal does not apply and eschewed any argument that the waiver,if applicable,is unenforceable.indeed,his opening brief did not even acknowledge our key case dealing with an appeal waiver enforceability,united states teeter,cir,nor did it address any of the factors we take into account when deciding whether or not we should enforce the waiver,see united states edelen,cir a ppellate waivers are binding so long as the written plea agreement clearly delineates the scope of the waiver the district court inquired specifically at the plea hearing about any waiver of appellate rights and the denial of the right to appeal would not constitute a miscarriage of justice.citing teeter,at.arroyo blas appellate strategy appears to have been to ignore the waiver of appeal and hope that the government would bring it up and,apparently,that we would notice it either 
at oral argument,when we pointed out his brief abject failure to engage with the waiver of appeal,counsel expressed his understanding that a waiver of appeal is akin to an affirmative defense and,therefore,need not be addressed unless and until the government raises the issue.counsel is mistaken.we have never equated a waiver of appeal with an affirmative defense that need not be addressed by an appellant opening brief.doing so would be nonsensical given that a defendant is required to affirmatively acknowledge his agreement to and understanding of an appeal waiver provision.see edelen,at.indeed,the very purpose of an appeal waiver is to bar an appeal.
to that end,we have indicated that an appellant who fails to make an argument with respect to an appeal waiver in his opening brief risks waiving that issue.see united states lara joglar,app x,cir per curiam stating that an appellant who failed to brief a certain exception to the enforcement of an appeal waiver arguably waived the application of that exception,but proceeding to find that enforcing the waiver of appeal would not result in a miscarriage of justice united states gil quezada,cir finding we could simply end our inquiry where a party failed to argue that enforcing appeal waiver would cause a miscarriage of justice,but attempting,i n an abundance of caution to sift the rudiments of his claim from the record.
let today decision remove any lingering doubts.we expect and require counsel to address a waiver of appeal and explain why we should entertain the appeal.an appellant who fails to do this buries his head in the sand and expects that harm will pass him by.the ostrich is a noble animal,but not a proper model for an appellate advocate.gonzalez servin ford motor,cir.
true,in the past we have deigned to sift the rudiments of the claim from the record when an appellant failed to make a complete argument about an appeal waiver in his opening brief.gil quezada,at.yet,nowhere does arroyo blas say that the scope of his waiver is unclear or that the district court did do a good enough job of telling him what that waiver meant.he also fails to tell us why denying the right to appeal would work a miscarriage of justice when his sentence falls on the lower end of the month range he agreed to.simply put,arroyo blas has given us nothing to work with.
this failure of briefing brings to mind our words from more than a ago it is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work,create the ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.united states zannino,cir.arroyo blas has waived any argument that we should refuse to enforce his waiver of appeal 
appeal dismissed.
not that ostriches really bury their heads in the sand when threatened,gonzalez servin ford motor,cir,but the image persists.and it suits our purposes well.
the plea agreement explicitly provided that t he parties make no stipulation as to defendant criminal history category.
the parties agreed to the disposition of certain forfeiture allegations,as well,but those are not germane to this appeal.the government also dismissed the other counts against arroyo blas,but we need not get into that either.
in an move,the parties did not see fit to include the transcript of the magistrate hearing or a copy of the report and recommendation in their joint appendix.this omission put the onus on the court to locate these materials in the district court docket.
arroyo blas reply brief feints toward an argument about enforceability,only to settle on repackaging his original argument that the judge miscalculated the guidelines range.he also throws in a conclusory statement that,in his view,enforcing the appeal waiver violates constitutional equal protection principles.even if these arguments had been sufficiently developed in his reply,it would have done him no good anyway.this is because it is that a legal argument made for the first time in an appellant reply brief comes too late and need not be addressed.united states brennan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
one last matter.in his brief,arroyo blas tells us that subsequent amendments to the guidelines have reduced his base offense level and provide for a lower sentencing range under either crim
