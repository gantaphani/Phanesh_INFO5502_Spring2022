background 
facts elicited at trial 
in the,a conspiracy was formed in the virgilio dávila public housing project in bayamón,puerto rico.the conspirators processed and packaged cocaine and heroin for delivery to various drug distribution points throughout puerto rico.in february,the drug organization splintered into rival factions when the brothers murdered a fellow conspirator,richard.a series of retaliatory murders ensued as members of the organization engaged in hunting expeditions to kill the brothers.
joined the conspiracy shortly after the war commenced,when the organization began storing drugs at a bar where appellant worked.at trial,two cooperating witnesses testified that on numerous occasions they delivered money to in exchange for drugs.when appellant was finally arrested,he was carrying more than decks of heroin,worth.
on june,a federal grand jury indicted on charges of using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug conspiracy in violation of c a,and of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base,cocaine,and heroin in violation of.on february,the jury found appellant guilty of both charges.
at the sentencing hearing,the judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that was responsible for more than kilos of heroin,kilos of cocaine,kilos of crack cocaine.after assessing appellant criminal history and the extent of his participation in the offense,the district court sentenced appellant to months imprisonment for the drug conspiracy count.
during sentencing for the gun count,the government argued that appellant should not be sentenced under the base offense of c a,but rather under the more severe punishment offered by c b.whereas c a offers a statutory minimum of five years imprisonment,c b mandates an enhanced sentence of no less than ten years imprisonment for the use or carrying of a semiautomatic weapon during a crime of violence.to prove appellant violation of c b,the government cited two instances in which used semiautomatic weapons during the period of participation in the,a double murder in april and the shooting of a police officer in september.the government argued that since the use of semiautomatic firearms by was foreseeable,should be held accountable for it.
the district court agreed,finding by a preponderance of the evidence that appellant violated c b.the court then imposed an enhanced sentence of ten years imprisonment for the gun count.
procedural history 
appealed his conviction and sentence to this court.united states,cir.he claimed,inter alia,that he should have received a,rather than the enhanced,sentence for the gun count.more specifically,appellant argued that the use or carrying of the semiautomatic weapons occurred prior to his joining the conspiracy,and he could not have foreseen the use of semiautomatic weapons.id.at.this court rejected appellant arguments,citing sufficient evidence in the record to refute both claims.
one day before we decided appeal,however,the supreme court rendered its opinion in apprendi.then,after this court affirmed conviction and sentence,appellant sought a rehearing of his appeal raising new arguments in light of apprendi.on september,this court denied petition for rehearing.
appellant then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the supreme court.on may,the supreme court granted appellant petition,vacated this court judgment,and remanded the case to this court for further consideration in light of apprendi.
discussion 
on june,the supreme court decided apprendi,which has been described as a watershed change in constitutional law at,dissenting.the apprendi court held that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.internal quotations omitted.because this holding was in contrast to practice,numerous appellants,including,were given ammunition to attack their convictions and sentences.
relying on apprendi,argues that his enhanced sentence for the gun count must be vacated since the jury never determined beyond a reasonable doubt that he carried a semiautomatic weapon that his drug sentence must be vacated because the drug quantity at issue was neither decided by the jury nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt and that his conviction should be vacated because b is unconstitutional on its face.since appellant arguments are raised for the first time on appeal,we review them for plain error.see united states eirby,cir.
first,appellant argues that his enhanced sentence for the gun count must be vacated because,under apprendi,the jury should have determined beyond reasonable doubt that he was accountable for the semiautomatic weapons used or carried by his.the government concedes that it was plain error for the district court to impose the enhanced sentence given the government concession,we vacate sentence.
the government proposes that we remand the case to substitute a consecutive sentence for the enhanced sentence.the sentence does not suffer from any of the constitutional infirmities that plague the sentence because the original indictment included a count charging appellant with violating c a and the jury found appellant guilty of this charge beyond a reasonable doubt.therefore,we remand the case to the district court to impose a sentence under c a.
second,argues that his drug sentence must be vacated because the drug quantity at issue was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial,as required by apprendi.appellant argument,however,rests on an expansive reading of apprendi that has been explicitly and repeatedly rejected by this court.we have consistently held that the apprendi doctrine does not apply to defendants who are sentenced to terms less than the otherwise applicable statutory maximum.see,eirby,at united states duarte,cir united states baltas,cir.most succinctly,apprendi does not require that all sentencing factors be submitted to a jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt,rather only those that increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum at.
in the instant case,sentence for the drug conspiracy was at least seven years less than the applicable statutory maximum.see b c authorizing a term of imprisonment of not more than years for a defendant who has been found guilty of a drug offense involving any quantity of cocaine,crack cocaine,or heroin.because apprendi constitutional requirements do not even apply to appellant drug conspiracy sentence,we affirm the sentence.see baltas,at holding that no constitutional error occurs when the district court sentences the defendant within the statutory maximum,regardless that drug quantity was never determined by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
lastly,argues that his conviction should be vacated because,b is unconstitutional on its face.section a makes it unlawful to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,or possess with intent to manufacture,distribute,or dispense,a controlled substance.section b,in turn,provides the penalties for violations of a,which vary depending upon drug type and quantity.before apprendi was decided,only the elements specified in a needed to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt the penalty provisions set forth in b were administered by the sentencing judge under a preponderance of the evidence standard.after apprendi,however,all facts other than prior convictions that set the maximum possible punishment under b must be established beyond a reasonable doubt by the same body that determines culpability under a.see eirby,at finding that apprendi applies to d
