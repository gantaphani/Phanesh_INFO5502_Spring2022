background 
in march,the bronx county family court entered an order requiring maloney to make child support payments of approximately to the commissioner of social services of the city of new york.the commissioner was to collect these payments on behalf of maloney wife,a of public assistance who was the custodial parent of maloney two children.when maloney failed to make the required payments,his wages were garnished.upon maloney request,however,the family court amended its payment order in to reduce the support obligation to weekly payments of like the original order,the amended order expressly warned that a willful failure to obey th e order could result in incarceration for criminal or contempt.
maloney moved to florida in,where over the course of several years he accumulated debts exceeding including money owed in child support.by the time he was charged in a criminal complaint in the summer of,maloney had not made a single voluntary payment of child support since the family court issued its original support order,and had not made payments by wage garnishment for at least seven years.he owed at that time over in child support.
on july,maloney pled guilty to charges that he willfully failed to pay child support in violation of a and c before sentencing,the united states probation office probation office prepared a presentence investigation report psr in accordance with the november guidelines.the probation office determined that pursuant to and its application note,maloney should be sentenced under.the office recommended a base offense level of six pursuant to a an increase of six levels under b d because the amount owed was more than but less than an increase of two levels under b c because the offense involved the violation of a prior judicial order and a reduction of two levels under a for acceptance of responsibility.because maloney was in criminal history category i,the calculation of an offense level of twelve yielded a recommended guidelines range of ten to sixteen months imprisonment.
in response to the psr,maloney counsel submitted a letter to the district court arguing,inter alia,that the enhancement proposed by the probation office under b c constituted impermissible double counting.in the alternative,maloney sought a downward departure of two levels based on a combination of factors,including maloney cooperation with government officials and the financial consequences that would befall his children if he were incarcerated and unable to work.after receiving a response letter from the government and hearing oral argument on maloney sentencing objections,the district court adopted the recommendations of the probation office and sentenced maloney to five months incarceration to be followed by one year of supervised release,of which five months would be spent in home confinement.maloney filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
maloney primary contention on appeal is that a enhancement pursuant to b c constitutes impermissible double counting when applied to enhance the sentence of a defendant convicted under,because the conduct triggering the of a court already taken into account in setting the base offense level of the charged crime.we review de novo a district court interpretation of the guidelines.see united states meskini,cir.we reach the double counting issue notwithstanding the fact that the guidelines are now only advisory,see booker.at,because the district court on remand remains under an obligation to consider the sentence that would have been imposed under the guidelines.crosby,at see id.at in order to fulfill its statutory duty to consider the guidelines,a sentencing judge will normally have to determine the applicable guidelines range.our resolution of maloney double counting objection on appeal will assist the district court in fulfilling that obligation.
though no guidelines provision has been promulgated specifically for violations of a child support obligation,appendix a of the guidelines provides that sentences for offenses under should be determined in accordance with.section,entitled contempt,provides that courts should apply,entitled other offenses.section,in turn,instructs courts to apply the most analogous offense guideline.pursuant to application note of,the most analogous guideline for offenses involving violations of is,the section that encompasses crimes involving theft,property destruction and fraud.importantly,the guidelines also provide that the incorporation of a guideline by requires incorporation of the entire guideline,including the base offense level,specific offense characteristics,cross references,and special instructions.thus,through these various provisions,the guidelines unmistakably provide that courts imposing sentences for offenses involving the willful failure to pay child support under should apply the general fraud guideline,including its enhancement provisions.
maloney argues that application of the enhancement under b c is nevertheless inappropriate because the conduct justifying that enhancement is already considered in setting the base offense level under a.that is,because violation of the child support obligation is precisely what triggers application of the base offense level provision,maloney contends that the district court engaged in impermissible double counting by adding a enhancement for the same conduct.we have repeatedly held,however,that a district court calculating a guidelines sentence may apply multiple guidelines provisions based on the same underlying conduct where that is the result clearly intended by congress and the sentencing commission.while such calculations may involve double counting in a literal sense,they do not involve impermissible double counting see,meskini,at this court has repeatedly recognized that it is within the sentencing commission and congress prerogative to adopt double counting impermissible double counting is the judicial augmentation of a defendant sentence in contravention of the applicable statute or sentencing guideline.citations and internal quotation marks omitted united states aska,cir united states,cir see also united states pedragh,cir explaining that double counting is certainly not improper if it serves a legitimate purpose intended by congress and the sentencing commission.here,as noted,congress and the sentencing commission have clearly instructed that judges imposing sentences for violation of should apply in its entirety,including both the base offense level set by a and the which b c forms part see.
moreover,we have consistently held that double counting is permissible in calculating a guidelines sentence where,as here,each of the multiple guidelines sections applicable to a single act serves a distinct purpose or represents a discrete harm.see united states castellanos,cir holding that a district court may base two aspects of a guidelines calculation on a single act where they serve different purposes united states volpe,cir m ultiple adjustments may properly be imposed when they aim at different harms emanating from the same conduct.united states shepardson,cir finding no impermissible double counting where the enhancement and base offense level each penalize d conceptually distinct notions related to sentencing united states campbell,d ouble counting is legitimate where a single act is relevant to two d
