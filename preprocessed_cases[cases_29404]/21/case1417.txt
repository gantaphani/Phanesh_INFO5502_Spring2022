background 
at the conclusion of a jury trial in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,the khalid awan awan was convicted of conspiring to provide material support and resources to be used in a conspiracy prohibited by a,to wit,a conspiracy to commit murder,kidnapping,or maiming outside the united states,in violation of providing material support and resources to be used in such a conspiracy,also in violation of u.and the international transfer of money with the intent to promote specific unlawful activity,to wit,murder and the destruction of property by means of explosive or fire as prohibited by india penal code sections and,in violation of a a.
the following facts are drawn from the evidence presented at trial,and are presented in the light most favorable to the government.see united states ivezaj,cir.the khalistan commando force kcf is a sikh terrorist organization responsible for carrying out murders and bombings in india.the organization seeks to compel the indian government to allow the creation of an independent sikh state in the punjab region of india.the kcf has engaged in bombings of indian security forces,buses,trains,and civilian economic targets resulting in the deaths of thousands in india since the beginning of the organization existence.the kcf is funded by means of illegal activities,such as bank robbery and kidnapping,as well as through contributions of supporters in north america and europe.since,the kcf has been led by paramjit singh panjwar panjwar.awan stated to others on several occasions that he was a close friend of panjwar and that he knew panjwar was a leader of the kcf.awan was also wiretapped by the government making phone calls to panjwar from the metropolitan detention center mdc in brooklyn,new york awan told a fellow inmate at the mdc,harjit singh harjit,that he knew that panjwar was involved in several hundred bombings,a plot to attack indian prime minister indira gandhi in and attacks on indian security forces in india,and that the kcf received training at camps in pakistan run by the pakistani intelligence service.
from through,using a variety of methods,awan served as a conduit for the transfer of funds from kcf supporters in the united states to panjwar.in particular,awan told harjit and admitted to investigators that he had transferred money to panjwar after meeting with a number of sources on several occasions.two members of the kcf funding network in the united states who cooperated with the government,gurbax singh gurbax and baljinder singh baljinder,also testified that they both had delivered money for kcf to awan on different occasions.baljinder later spoke to panjwar on the phone about delivering the money to awan,and panjwar told him that awan was a good friend of his and a trusted person who had done this work already.trial tr.awan told harjit and investigators that he used the bank accounts of several businesses to transfer the money to panjwar.
in or around and,while both were detained at the mdc,awan attempted to recruit harjit to travel to pakistan and receive explosives training at a kcf camp.awan discussed with harjit on several occasions traveling to pakistan to meet with panjwar and receiving training in bombmaking and military activities.government investigators also wiretapped phone conversations between awan and panjwar in which awan introduced harjit to panjwar and harjit and panjwar discussed harjit traveling to pakistan for military training.
in its proposed calculation of awan sentencing guidelines,the probation department recommended an adjusted offense level of for awan material support of terrorism counts,which included the application of a terrorism adjustment pursuant to.the department also recommended an adjusted offense level of for the international money transfer count,which also included the terrorism adjustment.this yielded an effective guidelines sentence of years,the statutory maximum sentence for awan counts.see united states awan,no,wl,at july.
the terrorism enhancement,provides as follows 
a if the offense is a felony that involved,or was intended to promote,a federal crime of terrorism,increase by levels but if the resulting offense level is less than level,increase to level.
b in each such case,the defendant criminal history category from chapter four criminal history and criminal livelihood shall be category vi.
application note provides that the term federal crime of terrorism is defined by the meaning given that term in g,which provides a definition.first,a federal crime of terrorism is an offense that is calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion,or to retaliate against government conduct.g a.second,the offense must be a violation of a specific federal criminal statute listed in g b.the list includes,inter alia,violations of a relating to conspiracy to murder,kidnap,or maim persons abroad and relating to providing material support to terrorists.id.g b i.awan was convicted of violating,and each count involved the provision of material support and resources to be used in a conspiracy to violate.violations of a a the international money transfer crime of which awan was convicted are not included in g b.
before sentencing,the government argued that the terrorism enhancement applied to all of awan counts because each count was intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism,namely a conspiracy to murder,kidnap,or maim persons abroad in violation of.sent.mem.further,the government argued that awan money laundering count was intended to promote an additional federal crime of terrorism,the provision of material resources and support in violation of.supp.sent.mem.finally,the government argued that awan substantive and conspiratorial material support crimes in violation of involved a federal crime of terrorism.id.at.awan challenged the application of the terrorism enhancement to any of his counts of conviction,arguing,inter alia,that his conduct did not satisfy the motivational element of g a,which defines a federal crime of terrorism as a statutorily specified offense calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion,or to retaliate against government conduct.def.obj.to psr.
the district court declined to apply either the involved or intended to promote prongs of to any of awan counts.first,because awan was convicted of a crime listed in u.g b,namely,providing and conspiring to provide material resources and support to be used in a conspiracy to commit murder,kidnapping,and maiming outside of the united states,in violation of,the district court found it unnecessary to consider whether awan third crime,transferring money internationally with the intent to promote unlawful activity in violation of,was intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism.the court reasoned s ince g b includes in the list of crimes whose violation may be a federal crime of terrorism,there is no need to determine whether the violation of is properly deemed a promotion of a federal crime of terrorism for the purposes of.awan,wl,at.as a result,the court apparently limited its analysis of the applicability of the terrorism enhancement to the involved prong of.the court noted that a federal crime of terrorism under requires both the commission of one of the enumerated crimes and a finding that the required motivational element set forth in g a has been met.id.at footnote omitted.next,the district court found that the evidence at trial and the facts stated in the presentence report psr were insufficient to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that awan actions satisfied the motivational element,that his conduct was calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government.id.quoting g a.thus,the district court determined that the involved prong was inapplicable and calculated awan guidelines range without the terrorism adjustment,resulting in a guidelines range of to months,id.at.the district court sentenced awan in principal part to months in prison.awan is now serving his sentence.
discussion 
we review a district court sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness,a standard akin to review for abuse of discretion.united states cavera,cir en banc quoting united states fernandez,cir.a district court is procedurally obligated to calculate and consider the sentencing guidelines in reaching an independent decision as to sentence.see gall united states,cavera,at observing that sentencing judges should begin all sentencing proceedings by calculating the applicable guidelines range before reaching individualized judgment in each case see also a.we review resulting questions of interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo.united states meskini,cir.when finding facts relevant to sentencing for guidelines calculation purposes,the district court is required to use the preponderance of the evidence standard.united states salazar,cir per curiam.we apply the clear error standard when evaluating a district court findings of fact.united states salim,cir.
the government argues that the district court committed two errors in its analysis of applicability.first,the government contends that the district court erred in considering only the involved prong of in concluding that no terrorism enhancement was warranted in this case,thereby ignoring alternative intended to promote prong.second,the government submits that in applying the involved prong,the district court clearly erred in concluding that awan conduct failed to satisfy the requirement set forth in g a that it be calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion,or to retaliate against government conduct what the district court termed the motivational element.awan,wl,at quoting cong.rec.we conclude that the district court committed procedural error in two respects.first,it erroneously concluded that the intended to promote prong was inapplicable if one of the crimes of conviction was a crime listed in g b.second,it erroneously concluded that the statutory definition of a federal crime of terrorism.g,which is incorporated into the guideline,requires the government to prove the defendant motive for committing the crime of conviction.
i.the intended to promote prong of 
interpreting 
canons of statutory construction ordinarily suggest that terms connected by a disjunctive be given separate meanings,unless the context dictates otherwise.reiter sonotone,see also mizrahi gonzales,cir.this principle applies with equal force to guidelines interpretation.the guidelines must be interpreted so no words are discarded as meaningless,redundant or surplusage.united states arnaout,cir see also united states mandhai,cir.thus,the disjunctive phrase from at issue here i f the offense involved,or was intended to promote,a federal crime of terrorism makes clear that the predicate offense must either involve a federal crime of terrorism or be intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism,and that each clause has a separate meaning.we start with the meaning of the involved prong,which,by comparison,illuminates the meaning of the intended to promote prong.
when interpreting the guidelines,we begin with the basic rules of statutory construction,and we give all terms in the guidelines their ordinary meanings unless there are persuasive reasons not to do so.united states mullings,cir per curiam.the ordinary meaning of involved is to have within or as part of itself,or to include.webster third new international dictionary see also arnaout,at the ordinary and plain meaning of involved means to include.mandhai,at the term involve means to include.as the sixth circuit has pointed out in construing,t he word involved occurs frequently throughout the guidelines,both in the substantive provisions and in the commentary,and is typically employed to mean included.united states graham,cir.for example,the aggravating role enhancement in a provides that i f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,increase by levels.a emphasis added see also graham,at collecting examples.thus,a defendant offense involves a federal crime of terrorism when his offense includes such a crime,the defendant committed,attempted,or conspired to commit a federal crime of terrorism as defined in g,or his relevant conduct includes such a crime.id.at see also united states stewart,cir arnaout,at t he word involved,as used in,signifies that where a defendant offense or relevant conduct includes a federal crime of terrorism as defined in g b,then is triggered.
turning to the intended to promote prong,we begin with the assumption that the intended to promote language means something different from the word involved.graham,at see also stewart,at mandhai,at the phrase or intended to promote in must have additional meaning.because is written as a disjunctive phrase and must be interpreted to avoid redundancy,the intended to promote prong must be applicable in some circumstances in which the involved prong is not,where the defendant offense or relevant conduct does not include a federal crime of terrorism.
the ordinary meaning of promote includes to bring or help bring into being,to contribute to the growth,enlargement,or prosperity of,or to encourage or further.webster third new international dictionary see also arnaout,at in its ordinary usage,promote means to help or encourage.according to the ordinary meaning of,then,an offense is intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism when the offense is intended to help bring about,encourage,or contribute to a federal crime of terrorism as that term is defined in g.see stewart,at the criminal conduct at issue need not itself meet the statutory definition of a federal crime of terrorism if a goal or purpose of the defendant act was to bring or help bring into being a crime listed in g b.alteration in original quoting mandhai,at arnaout,at t he word promote,as used in,signifies that where a defendant offense or relevant conduct helps or encourages a federal crime of terrorism as defined in g b,then is triggered.
the ordinary meaning of the intended to promote prong gives that clause a separate meaning from the involved prong of.the intended to promote prong applies where the defendant offense is intended to encourage,further,or bring about a federal crime of terrorism,even though the defendant own crime of conviction or relevant conduct may not include a federal crime of terrorism.and this has an important implication to qualify as a federal crime of terrorism that may serve as a predicate for a enhancement,an offense must be listed in g b and,in addition,it must be an offense that is calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion,or to retaliate against government conduct,as provided by g a.under the intended to promote prong,however,so long as the defendant offense was intended to encourage,further,or bring about a federal crime of terrorism as statutorily defined,the defendant himself does not have to commit an offense listed in g b,and the defendant offense need not itself be calculated as described in g a.see stewart,at graham,at pursuant to the intended to promote prong,the offense of conviction itself need not be a federal crime of terrorism.
a narrower reading of would defy common sense.if an offense can not be intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism unless the defendant himself committed one of the crimes specified in g b or committed a crime that was itself calculated to influence,affect,or retaliate against government conduct as required by g a,would not apply to defendants who clearly intend to promote federal crimes of terrorism committed by other persons.for example,as the gover
