gary woltmann pled guilty in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york platt,j.to one count of tax fraud.woltmann filed a notice of appeal challenging the sentence,and the government countered with a motion to dismiss,citing woltmann waiver of appeal in the plea agreement the agreement.we conclude that the waiver is unenforceable,and we vacate and remand to a different district judge for.
pursuant to the agreement,woltmann pled guilty in september.after signing the agreement but before sentencing,woltmann provided substantial assistance to the government in its ultimately successful prosecution of another criminal tax fraud case.in exchange for this cooperation,the government submitted a letter to the district court pursuant to urg ing the court to consider formulating a sentence below the advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment 
at a december,hearing december hearing,defense counsel and the government urged the district court to consider the letter and the factors enumerated in a when imposing sentence.notwithstanding these prompts,the district court deemed the letter an improper effort by the parties to repudiate,modify,or amend the agreement,and ruled that the agreement constituted woltmann consent to any sentence at or below months the upper limit of the appeal waiver provision.accordingly,the judge discounted the letter and the other factors enumerated in a.
at a hearing on january,january hearing,the district court sentenced woltmann principally to months imprisonment the low end of the guidelines range.in short succession,woltmann filed a notice of appeal in this court the government moved to dismiss on the basis of the appeal waiver provision in the agreement and woltmann moved for bail pending appeal.
on april,we granted woltmann bail motion.see united states woltmann,order.the government motion to dismiss was then submitted to this panel.because the facts,rules,and considerations that bear upon the motion likewise control the merits of the underlying appeal,we heard oral argument on the merits,and we resolve the merits together with the motion the government motion is denied,woltmann sentence is vacated,and the matter is remanded to a different district court judge for.
three provisions of the agreement have bearing on this appeal 
paragraph states that the applicable guidelines term of imprisonment is months.
paragraph acknowledges that the guidelines are advisory and the court is required to consider any applicable guidelines provisions as well as other factors enumerated in a to arrive at an appropriate sentence in this case.
paragraph contains an appeal waiver provision the defendant agrees not to appeal the conviction or sentence in the event that the court imposes a term of imprisonment of months or below.this waiver is binding without regard to the sentencing analysis used by the court.
provisions like these are common,and their inclusion in the agreement is unexceptional.
at the december hearing,the government reiterated its position,expressed in the letter,that the court should impose a sentence due to woltmann substantial assistance.see,tr.of december hearing at.the district court refused.it viewed the agreement as the governing or controlling instrument,id.at,and reasoned that the government advocacy of a sentence on the basis of the letter was an impermissible attempt to repudiate,modify,or amend the agreement,id.at.the district court felt free to ignore the letter and the factors because woltmann had ostensibly consented to such and such a sentence by agreeing both to the guidelines calculation in paragraph and the appeal waiver in paragraph.id.at.in effect,the district court believed that because of the appeal waiver,any sentence at or below months was appropriate,regardless of whether or how the letter and the a bear on the sentence.
at the january sentencing hearing,the district court stated that it had considered the a greement that was made with the government and the provision that we just read,paragraph four,the appeal waiver provision,and the court feels that under the circumstances here and the family circumstances that an month sentence is an appropriate one.tr.of january hearing at.the court also intimated,as it had done at the december hearing,that consideration of the letter would constitute an impermissible repudiation of the agreement 
defense counsel i would just like to point out to the court,judge,first,that all of the guideline calculations were based upon an estimate prior to any cooperation or letter.
the court are you saying he wants to repudiate the plea agreement 
woltmann filed a notice of appeal,and the government moves to dismiss citing the appeal waiver in paragraph of the agreement.woltmann in turn argues that the district court treatment of the letter and the a factors requires us to vacate the sentence and remand for.we agree.
plea agreements are reviewed in accordance with principles of contract law.united states vaval,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we consider the reasonable understanding of the parties as to the terms of the agreement.united states colon,cir.moreover,because plea agreements are unique contracts,we temper the application of ordinary contract principles with special due process concerns for fairness and the adequacy of procedural safeguards.united states granik,cir internal quotation marks omitted.such contracts are narrowly construed.id.
it is a legal principle that the sentencing judge is of course not bound by the estimated range in a plea agreement.united states hamdi,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to the contrary,before imposing sentence,a district court must consider both a letter if one is proffered,united states campo,cir per curiam,and the factors enumerated in a,gall united states.
ordinarily,appeal waivers are for good reason.see united states morgan,cir explaining that voiding such waivers would render the plea bargaining process and the resulting agreement meaningless internal quotation marks omitted united states,cir t he benefits of such waivers inure to both government and the defendant alike,with the government receiving the benefit of reduced litigation,and the defendant receiving some certainty with respect to his liability and punishment.united states yemitan,cir if this waiver does not preclude a challenge to the sentence as unlawful,then the covenant not to appeal becomes meaningless and would cease to have value as a bargaining chip in the hands of defendants.but we will not enforce an appeal waiver sentencing decision was reached in a manner that the plea agreement did not anticipate,united states,cir see also united states roque,cir suggesting that an appeal waiver would be unenforceable if the defendant failed to underst an d fully the consequences of his bargain,both in terms of what he was gaining and what he was giving up,or where the sentencing court failed to enunciate any rationale for the defendant sentence,thus amounting to an abdication of judicial responsibility subject to mandamus,at brackets and internal quotation marks omitted.
applying these principles,we hold that vacatur is required because the district court improperly relied on the agreement to the exclusion of the letter and the a factors and misread the agreement as manifesting woltmann enforceable concession that any sentence at or below months obviated the need to consider the letter and the a factors.in so doing,the district court failed to give effect to the parties expectations and deprived woltmann of the benefit that he and the government agreed he would receive from signing the agreement,a weighing of the letter and the factors.at the same time,the court also abdicated its judicial responsibility in the way posited by,f d at.
as the transcript of the december hearing unambiguously shows,the district court felt itself entitled to rely on the agreement notwithstanding our law that such reliance is misplaced.see hamdi,at.for example,when the government raised the letter at the outset of the hearing,the court responded t his is all very good,but we this case off,with an agreement that you and counsel for the defenda
