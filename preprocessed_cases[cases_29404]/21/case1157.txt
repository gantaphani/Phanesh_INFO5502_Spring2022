a federal sentence ordinarily may not be modified once it has been imposed.b.an exception to this rule of finality arises when a defendant has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by a retroactive amendment to the united states sentencing guidelines,id.c,and the guideline range applicable to the defendant has been lowered as a result,a.under those circumstances,a district court may modify the term of imprisonment based upon the amended guideline range.b.
this appeal calls on us to determine whether a defendant who has received a sentence modification is eligible for a further modification when,as a result of a subsequent guidelines amendment,his revised guideline range is lower than that applied at his original sentencing but not lower than the range applied at his prior sentence modification.leroy derry was originally sentenced in to a term of months imprisonment based on a guideline range of months to life.in,he received a sentence modification based upon amendment,which lowered the base offense level for his crack cocaine convictions and thereby reduced his guideline range to to months.in,he sought a second modification based on amendment,which again lowered the base offense level but,because of the guidelines grouping procedures,yielded the same guideline range as before.the united states district court for the district of connecticut shea,concluded that derry was ineligible for a second sentence modification because amendment did not further reduce his guideline range below that applied at his prior modification.derry contends that he is eligible because his amended guideline range is lower than the range applied at his original sentencing.
we hold that when a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment that has been modified pursuant to c,his sentence is based on the guideline range applied at his most recent sentence modification,rather than the range applied at his original sentencing.because derry sentence is based on a guideline range of to months and that range has not subsequently been lowered by amendment,he is ineligible for a sentence modification.the judgment of the district court is accordingly affirmed.

discussion 
because a sentence incorporated in a judgment of conviction is final,courts are generally precluded from modifying a sentence once it has been imposed.b,c.congress has,however,recognized an exception when the sentencing commission has issued a retroactive amendment,such as the amendments reducing the crack cocaine guidelines,that would have reduced the defendant guideline range had it been in place when the defendant was initially sentenced.specifically,a court is authorized to modify an otherwise final sentence,on a motion or its own initiative,
in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the sentencing commission pursuant to o after considering the factors set forth in section a to the extent they are applicable,if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.
c the commission applicable policy statement appears at and provides that a court may modify a sentence i n a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment,and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the guidelines manual listed in subsection d.a a defendant is thus eligible for a modification if he has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a guideline range that has subsequently been lowered by an enumerated,retroactive amendment,and the guideline range applicable to him has been lowered as a result.
to determine whether and to what extent a reduction is warranted,a district court must calculate the amended guideline range that would have been applicable to the defendant if the amendment s to the guidelines listed in d had been in effect at the time the defendant was sentenced.id.b.in so doing,the court is directed to substitute only the amendments for the corresponding guideline provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and to leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.id.if the court concludes that the defendant is eligible for a sentence modification based upon the amended guideline range,it should proceed to determine whether,in its discretion,a reduction is warranted in light of the applicable a factors and the defendant circumstances,including conduct.c cmt.b i iii see also dillon united states,describing this process.thus,c does not authorize a plenary sentencing or resentencing proceeding,dillon,at,but rather empowers district judges to correct sentences that depend on frameworks that later prove unjustified by reducing a sentence in circumstances specified by the commission,freeman united states,plurality opinion.
we now consider whether derry is eligible for a sentence modification based upon amend
