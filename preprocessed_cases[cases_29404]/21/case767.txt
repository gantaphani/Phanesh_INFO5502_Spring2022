introduction 
after a bench trial,wayne shelton was convicted of aggravated bank robbery.on appeal,he challenges the district court rejection of his insanity defense and the reasonableness of a sentence of months.after a thorough review of the record,we affirm.
ii.factual background 
a.the robbery 
wayne shelton was indicted by a grand jury for bank robbery using force and violence in violation of a and d.shelton waived his right to a jury trial.during the bench trial,the government presented evidence of the following facts.
on august,the day before the robbery,shelton cased the bank rhode island in east providence,a federally insured bank,by observing it from across the street for two hours.just before the robbery,he again sat across the street watching the bank for in excess of two hours.then,at about on august,shelton burst into the bank brandishing a pellet gun,which looked like a real handgun,and wearing a pair of sunglasses,a hat,and a bandana over his face.pointing the gun,he methodically demanded large bills from each of the four tellers,who gave him.while stuffing the money into a duffle bag,shelton placed his gun down,but before fleeing the bank,he retrieved it.he placed the gun and his disguise into the duffle bag,then hopped onto a mountain bicycle.
a police officer,who had heard reports describing the bank robber,spotted shelton on his bike several blocks from the bank,and ordered him to stop.shelton ignored the command.abandoning the mountain bike,shelton continued to flee on foot.after chasing shelton for two blocks,a second officer captured and arrested shelton in a backyard,still holding the duffle bag with the money and the pellet gun.it was hot,and all were sweating and winded from the chase.
during the booking,shelton initially refused to answer questions.later,he identified himself with a false name and false date of birth.after arrival at the cell block,an officer requested an ambulance for shelton to check on his.en route to the hospital for medical attention in the ambulance,shelton told the officer,i will get away from you.i have done this in the past and i got away.later that evening,he admitted his true name after being confronted by a police officer who recognized him.
b.the insanity defense 
shelton presented an insanity defense.the defendant testified about his memory of the events on the day of the bank robbery as follows.he awoke to find himself sitting behind a garage and did know why he was there.thirsty and confused,he reached into his duffle bag to get a drink.instead,when he opened his bag,he found money.at that exact moment,he was approached by a police officer.startled,shelton began to run,but he was tackled shortly thereafter by the officer and hit so hard he passed out,only to regain consciousness at a hospital.he has no memory of the robbery or of being at the police station.
shelton offered evidence of his difficult life.his mother was murdered when he was only fifteen years of age.he said that he hears imaginary voices,particularly a female voice who likes to start trouble and chastise him,and that he has blacked out in the past while committing acts of vandalism and violence.prior to his arrest for the bank robbery,he had been arrested and incarcerated twice for receiving stolen goods,and the police had wrongfully seized some items of his personal property including a playstation video game device during a search and refused to return them despite a court order to do so.during this prior interaction with the police,shelton also had used an alias.shelton admitted disliking the police for refusing to return his dvds,playstation,and other items.
defendant recounted two instances where he did something violent and then did remember.when he was thirteen and living in a group home,he broke a chair on another occasion,he kicked his girlfriend car door.neither time did he remember the event immediately afterwards.
expert testimony 
each side submitted expert testimony on shelton mental state.defense expert ronald stewart,a psychiatrist,reviewed records from the group homes shelton had lived in as a child and reviewed the report of the government psychiatric expert,richard frederick.stewart examined shelton on two occasions.he concluded that the defendant suffered from a major depressive disorder with psychotic features that is,auditory hallucinations,stress disorder,and dissociative reaction,all of which rendered him incapable of knowing the wrongfulness of his behavior on the date of the robbery.stewart opinion was based,in large part,on shelton statements that he experienced auditory hallucinations,had no memory of the bank robbery,and had an extreme anger at the police due to the prior seizure of his gameboy a portable video game device which was the center of his universe.moreover,stewart testified about shelton prior personal history,including the murder of his mother who herself had schizophrenia,as did his two uncles sexual abuse physical beatings about the head by his father resulting in loss of consciousness longstanding depression and borderline intellectual functioning with an iq of.in stewart opinion,defendant was not aware of the bank robbery as it was happening.he testified that defendant was so preoccupied with the elements of his psychosis,which include auditory hallucinations,that though he may have been doing what appeared to be purposeful behavior,it is very unlikely that he had any understanding of the wrongfulness of his behaviors 
countering this testimony,the government introduced testimony from richard frederick,a clinical psychologist at the medical center for federal prisoners in springfield,missouri with an expertise in feigned psychopathology and cognitive impairments.shelton arrived at springfield in november and left in april.frederick placed shelton on medication designed to alleviate depression and psychotic symptoms.according to frederick,shelton reaction to the medication was inconsistent with that of a patient actually suffering from the claimed conditions.for example,shelton stated that his medication had no effect on his symptoms of depression and psychosis,though some reaction would normally be expected.when shelton was discovered cheeking,or not swallowing,his medication,treatment was discontinued.in another incident recounted by frederick,shelton exhibited a marked change in manner when allowed to speak to his sister over the energy level changed instantly.this observed ability to turn it on and turn it off suggested to frederick that defendant was probably faking his symptoms.
frederick observations over those weeks and his review of other medical reports and witness statements from the crime led him to conclude that shelton suffered from a schizoid personality disorder,which is not a major mental illness and would not prevent him from appreciating the nature and quality of his actions.frederick further opined that stewart diagnosis of dissociative disorder was unlikely,given that such a condition is both rare and obvious to observers.for instance,dissociative disorder is characterized by a vacant stare,and while patients suffering with that condition may be able to engage in repetitive behavior,they wo be able to respond to a new situation.shelton did not display a vacant stare and was observed engaging in purposeful behavior with a rational motive over the course of the robbery.frederick characterized shelton claim that he did remember the robbery as absurd,pointing out that the defendant fails to recall only those matters that involve criminal behavior.everything else he seems to be okay with.frederick concluded that shelton also did not suffer from stress disorder.
after pointing out that stewart did not know defendant had cased the bank the day before or that he took the disguise off after the robbery,the district court discredited defendant expert 
he knew almost no facts about the actual robbery.he spent little time discussing it with the defendant and stated that he assumed that the defendant was telling him the truth when he claimed to have no memory of the bank robbery and of hearing voices.
stewart did not look at the police reports,the video of the
