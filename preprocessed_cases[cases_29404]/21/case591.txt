adam stone appeals his sentence of years in federal prison on one count of knowingly transporting and shipping child pornography in interstate or foreign commerce,in violation of a and a.after careful review of the record,we affirm.
background 
we draw the facts from the presentence investigation report psr,the evidence presented in anticipation of the sentencing hearing,and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.united states,cir united states santos,cir.
illinois police created a internet account in the name of.the publicly available profile stated that was a fifteen girl.on february,stone,acting under the username,contacted and asked if she had any girl pics to share.the police detective sent stone a picture of a fully clothed girl.stone asked if she had ever seen a man naked,as well as if she had ever masturbated or watched a man do so.
on february,stone contacted again and asked her if she had any pics of other girls.stone asked to view his photo album,which contained images,including dozens of images that the police detective believed were minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
the next day,stone contacted again.he asked her about her sexual history,bra size,and for more pictures of herself.stone also transmitted a web camera picture of himself,which the police detective used in confirming stone identity.
on march,during another conversation,stone provided a link to an online photo album.the album contained dozens of images of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
after several other shorter communications from stone,on april,stone sent a message stating,i added albums between yesterday and today,check em out.the detective viewed the two new albums,which included many images of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.
on april,stone again contacted and offered to masturbate in front of his web camera.the detective then observed stone masturbating.
after federal officers executed a search warrant at stone residence in june,stone admitted that he had downloaded child pornography from the internet and had shared that pornography in online photo albums.his computer was seized,and it was found to contain many images,including images of children under twelve and images involving sadistic and masochistic conduct.
more than two years later,on january,the government filed a information charging stone with violating a and a that same day,stone waived the indictment and pled guilty to the information.
a psr was prepared.it recommended a base offense level of.the psr recommended applying a enhancement because the material involved a prepubescent minor,see b a enhancement because stone distributed the material to someone he believed to be a minor,see id.b c a enhancement because the material included images of sadistic or masochistic conduct,see id.b a enhancement because the offense involved the use of a computer,see id.b and a enhancement because the offense involved more than images,see id.b d crediting stone with a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,the psr computed stone total offense level at.given stone criminal history category of i,the advisory guidelines range was to months of imprisonment 
stone did not object to these computations,but asked the district court to impose a sentence.first,stone challenged the guideline range itself as unreasonable by arguing that the current version of,which governed his offense,was shaped in part by congressional directives to the sentencing commission.stone asserted that is flawed because this congressional input preempted the commission ability to do the job for which it was created.he challenged,categorically,the rationale for the computer enhancement.he also noted that his guideline range exceeded that for second degree murder,and observed that it was not reasonable to sentence offenders at a level near the statutory maximum.
second,stone argued that a guideline sentence was unreasonably harsh in his case.he argued that he downloaded pornography indiscriminately,had only a few sadistic or masochistic images,and did not seek them out.he noted that he had not physically harmed anyone,and was not shown to have distributed to any actual minors.stone argued that in the two and a half years between his arrest and sentencing,he had sought employment,maintained a relationship with his fiancee,and renounced his prior actions.stone argued that he posed no risk to anyone.
the government admitted that the guideline range was extremely harsh,but argued that a sentence at the low end of the guideline range would be appropriate,considering the facts that led to the enhancements.
the district court adopted the psr calculations.early in the hearing,the district court recognized it could impose a sentence when it said it had to determine whether to sentence stone within the guidelines or outside the guidelines.the district court later considered stone challenge to the guidelines themselves 
but the defendant argument that the because the guidelines are a direct response to congressional mandates that somehow that diminishes their impact is not an argument that the court can accept.in many ways,the fact that the guidelines are a direct reflection of a congressional expression of popular will is an argument in favor,not against the imposition of a guideline sentence.congress is,after all,the elected representatives of the people of this country,and has made policy choices about this type of crime,and those choices are reflected in the guideline range.it is not this court constitutional role to congressional policy decisions simply because they expressed in the guidelines,and it is this court constitutional role to express the will of the people of this country as expressed by congress.on this crime,the will of the people is,i must say,exceedingly clear.
although the court recognized that an argument can be made that congress has been particularly punitive,it concluded that stone actions warranted severe punishment since he contributed to the market for child pornography and because of his conduct with.the court then proceeded to discuss the guidelines further 
i want to be clear.i not suggesting that i feel i am bound by the guidelines.i have the authority under booker and under to go outside the guidelines.but in doing so,i am required to consider the guidelines themselves,the policies underlying the guidelines,and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities,and the policies themselves,as reflected by congressional directives,seem especially clear here.
the district court then analyzed the case,starting with the offender.it noted stone lack of criminal history,intact family background,and the absence of any substance abuse problem.it commented that there nothing in this defendant history or background that would predict he would be standing in front of this court facing a prison term of over years.the court later also noted stone rehabilitative efforts.
the court turned to the offense.the court found stone possessed a staggering volume of child pornography.the court noted exemplars of the child pornography that stone possessed 
the two exemplars that were attached to the prosecution version,which the defendant admitted to,are abhorrent.there one in particular that shows a very young girl,maybe years old or so,engaged in sex with an adult male.the picture depicts her placing her hands over her eyes as if to block out what was happening to her.the digital image is simply haunting,and that image calls in any adult an overwhelming need to protect that little girl.she is young,and she defenseless,and the adults who should be protecting her are violating her.so the court has considered the need to protect victims like that young girl in imposing a sentence today.
the district court also found that stone encouraged the distribution of child pornography through his online sharing of albums,and found disturbing stone conduct with.the court had earlier described this conduct as abuse that endangered a minor.
the court weighed the factors 
this combination of circumstances requires,in the court view,a long term in prison.the factors include the age of the victims,the volume of the images,the defendant sharing of the images with others,the defendant sexual chat with a person he believed was years old,and finally,the defendant engaging in actual sexual activity and transmitting that activity to a person he believed was.
with all these factors that militate in favor of a severe punishment,the court also notes there no allegation the defendant actually sexually abused any minor.he has no history of sexual abuse.his inappropriate conduct was wholly.
the court expressed its hope that a better way could be found to deal with similar crimes in the future,but that for right now,the congressional directive is very,very clear,as are the guidelines,and if you done what you have done,the guidelines advise a very,very harsh sentence.w ith some reservations,the court imposed a sentence at the bottom of the guideline range,months.
stone filed a timely notice of appeal.
ii.discussion 
we review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion,but we first consider whether the court below committed a significant procedural error,such as treating the guidelines as mandatory.united states decologero,cir quoting gall united states,d.accordingly,we will first address stone argument that the district court did not properly understand its sentencing discretion under kimbrough united states,d.then we will consider whether the sentence the district court imposed was unreasonable.
kimbrough sentencing discretion 
reviewing kimbrough error 
we review for abuse of discretion,and procedural errors amounting to an abuse of discretion might include failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.united states innarelli,cir quoting united states politano,cir.
kimbrough makes manifest that sentencing courts possess sufficient discretion under section a to consider requests for variant sentences premised on disagreements with the manner in which the sentencing guidelines operate.united states rodríguez,cir reversing,in light of kimbrough,our prior precedent forbidding district courts from constructing variant sentences to take account of disparities attributable to the program.as the supreme court has emphasized,the point of kimbrough is to recognize district courts authority to vary from the crack cocaine guidelines based on policy disagreement with them,and not simply based on an individualized determination that they yield an excessive sentence in a particular case.spears united states,d.and our precedent has interpreted kimbrough as supplying this power even where a guideline provision is a direct reflection of a congressional directive.rodríguez,at rejecting the government arguments that district courts were forbidden from disagreeing with the disparity attributable to fast track programs since congress had specifically approved such programs,and concluding that kimbrough had opened the door for sentencing courts to deviate from the guidelines in individual cases notwithstanding congress competing policy pronouncements 
thus,after kimbrough,a district court makes a procedural error when it fails to recognize its discretion to vary from the guideline range based on a categorical policy disagreement with a guideline.united states gibbons,cir united states boardman,cir using kimbrough to vacate and remand a sentence where a district court concluded it was bound by certain career offender guidelines rodríguez,at.we have interpreted kimbrough as giving district courts discretion to disagree with many guidelines,not just the crack cocaine guidelines at issue in kimbrough.united states vanvliet,cir remanding where a district court refused to impose a variant sentence based on its policy disagreement with a sentencing enhancement relating to the use of a computer boardman,at rodríguez,at.
stone kimbrough argument 
stone argues that the district court erred in failing to recognize its discretion to disagree with the guidelines covering child pornography crimes,particularly the high base offense level,the computer enhancement,and the high overall offense level resulting from the combined imposition of the various enhancements.in particular,stone argues that kimbrough indicated that one ground for a district court to disagree with a guideline provision would be that the guideline was based on something other than the sentencing commission ordinary empirical approach.see kimbrough.at.
stone makes a detailed historical argument,explaining that the child pornography guidelines are based on congressional directives,and not on the commission empirical approach.he notes that since was adopted on april,the base offense level has increased from thirteen to and the enhancements applicable to a defendant in stone position from two to eighteen stone also notes that a number of district courts have exercised their kimbrough discretion to give the child pornography guideline range less deference 
appraising the district court actions 
the government does not challenge stone argument that a sentencing judge has the discretion to reject the child pornography guidelines on this basis.rather,the government argues that the district court understood its discretion and simply was not persuaded to use its kimbrough power in this case.and,as is clear,the district court broad discretion obviously includes the power to agree with the guidelines.gibbons,at quoting united states,cir unpublished.
thus,the issue for us to resolve is simply whether the district court failed to appreciate its kimbrough discretion or whether it understood but declined to use it.stone argues that the district court explicitly held that it lacked the discretion to disagree with the applicable guidelines.stone points to the sentencing hearing where the court said that stone argument is not an argument that the court can accept and that it was not this court constitutional role to congressional policy decisions simply because they expressed in the guidelines,and it is this court constitutional role to express the will of the people of this country as expressed by congress.
the government counters that the district court explicitly and repeatedly recognized that it was not bound by the guidelines.the government characterizes the above two comments as substantive rejections of stone request to afford less deference to the guidelines since they were based on congressional policy.as to the first comment,the government argues that the sentencing court used the phrase i can not accept that to mean i reject that.and the government notes another case where we have recognized this exact verbal distinction.see decologero,at considering the sentencing record as a whole to conclude that when the court said it can not give credit for a prior sentence,it nonetheless recognized its discretion but simply indicated its decision not to take the prior sentence into account.the government explains away the second comment by reasoning that the sentencing court was not saying that it was required to follow congressional will,but only that it found persuasive the argument that it should follow such policy.in sum,the government argues that the sentencing judge made a permissible determination that he would value guidelines which reflected the will of the people,acting through congress.
this is a closer case than others where we have been called upon to examine alleged kimbrough error.the district court did not explicitly acknowledge its kimbrough power.on the other hand,the district court never lamented its lack of discretion to categorically disagree with the guidelines.in the cases stone relies upon,where we have remanded for resentencing in light of kimbrough error,the sentencing court clearly expressed a belief that it lacked discretion.vanvliet,at,vacating where the district court expressed a disagreement with an enhancement and expressed its belief it could not disagree with its application boardman,at vacating where a district court followed a guideline,as interpreted by this court,though it disagreed with it,since the district court did not,before kimbrough,believe it had the power to disagree rodríguez,at vacating where the district court said it had no authority to disregard the advisory guideline sentencing range on this ground see also united states rivera,cir per curiam unpublished vacating where the district judge repeatedly criticized the sentence as too long but nonetheless imposed it because,before kimbrough,it believed that it could not vary below the already reduced guideline range without creating an unwarranted sentencing disparity.
in the absence of a clear statement showing kimbrough error,we must review the record as a whole to assess the district court sentencing process.see decologero,at.this review yields several conclusions.first,at the district court,stone squarely made his argument that the guidelines were bad policy.the district court response was not to reject the argument out of hand,but rather to engage it.the district court considered the severity of the crime,the harshness of the sentence,and the benefit of guidelines that reflected democratic will.it was in discussing these concerns that the court said that stone argument was not one it can accept.this context indicates that the court fully considered the argument and decided not to accept it thus,on the whole,the following facts all suggest the absence of kimbrough error at the time of the sentencing kimbrough had been on the books for four months a kimbrough argument was clearly made the district court did not indicate that it believed it lacked discretion but rather,it analyzed the argument.
second,the district court clearly understood that it could impose a variant sentence under the advisory guidelines.of course,it did not specifically state that it could vary based on a categorical disagreement with the guidelines.and it is true that a district court understanding that the guidelines are advisory does not necessarily demonstrate that the court understood its kimbrough discretion.boardman,at rejecting the government argument that the district court variant sentence,under united states booker,d,could be affirmed against a charge of kimbrough error,reasoning the question is discretion to deviate on what grounds,and we think the district court without the benefit of kimbrough clarification underestimated what it was entitled to do emphasis in original.
nonetheless,both the district court recognition of its power to impose a variant sentence and its rejection of the proposed ground for such a variance are relevant.though the district court knew it could vary from the guidelines,it saw no reason to do so as it ultimately concluded that the harsh sentence fit the severe crime.see,united states saunders,cir rejecting a kimbrough argument based on a fair reading of the sentencing transcript where it was evident from the judge overall comments that he was aware of his ability to fashion a sentence that differed from the guideline range,and that,in his view,it was not appropriate to deviate from the guidelines in this case given the extent of the marijuana distribution operation united states olivero,cir finding no kimbrough error where the court concluded there was no reason to depart from the guidelines.to be sure,kimbrough authorizes categorical disagreements,but it also contemplates judges making these policy disagreements tied to the facts of a specific case.at.
here,the district court decision not to vary in light of its recognition that the guidelines were advisory makes it apparent that the district court did not believe that a guideline sentence was excessive as applied to stone.rather,the court felt that the combination of circumstances requires,in the court view,a long term in prison.so,the record shows the district court was not struggling against the guidelines in a way that it very likely would have if it had believed it could not categorically depart,regardless of whether the guidelines application was too harsh.this conclusion is consistent with,and therefore bolsters our conclusion that the sentencing court simply did not accept stone argument that it should disagree with the guidelines.
this leads to a third point.stone argues that if we affirm we must stretch to interpret the district court statement that it is not this court constitutional role to congressional policy decisions simply because they expressed in the guidelines as saying though it is this court role to such policy decisions,i chose not to.but the matter is more nuanced.as we have noted above,a district court is free to agree with the guidelines or,at least,some particular guideline.part of this freedom must be a freedom to agree with the guidelines because the sentencing court believes that the guidelines express some societal wisdom beyond what an entirely unrestricted sentencing judge might possess.thus,part of the sentencing court broad discretion must be the discretion to conclude that guidelines are convincing for various reasons,including that they reflect popular will.
stone argues that this conclusion is inconsistent with kimbrough,which recognized the fact that the crack cocaine guidelines were based on congressional policy,rather than empirical study by the commission,as one ground permitting a variant sentence.but the converse of this proposition is not true.even though a guideline is affected by congressional adjustment,a sentencing court may rely on it.see gibbons,at.we see no reason why it would be somehow invalid for a district court,in its broad sentencing discretion,to conclude that its reason for rejecting a kimbrough variance is that it values congressional input.if these results seem inconsistent,it is only because a sentencing court discretion is so broad.after kimbrough,the law allows one judge to find that congressional input makes a sentence less empirical,and so less appropriate,while another judge may reasonably find such input makes the sentence more reflective of democratic judgments of culpability,and so more reasonable.kimbrough itself specifically acknowledged the disparity the broad discretion it confers would create.see rivera.at in particular,the kimbrough court expressly recognized that its holding might create sentencing disparity between similarly situated defendants,depending on individual judges differing policy views,but characterized any such disparity as a necessary cost of the remedy quoting kimbrough.at 
we conclude that the district court statements here are best understood as expressing the view that it continues to value congressional policy statements in sentencing.for example,when making the statements that stone highlights,the court also said,in many ways,the fact that the guidelines are a direct reflection of a congressional expression of popular will is an argument in favor,not against the imposition of a guideline sentence.the court continued by observing that congress had made policy choices,reflected in the guidelines,about this type of crime.these additional remarks show that the court was expressing its decision to agree with congress,not any belief that it was required to defer to congress.specifically,the court use of the phrase argument in favor shows that it was open to considering categorical arguments for and against applying the guidelines.in sum,the district court certainly saw the guideline sentence as harsh,even punitive.but the court also observed that the offense was severe.though the district court knew it could impose a variant sentence,it decided not to do so.rather than conclude that the guidelines were too punitive,the district court believed that there was value in deferring to congress calibration of severe penalty for serious offense.and,as we have explained,this is a determination it could make under its broad discretion.
in conclusion,though stone can point to some quotes which appear to support his position,a review of the entire record has convinced us otherwise.the sentencing court considered stone kimbrough argument,did not explicitly doubt its own kimbrough power,was not offended by the harsh sentence,but rather expressed a preference for using guidelines based on congressional policy choices in the context of evaluating the level of culpability equating a serious crime with a severe punishment.thus,there was no procedural error.
substantive reasonableness 
we turn to stone challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.
standard of review 
the supreme court has given guidance on how a district court should arrive at a sentence the court must compute the guidelines,which are the starting point and the initial benchmark,but which may not be presumed reasonable.gall.at.then,the court considers the parties arguments,after which it makes an individualized assessment based on the facts presented,considering all of the factors under a.id.at.the court must explain the sentence,and any major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.id.
in reviewing this ultimate determination,we examine the district court contemporaneous oral explanation of the sentence,its written statement of reasons,and what fairly can be gleaned by comparing what was argued by the parties or proffered in the psi report with what the sentencing court ultimately did.united states martin,cir citations omitted.we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence,taking into account the totality of the circumstances.id.at.on review,the court of appeals should give due deference to the district court reasoned and reasonable decision that the a factors,on the whole,justified the sentence.gall.at.i t is not a basis for reversal that we,if sitting as a court of first instance,would have sentenced the defendant differently.martin,at rejecting a government argument that a sentence was unreasonable.this deference reflects the district court superior coign of vantage,greater familiarity with the individual case,the opportunity to see and hear the principals and the testimony at first hand,and the cumulative experience garnered through the sheer number of district court sentencing proceedings that take place day by day.id.there are a range of reasonable sentences,and we may not vacate unless the sentence falls outside that range.id.thus,sentencing is a judgment call based on a complex of factors whose interplay and precise weight can not even be precisely described.id.quoting united states,cir en banc.the linchpin of our review of that judgment call is a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible result.id.at.
this substantive reasonableness review also applies to sentences.united states van anh,cir see also gall.at w hile the extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended guidelines range is surely relevant,courts of appeals must review all inside,just outside,or significantly outside the guidelines a deferential standard.in this circuit,a sentence is not presumed to be reasonable,yet a defendant who attempts to brand a sentence as unreasonable must carry a heavy burden.van anh,at quoting united states pelletier,cir.in specifying this burden,we have said that a defendant challenging a sentence must adduce fairly powerful mitigating reasons and persuade us that the district judge was unreasonable in balancing pros and cons despite the latitude implicit in saying that a sentence must be reasonable.united states beatty,cir quoting united states,cir.
discussion 
here,we see a plausible rationale and a defensible result.we start with the rationale.our review of the sentencing transcript reveals that the district court considered the advisory guidelines,weighed the relevant factors,and explained why it thought a harsh sentence was appropriate.first,as is proper,the court computed the guideline range and heard stone argument on how to value the guidelines advice.the court discussed stone background and noted that it revealed no explanation for his conduct.the court acknowledged stone efforts.the court also considered the circumstances of the crime,observing that it was troubled by stone conduct with.though it recognized there was no allegation of actual abuse of a minor,it saw stone actions towards as abusive.stone maintenance of online albums further encouraged the distribution of child pornography to others.the court especially noted one exemplar of a very young girl was simply haunting and called forth an overwhelming need to protect the victim.considering that need,and that stone actions encouraged distribution,the district court concluded that a long term was necessary.the court recognized that the enhancements led to a guideline range that was a very,very severe punishment.again noting the congressional directive,the court,with some reservations,decided to impose a sentence at the bottom end of the guideline range.
as discussed above,the record thus reveals that the district court fully acknowledged the harshness of the sentence.yet,stone conduct with and the nature and volume of his collection of pornography caused the district court to conclude that the guideline punishment reasonably fit the crime.it does appear that the district court drew some degree of comfort in this finding by placing value in the fact that congress had also deemed stone crime serious.but,as we have explained above,a district court may look to such sources to help inform its weighing of crime and punishment.the district court also considered and was unmoved by possible mitigating factors.united states olhovsky,cir finding a below guideline sentence for child pornography to be unreasonably high,considering that the district court did not adequately consider mitigating factors and was so offended by the nature of olhovsky conduct that it sentenced the offense at the expense of determining an appropriate sentence for the offender.thus,the district court here reasonably found that the guideline punishment was appropriate for the grave offense.
though there can be no question that the result is stern,it is defensible.stone high guideline range resulted from the many enhancements applied.each of these enhancements captured an independent aspect of the wrongfulness of stone actions.first,the material he possessed involved victims who were particularly young.second,he distributed the material to someone he believed to be a minor.third,the material he possessed contained sadistic images that the sentencing court could reasonably find to be more dangerous to society because of the suffering caused by their production.fourth,he possessed a large volume of images.and finally,he used a computer.though stone challenges the fairness of this computer enhancement,we have explained that the district court has discretion to follow the guidelines.were we to find the computer enhancement unreasonable on these facts,we would essentially be holding that district courts must always reject that enhancement.this we will not do.thus,in this case,the sentencing enhancements fairly captured different dimensions of stone conduct.and,beyond the facts underlying the enhancements,stone conduct was not limited to simple distribution,but rather entailed probing sexual questions and a lewd performance for someone he believed to be a minor.the combination of harms caused by stone conduct,as measured along these many dimensions,could reasonably lead a sentencing judge to find a need to impose a year sentence.
stone attack on this result fails to rise to the level of fairly powerful mitigating reasons showing unreasonableness.first,stone argues that the district court gave undue weight to the guidelines.see,united states schmitt,cir vacating a sentence where a district court felt a guideline range deserved more weight in the calculus because a defendant crime involved child pornography,but recognizing that there is a difference between weighing the seriousness of a particular offense more heavily under a,and feeling compelled to impose a guideline sentence for a particular class of crimes.our discussion of the district court rationale dispatches this argument.the district court never indicated that it felt compelled to impose a guideline sentence.rather,as we explained above,the district court evaluated the relevant factors and decided to agree with the guidelines,after having recognized that it had an obligation to determine whether to sentence stone within
