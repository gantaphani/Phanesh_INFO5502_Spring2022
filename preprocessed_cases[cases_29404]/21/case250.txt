after entering into a written plea agreement with a commitment that the government would recommend a sentence of no more than months,antoine vega salgado pleaded guilty to being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm.see.g.the district court,without objection,fashioned a guideline sentencing range gsr significantly higher than that anticipated by the parties and notwithstanding the government recommendation of a month incarcerative term proceeded to impose a sentence months.the appellant challenges both the procedural propriety and the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.concluding,as we do,that the sentence imposed was free from error,we affirm.
we start by rehearsing the circumstances underlying this appeal.the appellant,a previously convicted felon,was found in possession of a small arsenal a loaded pistol that had been modified to operate as a fully automatic machine gun,two magazines,and rounds of ammunition.in due course,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico returned an indictment charging the appellant with being a felon in possession of a firearm 
after initially maintaining his innocence,the appellant entered into a plea agreement with the government the agreement.see.c b.in the agreement,the parties projected the appellant base offense level at.see ussg.a b i ii,ii i.the government conceded that the appellant deserved a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.see id.b.however,the agreement made no effort to determine the appellant criminal history category chc.knowing that the applicable gsr could not be computed without pinpointing the chc,the parties agreed to recommend a term of imprisonment in the middle range of whatever gsr proved appropriate.
the agreement went on to spell out what the sentencing ranges might be if the adjusted offense level stipulated by the parties were combined with various chcs.it specified that,at the highest possible chc vi,the gsr would be months and the recommended sentence would total months.
once the agreement was executed,the appellant tendered his guilty plea.a magistrate judge accepted it and ordered a presentence investigation report psi report.
in the course of preparing the psi report,the probation officer noted that the appellant had a number of prior convictions for aggravated felonies the circumstances of these convictions boosted the appellant base offense level to,see ussg a a ii,b,and resulted in an adjusted offense level of.with this offense level in place,the probation officer assigned the appellant to chc vi and set his gsr at months.see id.ch,pt.a sentencing table.
neither party objected to any portion of the psi report including the probation officer guideline calculations.at the disposition hearing,the district court followed the probation officer recommendation and again without objection adopted the suggested guideline computations in full.standing by the agreement,the government urged the court to impose a month sentence despite the fact that such a sentence would,by virtue of the revised guideline calculations,represent a substantial downward variance.when both attorneys had said their piece and the appellant had allocuted,the court levied a sentence of months.this timely appeal ensued.
the review process for federal criminal sentences is bifurcated we first determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally reasonable and then determine whether it is substantively reasonable.united states clogston,cir.consistent with this paradigm,we begin here with the appellant several claims of procedural error.in doing so,we reaffirm that findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and questions of law including questions about the meaning and application of the sentencing guidelines are reviewed de novo.see united states leahy,cir.
to begin,the appellant contends that he was not adequately informed about the nature of the agreement.because the appellant raises this contention for the first time on appeal,our review is for plain error.see united states duarte,cir.the hurdle is high.see id.delineating standard.we discern no error in this respect,plain or otherwise.
the agreement itself states,in unequivocal terms,that the appellant understands and acknowledges that the court is not a party to this agreement and thus is not bound by this agreement or the sentencing calculations recommendations contained in it.the appellant vouchsafed that he had read or been read this agreement and carefully reviewed every part of it with his attorney.he represented that he ha d no doubts as to the contents of the a greement and that he fully understood its provisions.
to cinch matters,at the hearing the magistrate judge specifically queried the appellant about whether he understood that any sentence imposed by the court is entirely in the discretion of the sentencing judge.in the same vein,the magistrate judge inquired whether the appellant understood that the terms of the plea agreement are only a recommendation,they are not mandatory.the appellant responded affirmatively to these queries.
viewed against this backdrop,the appellant claim of error disintegrates.
along the same lines,the appellant suggests that he was not properly informed about the effect of the agreement on his right to withdraw his guilty plea.this suggestion,too,is fatuous.
for one thing,the appellant made no effort to withdraw his guilty plea,even after it became apparent that the district court would not accept the month recommendation.for another thing,the agreement stated with conspicuous clarity that as long as the court sentenced the appellant within the statutory maximum,he can not,for that reason alone,withdraw his guilty plea.
next,the appellant asseverates that the sentencing court failed adequately to explain why it rejected the joint sentencing recommendation.this asseveration lacks force.to be sure,a sentencing court has a duty to explain its choice of a particular sentence.see united states fernández cabrera,cir united states turbides leonardo,cir.there is,however,no corollary duty to explain why it eschewed other suggested sentences turbides leonardo,at explaining that a sentencing court is not required to address frontally every argument advanced by the parties.
here,the district court provided a cogent explanation of its reasons for imposing a month sentence.after acknowledging the presence of potentially mitigating factors such as the defendant lifelong struggle with drug dependency and minimal family support,the court summarized its reasoning 
given the serious nature of the offense,the type of weapon possessed by the defendant,which had been modified to convert it to a fully automatic pistol,his personal circumstances and his extensive prior record,the court finds that a term of imprisonment at mid applicable guideline range is sufficient but not greater than necessary to meet statutory objectives of punishment and of deterrence in this case.
no more was exigible,especially since the sentence imposed fell within a properly calculated gsr.see fernández cabrera,at explaining that sentences that fall inside a properly calculated guideline sentencing range require a lesser degree of explanation than those that fall outside quoting turbides leonardo,at.
battling on,the appellant asserts that the sentencing court impermissibly assumed the reasonableness of a sentence and,for that reason,neglected to consider the factors enumerated in a adequately.the appellant premise is correct the supreme court has forbidden any presumption that the gsr reflects a reasonable sentence.see nelson united states,per curiam gall united states.but the conclusion that the appellant seeks to draw is not borne out by the record.
in support of his presumption argument,he points only to the restricted rationale offered by the sentencing court.that restricted rationale,he says,evinces that the court felt more compelled to adhere to the guidelines than to make a thoughtful,individualized assessment.appellant br.at.this is whistling past the graveyard while the court explanation for the sentence was not elaborate,nothing about the explanation indicates that it either considered the guidelines to be
