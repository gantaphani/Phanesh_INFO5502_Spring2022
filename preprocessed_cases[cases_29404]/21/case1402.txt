before the court is a motion by the government for summary affirmance of a judgment of conviction and sentence entered in the united states district court for the northern district of new york mordue.the judgment was entered following a plea of guilty by angel adan bonilla bonilla,a citizen of el salvador,to the crime of illegally reentering the united states after having been deported,in violation of a,a.bonilla has filed a brief on appeal challenging as procedural error the inclusion of a enhancement for a prior act of violence,resulting in what bonilla argues is a substantively unreasonable sentence of imprisonment of months.he also challenges an increase in the maximum sentence for a prior felony conviction.we grant the government motion for summary affirmance of the judgment for the reasons given below.
background 
on october,in a single count indictment,a grand jury charged that bonilla,
an alien,having been previously removed from the united states,did knowingly and unlawfully enter and was thereafter found in the united states in syracuse,new york,not having obtained the express consent of the attorney general of the united states or successor,the secretary of the department of homeland security title united states code,sections,and for reapplication for admission into the united states.
in violation of title united states code,a.
on november,bonilla entered a plea of guilty to the indictment without a plea agreement.in a report calculating the applicable united states sentencing guidelines range,the probation department found a base offense level of and increased it by levels for a crime of violence pursuant to b a ii.the crime of violence referred to was an attempted felonious assault for which bonilla was convicted in the state of michigan.the base offense level of thus determined was reduced in the report by levels for acceptance of responsibility.applying a criminal history level of iv,the probation department calculated a guidelines range of months.
in his sentencing memorandum,bonilla argued that he did not admit to his conviction for felonious assault in michigan as part of his plea allocution,that the conviction was not alleged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,and,therefore,that his maximum statutory term of imprisonment was two years,in accordance with a rather than ten years in accordance with b.
bonilla also challenged the appropriateness of the enhancement applied to his guidelines range calculation.conceding that his conviction for attempted felonious assault was a crime of violence that fit within the provisions of b a ii,bonilla sought a variance from the enhancement,contending that it overstated his potential for dangerousness and resulted in a sentence greater than necessary.in support of these contentions,bonilla argued that the enhancement provided for in the guidelines was not derived from any empirical study of sentencing data or recidivism but was enacted by the sentencing commission with little deliberation and no empirical justification.bonilla also argued in his sentencing memorandum for a downward departure,concluding that a sentence of no more than two years was reasonable,because his adjusted offense level of including the enhancement was comparable to the offense level of much more serious crimes.
in its sentencing memorandum,the government objected to any sentence below the guidelines range as calculated in the report.the government contended that the record revealed no mitigating factors not adequately considered by the sentencing commission that would remove the case from the of similar cases and that a sentence within the guidelines range would be sufficient,but not greater than necessary,to comply with the sentencing purposes set forth in a.with respect to the personal characteristics of bonilla,the government memorandum included the following 
the defendant has a lengthy criminal record which includes numerous references to his alcoholism and violent,disruptive behavior which has often required intervention by law enforcement authorities.at least one of these incidents involved the defendant,who was intoxicated,being disarmed by the police.the defendant has also been convicted of a wide variety of offenses.his three prior deportations are aggravating factors which are the best possible justification for the enhancement included under the united states sentencing guidelines.while the defense argues that there is no empirical evidence supporting this enhancement,the defendant in this case stands as an excellent example of the fact that such repeated violations of the statute should be sanctioned at a higher level.
at the sentencing hearing,counsel for bonilla again argued that bonilla was subject to a maximum term of imprisonment of two years due to the government failure to allege and prove beyond a reasonable doubt his prior conviction for attempted felonious assault.with regard to the guidelines sentence,counsel argued that this particular guideline is not so as the sentencing commission guidelines typically tend to be,it is not,and that t he level enhancement seems to be a rather arbitrary imposition.acknowledging bonilla criminal history,but contending that the guidelines sentences was far in excess of what necessary to satisfy all the requirements set forth in section a,counsel accordingly ask ed the court to impose a substantially lower sentence than months.
in responding arguments,counsel for the government pointed out that supreme court precedent supported the government contention that bonilla prior attempted felonious assault conviction need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and that bonilla therefore was subject to a term of imprisonment of not more than ten years pursuant to b.government counsel argued that bonilla has essentially opted out of our system of laws and ignored them time and time again by committing immigration offenses and other serious misdemeanor and felony offenses as well.accordingly,the government position was that the sentencing guidelines as they apply to bonilla amount to a reasonable and appropriate sentence.
in imposing sentence,the district court stated that it had reviewed and considered all the pertinent information,including but not limited to the presentence investigation report,the addendum,submissions by counsel,the factors outlined in a and the sentencing guidelines.the court thereupon fixed a term of imprisonment of months,the low end of the guidelines,after find ing the total offense level is,with a criminal history of iv,and the guidelines range of imprisonment is months.the court also imposed a term of supervised release.emphasizing bonilla recidivism,the district court gave an extensive explanation for the sentence 
neither the enhancement nor the total offense level of substantially overstates the seriousness of defendant prior conviction which involved swinging an axe at people who were eight to ten feet from him,and nor does it persuade me to do that in light of the number of times,this is his fourth conviction.and when he was deported before,i consider those factors too.he went for a month on two occasions,third occasion he came back,he was apprehended,he was let go and then he absconded,he was caught for several months later,and he has indicated that he feels he has a right to be here and is going to come back.so in light of all that,i feel that the people that drafted these sentencing statutes had in mind a person such as this defendant who was here before the c ourt for the fourth time,with little care of what the law has to say about his conduct,he is going to do it again.
in his brief on appeal,bonilla first contends that the district court committed procedural error,resulting in a substantively unreasonable sentence,by failing to adequately consider and respond to his arguments that the enhancement for a prior crime of violence reflects an unsound judgment,fails to properly reflect the a considerations,and does not treat his characteristics in the proper way.second,bonilla contends that his maximum sentence was increased pursuant to a prior felony was neither alleged in the indictment nor plead ed to or proven beyond a reasonable doubt.as to the second contention,bonilla recognized that such an increase is authorized by this court and the supreme court.on appeal,bonilla seeks a remand for imposition of a sentence below the maximum that he contends is applicable.
in moving for summary affirmance,the government notes that the district court considered all of bonilla arguments and properly concluded that a guidelines sentence was warranted.as to the enhancement,the government concedes that a district court may disagree with the guidelines for policy reasons but notes that the district court did not do so in this case.the government motion reiterates its contention that bonilla prior conviction was not an element of the offense charged so as to require pleading to the indictment or proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
in opposing the motion for summary affirmance,bonilla asserts that he is not complaining that the district court failed to explain its sentence or consider his arguments as the government claims.his argument as to the enhancement for a crime of violence is that the sentencing commission conducted no study,engaged in little deliberation,and provided no empirical justification,and its application resulted in a greater sentence than necessary in his case.arguing that this court has not yet addressed the precise contours of a district court requirement to adequately respond to a defendant argument at sentencing,bonilla contends that it is not at all clear that a defendant must object to the district court failure to respond to his arguments so as to meet the requirements of the plain error doctrine.finally,bonilla contends that his challenge to the constitutionality of increasing his sentence on the basis of a prior conviction not proved is not frivolous because,although futile in this court,it should be preserved for review by the supreme court.
of frivolous appeals generally 
in undertaking a motion for summary affirmance in a criminal appeal,the government assumes a heavy burden,for t he unique importance of criminal appeals makes the decision to characterize one as frivolous particularly perilous.united states davis,cir finding claims of procedural unreasonableness in district court language explaining decision not to impose a sentence and of substantive unreasonableness in insufficient consideration of defendant history and characteristics.the supreme court teaches that inarguable legal conclusion s and fanciful factual allegation s are hallmarks of frivolous litigation.neitzke williams.with specific regard to appeals raising issues of law,the court has noted that an appeal on a matter of law is frivolous where none of the legal points are arguable on their merits.id.alterations in original quoting anders california.we have identified as frivolous an appeal said to be totally lacking in merit,framed with no relevant supporting law,conclusory in nature,and utterly unsupported by the evidence.united states potamkin cadillac,cir imposing sanctions upon appellant and counsel for frivolous appeal.
despite the restrictive legal test for finding a criminal appeal frivolous,the test is often met in cases where attorneys seek to be relieved of representation on appeal on anders motions pursuant to the following procedure 
in order to be relieved pursuant to anders california,d,an appellant counsel must conscientiously examine the case,identifying any issues that could arguably be raised on appeal.see mccoy court of appeals of wisconsin,d,ct.this court will not grant an anders motion unless it is satisfied that counsel has diligently searched the record for any arguably meritorious issue in support of his client appeal and defense counsel declaration that the appeal would be frivolous is,in fact,legally correct.united states burnett,cir.
united states torres,cir.
customarily,the motion by counsel to be relieved from representation in the appeal of a criminal case is met with a motion for summary affirmance by the government.in the torres case,we granted both motions as to defendant lopez 
we grant counsel anders motion and the government motion for summary affirmance because we believe that lopez case presents no nonfrivolous issues for appeal.counsel anders brief addresses lopez plea allocution and sentence,as well as the argument that violates the commerce clause.counsel correctly concludes that none of these events present any issues for appeal.
in,we granted motions for summary affirmance adjunct to orders granting anders motions by counsel to be relieved from representation of appellants in criminal appeals.although no anders motions is before us in this case,these statistics demonstrate that a fair number of frivolous appeals are filed in this court.moreover,the statistics are relevant because we analyze the frivolous issues by the same standards that we apply in deciding such motions and responsive motions for summary affirmance.
ii.of the sentencing process 
we review sentences for abuse of discretion,a standard that incorporates de novo review of questions of law including interpretation of the sentencing guidelines and review of questions of fact.united states legros,cir.in applying the abuse of discretion standard in sentencing appeals,we are constrained to review for reasonableness.see gall united states.it is by now familiar doctrine that t his form of appellate scrutiny encompasses two components procedural review and substantive review.united states cavera,cir en banc.upon substantive review,a trial court sentencing decision will be classified as error only if it can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the length of the sentence imposed is what is examined on substantive review.united states villafuerte,cir.substantive reasonableness review can take place any time following procedural reasonableness review,including during the same appeal.see gall united states,an appellate court must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error and,a ssuming that the district court sentencing decision is procedurally sound,the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed see also united states dorvee,wl,at cir,noting that we are empowered to address both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of a sentence in the course of an appeal where we find both types of error.in engaging in substantive reasonableness review we recall that 
t he,and substantive unreasonableness standards in appellate review share several common factors.first,they are deferential to district courts and provide relief only in the proverbial rare case.second they are highly contextual and do not permit easy repetition in successive cases.third,they are dependent on the informed intuition of the appellate panel that applies these standards.in sum,these standards provide a backstop for those few cases that,although procedurally correct,would nonetheless damage the administration of justice because the sentence imposed was shockingly high,shockingly low,or otherwise unsupportable as a matter of law.

with respect to procedural review,
a district court commits procedural error where it fails to calculate the guidelines range unless omission of the calculation is justified,makes a mistake in its guidelines calculation,or treats the guidelines as mandatory.it also errs procedurally if it does not consider the a factors,or rests its sentence on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.moreover,a district court errs if it fails adequately to explain its chosen sentence,and must include an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.
