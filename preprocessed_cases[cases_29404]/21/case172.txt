on september,and his,jennica miller miller,robbed the kennebunk savings bank ksb in berwick,maine.entered the bank dressed as a woman in a pink sweatsuit,wearing a wig and sunglasses,and carrying a purse,while miller called and falsely reported having just been stabbed by her boyfriend in a mobile home park in an attempt to distract the police carried a screwdriver he planned to display as a weapon if the bank tellers were not compliant with his demands.he approached a bank teller,demanded cash,and according to the witnesses threatened to set a bomb off if any alarm button was pressed.after obtaining,fled the scene with miller.
two days after the robbery,the police recovered a series of items that had been discarded along the side of the road,less than a mile away from the ksb.these included a pink sweatsuit,a wig,and a screwdriver,among other things.authorities later confirmed that these items belonged to miller a confidential informant and a family member identified the bank robber depicted in ksb surveillance images as.
was arrested on april,for bank robbery.on june,an indictment charged him and miller with bank robbery in violation of a and aiding and abetting such conduct in violation of.initially pleaded not guilty,and filed two motions to suppress evidence,which the government opposed.he then withdrew both motions and,on february,entered a straight guilty plea at his hearing,admitted to all the facts stated by the government in its prosecution version,but clarified that he did not intend to threaten anyone when he entered the bank and could not recall doing so while inside.
was held at the cumberland county jail ccj from his arrest on april,until march,when he was transferred to the maine state prison.between april,and february,while at the ccj,violated several rules,conduct which resulted in seven disciplinary actions.these violations included making intoxicants possessing contraband refusing to provide a breath urine sample opening a secured slider door and possession of equipment,which resulted in his reclassification from medium to maximum security within the ccj.another disciplinary action involved a verbal interaction between and a correction officer in which purportedly stated,i f i receive twenty years as soon as i return to this jail and my handcuffs are removed,i going to break the jaw of the closest intake officer.
on march,after he had pleaded guilty,and a female inmate in the wing of ccj both jammed the locks of their cell doors to prevent the doors from locking.the female inmate then exited her cell,crossed to the male section of the facility,and entered cell,where they spent more than three hours engaging in consensual sex before being discovered by a guard.following this incident,cut himself and was placed on suicide watch before being transferred to the maine state prison.
during his time at ccj,also sent several letters to miller,instructing her to write to him using a bogus name,providing her with a script of what to say if called to testify in court,and telling her to figure a way to get their cases severed.he suggested that miller get a psych eval uation,drug rehab,fucking pregnant,something,just stall,to get her case continued as long as possible because he need ed to be tried first.
the psr calculated a total offense level of for,broken down as follows a base offense level of twenty pursuant to a a increase for taking property from a bank b a increase for possession of a dangerous weapon screwdriver b e a increase for his aggravating role because he directed miller to place false calls to distract the police c and a increase for his attempt to obstruct justice by influencing miller to commit perjury.these calculations produced an adjusted offense level of,but,because prior convictions rendered him a career offender with a criminal history category of vi his adjusted offense level was.the result was a guidelines sentencing range gsr of months,but the month statutory maximum lowered that range to months.
the psr did not recommend a reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to for several reasons.first,while provided the probation officer with a written statement taking full responsibility for his conduct,he denied any recollection of having threatened the bank teller with a bomb.second,conduct while at the ccj revealed no indication of repentance and demonstrated that he had not ceased criminal conduct.third,attempted to obstruct justice through his letters to miller.
objected to the psr recommendations to apply an obstruction of justice enhancement and to deny a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.he argued that his intention to put an end to a lifetime of criminality was evident through his conscious decision to waive the suppression issues,his guilty plea,and the fact that all his disciplinary actions while incarcerated except for the sex incident occurred prior to his guilty plea.the psr was not altered.
additionally,in a motion for a variant sentence,highlighted his troubled childhood including having lost his father at age six to suicide,living with an abusive,and falling from the second story of a building and fracturing his skull,which annihilated the impulse control center of his brain his history of diagnoses,and alcohol and abuse.
at his sentencing hearing,denied that he possessed a screwdriver during the robbery.he also clarified that he did not recall whether he made a bomb threat while at the bank,and could neither confirm nor deny having done so.in addition,admitted that he committed the disciplinary violations while incarcerated and that he sent letters to miller about spinning a web of lies to make their case more viable.while he conceded that the letters constituted an obstruction of justice and thus warranted the enhancement,he argued that he was nevertheless entitled to credit for acceptance of responsibility under because,except for the sex incident,everything else occurred before he pleaded guilty and after that he manned up and behaved as a model person for around four months.the government opposed request for credit under for essentially the same reasons stated in the psr.
the district court stated that it would not consider or hold against him the fact that did not recall making the bomb threat because his lack of recollection could be due to brain injuries or adrenaline.however,the court also stated that the possession of the screwdriver would be considered relevant conduct to the offense and found,based on miller testimony and the corroborating evidence that the government proved by preponderant evidence that he did have a screwdriver when he robbed the bank.it also found that letters to miller warranted an obstruction of justice enhancement.the district court then denied the reduction for acceptance of responsibility because did not admit to the offense relevant conduct possession of the screwdriver,and because a finding of obstruction of justice generally indicates that acceptance of responsibility should not be given unless it is an extraordinary case and the district court did not consider this an extraordinary case.in addition,the district court referenced conduct while incarcerated at ccj and found that he had failed to withdraw completely from criminal conduct.
the district court adopted the psr guidelines calculation,which yielded a gsr of months as reduced by the month statutory maximum.although the district court denied the reduction for acceptance of responsibility,it acknowledged that pleaded guilty,gave up a suppression motion,and significantly improved his behavior,for which he should get some credit by means of a variance.in the court view,that was appropriate
