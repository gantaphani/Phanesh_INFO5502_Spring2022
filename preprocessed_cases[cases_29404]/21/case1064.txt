federico villarman brings this appeal to raise different issues and errors that he claims necessitate either a new trial or reversal.we deny all of his claims of error,uphold the rulings of the district court and affirm his conviction and sentencing.
in a grand jury indictment returned on march,villarman together with one or more of his were charged in five counts,including one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine,one kilogram of heroin and quantities of marijuana.on april villarman was arraigned,entered a not guilty plea and was ordered detained pending trial.that indictment was superseded on april,and again villarman was arraigned and ordered detained without bail on april.on may the grand jury returned a second superseding indictment against villarman and.then on may he was again arraigned,again pleaded not guilty and continued to be detained.
on august villarman submitted an urgent motion requesting a de novo bail hearing.after conducting such a hearing on september,the district court denied villarman motion and approved the order for detention pending trial.
ultimately on april,the grand jury returned a third superseding indictment against villarman and eight.count one,the only count in which villarman was named,charged 
from on or about march,up to and including the date of this indictment,in the district of puerto rico and within the jurisdiction of this court,named defendants including villarman,the defendants herein,and others to the grand jury known and unknown,knowingly,willfully,intentionally and unlawfully did conspire,confederate,and agree with each other and with other persons to the grand jury known and unknown,to knowingly,intentionally,and unlawfully possess with intent to distribute and distribute 
five kilograms or more,the exact amount being unknown,of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine,a schedule ii narcotic drug controlled substance 
one kilogram or more,the exact amount being unknown,of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of heroin,a schedule i controlled substance and 
quantities,the exact amount being unknown,of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of marijuana,a schedule i controlled substance.
all in violation of title,united states code,section 
villarman and other then filed multiple motions to suppress evidence gathered from wiretaps or,in the alternative,for the conduct of a hearing under franks delaware,d.those motions call for backtracking somewhat in reviewing the chronology of the case.
on may,a wiretap application for cellular phones in puerto rico had been authorized by district judge daniel dominguez of the district of puerto rico,based on the government application and supporting affidavits.information in the affidavits originated in a new york investigation into a drug conspiracy,which expanded to puerto rico when the government learned of telephone calls to new york narcotics distributors from a puerto rican cellular phone.in the wiretap application the government cited telephone toll records,criminal history records of the targets,undercover purchases of heroin in new york,conversations from wiretaps established in new york and information that the cellular phones continued to be operational.in addition the government described how traditional investigative techniques would not be effective in investigating the drug conspiracy within puerto rico because the targets tended to be highly suspicious.
on june,the district court found that there had been sufficient investigation to justify denial of any suppression of the wiretap evidence.after describing some of that investigation,the district court found that the authorization of the wiretaps was reasonable because the nature of the conspiracy made it likely that routine investigatory techniques would fail.
in that same opinion the district court also considered how villarman allegations of perjury in the government affidavit in support of the wiretap could impact the motion to suppress the evidence.according to villarman,the affidavits had failed to disclose that the government had a confidential informant who was being debriefed by the government and had provided much of the information for the wiretap application.in addition,villarman contended that the government should have informed issuing judge dominguez about testimony in front of another judge,judge aracelia acevedo of the puerto rico commonwealth municipal court.two drug enforcement administration dea special agents,julie de mello de mello and iván rios grajales grajales,had given oral testimony under oath in connection with their request for an arrest warrant against two in this case,carlos soto del valle soto and joaquín cruz jiménez cruz.de mello and grajales did not advise judge acevedo that they were conducting a federal investigation and that they had wiretap communications.villarman cites judge acevedo affidavit describing how agents testified that they had received information about soto and cruz activities from a confidential informant as evidence of perjury in the affidavit for the wiretap application,which declared there was no confidential informant who could assist in the investigation of the puerto rico conspiracy.
finding that the alleged perjury was simply a misunderstanding by the state judge of the agents use of the spanish term confidencia meaning only confidential information,not a nonexistent confidential informant,a misunderstanding that was the product of a federal gag order forbidding reference to the wiretap which had indeed provided the confidential information,the district court held that no illegal activity had occurred.villarman request for a franks hearing to review the sufficiency of the evidence was also denied.
on october,the united states informed villarman that it anticipated calling dea special agent reinaldo lópez lópez to testify about factual matters and maybe as an expert witness.villarman was also informed about lópez background and experience,as well as the general context of his testimony.on october villarman submitted a motion to strike expert testimony,to which the government responded on october and.
on october,the case against villarman began,and the jury trial lasted nearly two weeks.during the trial the government presented its case through numerous witnesses,including lópez and cooperating witness isaias valerio valerio,as well as intercepted phone calls that involved villarman talking to cruz and soto both individually and together and to cooperating witness valerio,using one of soto cellular phones.
lópez presented testimony about general narcotics activities in puerto rico as well as interpreting coded language in the intercepted telephone calls.lópez had listened to over intercepted calls during the course of this investigation,as well as having many years of experience and training in narcotics investigations.villarman made motions and interposed contemporaneous objections asking that lópez not be allowed to testify as to the content of the taped conversations because he was not certified as an expert,nor had he been a participant in the conversations.finding that lópez was testifying to his personal experiences in listening to the tapes,the district court ruled that the testimony should be considered lay opinion testimony under,not expert testimony governed by evid.rule.
during the course of the trial,cooperating witness valerio testified for the government about his relationship with villarman and their narcotics distribution activity.valerio discussed how he and villarman had transported to kilograms of cocaine from puerto rico to new york between and.valerio also testified about how he and villarman used coded words to discuss narcotics and also analyzed a taped conversation in which he and villarman spoke about several kilograms of cocaine that had gotten wet.valerio also discussed taped conversations between villarman and other in which wet cocaine was discussed.
during the trial villarman moved for a mistrial,arguing that valerio testimony about the to kilogram cocaine transaction violated evid.rule b.in denying the motion,the district court determined that the conduct formed part of the charged conspiracy and was therefore not evid.rule b material.villarman later moved pursuant to fed.crim for a judgment of acquittal,which the district court also denied.
villarman testified at trial over a span of three days.villarman admitted that it was his voice in the taped conversations and that he had spoken to soto and cruz about obtaining cocaine for them.he also admitted to using coded terms to discuss drug transactions,but he denied that he ever really agreed or intended to provide narcotics.after his testimony villarman again unsuccessfully argued for a judgment of acquittal.
on october,the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to villarman with respect to count one of the third superseding indictment.by a special jury verdict,the jury found villarman guilty of conspiracy to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin,but it found that he had not engaged in a conspiracy to distribute any amounts of cocaine or marijuana.
on may,the presentence investigative report psi was released.under sentencing guideline the psi recommended a base offense level of,then added a enhancement for obstruction of justice,for a total offense level of.no recommendation for a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was included.both the united states and villarman submitted motions objecting to the psi,with villarman objections including a request for a downward departure for his allegedly minor role in the conspiracy,a dispute over discrepancies between the amount of heroin found by the special jury verdict and the testimony presented at trial,a complaint about the failure to acknowledge villarman acceptance of responsibility and an objection to the inclusion of a sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice.villarman also asked that the court apply the holding in apprendi new jersey,d to the indictment and the special jury verdict.
on july,the district court adopted the factual findings of the psi,determined a total offense level of and sentenced villarman to imprisonment for months,followed by a term of supervised release.villarman filed motions for new trial and judgment of acquittal under crim.rule on the same day,and on july he filed a notice of appeal.on august the district court denied villarman motions,and on october villarman submitted an urgent motion for new trial that was again denied by the district court.
we turn then to villarman numerous issues on appeal.some merit only short shrift,while others call for more extended treatment.
denial of bail pending trial 
villarman claims that the district court erred in denying him pretrial bail.we ordinarily apply an independent review,tempered by a degree of deference to the determinations made below to the district court pretrial detention order under section united states tortora,cir.but because murphy hunt,d per curiam teaches that a defendant claim to pretrial bail becomes moot once he is convicted,villarman like claim is moot.
title iii wiretaps 
villarman contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress all conversations obtained by title iii wiretaps and in refusing to conduct a franks evidentiary hearing before it denied that motion.villarman relies on what he describes as perjured statements,omissions,factual inadequacies and misrepresentations by the government in the applications for the original electronic surveillance and its extensions.villarman claims that it was unnecessary to have a wiretap because of the availability of less intrusive techniques and that the affidavit in support of the wiretap was tainted by misleading and false statements and material omissions.
on the first issue villarman disputes that the government provided a full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous title iii,section c.we have interpreted that provision to mean that the statement should demonstrate that the government has made a reasonable,good faith effort to run the gamut of normal investigative procedures before resorting to means so intrusive as electronic interception of telephone calls united states hoffman,cir.before granting a wiretap authorization the issuing court must satisfy itself that the government has used normal techniques but it has encountered difficulties in penetrating a criminal enterprise or in gathering the point where given the statutory preference for less intrusive techniques wiretapping becomes reasonable united states,cir.it is not necessary,though,to show that other methods have been entirely unsuccessful id.
decisions to grant wiretap orders are subject to review in two different contexts.first the trial judge may consider a motion to suppress the evidence gathered by the wiretap that the issuing judge authorized,while later an appellate court may review the trial judge suppression ruling see united states ashley,cir,most recently followed in united states,cir.in both instances the reviewing court examines the face of the affidavit and decide s if the facts set forth in the application were minimally adequate to support the determination that was made ashley,at.
here the affidavit provided to issuing judge dominguez contained a detailed description of the evidence the investigation had collected to date,including telephone toll records,background and criminal history of targets,undercover purchases of heroin in new york,telephone conversations from wiretaps in new york and information from the puerto rico telephone company that the telephones were operational.in addition,the affidavit explained why the continued use of traditional investigative techniques such as confidential sources,grand jury subpoenas,search warrants,surveillance and consensual monitoring would be ineffective in uncovering the full scope of the potential crimes under investigation,as well as the identities of those responsible for the unlawful manufacture,possession,sale and distribution of narcotics in puerto rico.and the affidavit also included a description of the investigation goal of obtaining evidence of the totality of offenses in which the targets of the investigation were involved.
against all of that,villarman claims that the government had failed to investigate thoroughly in puerto rico,so there were other methods of investigation that should have been pursued before resorting to the wiretap under section c.moreover,he plumps for suppression because of nondisclosure to the issuing judge about how far the new york investigation had proceeded and about the fact that a confidential informant was the source of much of the information presented in the application.according to villarman,if the issuing judge had been told how far the government had progressed without the wiretap,he would not have given his approval for the wiretap.
title iii does require that the affidavit show why wiretapping is necessary in place of less intrusive investigative techniques.from the facts provided to him in the affidavit,the district court here found that normal investigative techniques had been tried in puerto rico,but had failed.separate electronic surveillance had been authorized by a new york court and had resulted in traced calls to and from three telephones owned by a.additionally,another was under physical surveillance in puerto rico,and agents had attempted surveillance in the vicinity of the homes of two.
according to the affidavit,the surveillance and other techniques failed because the were very suspicious of potential surveillance and the surveillance would be easily detected in the neighborhood.moreover,such typical investigatory methods as grand jury subpoenas,search warrants and pen registers were insufficient to gather information without alerting the to the surveillance and potential criminal liability.
finally,the affidavit also asserted an inability to infiltrate the drug trafficking organization because there were no confidential informants who had knowledge of the organization or who could introduce agents to members of the organization.even though a new york confidential informant had enabled the agents to identify some of the main,that informant lacked sufficient contacts to develop information about the structure of the organization in puerto rico.moreover,the lack of a confidential source in puerto rico made it difficult to establish consensual monitoring.in light of that detailed explanation,the affidavit discussion of alternate methods plainly does not fall below the standard of adequacy for a wiretap see united states,cir.with the government still unaware of the identity of many of the conspiracy members as well as the organizational structure of the conspiracy,the district court could permissibly allow the government to employ electronic surveillance to uncover the complete range of operations of the target conspiracy.
villarman seeks to undercut that conclusion by also arguing that the affidavit was tainted by misleading and false statements and material omissions in violation of the government responsibility under section c.villarman claims that those omissions amount to perjury,especially in the area of whether or not the government had a confidential informant in puerto rico able to assist in investigating the drug conspiracy.
we need not lengthen this opinion by addressing villarman numerous theories of how the government assertedly failed to make a complete and honest statement of facts.we have examined them carefully just as the district judge did united states valle,d,and we too find them without merit.moreover,they are totally inadequate to have required a franks hearing under the standards we have announced in such cases as united states alicea,cir and united states adams,cir.it is an understatement to say that the district court rejection of the need for a franks hearing was not clearly erroneous,the standard announced in such cases as united states ranney,cir.
in sum,the district court allowance of the title iii wiretaps was entirely proper.we turn to villarman other arguments.
evid.rule b 
we review a district court admission of evidence that is allegedly evid.rule b material under an abuse of discretion standard united states manning,cir.because here the challenged evidence is not of other crimes,wrongs,or acts the language of the rule,but is rather intrinsic to the crime charged in the indictment id.at,the standard of review becomes irrelevant evid.rule b is really not implicated at all united states shea,cir.
thus villarman complains of the testimony of cooperating witness valerio about his alleged involvement with villarman in several cocaine distribution transactions involving to kilograms of cocaine between and.although other evidence at trial as well as the eventual verdict against villarman focused on heroin transactions,the district court found that the evidence as to cocaine was not evid.rule b material because it formed part of the charged indictment,in addition to which there was no contemporaneous objection by villarman counsel.
count one,on which villarman was convicted,charged him and his with conspiracy to distribute and possess cocaine,heroin and marijuana from on or about march up to and including the date of the third superseding indictment april.in addition to the challenged testimony,the jury heard taped conversations in which valerio and villarman discussed still another cocaine transaction.we can not say that the district court abused its discretion in finding that valerio testimony at issue was direct evidence of the conspiracy charged,rather than evidence of other bad acts subject to evid.rule b 
villarman also argues that the district court failed to carefully balance the probative value,if any of the proffered testimony under evid.rule.but b alancing these concerns lies within the broad discretion of the trial judge and will only be reversed upon a showing that the judge abused his discretion united states andiarena,cir.again no abuse of discretion has been shown here.
single conspiracy multiple conspiracies 
villarman also complains that a variance exists between the single conspiracy charged and multiple conspiracies presented at trial.that poses the issue succinctly described in united states jesus,cir 
a variance arises when the proof at trial depicts a scenario that differs materially from the scenario limned in the indictment.
such a variance requires reversal only if it is both material and prejudicial,for example,if the variance works a substantial interference with the defendant right to be informed of the charges laid at his doorstep id.here villarman argues that even though the indictment charged only a single conspiracy,the proofs at trial focused on multiple conspiracies that were different with respect to the,the time frame of alleged activity and the transactions themselves.
that issue of single conspiracy multiple conspiracies is a question of fact for the jury united states licausi,cir.as united states portela,cir has reiterated 
the question whether a given body of evidence is indicative of a single conspiracy,multiple conspiracies,or no conspiracy at all is ordinarily a matter of fact a jury determination in that regard is subject to review only for evidentiary sufficiency.
throughout trial the government presented evidence supporting the theory of a single conspiracy as described in the indictment.there were telephone calls between villarman and soto and cruz discussing both heroin and cocaine transactions.valerio also explained a drug transaction that he had discussed with villarman,once when villarman was using soto cellular phone.villarman himself testified at trial and admitted that he spoke to soto and cruz about providing cocaine,occasionally in coded language.all of that evidence would suffice for a jury determination that villarman was involved in a single conspiracy,including among its members valerio and soto and cruz,to distribute narcotics.
indeed,even if there had been a variance as there was not,villarman would still have to show that it had produced unfair prejudice and that it was not harmless error united states,cir.because the jury found villarman guilty only of heroin involvement and not of cocaine dealing,it apparently did not rely on valerio testimony as to to kilograms of cocaine,looking instead to the conversations of villarman discussing heroin transactions.so even at worst,villarman contention of a variance would constitute harmless error and would thus be insufficient to warrant reversal.
testimony by special agent lópez 
next villarman argues that the district court erred in allowing special agent lópez to provide expert testimony without prior notice,assertedly depriving villarman of the opportunity to retain his own experts to refute the testimony.looking to evid.rule as the predicate for doing so,the district court allowed lópez to testify about the conspirators use of coded terms to denote drugs and about the meaning of those terms.then villarman,electing to testify during the week following lópez testimony,took that opportunity by acknowledging the use of code words but by stating that bread denoted cocaine and not as lópez had testified heroin.that of course presented a classic occasion for the jury determination of credibility,which the jury permissibly resolved when it found villarman guilty of participation in a heroin conspiracy but not a cocaine conspiracy.
under the circumstances here,it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the district court was or was not right in characterizing lópez testimony as lay testimony under evid.rule rather than as expert testimony under evid.rule in the latter respect,see,kumho tire carmichael,d and the implementing december,amendments to evid.rules and.that is so because lópez was clearly qualified by experience and the specialized knowledge that he had acquired over the years to opine on the meaning of the code words that had admittedly been used by villarman and others see,united states tejada,cir,and because the government october,discovery letter gave ample notice of that specialized knowledge to villarman.in short,villarman loses this argument too.
brady,giglio and the jencks act 
villarman further charges that the district court erred in allowing valerio to testify because the government assertedly did not comply with its discovery obligations.according to villarman,the government asserted failures to disclose valerio identity as a witness,his plea and cooperation agreement,reports of his debriefings,his criminal history and any other impeachment material violated brady maryland,d,giglio united states,d and section the jencks act.villarman claims that he was deprived of the opportunity to use the withheld evidence a to conduct investigation and obtain further discovery,b to aid adequately in the formulation of his defense and c to impeach the witnesses against him during trial.
as to those claims,the issue is one of assertedly delayed disclosure rather than nondisclosure.villarman received a copy of valerio plea and cooperation agreement,with nonmaterial redactions,four days before trial.and for purposes,united states catano,cir teaches the application of an abuse of discretion standard,for purposes of which catano,id.repeats the test is whether defendant counsel was prevented by the delay from using the disclosed material effectively in preparing and presenting the defendant case.relatedly,congress has prescribed the defendant ability to conduct effective as the jencks act standard.
here villarman did employ the relevant assertedly exculpatory as to villarman or impeaching as to valerio or the valerio as was done in united states,cir.and as to the claimed inadequacy of that use,another branch of villarman complaints,he has not pointed credibly to specific objections that he might have lodged but let pass,or to particular arguments that he might have advanced but did not,if he had received the information earlier.as united states devin,cir says 
a defendant who claims that his hand was prematurely forced by delayed disclosure can not rely on wholly conclusory assertions but must bear the burden of producing,at the very least,a prima facie showing of a plausible strategic option which the delay foreclosed.
indeed,no better demonstration of the adequacy of the use of the material provided to villarman could be made than the actual result at trial valerio testified only about cocaine transactions with villarman,and by special verdict the jury found villarman not guilty of cocaine distribution.
right of confrontation 
again dwelling on the valerio testimony,villarman claims that the district court prevented him,in violation of his sixth amendment rights,from valerio effectively.although that added contention could also be dispatched swiftly in terms of the result reached at the end of the preceding section,villarman also loses that claim analytically.
confrontation clause challenges are reviewed de novo to determine whether defense counsel was afforded a reasonable opportunity to impeach adverse witnesses.but when that threshold is reached,any constraints imposed by the trial court on the extent and manner of are reviewed only for abuse of discretion united states,cir.on that score stephens hall,cir citations and quotation marks omitted,emphasis in original sets forth the relevant standard 
in order to safeguard the defendant rights under the confrontation clause,we have held that the trial judge may not so restrict as to deprive the defendant of the constitutionally required threshold level of inquiry,and must give the accused sufficient leeway to establish a reasonably complete picture of the witness veracity,bias,and motivation.
t he confrontation clause guarantees an opportunity for effective,not that is effective in whatever way,and to whatever extent,the defense might wish.
in this instance the district court curbed villarman of valerio as inappropriate on just three occasions when villarman attempted to use a version of facts attached to valerio plea and cooperation agreement when that guilty plea was unrelated to this case,when villarman accused valerio of violating his cooperation agreement by allegedly soliciting information from other defendants and when villarman asked valerio about his citizenship and place of birth.before us villarman has failed to address any of those instances,but in any event our reading of the trial transcript discloses that the district court did not abuse its discretion in any of those respects.
instead villarman simply repeats his nondisclosure or delayed disclosure contention that we have just rejected in terms of and the jencks act,attempting to transmute that into a violation of his sixth amendment right to confront witnesses.because the argument does not gain force either through repetition or by wrapping it in a new garment,we reject it again for the same reasons.
motion for mistrial 
in still another effort to ring changes on the same bells of valerio testimony,villarman urges that allowing that witness to testify about to kilograms of cocaine deprived villarman of an opportunity to investigate the veracity and nature thus to defend testimony,so that a mistrial should be declared for the asserted violation of evid.rule b.any refusal to declare a mistrial is measured against a manifest abuse of discretion yardstick,so that we will uphold the court ruling unless the movant demonstrates a clear showing of prejudice united states,cir.
what we have said earlier on the subject of evid.rule b defeats villarman on this score as well.every step in that analysis applies here with equal force,and the standard of review here is even more demanding.
motion for new trial 
we deal next with villarman assertion that the district court erred in denying his motion for new trial because the evidence presented at trial by the government did not justify the jury special verdict finding him responsible for more than one kilogram of heroin.that decision is reviewed in terms united states,cir in light of crim.rule,which authorizes the grant of a new trial if required in the interests of justice and where the evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict united states andrade,cir.
during the trial special agent lópez testified about two specific transactions,each involving kilogram of heroin.as villarman would have it,the jury could look only to that evidence and therefore convict him for no more than that quantity.but that contention glosses over the fact that lópez also testified about another attempted transaction that involved two kilograms of heroin with the drug reference sought to be disguised by the use of coded words.because that evidence too could be credited by the jury to support its special verdict of more than one kilogram of heroin,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying villarman crim.rule motion.
villarman next argues that the district court erred in denying his crim.rule motion for a new trial because the evidence did not support the special verdict in which the jury found him guilty of conspiracy with intent to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin.denial of a crim.rule motion for judgment of acquittal is reviewed de novo,and we will affirm villarman conviction if after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt united states donnat,cir.
as we have just said in the preceding section,lópez testified about transactions totaling kilograms of heroin.all credibility determinations are left for resolution by the jury for crim.rule purposes united states hernandez,cir.and that scotches villarman claim to a judgment of acquittal for any asserted insufficiency of the evidence.
calculation of drug quantity for sentencing purposes 
just as the jury determination of the quantity of heroin involved has withstood attack,so too does the district judge sentencing determination of villarman base offense level as.findings of the sentencing court are overturned only for clear error united states,cir,and that can not be said as to the offense level in this case,based as it was on at least one but not more than three kilograms of heroin.
other sentencing issues 
villarman advances three other sentencing issues that the district court erred in granting a increase under for obstruction of justice because,he says,there was no specific reliable evidence that villarman gave material false testimony at trial that the district court erred in not granting his motion for a downward departure based on his minor role in the conspiracy and that the district court engaged in a lack of parity in sentencing villarman to a longer term than other we deal with those contentions in turn.
as to the first of those issues,whether villarman conduct is within the scope of is subject to de novo review,but determinations are reviewed for clear error united states thomas,cir per curiam.in the latter respect,if the record supports at least two permissible inferences,the factfinder choice between or among them can not be clearly erroneous united states veilleux,cir.
requires the imposition of a increase in offense level if a defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice during the course of the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of an offense.for a defendant perjury to support such an enhancement,he or she must have provided false testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony,rather than as a result of confusion,mistake,or faulty memory united states rowe,cir.
at trial villarman acknowledged numerous telephone conversations with about providing drugs,but he claimed that he never agreed to provide or intended to provide them with any type of drug.instead villarman said that he spoke with the only because he was owed money and feared for his life.if that testimony had been believed,the jury would consequently have concluded that he did not intend to distribute drugs,rendering him guiltless of any conspiracy to distribute narcotics.in reaching the opposite conclusion as to his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt regarding a heroin conspiracy,the jury must perforce have determined that villarman testimony was the product of mistake,confusion or faulty memory,but rather stemming from villarman desire to convince the jury of a fabricated theory to excuse himself from liability.in turn,the district court could not have been clearly erroneous in deciding that villarman had provided materially false information,thus justifying the increase for obstruction of justice.
as for villarman role in the conspiracy,b cmt.identifies a minor participant as one who is less culpable than most other defendants,but whose role could not be described as minimal.we will reverse a sentencing court finding that a defendant is not a minor participant only if it is clearly erroneous united states,cir,so that the defendant bears a substantial burden of proving entitlement to such a downward adjustment for his or her role in the offense id.at.as united states brandon,cir has put it 
the sentencing court has broad discretion in determining whether this downward departure is appropriate and we will reverse only if the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the defendant played a part that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant such that the court decision was clearly erroneous.
villarman fails that test.he discussed with his not only the sale of drugs but also the need to find people to transport those drugs.importantly,villarman also supplied cruz with heroin and expressed worry about the loss of two kilograms of heroin transported by the conspiracy.even without regard to valerio testimony about villarman asserted role in transporting to kilograms of cocaine,villarman plainly has not shown clear error in the district court determination that he was not a minor participant in the conspiracy to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin.
finally as to the comparative length of villarman custodial sentence,the district judge imposed a term of months imprisonment,longer than the term imposed on each of soto and cruz.but villarman can not complain on that ground,because a court can not depart from the just to correct an asserted disparity in the sentencing of,at.
in this case villarman calculation was predicated on a very different situation from that of his.both soto and cruz pleaded guilty and otherwise qualified for a three level reduction in their offense levels under.by contrast,the district court properly determined that villarman was not entitled to a like reduction for acceptance of responsibility.and relatedly for the teach a customary linkage between these factors,see cmt,we have already upheld the district court appraisal of villarman testimony as justifying an enhancement for obstruction of justice.in sum,the asserted disparity in sentencing vanishes because it was entirely the product of appropriate applications of the 
apprendi considerations 
villarman penultimate objections stem from his counsel view of the fallout from the supreme court decision in apprendi.neither of those objections withstands analysis.
for one thing,villarman contends that clear error was involved in sentencing villarman without having the jury specify the type and quantity of drug,the enhancement for obstruction of justice and villarman role in the offense.villarman seeks to invoke apprendi to urge that those factors must be determined by a jury and not by the sentencing judge.
apprendi applicability as a question of law is reviewed de novo united states chemetco,cir united states candelario,cir.this circuit has already addressed and rejected this first apprendi argument in united states,cir citations and quotation marks omitted 
we have consistently held that the apprendi doctrine does not apply to defendants who are sentenced to terms less than the otherwise applicable statutory maximum.most succinctly,apprendi does not require that all sentencing factors be submitted to the jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt,rather only those that increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum.
in this instance the combined effect of sections a,b c and is that villarman adjudicated guilt of a conspiracy to distribute heroin sets a maximum statutory penalty of years imprisonment it will be recalled that the jury special verdict found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of a drug conspiracy involving more than one kilogram of heroin.villarman actual custodial sentence of months is more than seven years below the statutory maximum that would apply if the jury had failed to identify any specific amount of heroin.enough said.
villarman other argument is that his conviction should be vacated because the statute under which he was convicted section,when combined with the sentencing factors under section,is unconstitutional in light of apprendi.but here too this circuit has found that same argument wanting,this time in,at.we adhere of course to that decision.
villarman concludes with the contention that the cumulative effect of the putative errors already discussed in this opinion operated to violate his constitutional right to a fair trial.we have already shown that few of the matters to which villarman points may fairly be labeled as harmless ones.and even as to those,the familiar teaching of delaware van arsdall,d is that the constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial,not a perfect one.united states sepulveda,cir concluded a like review of a laundry list of purported trial court errors with this explanation 
of necessity,claims under the cumulative error doctrine are sui generis.a reviewing tribunal must consider each such claim against the background of the case as whole,paying particular weight to factors such as the nature and number of errors committed their interrelationship,if any,and combined effect how the district court dealt with the errors as they arose including the lack of any remedial efforts and the strength of the government case.
we have engaged in just such a review,and it mandates the denial of villarman claim of cumulative error as well.
conclusion 
we affirm villarman conviction and sentence.
further statutory citations will simply take the form section,omitting references to title and to title,the general criminal code.that dual usage should create no confu
