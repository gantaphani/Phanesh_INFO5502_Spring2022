william olivero,convicted by a jury of an interstate cocaine trafficking conspiracy,appeals from the sentence imposed after this court vacated his original sentence and remanded for on the government appeal.united states,cir.in the original sentencing,olivero received months imprisonment and five years of supervised release.on remand,olivero case was reassigned to another judge and this judge him to months imprisonment and five years of supervised release.
olivero challenges his new sentence on three grounds of claimed error that the court could not rely on the presentence report psr alone to find him responsible for a december,shipment of kilograms of cocaine when the jury had made no specific drug quantity finding that the court erred in denying him minor role and acceptance of responsibility downward adjustments and that the court failed to recognize its discretionary power to depart from the guidelines sentence.olivero appeal primarily raises issues about what requires of a sentencing judge who was not the original trial judge.we reject olivero argument that the court could not rely on inferences from the uncontroverted facts in the psr and affirm.
the saga of this major drug conspiracy is told in our prior opinion,at.we mention briefly the reasons for the to put in context the arguments concerning the new sentence.the original sentence of only months of imprisonment for a defendant in a large drug conspiracy was lenient and was based on a series of errors.the court erroneously limited the drug amount to less than grams of cocaine when,as we said,it could and should have found olivero responsible for the amount of cocaine established by a preponderance of the evidence against him.id.at.the original sentencing court never did that calculation and that alone meant the sentence had to be vacated and remanded.but more than that,the district court sua sponte gave olivero a low sentence in order to punish the government for what the court thought was impermissible fact bargaining and withholding of information from the court.we found no basis in fact or law for any of these rationales.id.at.to be explicit,olivero original sentence simply can not be used as a benchmark against which to assess his to a longer term of imprisonment.
olivero arrest and conviction 
we repeat here a few of the facts most pertinent to the.olivero cousin rafael headed a criminal cocaine distribution ring transporting massive quantities of cocaine from arizona to new york,rhode island,and massachusetts.the dea investigation of the ring was named operation.see id.at.olivero,who used the aliases alejandro and k and lived in new york city,assisted with shipments,distributed the cocaine,and collected the money.id.at.this was a family based drug business mother and his uncles were active participants,along with olivero,who was cousin.the seizure of two large of drugs bookended the case.one was seized in new york in april of,and the police found inside over kilograms of cocaine,over in cash,and a cell phone with numbers for both and olivero.id.
law enforcement agents put wiretaps on telephone lines after they seized the shipment of cocaine.id.at.agents recorded conversations between and olivero about the business on october,november,november,and december.details of the transcripts are described later.
dea agents learned that a large shipment was scheduled to arrive near new bedford,massachusetts.on october,prepared for a shipment of cocaine for tony by enlisting olivero to find a place to store a truck.on december,agents seized a loaded with kilograms of cocaine after its driver backed into a state trooper cruiser.id.at.at the time,this was the largest drug seizure in massachusetts history.undaunted by the seizure,the conspiracy continued,and and olivero had further conversations on december arranging a drug deal.agents later arrested olivero,and several others.
olivero was tried with and two other.he earlier had agreed to plead guilty but then withdrew his plea.the trial court gave the jury a special verdict form,which asked the jury to find the quantity of drugs for which each defendant found guilty was responsible.see id.at.the jury found all four defendants guilty.it found responsible for kilograms of cocaine and another defendant responsible for five kilograms.the jury left the quantity field on olivero special verdict form blank.see id.at.was sentenced to life imprisonment and fined sixteen million dollars.
on remand,olivero was assigned to a different district judge,in accordance with the court local rules.the court reviewed the psr,which included transcripts of conversations intercepted on the wiretaps described below,our opinion in,and the parties sentencing memoranda.it conducted a sentencing hearing over two days,granting a continuance to a second day at the request of defense counsel.olivero basic theme was that he was just an errand boy doing favors for his cousin for little money and had no idea of the depth and breadth of his cousin drug trafficking.the psr had used the term errand boy.the prosecution pointed out that two witnesses said olivero ran the new york operation for.the court concluded that olivero played an important part in facilitating the shipment and that he was responsible for at least that amount of cocaine.the court concluded that olivero did not qualify for a downward adjustment as a minor or minimal participant based on his role in the shipment.it also declined to make an adjustment based on acceptance of responsibility because olivero chose to go to trial.
the court calculated olivero base offense level at,based on his responsibility for or more kilograms of cocaine,and assigned him a criminal history category of i.the resulting guidelines range was to months,the statutory maximum.the prosecution suggested months as an appropriate sentence.the court declined to depart from the guidelines and sentenced olivero to months,the lowest end of the range.olivero appealed.
we review olivero challenges to the court drug quantity determination and its denial of role in the offense and acceptance of responsibility downward adjustments,all factual determinations,for clear error.united states,cir united states cash,cir united states santos batista,cir.
drug quantity determination 
olivero primary argument on appeal raises the question of whether a judge must go back and reread the transcripts of relevant testimony as well as the psr in order to make key guidelines findings,such as the drug quantity amount.he argues that since the court admittedly did not do that,it could not rely on the psr and this court opinion alone.the argument continues that even if the information in the psr alone could be relied on,the text of the wiretaps set forth in the psr did not provide a sufficient basis to make the finding of a relevant drug quantity of kilograms of cocaine.this was not the focus of the argument before the district court,however.nonetheless,we address the argument on its merits.
as to the first argument,there are no hard and fast doctrines about what a sentencing or judge who was not the trial judge must consult other than the normal documents required by the federal rules of criminal procedure.see.c a noting that a psr must be prepared for each defendant but that a sentencing court may rely on the record alone id.d specifying contents of psr id.i b,i a court must give parties a summary of information excluded from psr on which court will rely and may take evidence id.i c a court must hear parties comments on the psr and other matters relating to sentencing id.i a court must let defendants and victims speak see also a the information on which a sentencing court resolves a factual dispute must have sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.the ultimate test is whether the defendant can show clear error in the factual findings made by the court from whatever sources were consulted.in some situations,at least in theory,the argument that the sources were insufficient could be made out if there was an inadequate basis for the findings.
the district court here reviewed the evidence contained in the psr,the facts discussed in,and the
