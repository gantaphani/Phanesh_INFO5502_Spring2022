the defendant challenges his conviction and sentence for various gun crimes on a number of grounds.finding no error,we affirm.
on august,a federal grand jury in puerto rico indicted juan quiñones meléndez on one count of unlawfully possessing a machinegun,in violation of o.roughly two weeks later,on august,another federal grand jury in puerto rico indicted quiñones on two further counts one count of unlawfully possessing a firearm as a convicted felon,in violation of g,and one count of aiding and abetting another individual,orlando mojica rodríguez,in the unlawful possession of automatic firearms,in violation of o.quiñones subsequently pled guilty,in separate agreements,to the august count and the august count.
in the plea agreements,the parties agreed that quiñones base offense level was and that quiñones deserved a reduction in his offense level based on acceptance of responsibility.the agreements contained no stipulation regarding quiñones criminal history category.the parties did agree,however,that they would recommend to the district court the higher end of the applicable guidelines range depending on the criminal history category.the parties also stipulated that,although neither side would seek any further departures or variances from the guidelines limit,the government could argue that the sentences for the two offenses should run consecutively,and the defense could argue that the two sentences should run concurrently.
the probation office determined that quiñones criminal history fell into category ii under the guidelines,leading to guidelines ranges of months and months,respectively,for each of quiñones offenses.at the sentencing hearing,both the government and the defense argued for the higher end of that range,but quiñones argued for the sentences for each offense to run concurrently to one another,while the government argued for consecutive sentences for a total of months.the district court,at the end of the lengthy sentencing hearing,decided that neither the sentence recommended by the government nor the sentence recommended by the defense sufficiently accounted for the seriousness of the offense,the defendant personal characteristics,the context in which the offenses were committed,and a number of other factors.the district court thus imposed a higher sentence of months for each offense.and further,the district court decided that the sentences for each offense would run consecutively,so that the total sentence was months in prison.
quiñones now appeals on a number of grounds we discuss each contention in turn.
according to quiñones,the prosecution breached the plea agreements by seeking at the sentencing hearing to introduce video footage depicting quiñones august,arrest.the video shows quiñones,who was then at a gas station,attempt to flee from law enforcement by backing his car into a marshals,though unmarked,had strobe lights that were visible but not operating during this episode.the video also shows quiñones surrender when the were then wearing bulletproof vests emblazoned with the words marshal appear in his sightline.
quiñones contends that the government sought to introduce this video evidence to convince the district court to apply an enhancement under the sentencing guidelines for reckless endangerment or obstruction of justice.quiñones thus contends that the government was attempting an around the plea agreements,which explicitly provided that neither the government nor the defense would seek any departures or variances from the recommended guidelines limit.
the government is barred not only from explicit repudiation of the government assurances contained in a plea agreement but also in the interests of fairness from undertaking around them.united states rivera rodríguez,cir quoting united states voccola.but in this case,there was no such.
quiñones plea agreements specifically contemplated that the government could argue that the sentences for the two offenses should run consecutively.and a district court,in deciding whether to impose concurrent or consecutive sentences,see a,must consider the background and characteristics of the offender,the nature and circumstances of the offenses,the need for imposing consecutively running sentences,and the other sentencing factors set forth in section a,id.b.indeed,specifies that n o limitation shall be placed on the information concerning the background,character,and conduct of a person convicted of an offense which a court of the united states may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.
we thus agree with the district court that the prosecution was offering evidence to assist the district court in deciding whether to impose consecutive or concurrent sentences,just as the parties agreements allowed.and,in consequence,we hold that the prosecution did not breach the plea agreements.see united states miranda martinez,wl cir.june.
the next issue concerns whether the sentence the district court imposed was unreasonable.we review a sentence reasonableness for abuse of discretion.united states zapata vázquez,cir.in doing so,we begin by first look ing for procedural error,including to see whether the district court fail ed to consider appropriate sentencing factors,predicat ed a sentence on clearly erroneous facts,or neglect ed to explain the rationale for a variant sentence adequately.id.quoting united states del valle rodríguez,cir.
quiñones contends that we need to remand the case for resentencing before a different judge because the district court relied on material that led it to acquire a bias against him as a very dangerous individual.but the only cases quiñones cites in support of the remedy he requests are ones in which procedural error was already established because the district court provided the defendant with no meaningful opportunity to prepare and present a response to material on which the sentence was based.see,united states zavala martí,cir united states berzon,cir.and so,following his lead,we look to see whether the district court committed any procedural error by drawing on information.
quiñones contention that the district court did just that traces in part to the sentencing hearing for orlando mojica rodríguez,quiñones for the august,offenses.during that hearing held on january,nearly two months before quiñones sentencing hearing the district court thrice referred to the person who was with mojica as a very dangerous individual.and it is uncontested that quiñones was the person to whom the district court was then referring 
it is abundantly clear,however,that a sentencing court has the ability to consider information from court proceedings at which the defendant was not present,such as a codefendant sentencing hearing.united states millán isaac,cir.to be sure,that discretion is bounded.the sentencing court must base its sentence only upon information with sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy,id.at quoting united states gallardo ortiz,cir,and afford the defendant an opportunity to respond to the factual information offered against him at sentencing,id.but the district court did not cross those bounds here.
we see no basis for deeming the information the district court relied upon to be unreliable.the district court explained at quiñones sentencing hearing the precise basis for its expressed view that quiñones was a very dangerous individual.the district court cited to mojica presentence report in general,which the district court characterized as very similar to the information in quiñones own presentence report.and the district court cited more specifically to the fact that quiñones was a federal fugitive when he and mojica were arrested and to quiñones extensive criminal record.those facts are corroborated by the information in quiñones own presentence report.
nor can quiñones credibly claim to have been unfairly surprised by the information on which the district court based its judgment that quiñones was a very dangerous individual.see id.a criminal defendant must not be placed in a position where,because of his ignorance of the information being used agai
