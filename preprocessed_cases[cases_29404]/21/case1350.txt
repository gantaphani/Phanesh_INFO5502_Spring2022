gary greene,the superintendent of great meadow correctional facility,and eric schneiderman,the new york attorney general,appeal from the december,order and judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york carol amon,granting habeas corpus relief under to darrell watson.watson had been convicted of murder for shooting and killing patrick morris.at his trial in new york supreme court,king county,watson admitted that he participated in the robbery during which morris was shot,but maintained that he was not guilty of murder because his rakeem harvey keemie had shot morris.
watson claims are based on a note that the prosecution disclosed to defense counsel the harvey note,which stated,in relevant part 
keemie harvey,keemie cooke.
keemie had gun went off accident.
defense counsel unsuccessfully sought to the lead detective about the harvey note in an effort to show that,despite having this information,the police did not adequately investigate whether harvey was,in fact,the shooter.watson argues that the preclusion of such violated his rights under the sixth amendment confrontation clause.
the district court granted habeas,finding that the state appellate courts unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by rejecting watson confrontation clause argument.because we conclude that the state courts did not unreasonably apply clearly established federal law,we reverse.
background 
i.the crime and investigation 
on the night of july,patrick morris sat in a parked car in fort greene,brooklyn,waiting for his friends to use the bathroom in a friend apartment.watson and harvey robbed morris with a gun.morris resisted,and he was shot and killed.both watson and harvey eventually admitted to participating in the robbery.the principal remaining question was which one of them shot morris 
the police arrested watson soon after the incident.when questioned,watson made a number of contradictory statements.at first,he completely denied any involvement in the crime.later,he admitted that he was present,but maintained that he only acted as a lookout for harvey and another man named jahad.in that account,watson said that jahad was the shooter,and that during the crime jahad was wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt with tommy on the chest and sleeve.watson girlfriend,however,told police officers that watson himself had been wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt when he arrived at her apartment the night of the crime,and gave the sweatshirt to the officers.when confronted with this information and with the sweatshirt itself,watson provided yet another version of the night events,admitting that he owned the sweatshirt,that he wore it the night of the crime,and that he and harvey had committed the robbery.he then claimed,however,that harvey was the shooter and that he had not known that harvey had a gun.watson was eventually indicted on ten counts,including murder.
a few weeks after the crime,police officer sherry pierce,who was not involved in the investigation of morris murder,but whose family knew harvey family,telephoned the investigating detectives after seeing harvey on wanted posters.she reported that she had overheard during a discussion among members of her family that harvey had a gun on the night of morris murder and that it went off accidentally.an unknown detective took notes of this telephone report,creating the harvey note,which was placed in the detectives case file in july.detective warren bond,the lead detective on the case,read it within three months of the crime.
after the crime,harvey fled to georgia,where he lived under an alias.when harvey was arrested there for drunk driving in july,bond went to georgia and spent a day and a half questioning him.during that time,bond never confronted harvey with the information recorded in the harvey note,never told harvey that watson account of the crime placed the gun in harvey hands,and never asked harvey whether he had shot morris.in fact,according to harvey,bond told harvey at the outset of the interview that he knew harvey was not the shooter,and that harvey could therefore help himself by admitting what he had done.
harvey eventually pled guilty to robbery pursuant to a plea agreement,and later testified against watson at trial claiming that watson was the shooter in return for a sentence of to years imprisonment.
ii.the trial 
disclosure of the harvey note and the defense response 
the prosecutor first disclosed a copy of the harvey note to the defense on the second day of jury selection.at that point,the prosecution did not know who had written the note,or who had reported the information transcribed in it.the prosecution eventually identified officer pierce as the source of the information,but the prosecution efforts to discover which detective had spoken to her were unsuccessful.
when the prosecution interviewed pierce to learn more about the information in the harvey note,pierce reported that it was like vague information she indicated essentially that she heard he was involved.somebody might have said he had the gun,but she could not specify who.pierce told defense counsel that there are people in her family that know rakeem harvey rakeem cook or know his family,and that she was in the room and she overheard a number of conversations,which ranged from rakeem harvey did this,that he did do it,to him having the gun and did have the gun.
the prosecution and the defense both questioned bond about the harvey note outside the presence of the jury.bond testified that he did not write it and did not know who did.he testified that he read it within three months of the crime,and that after doing so he contacted pierce,who told him that she had heard that harvey had a gun that went off accidentally,but did not tell bond where she had heard this information.bond stated that it was information that was already basically known that keemie was involved,so it was not of any importance to me,because the defendant,darrell watson,had already said that keemie had the gun.
when defense counsel indicated that she wanted to use the harvey note at trial,the court asked how defense counsel planned to get it into evidence,and what is the evidentiary value of that statement in the harvey note i n view of the fact that it seems to be,at a minimum,not only hearsay but double hearsay,and it may be triple hearsay.defense counsel initially argued that it was admissible as a statement against penal interest.the court rejected that argument because the information did not come from harvey.
defense counsel subsequently proposed to use the harvey note in its examinations of harvey,pierce,and bond.the trial court ruled that defense counsel could ask harvey if he had told neighbors or family members that he had a gun that went off accidentally defense counsel could not call pierce to testify to what she overheard,because pierce testimony would have been hearsay and defense counsel could not examine bond in front of the jury about the harvey note,because bond had not written it.
defense counsel objected to the third ruling,arguing that 
we do think we should be able to go into this with detective bond,because he going to testify as to what he did pursuant to his investigation in this matter.and if part of the investigation was that he received information that consistent with darrell watson statement,which is that rakeem harvey had the gun,that should be an area of inquiry if detective bond was the one who apprehended rakeem harvey and questioned rakeem harvey and took a statement from rakeem harvey,in which harvey disavowed any knowledge of the gun,and said he never had the gun.certainly,we should be able to say,you had this information.you confirmed this information,and you chose not to question him about it.that goes with our theory that the people have not sufficiently investigated rakeem harvey as the person with the gun.
the court denied defense counsel application.
bond testimony and defense counsel second application to cross examine bond on the harvey note 
after bond direct testimony to the jury about his investigation of the crime,defense counsel renewed its application to him on the harvey note in order to show that bond had information that he confirmed that came from another police officer that she had heard that rakeem harvey had the gun,and he chose not to pursue that.defense counsel argued that,in the absence of on the harvey note,the jury is going to be left with the impression that the only person who said,and the only information that the police had to place the gun in rakeem harvey hands is darrell watson,and that not true.the court rejected the application,stating that a t a minimum,this is triple hearsay,and that the harvey note was a red herring,and i am not going to allow it.
on,defense counsel elicited a number of statements supporting the defense theory that bond had prematurely determined that watson was the shooter before even talking to harvey,and that bond did not adequately investigate the possibility that harvey was,in fact,the shooter.for example,the elicited testimony that by the time bond questioned harvey he knew that watson had been indicted for murder,that during the day and a half bond spent with harvey,neither he nor any other detective to his knowledge ever asked harvey whether he had shot patrick morris,and that bond never informed harvey that watson had accused him of having the gun.
further information about the harvey note and defense counsel third application to cross examine bond about it 
during the trial,pierce again spoke with members of her family who had provided information about harvey.as a result,her sister,sonjia pierce,contacted an investigator.the prosecution reported that sonjia pierce said that she had gotten information about keemie role in this from keemie mother saying that she heard that keemie said that he had the gun.when the prosecution contacted harvey mother,however,she denied ever saying such a thing to sonjia pierce.
when the prosecution informed the court about this development after bond testimony,the defense renewed its application to bond on the harvey note,arguing that this new information gives us further basis to go into it.the court again declined,stating that the new information only reinforced its earlier finding that the information constituted multiple levels of hearsay,and that the court still did not see what the probative value is in questioning the detective regarding that statement.
eyewitness testimony 
at trial,harvey testified that he saw watson playing with a silver handgun a few hours before the crime.harvey also described the robbery and homicide,claiming that watson had shot morris.as for the investigation,harvey testified that when bond questioned him about the crime,bond was just explaining to me,he know that i did kill the guy.and instead of coming here and try to win at trial and possibly getting my whole life taken away,he thought it was best that i do the best thing,which is help myself out.that testimony further bolstered defense counsel theory that the police did not thoroughly investigate whether harvey was the shooter.on,defense counsel,without referring to the harvey note,twice asked harvey if he had told someone in his family that he had a gun that went off accidentally.he denied doing so.
in addition to harvey,six eyewitnesses testified at trial.none of them saw the shooting itself.one witness testified that he hosted a party the night of the crime and he saw watson there more than usually high and with a gun in his waistband.
three of morris friends testified to what they saw after the shooting.ramcess jean louis testified that he ran out of the apartment after he heard gun shots,and saw two men near the passenger side of the car in which morris was sitting.when he got four or five feet away from the car,one of the men turned around and said i did hear anything.nothing happened.jean louis testified that he saw a silver gun in the hand of that man,who was and wearing glasses,and that the other man,who was and not wearing glasses,was leaning his body into the car morris other two friends,curt phillips and loren hillery,who also ran out of the apartment but were farther away from the car than jean louis,both testified that they saw a and a man standing by the car,and that it was the man who spoke to jean louis each testified that he could not see a weapon in either man hands 
two bystanders also testified.both stated that they saw two men doing something by the passenger side of the car,that they heard a pop,and that they did not see whether either man was holding a gun.
closing arguments 
in summation,defense counsel argued that although watson participated in the robbery of morris,watson was not the shooter,was unarmed,and did not know that harvey had a gun.the prosecution,for its part,noted that both men admitted to participating in the robbery,so that the only question was which one shot morris.after describing the investigation and touting its high quality,the prosecution argued that the evidence,including the testimony of harvey,jean louis,and the party host,as well as his own contradictory statements,pointed to watson as the shooter.
iii.procedural history 
the jury convicted watson of murder,and the court sentenced him to imprisonment for years to life.watson appealed,arguing,inter alia,that by precluding of bond on the harvey note the trial court deprived watson of his sixth amendment confrontation clause right to and the late disclosure of the harvey note violated brady maryland,d.the appellate division rejected both arguments,without specifically discussing the confrontation clause claim,people watson,dep t,and the new york court of appeals denied leave to appeal,people watson.
watson then filed his habeas corpus petition in the district court,reasserting both of the arguments set forth above.the district court rejected the brady argument but granted habeas based on watson confrontation clause claim,finding that the appellate division had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law entitling a criminal defendant to a meaningful opportunity to adverse witnesses.watson greene,cv cba,wl,at.the district court noted that the precluded went to the thoroughness of the police investigation,noting that t he supreme court has recognized the importance of this line of questioning in kyles whitley,d.id.at.after determining that the constitutional error was not harmless,id.at,the district court granted watson habeas petition,id.at.
although we respect the district court careful and thoughtful analysis of watson confrontation clause argument,we disagree with its conclusion.
discussion 
standardsa.aedpa 
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,the question we must answer to determine if watson is entitled to habeas relief is not simply whether the trial court abused its discretion by precluding of bond on the harvey note.see united states figueroa,cir decision to restrict reviewed for abuse of discretion.the question is instead whether the determination of the state appellate court that there was no abuse of discretion was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.renico lett,d,quoting d 
a legal principle is clearly established within the meaning of aedpa only when it is embodied in a holding of the supreme court.thaler haynes,d.the supreme court has explained that 
an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law is different from an incorrect application of federal law.indeed,a federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly.rather,that application must be objectively unreasonable.this distinction creates a substantially higher threshold for obtaining relief than that which applies on de novo review.aedpa thus imposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating rulings,and demands that decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.

where state court decisions are guided only by general constitutional standards as opposed to specific,rules,the unreasonable application standard is particularly difficult to meet,because such decisions are given
