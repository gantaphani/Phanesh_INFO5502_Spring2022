on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit 
justice scalia delivered the opinion of the court.
the controlled substances act imposes a mandatory minimum sentence on a defendant who unlawfully distributes a schedule i or ii drug,when death or serious bodily injury results from the use of such substance.a,b a c ed.we consider whether the provision applies when use of a covered drug supplied by the defendant contributes to,but is not a cause of,the victim death or injury.
joshua banka,a drug user,died on april,following an extended drug binge.the episode began on the morning of april,when banka smoked marijuana at a former roommate home.banka stole oxycodone pills from the roommate before departing and later crushed,cooked,and injected the oxycodone.banka and his wife,tammy noragon banka noragon,then met with petitioner marcus burrage and purchased one gram of heroin from him.banka immediately cooked and injected some of the heroin and,after returning home,injected more heroin between midnight and on april.noragon went to sleep at around,shortly after witnessing banka prepare another batch of heroin.when noragon woke up a few hours later,she found banka dead in the bathroom and called.a search of the couple home and car turned up syringes,grams of heroin,alprazolam and clonazepam tablets,oxycodone pills,a bottle of hydrocodone,and other drugs.
burrage pleaded not guilty to a superseding indictment alleging two counts of distributing heroin in violation of a.only one of those offenses,count,is at issue here.count related to an alleged distribution of heroin five months earlier than the sale to banka.count alleged that burrage unlawfully distributed heroin on april,and that death resulted from the use of th at substance thus subjecting burrage to the mandatory minimum of b c.
two medical experts testified at trial regarding the cause of banka death.eugene schwilke,a forensic toxicologist,determined that multiple drugs were present in banka system at the time of his death,including heroin metabolites,codeine,alprazolam,clonazepam metabolites,and oxycodone.a metabolite is a product of metabolism,webster new international dictionary ed,or,as the court of appeals put it,what a drug breaks down into in the body,although morphine,a heroin metabolite,was the only drug present at a level above the therapeutic range,the concentration normally present when a person takes a drug as prescribed schwilke could not say whether banka would have lived had he not taken the heroin.schwilke nonetheless concluded that heroin was a contributing factor in banka death,since it interacted with the other drugs to cause respiratory central nervous system depression.app.the heroin,in other words,contributed to an overall effect that caused banka to stop breathing.jerri mclemore,an iowa state medical examiner,came to similar conclusions.she described the cause of death as mixed drug intoxication with heroin,oxycodone,alprazolam,and clonazepam all playing a contributing role,at.mclemore could not say whether banka would have lived had he not taken the heroin,but observed that banka death would have been v ery less likely.at.
the district court denied burrage motion for a judgment of acquittal,which argued that banka death did not result from heroin use because there was no evidence that heroin was a cause of death,at.the court also declined to give burrage proposed jury instructions regarding causation.one of those instructions would have required the government to prove that heroin use was the proximate cause of banka death.at.another would have defined proximate cause as a cause of death that played a substantial part in bringing about the death,meaning that t he death must have been either a direct result of or a reasonably probable consequence of the cause and except for the cause the death would not have occurred.at.the court instead gave an instruction requiring the government to prove that the heroin distributed by the defendant was a contributing cause of joshua banka death.at.the jury convicted burrage on both counts,and the court sentenced him to years imprisonment,consistent with b c prescribed minimum.
the court of appeals for the eighth circuit affirmed burrage convictions.as to the element of count,the court held that the district court instruction was consistent with its earlier decision in united states monnier.see,at.as to proximate cause,the court held that burrage proposed instructions d id not correctly state the law because a showing of proximate cause is not required.at quoting united states mcintosh.
we granted certiorari on two questions whether the defendant may be convicted under the death results provision when the use of the controlled substance was a contributing cause of the death,and without separately instructing the jury that it must decide whether the victim death by drug overdose was a foreseeable result of the defendant offense.
as originally enacted,the controlled substances act,stat,et,tied the penalties for drug offenses to both the type of drug and the quantity involved,with no provision for mandatory minimum sentences.depierre united states,slip,at.that changed in when congress enacted the abuse act,stat,which redefined the offense categories,increased the maximum penalties and set minimum penalties for many offenders,including the death results enhancement at issue here.see,at.with respect to violations involving distribution of a schedule i or ii substance the types of drugs defined as the most dangerous and the act imposes sentences ranging from years to life imprisonment for distributions,b a,from to years for distributions,b b,and not more than years for smaller distributions,b c,the type of offense at issue here.these default sentencing rules do not apply,however,when death or serious bodily injury results from the use of the distributed substance.b a c.in those instances,the defendant shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which shall be not less than twenty years or more than life,a substantial fine,or both.ibid.
because the death results enhancement increased the minimum and maximum sentences to which burrage was exposed,it is an element that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.see alleyne united states,slip,at apprendi new jersey.thus,the crime charged in count of burrage superseding indictment has two principal elements i knowing or intentional distribution of heroin,a and ii death caused by resulting from the use of that drug,b c.
the law has long considered causation a hybrid concept,consisting of two constituent parts actual cause and legal cause.hart honoré,causation in the law.when a crime requires not merely conduct but also a specified result of conduct,a defendant generally may not be convicted unless his conduct is both the actual cause,and the legal cause often called the proximate cause of the result.lafave,substantive criminal law a,ed.hereinafter lafave see also ali,model penal code.those two categories roughly coincide with the two questions on which we granted certiorari.we find it necessary to decide only the first whether the use of heroin was the actual cause of banka death in the sense that b c requires.
the controlled substances act does not define the phrase results from,so we give it its ordinary meaning.see asgrow seed winterboer.a thing results when it a rise s as an effect,issue,or outcome from some action,process or design.the new shorter oxford english dictionary.results from imposes,in other words,a requirement of actual causality.in the usual course,this requires proof that the harm would not have occurred in the absence of that is,but for the defendant conduct.university of.southwestern medical center nassar,slip,at quoting restatement of torts,comment a.the model penal code reflects this traditional understanding it states that c onduct is the cause of a result if it is an antecedent but for which the result in question would not have occurred.a.that formulation represents the minimum requirement for a finding of causation when a crime is defined in terms of conduct causing a particular result.explanatory note emphasis added see also united states hatfield,but for is the minimum concept of cause callahan cardinal glennon hospital,same.
thus,where a shoots b,who is hit and dies,we can say that a actually caused b death,since but for a conduct b would not have died.lafave italics omitted.the same conclusion follows if the predicate act combines with other factors to produce the result,so long as the other factors alone would not have done so if,so to speak,it was the straw that broke the camel back.thus,if poison is administered to a man debilitated by multiple diseases,it is a cause of his death even if those diseases played a part in his demise,so long as,without the incremental effect of the poison,he would have lived.see,state frazier.
this requirement is part of the common understanding of cause.consider a baseball game in which the visiting team leadoff batter hits a home run in the top of the first inning.if the visiting team goes on to win by a score of to,every person competent in the english language and familiar with the american pastime would agree that the victory resulted from the home run.this is so because it is natural to say that one event is the outcome or consequence of another when the former would not have occurred but for the latter.it is beside the point that the victory also resulted from a host of other necessary causes,such as skillful pitching,the coach decision to put the leadoff batter in the lineup,and the league decision to schedule the game.by contrast,it makes little sense to say that an event resulted from or was the outcome of some earlier action if the action merely played a nonessential contributing role in producing the event.if the visiting team wound up winning to rather than to,one would be surprised to read in the sports page that the victory resulted from the leadoff batter early,home run.
where there is no textual or contextual indication to the contrary,courts regularly read phrases like results from to require causality.our interpretation of statutes that prohibit adverse employment action because of an employee age or complaints about unlawful workplace discrimination is instructive.last term,we addressed title vii antiretaliation provision,which states in part 
it shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any individual because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter,or because he has made a charge,testified,assisted,or participated in any manner in an investigation,proceeding,or hearing under this subchapter.a ed.emphasis added.
given the ordinary meaning of the word because,we held that a require s proof that the desire to retaliate was a cause of the challenged employment action.nassar,supra,at slip,at.the same result obtained in an earlier case interpreting a provision in the age discrimination in employment act that makes it unlawful for an employer to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation,terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,because of such individual age.a emphasis added.relying on dictionary definitions of t he words because of which resemble the definition of results from recited above we held that t o establish a claim under the plain language of a a plaintiff must prove that age was a but for cause of the employer adverse decision.gross fbl financial services,
our insistence on causality has not been restricted to statutes using the term because of.we have,for instance,observed that i n common talk,the phrase based on indicates a causal relationship,safeco ins.of america burr,and that the phrase,by reason of,requires at least a showing of but for causation,gross,supra,at citing bridge phoenix bond indemnity.see also holmes securities investor protection corporation,explaining that a statute permitting recovery for injuries suffered by reason of the defendant unlawful conduct require s a showing that the defendant violation was,among other things,a but for cause of his injury state courts,which hear and decide the bulk of the nation criminal matters,usually interpret similarly worded criminal statutes in the same manner.see,people wood.app,construing the phrase i f the violation results in the death of another individual to require proof of causation emphasis deleted state hennings,iowa statute prohibiting offenses committed against a person or a person property because of the person race or other protected trait requires discriminatory animus to be a cause of the offense state richardson,statute requiring suppression of evidence obtained as a result of police misconduct requires,at a minimum,a causal relationship between the misconduct and collection of the evidence.
in sum,it is one of the traditional background principles against which congress legislate s,nassar,at slip,at,that a phrase such as results from imposes a requirement of causation.the government argues,however,that distinctive problems associated with drug overdoses counsel in favor of dispensing with the usual causation requirement.addicts often take drugs in combination,as banka did in this case,and according to the national center for injury prevention and control,at least percent of overdose deaths in involved more than one drug.see brief for united states.this consideration leads the government to urge an interpretation of results from under which use of a drug distributed by the defendant need not be a cause of death,nor even independently sufficient to cause death,so long as it contributes to an aggregate force such as intoxication that is itself a cause of death.
in support of its argument,the government can point to the undoubted reality that courts have not always required strict causality,even where criminal liability is at issue.the most common though still rare instance of this occurs when multiple sufficient causes independently,but concurrently,produce a result.see nassar,supra,at slip,at see also lafave describing these cases as unusual and numerically in the minority to illustrate,if a stabs b,inflicting a fatal wound while at the same moment x,acting independently,shoots b in the head also inflicting a fatal wound and b dies from the combined effects of the two wounds,a will generally be liable for homicide even though his conduct was not a cause of b death since b would have died from x actions in any event,at italics omitted.we need not accept or reject the special rule developed for these cases,since there was no evidence here that banka heroin use was an independently sufficient cause of his death.no expert was prepared to say that banka would have died from the heroin use alone.
thus,the government must appeal to a second,less demanding but also less well established line of,under which an act or omission is considered a if it was a substantial or contributing factor in producing a given result.several state courts have adopted such a rule,see state christman.app,people jennings,cal,people bailey,commonwealth osachuk.app,but the american law institute declined to do so in its model penal code,see ali,annual meeting proceedings see also model penal code a.one prominent authority on tort law asserts that a broader rule has found general acceptance the defendant conduct is a cause of the event if it was a material element and a substantial factor in bringing it about.keeton,dobbs,keeton,owen,prosser and keeton on law of torts,ed.footnote omitted.but the authors of that treatise acknowledge that,even in the tort context,e xcept in the classes of cases indicated an apparent reference to the situation where each of two causes is independently effective no case has been found where the defendant act could be called a substantial factor when the event would have occurred without it.at.the authors go on to offer an alternative rule functionally identical to the one the government argues here that w hen the conduct of two or more actors is so related to an event that their combined conduct,viewed as a whole,is a cause of the event,and application of the rule to them individually would absolve all of them,the conduct of each is a cause in fact of the event.ibid.yet,as of,no judicial opinion ha d approved th at formulation.the death results enhancement became law just two years later.
we decline to adopt the government permissive interpretation of b.the language congress enacted requires death to result from use of the unlawfully distributed drug,not from a combination of factors to which drug use merely contributed.congress could have written b c to impose a mandatory minimum when the underlying crime contributes to death or serious bodily injury,or adopted a modified causation test tailored to cases involving concurrent causes,as five states have done,see.code a.code ann.me.stat,tit,cent.code ann.lexis.penal code ann.west.it chose instead to use language that imports causality.especially in the interpretation of a criminal statute subject to the rule of lenity,see moskal united states,we can not give the text a meaning that is different from its ordinary,accepted meaning,and that disfavors the defendant.
the government objects that the ordinary meaning of results from will unduly limi t criminal responsibility and can not be reconciled with sound policy.brief for united states.we doubt that the requirement of causation for this incremental punishment will prove a policy disaster.a cursory search of the federal reporter reveals that causation is not nearly the barrier the government makes it out to be.see,united states krieger,affirming death results conviction based on expert testimony that,although the victim had several drugs in her system,the drug distributed by the defendant was a cause of death united states webb,per curiam same.moreover,even when the prosecution is unable to prove causation,the defendant will still be liable for violating a and subject to a substantial default sentence under b.
indeed,it is more likely the government proposal that can not be reconciled with sound policy,given the need for clarity and certainty in the criminal law.the judicial authorities invoking a substantial or contributing factor test in criminal cases differ widely in their application of it.compare wilson state.crim.app.an act is an actual cause if it contributed materially to a result,even if other concurrent acts would have produced that result on their own,with cox state,causation can not be found where other concurrent causes were clearly sufficient to produce the result and the defendant act was clearly insufficient to produce it applying.code ann.here the government is uncertain about the precise application of the test that it proposes.taken literally,its test would treat as a every act or omission that makes a positive incremental contribution,however small,to a particular result.see brief for state of alaska et as amici curiae see also black law dictionary ed.defining contributing cause as a factor that though not the primary cause plays a part in producing a result but at oral argument the government insisted that its test excludes causes that are not important enough or too insubstantial.tr.of oral arg.unsurprisingly,it could not specify how important or how substantial a cause must be to qualify.see,at.presumably the lower courts would be left to guess.that task would be particularly vexing since the evidence in b cases is often expressed in terms of probabilities and percentages.one of the experts in this case,for example,testified that banka death would have been v ery less likely had he not used the heroin that burrage provided.app.is it sufficient that use of a drug made the victim death percent more likely fifteen percent five who knows.uncertainty of that kind can not be squared with the standard applicable in criminal trials or with the need to express criminal laws in terms ordinary persons can comprehend.see united states cohen grocery.
but in the last analysis,these policy discussions are beside the point.the role of this court is to apply the statute as it is written even if we think some other approach might accor d with good policy.commissioner lundy,quoting badaracco commissioner.as we have discussed,it is written to require cause.
we hold that,at least where use of the drug distributed by the defendant is not an independently sufficient cause of the victim death or serious bodily injury,a defendant can not be liable under the penalty enhancement provision of b c unless such use is a cause of the death or injury.the eighth circuit affirmed burrage conviction based on a markedly different understanding of the statute,see,at,and the government concedes that there is no evidence that banka would have lived but for his heroin use,brief for united states.burrage conviction with respect to count of the superseding
