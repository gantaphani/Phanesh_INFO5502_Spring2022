this case requires us to apply the grouping principles set forth in of the sentencing guidelines to the defendant william sedoma,convictions for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana,conspiracy to defraud the state of rhode island,its taxpayers,and the tiverton police department of their intangible right to the defendant honest services,ten counts of mail fraud,and one count of wire fraud.
from january through march,a marijuana and cocaine trafficking organization operated in and around tiverton,rhode island and fall river,massachusetts.sedoma,a detective sergeant with the tiverton police department,was a member of this organization,acting as lookout and protector for the organization and its members by providing confidential police information and other specialized assistance.this assistance included checking vehicle registrations and telephone subscriber records,disclosing the identities of undercover police operatives and cooperating individuals,and warning the organization of police enforcement actions such as controlled deliveries of drug packages intercepted by law enforcement agencies.in return for his protection and assistance,sedoma received cash payments and other benefits from the,he was paid per pound of marijuana that the organization shipped into tiverton.
arrested,indicted,and tried for this criminal activity,sedoma was convicted on february,of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana,see,conspiracy to defraud the united states by devising and executing a scheme to defraud the state of rhode island,its taxpayers,and the tiverton police department of their intangible right to the defendant fair and honest services,see,ten counts of mail fraud,see,and one count of wire fraud,see.on february,the district court sentenced sedoma to a term of months of imprisonment on the drug conspiracy count and terms on the conspiracy to defraud count,the ten mail fraud counts and the wire fraud count,all of the terms to be served concurrently,followed by four years of supervised release.sedoma appeals his sentence on the theory that the district court erred by failing to group for sentencing purposes under the drug conspiracy and the conspiracy to defraud.we agree.therefore,we vacate sedoma sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.
in determining sedoma sentence,the district court relied almost entirely on the presentence report psr prepared by the probation office.accordingly,we address our analysis directly to the psr.the psr divided sedoma offenses into two groups.group consisted of the drug conspiracy.group consisted of the conspiracy to defraud and the mail and wire fraud counts.
pursuant to the drug quantity tables set forth in c,and based on his participation in a conspiracy to distribute between and kilograms of marijuana,sedoma base offense level for group was.the psr recommended,and the district court assigned,a upward adjustment for abuse of a position of trust under,and another upward adjustment for obstruction of justice under,bringing his adjusted offense level to.
for the group convictions,the psr refers to,which addresses assignment of an offense level for attempt,conspiracy and solicitation.section c provides that,when a conspiracy is expressly covered by another offense guideline section,that guideline should be applied.in this case,both,conspiracy to defraud the united states,and the specific mail and wire fraud statutes,are explicitly covered by involving deprivation of the intangible right to the honest services of public officials.section c directs that i f the offense was committed for the purpose of facilitating the commission of another criminal offense,apply the offense guideline applicable to a conspiracy to commit that other offense if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined by applying a and b.the application of a and b would result in an offense level of.the psr determined that sedoma did indeed commit the conspiracy to defraud for the purpose of facilitating the commission of the drug conspiracy.thus,the guidelines point us again to c and result in an offense level adjusted for abuse of position of trust and obstruction of justice of.since this is greater than the offense level that would result from the application of a and b,c applies,resulting in a final offense level for group of.
the psr then turned to which determines the combined offense level for multiple groups.in determining the combined offense level,a instructs the sentencing judge to assign one unit for the group with the highest offense level and then assign one additional unit for each group that is equally serious or from to offense levels less serious section also contains a chart which relates an increase in offense level to the total number of units this increase is to be added to the count with the highest offense level to determine the combined offense level.in this case,the adjusted offense level of for group is the highest offense level,and the psr assigns it one unit.another unit is assigned for group which,with an offense level of,is equally serious.according to the chart,two units requires a increase,resulting in a total combined offense level of.
the psr determined that sedoma had a criminal history category of with a criminal history category of i,an offense level of results in a sentence range of to months.the district court sentenced sedoma to months of imprisonment,the maximum sentence within this range.
during sentencing,sedoma did not object to the court grouping of his counts of conviction.therefore,we review for plain error sedoma argument that,pursuant to,the district court should have grouped together the drug conspiracy with the conspiracy to defraud,and mail and wire fraud counts.united states albanese,cir citing united states olano,d.under plain error review,the appellant must show the occurrence of an error that the error is obvious or clear under current law and that the error substantially and adversely affects the rights of the appellant.olano,at.remedial discretion in the face of plain error should be exercised if the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.internal quotation marks omitted.
relying on,sedoma challenge to his sentence is.section provides that a ll counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single group.the provision then goes on to explain the meaning of substantially the same harm by listing four subsections defining the circumstances under which counts involve substantially the same harm for the purposes of the rule.sedoma argues that three of these subsections b,c,d mandate grouping of his counts of conviction.
under b,counts are to be grouped together w hen counts involve the same victim and two or more acts or transactions connected by a common criminal objective or constituting part of a common scheme or plan.application note explains that 
f or offenses in which there are no identifiable victims,drug or immigration offenses,where society at large is the victim,the victim for purposes of subsection b is the societal interest that is harmed.in such cases,the counts are grouped together when the societal interests that are harmed are closely related.
sedoma argues that,although legally distinct,the drug conspiracy and the conspiracy to defraud are so completely intertwined factually as to be virtually indistinguishable.for sedoma and the drug trafficking organization,there was a single course of conduct designed to produce one harm the continued sale of a controlled substance.thus,sedoma argues that the counts are connected by a common criminal objective involving a single societal harm and should be grouped pursuant to b.
the government counters that b does not apply because the marijuana trafficking conspiracy harmed society interest in drug prevention,whereas the conspiracy to defraud harmed the integrity of rhode island law enforcement agencies.because sedoma two conspiracy convictions harmed distinct social interests,the government maintains that they did not involve the same victim within the meaning of b,and therefore were p
