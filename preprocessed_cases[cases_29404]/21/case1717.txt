george englert appeals from a sentence imposed after his plea of guilty to mortgage fraud,wire fraud,and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.specifically,he challenges the imposition of a enhancement for obstruction of justice and the consequent denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.we will resolve the appeals of englert under separate cover.here,we consider only whether the sentencing judge was correct in holding that englert swearing to a false financial affidavit in order to obtain counsel constituted obstruction of justice within the meaning of ussg.
background 
in late,george englert and his came under investigation for an elaborate scheme of mortgage and wire fraud.they were suspected of participating in a fraudulent scheme to convince individuals that they represented a trust that had substantial assets to lend,when in fact,there were no assets.defendants would convince these entrepreneurs seeking pay them substantial performance guarantees in exchange for loans,knowing that their trust would never provide the loans.
the united states attorney warned englert that he might be a material witness in the investigation and it advised that he obtain counsel.on january,englert followed that advice and sought counsel pursuant to the criminal justice act.he submitted a financial affidavit and swore to its accuracy before united states magistrate judge theodore katz.on the basis of that financial affidavit,magistrate judge katz appointed counsel to englert,free of charge.englert was not indicted until november,when he was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of and ten counts of wire fraud in violation of.on march,the united states attorney filed another indictment,charging englert with one count of mortgage fraud in violation of.
one and a half years after the appointment of counsel,on july,englert pleaded guilty to charges of mortgage fraud,wire fraud,and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.in connection with his report,englert submitted to the probation office a net worth statement and a cash flow statement.in total,englert listed assets of approximately and liabilities of.his most significant assets were a home worth with an outstanding mortgage of and paintings,furniture,and antiques worth.
englert was sentenced on may.on the basis of the net worth statement englert had filed for his report,the united states attorney argued that englert earlier financial affidavit,sworn to in connection with the appointment of counsel,was clearly false.further,he argued that this false affidavit constituted obstruction of justice worthy of a enhancement pursuant to ussg.englert earlier financial affidavit was not in evidence and could not be located,but the circumstantial evidence was sufficient to support a finding that the affidavit englert had filed was false.accepting the argument of the united states attorney,the sentencing judge observed 
while this enhancement must be evaluated in the light most favorable to the defendant,i find by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant intended to mislead the court by omitting certain information from his financial affidavit.the motivation for these omissions is did not want to pay for a lawyer.he knew that if he disclosed all of his assets,he would not qualify for appointed counsel,and that he would have to pay for counsel.this lying is reprehensible and constitutes obstruction of justice.a enhancement is therefore warranted.
on the basis of this obstruction of justice enhancement,the sentencing judge also denied englert a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.the probation report had recommended a reduction on this ground,and the united states attorney had not opposed it.but after the sentencing judge enhanced englert sentence by for obstruction of justice,the united states attorney pointed out that when there is obstruction of justice enhancement,ordinarily acceptance is not warranted.the sentencing judge agreed and stated that a reduction for acceptance of responsibility would be warranted where there is a finding of obstruction of justice during the prosecution.accordingly,englert was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of months,five years of supervised release,a special assessment,and restitution of.
discussion 
englert makes two principal arguments on appeal.first he claims that the sentencing judge was wrong to enhance his sentence by two levels for obstruction of justice where the financial affidavit claimed to be false was not in evidence and there was no clear showing that englert in fact intended to obstruct justice.second,he claims that the sentencing judge incorrectly denied him a reduction for acceptance of responsibility without considering whether the obstruction of justice at issue was of the sort that suggests a lack of acceptance of responsibility.he argues that any obstruction alleged here should not have precluded a reduction for acceptance of responsibility because the conduct underlying his obstruction of justice enhancement was not part of an effort to deny guilt or hinder case investigation,but rather resulted from the wholly unrelated process of filling out a financial affidavit at arraignment.by asking us to distinguish among different kinds of allegedly obstructive conduct,englert claim implicitly raises a more basic question.that question,whether swearing to a false financial affidavit in order to obtain counsel constitutes obstruction of justice under ussg,is the only one we address.because it turns on a legal interpretation of the sentencing guidelines,the sentencing judge decision is reviewed de novo.e united states mcsherry,cir.
the sentencing guidelines dictate a enhancement under the following circumstances 
if a the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice during the course of the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,and b the obstructive conduct related to i the defendant offense of conviction and any relevant conduct or ii a closely related offense,increase the offense level by levels.
ussg.the first clause of this guideline places a temporal requirement on defendant obstructive conduct.the second clause requires that the obstructive conduct relate in some manner to the underlying offense or related conduct.but we focus first on whether englert swearing to a false affidavit in a proceeding to obtain appointed counsel was in fact a willful attempt to obstruct or impede the administration of justice.
to enhance a sentence for obstruction of justice,the court must find that the defendant statements unambiguously demonstrate an intent to obstruct.united states kelly,cir ussg.the sentencing commission understanding of what constitutes obstruction of justice is set forth in examples in application notes and to ussg.see infra.but it is perhaps better explained by considering what led to two amendments to those examples.in united states stroud,cir,we considered whether a defendant flight from an arresting officer could provide the basis for an obstruction of justice enhancement under.at the time,the commentary to was silent on this score.we observed,however,that the word willfully,as used in section,requires that the defendant consciously act with the purpose of obstructing justice.id.at.we held that flight from an arresting officer could not constitute obstruction of justice in that case because,the purpose of stroud flight was not a deliberate pre or attempt to frustrate or impede an ongoing criminal investigation rather,stroud flight appears to have been a natural attempt to avoid apprehension.id.at.less than one year later,the sentencing commission implicitly adopted that holding by amending the commentary to to state that avoiding or fleeing from arrest was not conduct that would warrant an obstruction of justice enhancement.see ussg,app,amend.
a separate amendment to the application notes of was rooted in our decision in united states.cir.in,we considered whether a defendant threats to a drug treatment counselor pending sentencing warranted an obstruction of justice enhancement.we concluded that they did not for t
