discussion 
in,federico giovanelli giovanelli was tried before a jury in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,with judge rakoff presiding.the indictment charged giovanelli with eighteen separate counts,including one count for conspiracy under,the object of which was to obstruct justice in violation of,and two counts for endeavoring to obstruct justice in violation of.on may,after an trial,the jury acquitted giovanelli of fifteen counts,but returned a verdict of guilty for the conspiracy count and the two obstruction of justice counts.following trial,judge rakoff sentenced giovanelli to months incarceration on a crosby remand,see united states crosby,cir,judge rakoff reduced the prison sentence to months.
on appeal,giovanelli challenges his conviction and sentence.in all,he raises four arguments that the obstruction of justice charges were not supported by sufficient evidence that the jury charge was defective that the government failed to specify charges and thereby violated giovanelli due process rights or,as the government frames the challenge,that the government constructively amended or improperly varied the charges and that the district court incorrectly calculated the guidelines range applicable to giovanelli conviction,and that giovanelli prison sentence is otherwise unreasonable.we consider each of these arguments in turn.
sufficiency of the trial evidence 
a defendant challenging the sufficiency of trial evidence bears a heavy burden,united states jackson,cir,and the reviewing court must view the evidence presented in the light most favorable to the government,and draw all reasonable inferences in its favor,united states autuori,cir.accordingly,we will affirm the jury verdict unless no rational trier of fact could have found all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states schwarz,cir.
in this case,giovanelli was convicted pursuant to the omnibus clause of,which states 
whoever corruptly or by threats or force,or by any threatening letter or communication,influences,obstructs,or impedes,or endeavors to influence,obstruct,or impede,the due administration of justice,shall be fined not more than or imprisoned not more than five years,or both.
the omnibus clause makes criminal not just success in corruptly influencing the due administration of justice,but also the endeavor to do so.united states aguilar,d scalia,dissenting.
although endeavor language is potentially sweeping in its breadth,the supreme court in aguilar recognized the need to place metes and bounds on the very broad language of the catchall provision.id.at.to convict under an endeavoring theory,the prosecution must show that the endeavor had the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice but if the defendant lacks knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding,he lacks the requisite intent to obstruct.see also schwarz,overturning a conviction for insufficiency of evidence in light of aguilar.as the aguilar court explained,o ur reading of the statute gives the term endeavor a useful function to fulfill it makes conduct punishable where the defendant acts with an intent to obstruct justice,and in a manner that is likely to obstruct justice,but is foiled in some way.aguilar,at.see also schwarz,at the thrust of aguilar is that requires a specific intent to obstruct a federal grand jury proceeding.accordingly,the conduct offered to evince that intent must be conduct that is directed at the grand jury and that,in the defendant mind,has the natural and probable effect of obstructing or interfering with that entity.
giovanelli relies on these interpretations of to argue that his convictions can not stand.first,he cites aguilar and contends that the government failed to establish a sufficient nexus between his actions and the grand jury proceedings.second,giovanelli argues that,if the government failed to establish that he had an intent to violate,then the conspiracy charge must also be overturned.
the first of giovanelli contentions is meritless,and therefore both of his arguments must fail.the trial evidence,read in the light most favorable to the government,provides ample support for the following facts that giovanelli was a caporegime or captain of the genovese organized crime family of la cosa nostra and that he was part of the ruling panel running the family at the time of his allegedly obstructive acts in that,at that time,a grand jury in new york was conducting a thorough investigation into another family of la cosa nostra,the decavalcante family,and that this investigation was going to lead to numerous arrests and indictments that giovanelli obtained detailed information from the grand jury proceedings and that giovanelli provided to targets of the investigation,including vincent palermo,then the acting boss of the decavalcante family,sensitive information,including a two separate written lists of the people to be indicted b the charges on which they were to be indicted c the names of some extortion victims who were being investigated d the fact that a confidential informant was using concealed recording devices to palermo e information about the identity of that informant f the fact that the grand jury investigation involved cell phones that the government was monitoring g the fact that among the charges being considered by the grand jury were murders and h the date on which the forthcoming arrests were to occur.
this evidence clearly supports the charge that giovanelli,that of passing along that information to the targets of the the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice.further,the fact that giovanelli was a member of the genovese family,and the fact that he passed the information,inter alia,to the acting boss of the decavalcante family,supports the view that giovanelli knew that his actions were likely to affect the judicial proceeding.aguilar,at.the evidence also indicates that giovanelli purloined information from the grand jury,or at least knew that it had been unlawfully obtained.united states rosner,cir.though not itself an element of the specific offense charged,this evidence adds support to the conclusion that he acted with the requisite knowledge and corrupt purpose to violate.because giovanelli then provided that information directly to the targets of the grand jury investigation,his attempt to analogize his case to those of aguilar and in which a defendant lied to a government investigator with no obvious connection to a particular grand jury unconvincing.
ii.the jury charge 
giovanelli second contention on appeal is that,even if the evidence was sufficient to support the jury verdict,his convictions should nevertheless be overturned because judge rakoff jury charge was defective.to support this argument,giovanelli points to the fact that judge rakoff charge failed to include the natural and probable language of though,as giovanelli concedes,judge rakoff did require the jury to find that giovanelli had the specific motive or purpose of obstructing or impeding the grand jury proceedings in order to convict.
under rule d of the federal rules of criminal procedure,a party who has an objection to the charge given by the trial court must inform the court of the specific objection and the grounds for the objection before the jury retires to deliberate.fed.crim.proc.d.and a party does not satisfy this burden merely by submitting its own proposed language as part of a requested charge.see,united states crowley,cir a request for an instruction
