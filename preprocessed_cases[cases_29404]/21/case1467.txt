background 
marte participated in a violent robbery crew during the summer and fall of.the robbery crew totaled approximately ten members,and included marte and hector penaranda and jose saldana,whose challenges on appeal are addressed in the accompanying summary order.the crew primarily targeted people whom they believed were involved in narcotics trafficking because they supposed that drug dealers would be more likely to have significant amounts of money and less likely to report to the police.
the superseding indictment filed on july,charged seven counts.those relating to marte are as follows count one charged marte,saldana,penaranda,and three other defendants with conspiracy to commit hobbs act robberies of drug dealers in manhattan and the bronx,new york,in violation of count two charged marte and saldana with committing hobbs act robbery at pinehurst avenue in manhattan on july,the pinehurst robbery,in violation of and count three charged marte,saldana,and two other defendants with committing hobbs act robbery at street in manhattan on july,the street robbery,in violation of and count five charged marte and saldana with using,carrying,and possessing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,in violation of c a ii and and count six charged marte,saldana,and two other defendants with using,carrying,and possessing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,in violation of c a ii and.the trial ended on june,when the jury found all four defendants guilty on count one of the indictment.the jury acquitted the defendants of the remaining substantive counts of the indictment.
notwithstanding the jury acquittal on the substantive charges,the district court found for purposes of calculating marte sentence for the conspiracy conviction that the government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he had conspired to commit the pinehurst and street robberies.the court,therefore,considered those robberies as offenses that were the object of the hobbs act conspiracy and took them into account when determining marte sentence.the district court sentenced marte principally to a term of imprisonment,within his calculated guidelines range.
discussion 
as relevant to this opinion,marte raises several objections to his sentence.marte objections center on his claim that the district court erred when,in order to enhance his sentence,it found beyond a reasonable doubt that the pinehurst and street robberies were objects of the conspiracy.first,marte argues that the court erred in considering the robberies as objects of the conspiracy because these robberies were not specifically identified as objects of the conspiracy in the conspiracy count of the indictment.marte contends that in considering the robberies nevertheless,the court misapplied the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines and violated his sixth amendment right to a jury trial second,marte claims that the district court violated his sixth amendment right to a jury trial when it considered the robberies as objects of the conspiracy relevant to sentencing jury had acquitted him as to the same conduct.marte challenges present questions of law,which this court considers de novo.see united states sanchez,cir.
marte claim that the court may not consider the robberies as objects of the conspiracy because the robberies were not identified as objects of the conspiracy in the conspiracy count of the indictment 
whether such consideration is a misapplication of the sentencing guidelines 
marte contends that the guidelines prohibit sentencing enhancements based on the objects of a conspiracy unless those objects are specifically identified in the conspiracy count of the indictment.he argues that although the pinehurst and street robberies were charged as substantive offenses in the indictment,they were not specifically designated as the objects of the conspiracy in the conspiracy count of the indictment.for that reason,the argument goes,application note of the guidelines provision covering conspiracy convictions precludes the judge from considering the undesignated robberies as objects of the conspiracy when calculating the defendant offense level under d of the united states sentencing guidelines.see united states sentencing guidelines d cmt.emphasis added.
as we stated in united states cavera 
a district court should normally begin all sentencing proceedings by calculating,with the assistance of the presentence report,the applicable sentencing guidelines range.gall united states,d.t he guidelines provide the starting point and the initial benchmark for sentencing,gall.at,and district courts must remain cognizant of them throughout the sentencing process,id.at.
cir en banc citation omitted.the guidelines application instructions dictate that the provisions of the guidelines manual are to be applied in a specific order.a sentencing court must first d etermine,pursuant to applicable guidelines,the offense guideline section applicable to the offense of conviction.id.a.guidelines provides,inter alia,that the court must a d etermine the offense guideline section in chapter two offense conduct and b a fter determining the appropriate offense guideline section determine the applicable guideline range in accordance with relevant conduct.id.a b.
significant to the appeal we decide here,d states a conviction on a count charging a conspiracy to commit more than one offense shall be treated as if the defendant had been convicted on a separate count of conspiracy for each offense that the defendant conspired to commit.id.d.application note to comments that 
particular care must be taken in applying subsection d because there are cases in which the verdict or plea does not establish which offense s was the object of the conspiracy.in such cases,subsection d should only be applied with respect to an object offense alleged in the conspiracy count if the court,were it sitting as a trier of fact,would convict the defendant of conspiring to commit that object offense.
the government argues that marte the above language requires any object offenses the judge considers at sentencing to be specifically named as object offenses in the conspiracy count of the not mandated by the language of application note.we agree.
the construction of application note places its emphasis not on the specificity of the conspiracy charge but on the standard of proof that must be satisfied to permit a court to find that a defendant conspired to commit particular object offenses and then to treat such findings as a sentencing factor in determining the defendant offense level.this more rigorous standard of proof is a protection for the defendant and is imposed because of the impact that the determination of object offenses has on a defendant sentence.we have previously stated as much,albeit in dicta,noting that
