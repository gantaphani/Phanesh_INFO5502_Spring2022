background 
on august,nuzzo,a united states citizen,was arrested at john kennedy international airport jfk upon his disembarkment from a flight arriving from guyana,for attempting to smuggle approximately twelve kilograms of cocaine into the united states.nuzzo was indicted by a grand jury on october,for importing more than five kilograms of cocaine in violation of a,a and b b ii and possessing with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine in violation of a.each of the two counts carried a mandatory minimum sentence.see et,b a ii ii.on march,nuzzo pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment and on october,the district court entered judgment sentencing nuzzo principally to months imprisonment.nuzzo now appeals that sentence on a variety of grounds.the government.
i.the arrest 
nuzzo was stationed at jfk as an inspector for the immigration and naturalization service ins from june to april.he was fired in april for conduct unbecoming an officer.prior to his termination,however,nuzzo was recruited by a operation to assist in the smuggling of cocaine into the united states from guyana.nuzzo has stated his belief that he was recruited due,at least in part,to knowledge of the immigration and customs processes he ostensibly gleaned from his service as an ins inspector.
on august,subsequent to the termination of nuzzo employment by the ins,nuzzo and a woman named jean campbell arrived at jfk from guyana.because the government had previously received a tip concerning nuzzo trip,he and campbell were arrested before reaching the usual customs declaration checkpoint.nuzzo suitcase was found to have kilograms of cocaine.
upon his arrest,nuzzo waived his miranda rights and admitted to knowingly importing cocaine into the united states.he explained that campbell,with others,had paid for his flight and assisted him in his smuggling activities.those smuggling activities had been planned in georgetown,guyana,under the leadership of mark morgan,campbell former.had he not been arrested,nuzzo accordance with the instructions given to him under the leadership of morgan in to proceed to his residence in queens,where subsequently he would receive further instructions.nuzzo would have been paid for successfully smuggling the cocaine.
nuzzo also admitted that in december,while he was still employed as an inspector for the ins,he had successfully smuggled seventeen kilograms of cocaine from guyana into the united states through jfk at the instance,and with the guidance,of morgan.nuzzo traveled to and from guyana with his,simone defreitas.defreitas and her sister,marcia figueroa,made arrangements to sell the seventeen kilograms of cocaine in the united states.the proceeds were to morgan in guyana and nuzzo was paid.
nuzzo also admitted that he helped launder drug proceeds.although the amount of money that he admitted to helping launder and wire to guyana varied in subsequent proffer sessions,upon questioning at jfk on august,nuzzo admitted that he laundered.
campbell,too,waived her miranda rights.although she equivocated on most matters during questioning,eventually she admitted that her final destination within the united states was nuzzo address she had received an unspecified amount of money from nuzzo and morgan,the leader in guyana under whom nuzzo had admitted he was operating,was her former.campbell purse contained a key that unlocked both her luggage and nuzzo matching latter containing the kilograms of cocaine.
nuzzo consented to a search of his residence in queens.that search yielded an ins uniform jacket,a beretta handgun,an ins raid vest with kevlar inserts a federal law enforcement inspector badge,an expandable baton,an ins date stamp,ammunition and miscellaneous documents.
nuzzo and campbell were charged together by complaint with conspiracy to import cocaine in violation of a and.
ii.nuzzo inconsistent statements 
nuzzo made some efforts to disclose his knowledge of,and participation in,the operation in his statements,and in the course of three proffer sessions with federal prosecutors in october,january and august and submissions and testimony at his sentencing proceeding,see,at.in doing so,nuzzo was unable to provide a consistent account of his activities.
for example,he made conflicting statements about how many of his past trips to guyana had a purpose whether campbell was a participant in the operation what amount of drug proceeds he to guyana whether he had seen,and had a telephone number for,red man,a prominent cocaine exporter to the united states and whether he had personally delivered a suitcase full of drugs to a dealer in a parking lot in the united states 
the district court concluded at nuzzo sentencing that nuzzo is incapable of answering questions truthfully and was telling the truth here during the sentencing proceeding any person with a modicum of common sense would be able to reach that conclusion without a moment hesitation,at.
iii.sentencing 
the district court set nuzzo base offense level at,see,at,c and applied the following adjustments a enhancement,pursuant to for abuse of a position of trust,see,at a enhancement,pursuant to for obstructing justice,see,at a acceptance of responsibility adjustment,see,at a and a deduction,see,at b and a f 
the court declined to grant nuzzo an additional adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to b and a adjustment pursuant to b 
having made these determinations,the court should have sentenced nuzzo based upon a final offense level of and,accordingly,within a range of to months incarceration the court made a computation error,however,and thought that its determinations had yielded a final offense level of,which would have yielded a range of to months incarceration.laboring under that misunderstanding,the court sentenced nuzzo to the midpoint of what it thought was the appropriate range.see,at.
judge glasser subsequently realized his mistake i calculated a adjustment twice for acceptance of responsibility,see id.at and admitted that,according to the sentencing determinations he had made,nuzzo should have been sentenced at a final offense level of,within a range of to months.nevertheless,judge glasser declined to change nuzzo sentence,and explained that he would keep nuzzo sentence at months by sua sponte downwardly departing an additional two points pursuant to and mitigating factors which were contemplated.id.at.
discussion 
on appeal,nuzzo challenges his sentence on the grounds that,inter alia the district court erred in enhancing his sentence two levels for abuse of trust.the government,claiming that the district court erred in awarding nuzzo a deduction and downwardly departing two levels for mitigating circumstances.
i.the abuse of trust enhancement 
the district court applied a enhancement,pursuant to,see note,ante,for nuzzo abuse of a position of trust in a manner that facilitated his offense conduct or concealment thereof.nuzzo argues that that the district court committed clear error in doing so.proper application of requires satisfaction of two requirements first,that nuzzo occupied a position of trust,and second,that nuzzo abused that position of trust to commit or conceal his crimes.see note,ante.
whether nuzzo occupied a position of trust 
nuzzo does not dispute that his position as an ins inspector constituted a position of trust in certain respects.see appellant br.at see also government br.at.nuzzo admits that he had discretion in the course of his employment checking the entry documents of persons entering the country and had he improperly admit ted someone with defective or deficient documentation,then he would have been abusing a position of trust.appellant br.at.united states brickey,cir clearly,an ins border position is one of public trust characterized by professional discretion.we turn,therefore,to a consideration of the second prong of nuzzo abused his position of trust in a manner that facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense conduct for which he was charged.
whether nuzzo abused his position of trust within the meaning of 
we review for clear error the second prong of.see united states santoro,cir we accord due deference to the district court application of the guidelines to the facts and we will not overturn the district court finding that the defendant abused a position of trust to significantly facilitate his offense unless it is clearly erroneous.quotation marks and citation omitted.
the government must meet its burden of proving satisfaction of the second prong of by a preponderance of the evidence,see united states desimone,cir,proving that the position of trust must have contributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense,by making the detection of the offense more difficult,comment.emphasis added.
it is not sufficient that a defendant enjoyed a position of trust,and thus had an opportunity to commit a wrong.that would merely satisfy the first of the two prongs of.rather,the defendant must have enjoyed a superior position,relative to other potential perpetrators,as a result of a trust relationship,see united states castagnet,cir and the defendant must have capitalized on that superior position in committing the offense conduct,see,comment.
the government argues that relative to all people in a position to smuggle drugs through jfk airport,nuzzo was in a superior position as a result of his service as a jfk airport ins inspector.government br.at.in the government view,nuzzo personal relationship with other inspectors,his insight into law enforcement methods of detecting drug smugglers and his ins credentials could do nothing but enhance nuzzo ability to smuggle drugs through the airport.id.at.the government offers nuzzo successful smuggling of seventeen kilograms of cocaine through jfk in december as proof that he enjoyed such a position and that he capitalized on that position.finally,the government asks us to look to nuzzo own statements,upon arrest,that he believed that he had been recruited to smuggle drugs for the guyana outfit due to his profession and because he knew his way through the immigration and customs processes.id.at.
in the particular circumstances presented here,these arguments are unconvincing and insufficient to establish,by a preponderance of the evidence,that nuzzo position of trust facilitated the commission or concealment of his crimes.the only evidence that nuzzo was recruited for his criminal activity because of his ins position is nuzzo own statement one of many that the district court deemed could be disbelieved by anyone with a modicum of common sense even if nuzzo testimony were credited in this respect,his asserted recruitment because of special skills relevant to the projected crime would not prove that he actually had such skills or that he used them in a particular criminal enterprise.indeed,it is altogether possible for an individual to be recruited for a specific job due to supposed special skills,and to succeed at that job,without actually having the skills or using them.
although the government suggests that nuzzo personal relationships with other ins inspectors gave him insight into the law enforcement agencies detection techniques,see government br.at,and that he used his credentials to facilitate the crimes with which he was charged,none of this is explained in any detail nor supported by the findings of the district court.for example,nothing in the record supports the proposition that nuzzo maintained personal relationships with government inspectors that facilitated his crime,or that nuzzo had special knowledge about the detection of drug smuggling that he used in the commission of the offense with which he was charged.moreover,there is no suggestion in the record that nuzzo used any ins credentials in the successful december or in the unsuccessful march efforts to smuggle cocaine into the united states.
we find unconvincing the government argument that nuzzo successful importation of seventeen kilograms of cocaine in provides some proof that nuzzo abused his position of trust in the commission of his crimes.first,it is surely possible successfully to smuggle cocaine into the country without the use of special skills or the abuse of a position of trust.second,we know of no authority for the notion that evidence of a successful prior crime,standing alone,can support a conclusion that special skills or an abuse of a position of trust accounted for the success of later attempts.
the cases in which this court has held that a position of trust was abused in a manner appropriately relevant to a enhancement and the cases from other courts that this court has cited as illustrative of such abuse contemplate a closer nexus between a defendant position of trust or special skills learned or exercised in connection with such a position and the defendant offense conduct than is present here.we do not doubt that nuzzo occupied,for a time,a position of trust that might have afforded him opportunities to commit wrongs because of his superior position.nor do we minimize society legitimate concern that an ins agent might engage in activities as a direct result of his designated post.but in the instant case,we do not find support in the record of a direct nexus between a position of trust,the abuse of that trust,and the facilitation of the commission or concealment of the relevant offense conduct.
accordingly,we reverse the district court decision to enhance nuzzo sentence for abuse of a position of trust pursuant to,and we instruct the district court,on remand,to resentence nuzzo without such an enhancement.
ii.the deduction 
the district court awarded nuzzo a safety valve deduction,see,at b and a f notes,ante.in order to award a deduction,the district court must find that an offender has proved,by a preponderance of the evidence,satisfaction of all five criteria.see united states conde,cir.at issue in this appeal is the fifth criterion,that not later than the time of the sentencing hearing,the defendant must have truthfully provided to the government all information and evidence he has concerning the offense that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan a.
the government argues on that the district court erred in awarding nuzzo a deduction,see government br.at,drawing our attention to the district court statements with respect to nuzzo untruthfulness and the host of inconsistent statements made by nuzzo.
we review a district court factual findings for clear error,and its interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo.see united states jeffers,cir.we acknowledge that t he plain language of the statute f requires the district court to make its own determination whether a defendant satisfied the provision,united states gambino,cir,and that we owe a district court deference with respect to factual findings,especially those based on witness credibility,see conde,at.
it is precisely because we owe such deference to the district court assessment of nuzzo credibility that we conclude that the district court erred in affording him the benefit of a deduction.on the day of sentencing,the district court stated 
i do have to really document my conclusion that nuzzo is incapable of answering questions truthfully and was telling the truth here this morning or this afternoon.i do have to document that.any person with a modicum of common sense would be able to reach that conclusion without a moment hesitation.
at emphasis added.shortly thereafter,the district court stated 
i do believe that nuzzo is entitled to the safety valve because i do believe that nuzzo has provided the information which he has regarding the enterprise in which he was engaged.and i do think he has carried the burden of proof in that regard.
id.at.our review of the record shows that these statements by the district court were amply justified.nuzzo made inconsistent statements about a host of issues pertinent to his offense conduct,and his inconsistency spanned the long period approximately thirteen months between his statements and his statements before the district court on the day of his sentencing.see background ii,ante.
we are unable to reconcile the district court assessment of nuzzo lack of credibility and the long record of nuzzo untruthfulness with the fifth criterion.a requires that the defendant provide complete information about his offense conduct and related activity,that he subjectively believes that information to be true,see united states reynoso,cir,and that the information provided is objectively true,see id.
in these circumstances,we vacate so much of the sentence as granted nuzzo a deduction,and remand to the district court for a reconsideration of the record,with instructions to nuzzo without such a deduction absent findings of fact by the district court,supported by the record,to support a conclusion that he has met all five of the requisite criteria for such a deduction 
iii.the downward departure 
upon discovery of a guideline range miscalculation,see,at background iii,ante,and a mistaken sentence based upon that miscalculation,the district court decided to stand firm on the sentence duration and,in order to reconcile the discrepancy,awarded a downward departure for mitigating factors which were contemplated,at.subsequently,the district court recorded the departure in its written order and judgment as a level departure pursuant to for mitigating circumstances not contemplated by the sentencing commission.a 
the government argues on that the district court erred in awarding nuzzo this departure on at least three grounds the departure was unjustified,see government br.at the district court failed to provide the government advance notice that it was considering a departure,thereby depriving the government of an opportunity to address the issue,see id.at and the district court failed to satisfy the requirement of written,specific reasons for a departure as stated in the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act of,stat,codified at e b protect act or act,see id.at.we agree with each of these arguments.
it is undisputed that the district court explanation of its decision to depart was conclusory and limited to a sentence in the written order and judgment invoking a provision of the sentencing guidelines.it is also undisputed that no notice was given to the government by the district court of its intention to depart downward 
accordingly,we vacate the district court decision to depart downward,and we remand the cause with instructions that the district court whether nuzzo is entitled to a downward departure.if the district court intends seriously to consider such a departure,it shall provide the government prior notice of its intent to do so.if the district court,following a hearing on notice,determines that a departure is indeed warranted,we direct the court to adhere to the requirements of the protect act that the court state in open court,as well as with specificity in the written order and judgment,reasons for imposing a sentence that differs from the prescription of the sentencing guidelines.see e and c.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we reverse the district court decision to enhance nuzzo sentence for abuse of a position of trust,and we vacate the district court decisions to award nuzzo a deduction and a downward departure.we remand the cause to the district court,and on remand,we instruct the district court to whether nuzzo is entitled to a deduction,on notice to the government as appropriate,whether nuzzo is entitled to a downward departure and,if it finds that such a departure is warranted,state in open court,and in a written order and judgment,its reasoning in a manner that complies with the requirements of the protect act.
we have considered nuzzo other arguments on appeal,see note,ante,and we hold that they are all without merit.accordingly,in all other respects the judgment of the district court is affirmed.
the ins has ceased to exist as an independent agency,certain of its functions having been transferred as of march,to the department of homeland security,see homeland security act of,stat,and the functions at issue here are being performed by what is now called the bureau of citizenship and immigration services.because the agency was still the ins at all times pertinent to this case,we will refer it as such throughout this opinion.
nuzzo statements made during interrogation,after his arrest and while in custody,are properly part of the record and available to us because he makes no objection that he did not waive effectuation of these rights against,as provided by the fifth amendment,voluntarily,knowingly and intelligently.miranda arizona,d.

nuzzo first stated after his arrest that of his numerous trips to guyana in the years preceding his arrest,only two had any purpose the rest were purely for spiritual reasons.he reiterated this during the january proffer session.see,at.later,nuzzo clarified that by spiritual reasons,he sometimes meant having sex with many different women at the same time and in the same night,and that there were other trips,a couple of times,that had a purpose that he had previously denied.see id.at,see also government br.at.
during interviews,nuzzo admitted that campbell was a participant in the smuggling operation.at the october proffer session,however,nuzzo recanted those statements and insisted that campbell was innocent of any wrongdoing.at the january proffer session,nuzzo flipped again and admitted that he lied to authorities in october.nuzzo explained that he had lied because he thought he and campbell shared a romantic relationship,and only told the truth when he learned that the amorous feelings were not mutual.see presentence investigation report,at.as a result of nuzzo lying about campbell role in the smuggling activities during the october proffer session,the government dropped all charges against her.see government br.at.
during his interviews,nuzzo admitted that he had at least in drug proceeds to guyana.he later recanted this statement,said that he had only of what might have been drug money,and explained that he said the ostensibly incorrect out of fear.see,at.
nuzzo stated in january that he had never laid eyes upon red man in his life and swore upon god that he was telling the truth.see,at.he later admitted that this was untrue.see id.at.he attributed his lying behavior to his being a human being.he got he was scared and is not good at talking in front of people.id.at.nuzzo stated,in august,that he never possessed red man telephone number.he then admitted the opposite when confronted with a piece of paper,taken from his wallet,upon which red man number was written in nuzzo handwriting.see,at.
nuzzo admitted during the august proffer session that,in december,he personally handed a suitcase full of drugs to an individual in the parking lot of a pathmark store.but at his sentencing proceeding in october,nuzzo claimed that another individual,ken campbell,handed off the suitcase.see,at.nuzzo explained that he had lied in august because of his relationship with ken campbell mother it was like a very hard process for me to divulge this information that i know it really hurting ken campbell mother and put her children in danger of going to prison.id.at.
c lists a base offense level of for the unlawful importation or possession of a t least kg but less than kg of cocaine.because nuzzo was sentenced in october,we refer,throughout this opinion,to
