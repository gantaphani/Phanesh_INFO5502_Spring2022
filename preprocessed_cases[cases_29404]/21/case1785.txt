the government appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york frederick scullin,chief judge reimposing on the defendant,donald carpenter,the same sentence it had imposed upon him prior to his first appeal to this court and our remand to the district court for resentencing.
when carpenter was originally sentenced,in march,the district court determined that his total offense level for the crime of to steal firearms from a licensed firearms,after giving him the benefit of a minor participant downward adjustment pursuant to united states sentencing guidelines or guidelines the court sentenced carpenter principally to a split term of five months imprisonment followed by five months home detention,as permitted by d.on the government appeal,and after carpenter had completed serving his split sentence,we held that the minor participant adjustment was unavailable to him as a matter of law.united states carpenter,cir carpenter i.we therefore vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded the matter to the district court with instructions to resentence carpenter at a base offense level of and a criminal history category of i,which carries a sentencing range of months.id.at.we left open the possibility,however,that the district court might decide to give carpenter the benefit of a further reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to b,in which case,we said,carpenter shall be sentenced at a base offense level of and a criminal history category of i,which carries a sentencing range of months.carpenter i,at.
on remand,instead of sentencing carpenter in accordance with that mandate,the district court granted him a downward departure based on the additional level for acceptance of responsibility contemplated by our mandate and some unspecified combination of carpenter extraordinary rehabilitation,a finding that his criminal conduct constituted aberrant behavior in an otherwise life,a finding that further imprisonment would have a detrimental effect on carpenter employer,and a conclusion that choosing not to downwardly depart would,under the guidelines,preclude carpenter from receiving credit for time he had already served in home detention pursuant to the district court erroneous original sentence.under the adjusted offense level of,the same as his original offense level,the district court reinstated carpenter original sentence,including home detention,which he had already served.
we conclude that the downward departure granted by the district court was unwarranted in part because of the mandate in carpenter i and in part on the merits.we remand,however,for the court to consider a limited downward departure to account for the home detention carpenter served.
background 
factual background 
we described the facts of this case at some length in carpenter i,at.we repeat them here only insofar as we think it necessary to explain our resolution of this appeal.
in or about september,carpenter entered into a conspiracy with marty wise,a sales clerk at dick clothing and sporting goods dick,a licensed firearms dealer located near syracuse,new york,to steal and resell firearms from dick.see id.during the course of the conspiracy,the conspirators committed some fifty thefts involving firearms id.at.to execute each theft,carpenter entered dick during wise shift,and wise provided carpenter with a gun without receiving payment from carpenter.id.each time carpenter left the store,wise told the cashier that carpenter was all set.carpenter was thus able to remove the firearm from the store without paying for it.id.carpenter was a former partner in another gun shop and a firearms licensee,and as such was easily able to fence the stolen guns.he divided the proceeds of their sale equally with wise.id.
the conspirators enterprise was eventually discovered when carpenter was unable to produce a receipt for one of the firearms during a confrontation with the store manager at dick.id.carpenter immediately confessed his role in the thefts and revealed wise involvement.at the manager behest,carpenter visited wise and urged him to admit to his participation in the scheme.wise relented and submitted his resignation to dick.both carpenter and wise then confessed the details of the conspiracy to agents of the united states bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms id.on july,carpenter pleaded guilty to an information charging him with one count of conspiring to steal firearms from a licensed firearms dealer in violation of m.carpenter i,at.
procedural history 
at his first sentencing hearing,on june,carpenter argued for a downward departure from the offense level of recommended in his report because of his relatively minor role in the conspiracy,see,and on the ground that he had voluntarily disclosed the conspiracy to the store manager,see carpenter i,at.describing the case as close,the district court declined to depart on the basis of carpenter voluntary disclosure of the conspiracy,explaining that carpenter did not disclose his involvement until he was confronted by the store manager.id.after extensive further hearings,the district court granted carpenter a downward departure on the basis of what it concluded was his comparatively minor role in the conspiracy.id.the district court also departed downward two additional levels for carpenter acceptance of responsibility.id.
carpenter resulting offense level of,combined with his criminal history category of i,yielded a guideline imprisonment range of ten to sixteen months.more important for purposes of this appeal,it placed carpenter in zone c of the sentencing table,which qualified him for a split sentence under which he could serve up to of his term under home detention.see d e carpenter i,at.the district court sentenced carpenter at the lowest end of that range,ten months,ordering him to serve a term of five months imprisonment followed by five months home detention.id.
the government appealed the district court decision to depart downward in light of carpenter role in the conspiracy,arguing that as a matter of law such a departure is not warranted merely because,as in carpenter case,a defendant is less culpable than his or her.id.at.we agreed,noting that the law of this circuit makes clear that a reduction pursuant to guidelines will not be available simply because the defendant played a lesser role than his.id.at quoting united states rahman,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d alternations in original.we therefore vacated carpenter sentence and remanded for resentencing.
our mandate in carpenter i was narrow.the decretal paragraph read in full 
the judgment imposed by the district court is vacated as to the sentence only and the matter is remanded to the district court with instructions to resentence carpenter at a base offense level of and a criminal history category of i,which carries a sentencing range of months.see f.a.if,however,the district court determines,upon motion by either party,that carpenter is entitled to an additional one level reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to b,then carpenter shall be sentenced at a base offense level of and a criminal history category of i,which carries a sentencing range of months.
carpenter i,at.
while carpenter sentence was on appeal,he completed his original sentence of five months imprisonment at a community correctional center or halfway house and five months home detention.by all accounts,carpenter served his term in the halfway house commendably,taking a job during his incarceration in the machine room of a local manufacturing plant.he later received several supportive letters from his supervisors indicating that he had been a role model for other inmates.by june,when we issued our decision in carpenter i,carpenter had returned home to syracuse,been relicensed to work as a restaurant manager,and had completed his term of home detention.
on remand to the district court,defense counsel moved for a downward departure pursuant to guidelines for reasons not adequately taken into consideration in formulating the guidelines.quoting b.carpenter counsel submitted a memorandum of law describing the grounds on which carpenter thought a departure was warranted,urging that the mandate of carpenter i did not preclude the district court from departing a second time.letter dated august,from carpenter counsel to the district court the august letter.
on august,the district court conducted a resentencing hearing at which the government did not contest that carpenter was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under guidelines b in addition to the two levels previously awarded to him for acceptance of responsibility under section a,bringing his total offense level from down to over the government objection,the district court also granted carpenter motion for an additional downward departure pursuant to section,indicating only that the defense presumably in the august letter and at the hearing had articulated well a basis for a downward departure and that the court adopt ed defense counsel reasoning and conclusions in toto as the decision of th e court.tr.of,hearing,at.the court concluded 
now that the court has granted a motion for downward departure brought by the defense,i find that the original sentence imposed by this court is the correct sentence and that five months incarceration and five months home detention was appropriate,and therefore i will reimpose the same sentence at this time.
the government again appeals.
discussion 
the district court departed downward after adopting arguments made by defense counsel based on rehabilitation efforts that were extraordinary,aberrant behavior,effect on employment,credit of time served in home detention and on those factors brought together.id.at.we conclude that these factors did not justify the extent of the district court downward departure.our mandate in carpenter i precluded consideration of the effect of carpenter incarceration on his employer and of carpenter allegedly aberrant behavior.irrespective of whether our mandate precluded consideration of carpenter rehabilitation efforts,we conclude that those efforts were insufficient as a matter of law to justify a downward departure.finally,although we agree that the district court may reduce carpenter sentence to account for time already served,we conclude that this basis was insufficient to justify the extent of the district court downward departure.
limitations under the carpenter i mandate 
in united states quintieri,cir,we held that 
absent explicit language in the mandate to the contrary,resentencing should be limited to issues specified in the court of appeals mandate when the court of appeals upholds the underlying convictions but determines that a sentence has been erroneously imposed and remands to correct that error.
id.at emphasis in original.we also concluded,however,that there are occasions when the spirit of the mandate requires de novo sentencing by the district court,for example,when the reversal by the court of appeals effectively undoes the entire knot of calculation underlying the original sentencing.id.internal quotation marks omitted 
our decision in carpenter i addressed a single sentencing error,and the mandate was plainly limited to correcting that error and suggesting and permitting a possible additional downward departure.at carpenter second sentencing,the district court nonetheless granted a downward departure in addition to that contained in our mandate without explaining which of the four grounds that the defendant asserted for it,or which combination thereof,underlay the court decision.the district court simply adopted defense counsel reasoning and conclusions in toto as the decision of the court.tr.of,hearing,at.
on appeal after remand,we now read our original mandate as having precluded litigation or relitigation of at least two of the grounds proffered by carpenter for a departure that carpenter behavior was aberrant and that his further imprisonment was detrimental to his employer those were issues for carpenter to establish at his first sentencing and sustain on appeal,if ever.he did not do so.there is nothing in the spirit of the mandate of carpenter i that permitted the district court to do so at resentencing,and the court could not,therefore,rely on aberrant behavior or the detrimental effect of carpenter imprisonment on others to depart downward at that time.
ii.grounds that survive the carpenter i mandate 
were the remaining two grounds asserted for the downward departure upon resentencing valid for that purpose,we would likely remand to the district court to allow it to determine whether it would downwardly depart on those grounds alone,and,if so,to what extent.we conclude,however,that extraordinary rehabilitation was not a valid ground for departing downward,and that the time carpenter previously served in home detention does not support a downward departure to the extent granted by the district court.
standard of review 
a sentencing court may impose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable guidelines,if the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.quoting b.a court dealing with an atypical case is thus not rigidly constrained by the guidelines.united states bryson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.when considering such a departure,the sentencing court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.id.at quoting a.
we apply a clearly erroneous standard to a district court factual findings and review a district court decision to depart from applicable guideline range for abuse of discretion.united states payton,cir.the test for abuse of discretion is 
whether the circumstances relied upon to justify a downward departure are so far removed from those found exceptional in existing case law that the sentencing court may be said to be acting outside permissible limits then,and only then,should we rule it has misused its discretion.
united states galante,cir.we review de novo,however,whether the factor relied upon by the sentencing court is a permissible ground for departure.united states williams,cir.finally,i f there is no clear error in the district court factual findings and no error in its conclusion that the factor is a permissible ground for departure,we review the resulting sentence to determine whether or not it is reasonable.id.
extraordinary rehabilitation 
the district court,in granting carpenter request for a further downward departure on resentencing,relied in part on his counsel argument that carpenter had undergone extraordinary rehabilitation,both before and after his first sentence.see august letter at.this raises complicated procedural questions as to the extent to which our mandate in carpenter i foreclosed the district court from considering the behavior of carpenter during the course of the resentencing,and the extent to which the district court was able,in its resentencing of carpenter,to take into account rehabilitation in light of,effective as of november,which provides that rehabilitative efforts,even if exceptional,undertaken by a defendant after imposition of a term of imprisonment for the instant offense are not an appropriate basis for a downward departure when resentencing the defendant for that offense.rather than attempt to resolve these questions,we conclude that,in any event,carpenter rehabilitation,in its entirety,was insufficient to warrant a downward departure.
the district court did not explain its downward departure insofar as it relied on this ground,other than to state that it adopt ed defense counsel reasoning.tr.of,hearing,at.defense counsel had argued for a departure based on a carpenter cooperation with the authorities following the exposure of the conspiracy b his real effort to achieve a genuine rehabilitation while at the halfway house where he served the first five months of his sentence c the assistance he gave to other residents with their transition into the program d his progress in paying restitution to the victim of his crime and e
