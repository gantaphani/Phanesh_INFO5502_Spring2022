carlos hereinafter escobar appeals from his conviction and sentence in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico on a charge of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine,cocaine base crack,and heroin.he raises four issues on appeal whether the evidence was sufficient to support the jury convicting him as a participant in a single rather than multiple drug conspiracies whether the district court erred,when sentencing,in not adjusting downward on the ground escobar was a minor participant in the conspiracy,and in adding a enhancement for possession of a firearm whether the district court erred in sentencing him without finding the specific drug amounts for which he was personally responsible and whether his case should be remanded to the district court for resentencing under united states booker,d.we affirm escobar conviction and sentence.
background and facts 
on october,a grand jury indicted escobar and others.escobar and his were charged in count one with a conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute and to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine,fifty or more grams of crack,one or more kilograms of heroin,in violation of a and.escobar pled not guilty,and,on august,a jury trial commenced involving,besides escobar,five,all or most of the others having pled guilty.trial lasted days and ended in findings of guilty as to the defendants on september.responding to questions in a special verdict form provided by the court,the jury confirmed that the conspiracy as charged in count one distributed intended to distribute cocaine in the quantity of five kilograms or more,heroin in the quantity of one kilogram or more,and crack in the quantity of fifty grams or more.the court denied escobar motion for judgment of acquittal.following his sentence on january,escobar filed this timely appeal on january of that year.
a.the evidence 
the evidence at trial showed that from at least to approximately,jose anibal,jose cabezon cabezon,was the leader and organizer of a drug trafficking organization know as las abispas.in the guayama and salinas areas of puerto rico,cabezon rented a number of drug points to las abispas members,all of whom answered to him.escobar was one such member.different members sold many different kinds of drugs,including cocaine,crack,heroin,and marijuana.las abispas sellers received drugs from heriberto ofray,wilson mendoza,and modesto zaragoza lasa zaragoza lasa,as well as from cooperating witness abdul.
among the drug points operated by las abispas were two at la puenta de jobos ward in guayama,one in the santa ana quarter,managed by dennys,and one in the miramar quarter,run by escobar and his brother.the miramar drug point sold primarily crack.escobar and his brother would buy cocaine and make it into crack or buy crack from las abispas sources,including from ofray and mendoza,and cooperating witness.
escobar played an active role in the operation of the miramar drug point,buying and preparing drugs for the point,pricing the drugs,and maintaining the proceeds from the point.testified that escobar stashed drugs and weapons for him.he also testified to selling an eighth of a kilogram of crack per week to escobar over a period which,from other testimony,could be inferred to have lasted from to.testified that escobar would sometimes sell crack to.the government put in evidence a conversation between escobar and a government informant,angel,in which escobar said he was waiting for the cocaine to make the crack and bragged to the informant that he had better crack than his brother and and mendoza.subsequently bought vials of crack from escobar.
there was also testimony from several puerto rico police officers who had been involved in undercover purchases of drugs from escobar observed several drug transactions being conducted in front of escobar residence.on september,undercover officer edwin rosas ferrer bought several small ziplock bags of cocaine from escobar at the drug point.on or about august,officer carlos de jesus conducted surveillance at the drug point.he observed several drug transactions taking place in front of escobar residence.the puerto rico police department thereafter obtained a warrant to search the residence.drugs and were seized from escobar residence.after waiving his miranda rights,see miranda arizona,d,escobar admitted the drugs belonged to him and the money came from drug proceeds.
escobar sentencing 
following conviction,and prior to sentencing,escobar received his presentence investigation report psi or report on december.in describing the drug conspiracy for which escobar was convicted,the report on the cover page termed it as being a conspiracy to possess and distribute not less than one hundred and fifty kilograms of cocaine,whereas,in fact,the conspiracy charged in the indictment and later confirmed in the jury special verdict finding was one to possess and distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine,fifty grams or more of cocaine base,one kilogram or more of heroin.the psi correctly described the charged offense in its discussion of the charge and conviction but used the kilograms of cocaine standard in computing a proposed guidelines sentence.in determining that sentence,the psi calculated a base offense level of under ussg c the psi expressly derived this offense level from its unexplained supposition that the offense involved not less than one hundred fifty kilograms of cocaine a enhancement for possession of firearms under ussg b and a enhancement for managerial or supervisory role in the offense under ussg c.these figures added up to a total offense level of.the total offense level,along with a criminal history category of i,resulted in a proposed guideline sentencing range of months imprisonment to life 
at escobar sentencing hearing,held on january,the district court began by asking,counsel,have you read the report to which counsel for escobar replied,yes,your honor.the court then addressed defendant,asking,escobar,are you aware of the contents of the report defendant replied,yes,and also acknowledged his attorney had translated to him the information contained in the report.
the court asked next,is there anything that needs to be corrected at the time as to the information in the report escobar counsel at first replied,yes,your honor,we did file an objection as to some information.to this the court reiterated,any corrections,prior to getting to the objections,any corrections that need.escobar counsel said,no,no corrections at this time,your honor,and the court then asked escobar himself,is there anything in the report you wish me to correct,to which escobar responded,no.like questions were put by the court to government counsel,similarly evoking negative answers.
the court then turned to escobar counsel,saying,counsel,you do have an objection to the calculations counsel replied,right,that is correct our objection is based on the fact that the report indicates that my client was an organizer,or leader,or manager or supervisor.to this the court replied,objection is sustained,granted.i will not follow the recommendation of the probation officer for a enhancement.escobar counsel then responded very well,your honor.that would be all as to the objections.
the court then enquired,is there anything you counsel would like to state to the court on behalf of your client before i pronounce sentence 
escobar counsel responded with a plea for a sentence at the lower end of the guidelines,citing escobar youth,his father absence,his residence in a very poor area of guayama,and his lack of early guidance.counsel ended by saying,that the only request that we make,your honor,that he be sentenced as to the lower end of the guidelines applicable in this case.
the court then heard from escobar,who asked for forgiveness from his wife and mother for having failed them.
thereafter,government counsel argued against any variation from the findings in the report.she pointed out there was evidence escobar was an owner of a drug point,making him a manager or a leader of one of the points within the conspiracy.the government urged that escobar be sentenced according to the findings in the report at a total offense level of,including a two level enhancement,which would put the defendant within the guidelines of three hundred and sixty months to life.
after hearing from counsel,the district court explained at some length why it was declining to grant the leadership enhancement.the court noted that although the defendant was of the drug point with his brother,he was acting more of sic a runner at the point it was more his brother,i think,who was in active participation as the leader at that point than this defendant.the court went on to say there was no evidence of other individuals the brothers were supervising or over whom control was being exercised,and the court believed escobar brother had more authority.the court concluded,so,really,for my recollection of the evidence in this case,it would seem to me that he does fall within the parameters of the commentary and that why i not inclined to grant or go along with the probation officer recommended enhancement for the increase pursuant to guideline c.
after his above ruling denying the increase,the court sentenced escobar with the following explanation 
on september,defendant carlos manuel escobar figueroa was found guilty by jury trial in criminal case,which charges a violation of title,united states codes,section.based on guideline c a base offense level of thirty or or thirty sic is determined as the offense or sic conviction involved more than one hundred and fifty kilograms of cocaine,that is having done the equivalency factors.since the defendant had possession of a firearm within the conspiracy,a two level enhancement is warranted pursuant to guideline b.there are no other applicable guideline adjustments.based on a total offense level of forty and a criminal history category of one,the guideline imprisonment range in this particular offense is from two hundred and to three hundred and months with a fine range of thousand to four million dollars plus a supervised release term of at least five years.therefore,it is the judgment of this court that the defendant is hereby committed to the custody of the bureau of prisons to be imprisoned for a term of two hundred and months.upon release from confinement you shall be placed on supervised release for a term of five years 
proceedings 
the above events end the story of escobar own sentencing.judgment was entered on january.he filed a timely appeal to this court less than a week thereafter.escobar five were,however,not sentenced at this time.instead,they were sentenced several months later,after which escobar filed,unsuccessfully,towards the end of and the beginning of,two new trial motions alleging that he had not been fairly sentenced.underlying escobar complaint was an order the district court had issued on march,directing the government to put the court in a position to be able to individualize the amount of drugs attributable or foreseeable to each defendant based on the record and on the evidence presented during the trial,in keeping with the new jurisprudence in united states,cir,a decision handed down two weeks before escobar january sentencing but apparently not yet known to the judge and escobar counsel at escobar sentencing.
the united states responded to the court request on july,tendering information from the trial record bearing upon the different drug amounts.the government response also included drug information about escobar even though he had already been sentenced,noting in particular testimony of having furnished escobar of a kilogram of crack on a weekly basis over the period of their long relationship.
as noted,escobar subsequently filed,on november,and february,two motions for new trial,citing to the first circuit holding in and alleging error in the court failure to have made an individualized finding as to the drug amounts in his own case.the court denied both motions in electronic orders without comment.it is unclear whether the court rejected the motions on the merits or because they were untimely filed.see.a requiring a defendant to file any motion contesting his sentence within seven days after sentencing.though escobar cited.b,which provides a window for a motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence,the court attention to in the sentencing of the five was scarcely newly discovered evidence.in any case,escobar did not appeal to this court from the denial of his two motions for a new trial,hence those motions are not now before us.
unlike escobar,who was sentenced prior to the court march,order and prior to booker,escobar were all sentenced after the court march,order and after the supreme court decision in booker.although not part of the record of escobar proceedings,we note that ofray was apparently sentenced to months.ofray aide,pedro jose,was sentenced to months.was sentenced to months.was sentenced to months.a fifth,mizaury,was sentenced to months.in all cases except that of,the court imposed sentences within the guideline range,based upon drug quantities found to be somewhat lower than escobar.in the case of,however,the court went far above the guideline range because,it stated,the recommended guideline sentence did not reflect the seriousness of the offense.
letters filed pursuant to fed.j 
when it was disputed by counsel during appellate argument whether the district court had,in fact,made an individualized finding of drug quantity as to escobar,the parties were directed to agree and notify us as to whether this was done,and if so,where such a finding could be found in the trial record.letters purporting to answer our inquiry have since been filed,expressly indicating the parties were unable to agree on the matter,but,for all practical purposes,underscoring what the sentencing transcript no individualized drug quantity finding as such was made by the court.
ii.discussion 
insufficient evidence of single conspiracy 
escobar argues there was insufficient evidence of a single drug conspiracy,as alleged in count one,the sole count for which he was tried.he says the evidence shows multiple conspiracies and failed,moreover,to show a direct connection between him and some of his.he also contends that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the accomplishment of a common goal or plan.
as a preliminary matter,the government responds that escobar argument is insufficiently developed for us to take note of it and hence has been waived by escobar.see united states zannino,cir i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.while the government may have some basis for this contention,we need not resolve it,as we find the argument to be without merit in any event.
whether a single conspiracy exists is a question of fact for the jury.united states portela,cir united states licausi,cir.the jury finding of a single conspiracy is subject to review for evidentiary sufficiency,united states david,cir,and the evidence is taken in the light most favorable to the verdict,id.at.
a conspiracy constitutes an agreement to do an unlawful act.iannelli united states,d.a jury finding of a single conspiracy will be supported if the evidence demonstrates that all of the alleged directed their efforts towards the accomplishment of a common goal or overall plan.united states drougas,cir.e ach coconspirator need not know of or have contact with all other members,nor must they know all of the details of the conspiracy or participate in every act in furtherance of it.united states,cir.the jury may infer an agreement circumstantially by evidence of,inter alia,a common purpose such as a purpose to sell illicit drugs,overlap of participants,and interdependence of various elements in the overall plan.id.at.
here the conspiratorial unit was the las abispas organization headed by cabezon,which trafficked in a variety of drugs.there was evidence it operated a number of drug points,especially in guayama and salinas.cabezon,according to the evidence,rented out the drug points to las abispas members,who answered to him alone.escobar and his brother operated the miramar drug point,under the control of cabezon and his las abispas organization.escobar his brother bought drugs from sources which also supplied other las abispas.escobar sold crack to,a las abispas member who operated another drug point for las abispas.escobar stashed drugs and weapons for one of las abispas suppliers.there was ample evidence of escobar selling of crack at the miramar drug point,including from and outside his own residence.the evidence is thus consistent with escobar participation in a single drug conspiracy defined by the las abispas organization to which he belonged.
it is immaterial there was no proof of a direct connection between escobar and every one of his standing trial.a single conspiracy can exist even where there is no personal contact among some of the individual participants the fact that every defendant did not participate in every transaction necessary to fulfill the common aim does not transform a single ongoing scheme into multiple conspiracies.united states,cir citation omitted.moreover,t he government need not show that every person indicted was a member of the conspiracy,at.the evidence presented here would have allowed a reasonable jury to conclude,as it did,that escobar was involved in a single illegal enterprise having as its common purpose the selling of illegal drugs.
we find no merit in the multiple conspiracy contention.
sentencing considerations 
escobar argues that the district court erred at sentencing when it failed sua sponte to provide a downward adjustment for his allegedly minor role in the offense pursuant to ussg added a enhancement for possession of a firearm pursuant to ussg b and failed to make an individualized finding of a specific drug quantity.finally,escobar argues that,under booker,his sentence should be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing under the newly advisory sentencing guidelines.
minor participant 
escobar argues that,under the sentencing guidelines,the court should,on its own,have afforded him a downward adjustment,as he was a minor participant in any criminal activity.ussg b.escobar,however,never asserted he was entitled to this downward adjustment at the sentencing hearing,even though his counsel was invited by the court to offer corrections and objections to the calculations in the psi,which recommended a guidelines sentence that did not include this adjustment.instead,on two occasions,escobar counsel affirmatively expressed satisfaction with the psi.the district court sentenced escobar in accordance with the psi sentencing calculations,omitting only the psi recommended leadership enhancement,and escobar at no time mentioned or took exception to omission of the minor participant downward adjustment.he waived,therefore,the right to insist upon receiving this benefit.see united states,cir defendant did not argue for adjustment at sentencing and did not object to its omission from the psr,hence the argument was abandoned.
even assuming arguendo that failure to raise the claim were a forfeiture,not a waiver,it would still fail on plain error review.a defendant has the burden of proving he merits a downward adjustment in the offense level.united states ortiz,cir the test is even more demanding on plain error review the defendant must show,in effect,that the status for which he argues is the only one rationally supported by the record below.united states,cir citation omitted.escobar contends that his conduct was one of a street pusher for splenda bag size crack.the evidence shows,however,that for a lengthy period he was also the of a drug point.he purchased and prepared drugs for resale,supplied drugs to other and decided the price scheme for the sale of drugs.he then kept the proceeds from the transactions.thus it was scarcely error,let alone plain error,for the court not to give a downward adjustment on minor participant grounds.
ii.weapons enhancement 
the court followed the recommendation of the psi by adding two levels to escobar offense level under ussg b,which provides that the sentencing judge can increase the offense level by two levels i f a dangerous weapon including a firearm was possessed.again,escobar failed to object to this enhancement either after sentence was pronounced or,earlier,when expressly invited by the district court to offer any corrections and objections to the psi.his attorney objected to the supervisory role enhancement but not to the weapons enhancement.indeed,as already mentioned,the attorney said on two occasions that the supervisory enhancement was the only item in the psi he took exception to.escobar therefore can not raise the issue on appeal.see united states benjamin,cir sentencing challenge should not be addressed for the first time on appeal.and supposing arguendo the issue were open on appeal,we would review only for plain error.id.there was,however,adequate evidence to allow the court to impose the weapons enhancement without committing error,plain or otherwise.the comment to this section states that the enhancement applies if the weapon was present,unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.united states,cir.escobar denies there is evidence in the record that he actually or constructively possessed a firearm.the government,however,points to evidence that escobar concealed weapons for a and possessed a firearm as part of his drug trafficking activities.cooperating witness testified that escobar concealed weapons and drugs for him between approximately and.he testified that when someone had shot at escobar brother,escobar and his brother both possessed weapons of their own.thus we reject escobar assertion that the weapons enhancement was improperly added in computing his sentence.
iii.drug quantity 
escobar argues that the district court erred by not making an individualized finding as to drug amounts attributable to or foreseeable by himself in keeping with.instead,the court,without explanation of its own or in the psi,imposed a guidelines sentence calculated on a drug amount of kilograms of cocaine.the psi,inaccurately it would seem,had described this as the drug with which escobar was involved the court,when sentencing escobar,said without explanation that the offense or sic conviction involved more than one hundred and fifty kilograms of cocaine,that is having done the equivalency factors.one hundred and fifty kilograms of cocaine is more than the minimum amount five or more kilograms charged in the indictment and found by the jury.while the or more wording of the indictment would make it perfectly permissible to conclude on the basis of competent evidence that escobar or his were dealing with more cocaine than the alleged minimum,no evidence of by escobar in the amount of kilograms has been brought to our attention.the trial evidence as to escobar drug involvement related almost exclusively to crack,not cocaine.however,the evidence of record easily supports a finding that escobar crack dealings involved amounts of crack well in excess of that needed to reach the base offense level called for by kilograms of cocaine.see supra note.
a case this circuit handed down on january,two weeks prior to escobar sentencing hearing,stands for the proposition that even when a defendant admits that the conspiracy to which he belonged handled drug quantities sufficient to trigger a statutory mandatory minimum sentence,he is not automatically subject to that mandatory minimum without a further finding that the triggering amounts were specifically attributable to,or foreseeable by,him.at in,the defendant entered a straight guilty plea to a conspiracy involving more than five kilograms of cocaine.at sentencing,the district court found that was responsible for five or more kilograms of cocaine,based solely on his plea to the conspiracy charge,even though the defendant sought to show that he was not personally on notice of or connected with such large amounts.this court found that the district court was in error,without further inquiry,automatically to attribute the full amount of drugs attributed to the conspiracy to the defendant and vacated the sentence.id.at.
as with his other two sentencing objections,escobar has arguably waived his present argument,his couns
