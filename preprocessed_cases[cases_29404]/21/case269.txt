levell matthews stands convicted of one count of conspiring with others to make false statements to a firearms dealer,three counts of possessing a firearm following a felony conviction,and one count of possessing marijuana.he complains about the district court rulings denying him a judgment of acquittal on the count and enhancing his sentence four levels for possessing a gun in connection with felony drug trafficking.finding none of his arguments persuasive,we affirm.
how the case got here 
we summarize the trial evidence against matthews in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.see,united states acosta colón,cir.
arrest and indictment 
this is not matthews first scrape with the law.in he was convicted in new york of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute a crime punishable by more than one year imprisonment.some time after he got off parole for that offense,he headed to maine,staying occasionally with taleek mcfadden and victor morales at renee weeks house.no boy scout himself,mcfadden would later get locked up for selling crack cocaine.
in october matthews and morales walked into a store called frati the pawn brokers.we will refer to this shop as frati,to avoid any confusion with its eponymous owner,orlando frati,who importantly is a federally licensed firearms dealer.matthews checked out a couple of guns while there,actually holding them in his hand.
about two weeks later,matthews and morales stopped by frati again,this time with weeks in tow.matthews zeroed in on a taurus caliber pistol,picking it up to get a closer look.weeks then told frati that she wanted to buy the pistol.frati handed weeks the federal form form that anyone trying to buy a gun must complete.after getting the document,frati ran a background check on her to see whether the sale could take place that day.he learned that weeks name went to delayed status,which meant the sale could not happen right away,so matthews,morales,and weeks took off suspecting that weeks wanted to buy the gun for matthews,frati tipped off atf agent brent mcsweyn,who began to investigate 
around this time,matthews while riding in a car owned by weeks but driven by mcfadden was searched by local police during a traffic stop.turned out matthews had in cash on him,though that is basically all we know about the stop.
fast forward a few weeks.acting on agent mcsweyn instructions,frati called weeks to let her know that she could buy the taurus pistol.she said that she would be there in ten minutes.waiting for her to show up,agent mcsweyn placed atf agent paul mcneil in an unmarked car outside frati and atf agent daniel woolbert in the store,posing as an employee.agent mcsweyn then hid in the store back room.
eventually,weeks drove over with matthews and another woman.only weeks went inside,though,with matthews had given her to buy the pistol.her mission complete,weeks jumped back into her car driver seat and put the pistol unloaded,with the safety lock on on her lap,seconds before agent mcneil approached the driver side and agent mcsweyn approached the passenger side.agent mcsweyn ordered matthews who was sitting in the front passenger seat out of the car.and then agent mcsweyn frisked matthews for weapons.matthews had in his pocket,with a bill on his seat in the car.
agent mcneil told matthews that he was not under arrest.but matthews wanted to clear things up.so agent mcneil read matthews his miranda rights,see miranda arizona,and matthews started talking.no way would he ever ask weeks to get him a gun,matthews said,because he was a convicted felon and knew that he could not have a firearm.that statement did not jibe with matthews going to frati and actually looking at guns,agent mcneil shot back.matthews replied,uh oh.
as they talked,agent mcneil smelled burnt marijuana and asked matthews what he had taken that day.matthews admitted that he had smoked two blunts cigars in which the tobacco has been replaced with marijuana but said that there was no marijuana in weeks car.you want to know where you fucked up matthews then asked mcneil.what you should have done,matthews said,was wait to see where weeks took the gun to see who she was buying it for.a smiling agent mcneil simply fired back,some people might say that is exactly what we did do.we did arrest weeks at the counter.we waited to see,when she left the store,who was in the car and who she was getting the gun for.oh,matthews exclaimed,catching agent mcneil drift,because she was in the store that i had been in,bought the gun that i had looked at,came out to the car that i was sitting in,and i have hundreds of dollars in my pocket bingo,agent mcneil basically said to which matthews replied,that cold with cold being slang for harsh,or so agent mcneil testified.
agent mcsweyn then arrested matthews.knowing the jig was up,matthews said that he had some weed stuffed in his underwear grams worth,tests showed.he also said that he had hidden in his sock,though he actually had.for anyone keeping track,that is in cash law enforcement had caught him with over a fairly short period we are talking weeks.
a federal grand jury later indicted matthews,with the operative document charging him with one count of conspiracy to make false statements on a federal firearms application three counts of gun possession by a previously convicted felon and one count of marijuana possession matthews pled not guilty to all charges.and a jury trial followed in due course.
trial and sentencing 
the trial testimony came in consistent with the facts described above.what we have not mentioned yet is that weeks having copped a plea and agreed to testify for the government told the jury about matthews involvement with crack cocaine,saying that she had seen him with crack and had bought crack from him before.asked whether she was promised crack if she helped with the gun buy,weeks answered yes.matthews counsel attacked her credibility by getting her to talk about how she was a chronic drug abuser,with crack and marijuana being her drugs.
matthews moved for acquittal at the close of the government case.see.a.as relevant here,he argued that prosecutors had failed to prove an element required by namely,that he did not have a valid prescription for the marijuana.convinced that the of a valid prescription is not an element of a offense,the district court denied the motion.after the jury convicted him on all counts,matthews again moved for acquittal on this theory.see.c.but the court denied that motion too.
at sentencing the parties battled over whether the district court should hand matthews a enhancement under the federal sentencing guidelines for possessing a firearm in connection with another felony.see ussg b.leaning heavily on united states cannon,cir,the court imposed the enhancement,describing the other felony as drug trafficking rather than marijuana possession,and concluding matthews had possessed a gun in connection with that offense.this enhancement helped set matthews sentencing range at months in prison.and,ultimately,the court imposed a month term.
this appeal followed.in resolving it,we will add a few more details as we discuss specific issues.
our take on the case 
as we mentioned at the beginning of this opinion,matthews challenges the denial of his acquittal motion on the count plus the imposition of the sentencing enhancement.as we also noted,his arguments do not carry the day for him,for reasons we now explain.
judgment of acquittal 
first up is the issue,which we review de novo.see,united states dávila nieves,cir.
section a provision under the controlled substance act csa forming the basis of matthews conviction pertinently provides that 
i t shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess a controlled substance unless such substance was obtained directly,or pursuant to a valid prescription or order,from a practitioner,while acting in the course of his professional practice.
a emphasis added.matthews reads the unless clause as requiring the government to prove that he did not have a valid marijuana prescription.but another statute that he does not mention or cite,titled burden of proof liabilities undoes his theory.
subsection a of titled exemptions and exceptions presumption in simple possession offenses declares in relevant part that 
i t shall not be necessary for the united states to negative any exemption or exception set forth in this subchapter in any indictment or in any trial and the burden of going forward with the evidence with respect to any such exemption or exception shall be upon the person claiming its benefit.
subsection a adds that in a prosecutions any label identifying such substance shall be admissible in evidence and that the label shall be prima facie evidence that such substance was obtained pursuant to a valid prescription from a practitioner.
the precise issue matthews raises is not one we have faced before.the closest match in our caselaw is united states hooker,an opinion dealing with csa sections different from the one that confronts us here and,not.see,cir.a jury had convicted hooker a licensed physician of distributing and conspiring to distribute prescriptions for controlled substances.id.at citing and.trumpeting his physician status,hooker argued to us that he had statutory authorization to dispense controlled substances and so could not be convicted of illegal distribution unless the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that his deeds fell outside the bounds of the professional medical practice.id.at.critically,in analyzing his argument we noted that under a a defendant claiming the benefit of a medical exemption bears the evidentiary burden with respect to its applicability.id.
hooker helps us understand a effect on evidentiary burdens in this corner of the law.but what ultimately seals matthews fate is a line of cases from other circuits expressly holding based on a plain reading of the statutory text that a unless clause establishes a defense for the accused to raise rather than an element of the offense for the government to prove.see united states forbes,see also united states foster,app x,cir per curiam relying on a in rejecting the idea that a has as an element that the defendant did not possess the drugs pursuant to a valid prescription see generally woods butler,cir relying on forbes in analyzing state statutes virtually identical to a and a,and reaching the same result 
a principle animating these cases is that a contrary ruling would blot out a.again,that provision provides that a label is prima facie evidence that the drugs were obtained lawfully without any contrary evidence by the government,that showing would satisfy a unless clause.matthews offered no prima facie evidence,we must say.anyway,accepting his argument would mean forcing the government to negate the possibility of a valid prescription even in the absence of the label.forbes,f d at.and that can not be what congress had in mind when it set up a statutory scheme requiring the defendant to come forward with evidence of the exception.see id.finding this reasoning convincing,we hold that a s unless clause creates an exception for an accused to invoke by producing prima facie evidence of a valid prescription,not an element of the offense for a prosecutor to prove.
unfortunately for matthews,he can not escape this conclusion with the cases he champions.true,one of his cases says that i t is a general guide to the interpretation of criminal statutes that when an exception is incorporated in the enacting clause of a statute,the burden is on the prosecution to plead and prove that the defendant is not within the exception.united states vuitch,emphasis added.but vuitch general guide is helpful only when congress has not clearly expressed its intent.see united states steele,cir.and here congress has spoken with crystal clarity,declaring in a that a defendant seeking the benefit of an exception found in title must shoulder the burden of coming forward with evidence regarding that exception.so vuitch general rule does not come into play.see steele,at.as for his other cases,they simply mention a without discussing a effect on the crime elements or on the burdens of production.see dorszanski united states,united states labuff,app x,cir mem.united states stone,cir united states swiderski,cir.and that means that they can not turn the tide in matthews favor.
having concluded that a unless clause creates an exception under a,we find that the district court rightly denied matthews a judgment of acquittal.
sentencing enhancement 
which takes us to the issue.the government,naturally,bears the burden of proving sentencing enhancements.see,united states paneto,cir cannon,at.the standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence.see,paneto,f d at cannon,at.either direct or circumstantial evidence will do,with the sentencing court free to draw commonsense inferences from the evidence.see,paneto,at cannon,at.
for our part,we review the district court legal rulings anew,its factfinding for clear error,and its application of the guidelines to the case on a sliding scale with the scrutiny cranked up the more the court decision is.see,united states zehrung,cir citing cannon,at.of course,clear error is not an easy thing to show,because the sentencing court choice among rational but competing inferences can not be clearly erroneous.see,cannon,at.
as relevant here,b b calls for a sentencing enhancement if the defendant possessed any firearm in connection with another felony offense.the enhancement applies,then,if the court finds that the government proved two things by a preponderance of the evidence one,that the defendant committed another felony offense meaning any federal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,regardless of whether a criminal charge was brought,or a conviction obtained,ussg cmt.c and two,that he possessed a firearm in connection with that other offense a phrase read broadly under our caselaw,which neither requires actual use of the weapon during commission of the felony n or physical proximity between the weapon and the contraband.see paneto,at.
taking the evidence in its totality a macro approach,not a micro one,we see enough here to support the district court finding that matthews committed another felony namely,felony drug trafficking.see cannon,at indicating that felony drug trafficking is a qualifying felony under.b b.matthews already had a felony conviction under his belt before getting busted in our case.also,after moving from new york to maine,he chose at some point to pal around with another drug trafficker,mcfadden,living with him for a time and getting pulled over with him in a traffic stop more,matthews sold weeks crack in the past the very drug she was supposed to get for helping the gun buy go down.more still,despite having no job,he had thousands of dollars in cash on him when stopped by law enforcement.on top of that,he had gotten weeks to buy the pistol for him and had grams of marijuana on him,with the gun inches from him when nabbed.
as the district court noted,matthews case bears an uncanny resemblance to cannon.there,we upheld a b sentencing enhancement,highlighting the following cannon had a history as a drug trafficker just like matthews suggesting that he was no idle passenger when the police collared him and his cohorts after a investigation found him armed and sitting in an suv near an unknown amount of drugs.cannon,at,discussing cases holding that a defendant history supports an inference that he is a drug trafficker.calling the combined found on cannon and the others all of whom were unemployed a large stash of cash remember,a jobless matthews had over on him,if you add everything up,with most of it hidden in his sock we said such an amount helps justify an inference that the suv riders were engaged in the sale,rather than the casual use,of drugs.id.at citing cases to back up that point.also,cannon having a gun on him with drugs in the suv matthews had drugs on him with a gun next to him was probative of an intent to distribute narcotics,we wrote.id.citing cases holding that guns and drug dealing go together like a hand in glove.and on that record,we could not say that the sentencing court clearly erred in finding that cannon was engaged in drug trafficking.id.at.given the eerie similarities between canno
