these two appeals present two questions of first impression in this circuit whether,given the language of the mandatory victim restitution act mvra,the united states through one of its agencies is a victim for purposes of the mvra and if so,whether the amount of restitution imposed under the mvra should be offset by the value of property forfeited to the attorney general under.we hold,in agreement with every circuit to have considered these issues,that the united states is a victim within the meaning of,and that a restitution award may not be offset by the value of property forfeited to the attorney general.we affirm the restitution orders imposed by the district court.
only those facts necessary to frame the issues are presented.defendants mei ya zhang and mei juan zhang are sisters who each managed chinese restaurants in maine where undocumented immigrants were employed mei juan zhang managed a buffet restaurant in waterville,maine the waterville buffet,and assisted in transporting the restaurant employees back and forth from a safe house in waterville where the employees lived.she admitted that she was responsible for hiring new employees and that she knew some of the individuals she hired were not authorized to work in the united states.
similarly,mei ya zhang managed a buffet restaurant in brewer,maine the brewer buffet.she admitted being responsible for the hiring of new employees,some of whom she knew were not authorized to work in the united states.she also was in charge of the brewer safe house where some of the brewer buffet undocumented employees lived.
defendants uncle,zi qian zhang,was apparently the mastermind behind the hiring of the undocumented immigrants.at the time defendants were charged,he was the owner of the brewer buffet and the previous owner of the waterville buffet.he arranged for the undocumented immigrants to be sent to the restaurants and hired.
defendants were charged with conspiracy to harbor and aiding and abetting the harboring of illegal aliens for commercial advantage and private financial gain,see a a iii,v,b i conspiracy to launder money,see a,h and conspiracy to file false employer quarterly tax returns with the internal revenue service,see.the basis of the last charge was defendants failure to include the cash compensation paid to the undocumented immigrants on the restaurants tax returns,which in turn resulted in an underpayment of federal employment taxes to the irs.the charging documents for both defendants included a notice of forfeiture pursuant to,which included any property that derived from or was used to facilitate the offenses.the government in fact seized from two bank accounts related to the waterville buffet,and the attorney general retained those funds as forfeiture proceeds see b g,i.
both defendants pled guilty to all three charged counts.the district court sentenced mei ya zhang to months imprisonment and mei juan zhang to months imprisonment.both sentences represented downward variances from the applicable guidelines range.
at sentencing for each defendant,the district court held that the mvra,required it to issue an order of restitution compelling defendants to pay to the irs the taxes wrongfully withheld as a result of defendants failure to report the compensation paid to the undocumented workers at defendants restaurants.the court ordered mei ya zhang and mei juan zhang to pay and,respectively,in restitution to the irs.the court did not offset mei juan zhang restitution obligation by the forfeiture proceeds that the government had seized from the waterville buffet bank accounts.
on appeal,both defendants argue that the district court erred in ordering restitution because the united states is not a victim for purposes of.mei juan zhang also argues that the district court should have offset the restitution award by the amount of the forfeiture and that its failure to do so resulted in an impermissible windfall for the government.we bypass the arguments by the government that each defendant either waived or forfeited these arguments,and turn to the merits.united states pitrone,cir.
whether the united states is eligible to be a victim under the mvra 
the mvra provides for mandatory restitution to the victims of certain crimes,including,as relevant here,offenses against property which are committed by fraud or deceit.a,c a ii.the statute defines victim as a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered.id.a.defendants argue this term should not be construed to include the united states because the dictionary act,does not include the government in its definition of person,nor does the ordinary meaning of the word person include the government.united states united mine workers of,in common usage that term person does not include the sovereign,and statutes employing it will ordinarily not be construed to do so.
this argument has been rejected by every court to have considered it,and rightfully so.the definitions contained in the dictionary act apply unless the context of the statute indicates otherwise.under rowland california men colony,context as used in means the text of the act of congress surrounding the word at issue,or the texts of other related congressional acts.rowland,at.and the context here indicates unequivocally that the word person,as used in the mvra,includes the government.the enforcement provision of the mvra explicitly recognizes the government as a possible victim.see i in any case in which the united states is a victim,the court shall ensure that all other victims receive full restitution before the united states receives any restitution.emphasis added.n othing indicates that congress intended two different meanings when it used the same word victim in and i related provisions adopted at the same time and codified in serial sections in the united states code.united states ekanem,cir accord united states turner,cir united states mateos,cir,united states senty haugen,cir united states lincoln,cir see also united states s√°nchez maldonado,cir characterizing the fbi as a victim under on plain error review.indeed,if we defined victim differently,one wonders how i could ever serve any purpose.see duncan walker,noting that courts must,if possible,give meaning to every portion of a statute 
we join our sister circuits in holding that the united states may be a victim for purposes of the mvra.the district court did not err in ordering restitution to the irs.
whether a restitution award may be offset by forfeiture proceeds 
we start with an explanation of where forfeited monies go,before addressing the offset question.the attorney general has the responsibility for disposing of funds seized under the criminal forfeiture statute.see b providing that the criminal forfeiture of property is governed by,which gives the attorney general the authority to direct the disposition of the property by sale or any other commercially feasible means,making due provision for the rights of any innocent persons,id.h.although the attorney general and the irs are both part of the federal government,they are distinct entities.united states joseph,cir per curiam.
we join the analysis set forth in the eleventh circuit opinion in joseph.there,the defendant,who,as here,had defrauded the irs,argued that he was entitled to an offset of his ordered restitution amount by the value of currency seized by the government which were the proceeds of his fraud.id.at.the joseph court held that,under the plain language of the mvra,the district court had no authority to order such an offset,at least where there was no evidence that the victim had received the value of the forfeited property.id.at.the court explained that the mvra requires a district court to order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.id.at quoting f a.moreover,a restitution order is required in addition to any other penalty authorized by law,id.quoting a,such as an order of forfeiture under.
