opinion of the court 
this case returns to us on a grant,vacate,and remand gvr order of the supreme court of the united states.our earlier precedential opinion and judgment of march,had affirmed steiner conviction for possession of ammunition by a convicted felon g we did not reach challenges to steiner sentence,as he had not raised any.
the supreme court gvr order instructs us to reconsider our decision in light of mathis united states the court latest case about predicate offenses and the categorical approach.we asked the parties to file short supplemental statements addressing both the impact of mathis on our previous opinion and the merits of steiner mathis challenge more generally steiner also separately moved to remand for expedited resentencing.both steiner and the government agree that mathis did not affect the validity of our earlier decision affirming steiner conviction.they also agree that it does affect steiner sentence the district court used a pennsylvania burglary conviction as a predicate crime of violence under the united states sentencing guidelines,which the government now concedes was plain error.
because we agree with the parties that,under mathis,steiner burglary conviction was not a predicate crime of violence under the guidelines and,thus,that his guidelines range should not have been enhanced we will grant steiner motion for summary action,vacate the district court judgment of sentence,and remand for expedited resentencing.steiner is to be released from federal custody pending resentencing,subject to the supervised release terms contained in the district court judgment of sentence.and because our previous precedential opinion was not at all affected by mathis,we will once again affirm steiner conviction.we therefore revise and reissue below our previous precedential opinion as altered by our mathis discussion and the alternative disposition it requires.
background 
during the execution of two separate search warrants at properties that police believed were owned or occupied by defendant thomas steiner,police seized,among other things,a shotgun,and caliber ammunition,and gauge shotgun ammunition.as a result,steiner was indicted on two counts for being a of a firearm and ammunition in violation of g.following a trial,he was convicted on one count of of ammunition and sentenced to an prison term.
during the trial,the government introduced into evidence the fact that a warrant had issued for steiner arrest on an unrelated charge.steiner contends that the district court improperly admitted evidence of the arrest warrant that was unrelated to the offenses he faced at trial.he also argues that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury that it was required to reach a unanimous verdict as to each type of ammunition seized.while we conclude that the admission of the unrelated arrest warrant was error,the error was harmless.we also conclude that the district court did not err when it declined to provide a unanimity instruction.for the reasons that follow,we will affirm the conviction.as intervening supreme court precedent has affected the validity of steiner sentence an error that the government concedes is worthy of remand we will vacate the judgment of sentence and remand for expedited resentencing.
operation,search,and indictment 
this case arises from a sting operation.in august,police informant timothy stants told pennsylvania state trooper thomas baumgard that thomas steiner,a convicted felon,was staying on his stants property and was on the run from law enforcement.stants also claimed that steiner had a shotgun,which steiner had described to him as a cop killer,and that steiner said he would use the gun to avoid being arrested.stants claimed that the shotgun would be found in a camper on stants property.
based on stants tip,baumgard obtained a search warrant for the camper.before executing the warrant on august,baumgard paid stants for his help in securing steiner arrest and told stants to drive steiner to a nearby gas station.there,officers would be waiting to arrest steiner on a warrant that had issued for steiner arrest for failure to appear at a preliminary hearing scheduled that same day,on an unrelated sexual assault charge.baumgard conducted his search of the camper in the afternoon,just after stants drove steiner away to the gas station.he found,among other things,a shotgun loaded with six rounds of shotgun ammunition a wallet containing various documents,all bearing steiner name and a discharged shotgun shell.soon after the search,baumgard ordered steiner arrested on the warrant issued for his failure to appear at the preliminary hearing earlier that day.at the time of his arrest,steiner was in stants car at a nearby gas station.
apparently,there was more to the story than the gun and ammunition found in the camper.stants also told police that he had seen the missing pieces of the shotgun part of the barrel and stock at a home that steiner supposedly owned,located at meadow avenue the home or the meadow avenue home.based on stants tip,police obtained another search warrant,this time for the home.
police executed the search warrant for the home on august.when they arrived,they entered the basement of the home,which was in disarray there,they found a shotgun stock on the bar and a shotgun barrel in the ceiling where a tile was missing also,they discovered a hacksaw and pipe wrenches on the basement floor and a single shotgun shell in a pocket of the pool table.four other shotgun shells were found in a bowl,on top of which was steiner notice of impending warrant of arrest.in addition to the shotgun ammunition,the police also discovered a variety of other types of ammunition,including rounds of caliber ammunition and rounds of special ammunition.
based on the shotgun and ammunition found in the camper,a grand jury charged steiner with one count of being a of a firearm and ammunition in violation of g.a superseding indictment was filed several months later,adding a second count charging steiner with a violation of g based on the ammunition found in the home.
the government case against steiner proceeded to a jury trial at trial,steiner stipulated to having a prior felony conviction.he testified in his own defense and denied that he ever owned or possessed the shotgun or ammunition seized from either the camper or the basement of the home.steiner also acknowledged that he owned the wallet found in the camper and admitted that he owned the meadow avenue home at some point in.
steiner,greta steiner,was called as a witness.she testified that although she had been living at a different address in,she occasionally stopped at the meadow avenue home to retrieve her belongings.she also testified that during these visits she saw neither firearms nor ammunition in the home but she recalled having stored boxes of antique ammunition that belonged to her deceased in the home garage.she denied that anyone ever brought the ammunition into the home and claimed that steiner was unaware of the ammunition.neither steiner nor the government presented evidence about whether the ammunition stored in the garage may have been moved to the basement.
mark williams,stants close friend,testified for the government.williams claimed that he had been inside steiner home in august because he was interested in purchasing the property at that time,williams said that he noticed the shotgun barrel and the hacksaw laying on a homemade bar and pointed them out to stants.williams also claimed that steiner told him that he would go easy if the police tried to arrest him.
stants also testified.he denied receiving any benefit for his help in securing steiner arrest,despite baumgard testimony that he had paid stants for his assistance.he also corroborated williams testimony regarding the basement of the home and admitted that he had visited steiner home twice in steiner absence.
the government arrest warrant evidence 
during steiner trial,the government introduced the arrest warrant that had issued based upon steiner failure to appear on the sexual assault charge.the government argued that the arrest warrant though not the underlying conduct,was admissible to show that steiner was on the run from law enforcement at the time,hiding out in this trailer,and was intending to evade the warrant and not appear at the preliminary hearing because t hat what led officers to his trailer in the first place.the government claimed that the arrest warrant complete d the story because it was background of what led law enforcement to steiner to begin with in this case.however,this was not true.stants tip regarding the shotgun was the actual source of the government initial interest in steiner.the district court,relying on the government representation,admitted the arrest warrant evidence as background under federal rule of evidence b.the court reasoned that,as long as the underlying conduct was not admitted,any prejudice to steiner was minimized.the court,though,expressly rejected any argument that the evidence could be admitted to prove steiner motive or intent under rule b.
the district court jury instruction on unanimity 
the government requested that the jury be instructed that although the defendant was charged with possessing ammunition in different varieties or from different locations,it need not unanimously agree on which ammunition he possessed to convict him of felony possession under g.steiner objected and requested that the jury be instructed that it must agree as to which ammunition steiner possessed,adding that the indictment was confusing.the district court adopted the government position and instructed the jury that unanimity was not required with respect to the firearm or ammunition.specifically,the court stated 
although all jurors must agree with respect to count that the defendant possessed a firearm or ammunition and with respect to count that the defendant possessed different ammunition,you need not all agree on the exact item possessed.for example,if a defendant was charged with possessing one piece of ammunition found in the bedroom,one piece of ammunition found in the living room,and one piece of ammunition found in the basement,you must all unanimously agree that the defendant possessed at least one piece of ammunition in order to convict.you do not have to agree on which one or if he possessed more than one.
therefore,it would be sufficient if ten jurors determined that he possessed one piece of ammunition in the bedroom,one juror determined that he possessed one piece of ammunition found in the basement,and one juror determined that he possessed them all.in other words,if the defendant is alleged to have been in possession of ammunition of different varieties or from different locations,you must all find that as to the ammunition charged in each count he possessed at least some ammunition as charged in that count in order to convict,but need not all agree with respect to a count on exactly which ammunition was actually possessed as charged in that count 
the jury found steiner not guilty on count one charging possession of the gun and ammunition in the camper,but guilty on count two charging possession of the ammunition found in the meadow avenue home.
to steiner conviction 
admission of the arrest warrant 
first,steiner argues that the district court erred by admitting evidence of the arrest warrant that had issued for his failure to appear at a preliminary hearing on an unrelated charge.the district court stated during the in limine hearing on the admissibility of the arrest warrant,and memorialized in its minute entry,that its decision rested on rule b grounds based on the government representations,the court admitted the evidence as background or to complete the story of the crime.
steiner argues that,while courts in this circuit have occasionally admitted evidence under rule b for the purpose of completing the story or providing background,they have also generally limited the use of those purposes to conspiracy cases.in response,the government asserts that the arrest warrant was properly admitted under rule b because it identified a proper purpose for the evidence it was necessary to provide background and complete the story of steiner arrest,interrogation,and the police investigation of the crimes charged.
for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court erred by admitting the arrest warrant.
admission of the arrest warrant under rule b 
we review the district court evidentiary rulings principally on an abuse of discretion standard,which occurs only when the district court decision is arbitrary,fanciful,or clearly unreasonable in short,where no reasonable person would adopt the district court view.we conduct plenary review,however,of the district court rulings to the extent they are based on a legal interpretation of the federal rules of evidence.this includes plenary review of whether evidence falls within the scope of rule b.
rule b provides that evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is not admissible to prove character or demonstrate action in conformity with those acts evidence,though,may be admitted for another purpose,such as proving motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake,or lack of accident.to be admissible,evidence must satisfy the test set forth in huddleston united states as the supreme court stated there,the proffered evidence must be offered for a proper purpose under rule b relevant to that purpose sufficiently probative under the rule balancing requirement and accompanied by a limiting instruction,if requested and,u nless the reason is apparent from the record,a mere list of the purposes found in rule b is insufficient.indeed,t he district court must put a chain of inferences into the record,none of which is the inference that the defendant has a propensity to commit this crime.
in united states green,we concluded that allowing the jury to understand the circumstances surrounding the charged crime completing the story is a proper,purpose under rule b.we also stated that evidence is admissible to supply helpful background information to the finder of fact.with all of this in mind,one might ask is not all evidence helpful to providing background to the factfinder the answer is yes.but not all helpful evidence is relevant to a proper purpose under rule b.
in fact,steiner is correct that the majority of criminal cases in which we have deemed background a proper purpose involve conspiracies and there is no conspiracy involved in this case.also,in at least one opinion that preceded our decision in green,we specifically warned that,while courts have occasionally admitted prior crimes evidence as background,this label is uninformative at best and,at worst,can be an unacceptable substitute for the analysis required by rule b.
there are unique characteristics that render background a proper purpose for admitting evidence in conspiracy cases.for instance,in proving the existence of a conspiracy,a court might allow a party to present background evidence revealing an ongoing relationship between likewise,this court affirmed the admission of background evidence to help the jury understand one conspirator role in a complex scheme but neither of those models applies in this case.
here,steiner is the only defendant.there was no need for the government to explain a complicated backstory.we are not suggesting that conspiracy cases are the only ones in which background facts may be admissible as b evidence.we are saying that,when the information needed to understand what happened in a case is straightforward and easily understood without reference to facts that do not bear on the charged offense,forcing extraneous and potentially prejudicial information into the record in the name of background is not defensible under rule b.that,unfortunately,is what happened here.stants tip entirely explained why the government was focusing on steiner.in fact,the arrest warrant evidence was completely irrelevant to the government case we therefore find this case to be sufficiently distinct from cases in which background evidence may be admissible under rule b.
in green,by contrast,we concluded that the background information evidence that the defendant threatened to kill a police officer was properly admitted under rule b because it fit into a chain of logical inferences and explained why the defendant was under investigation for the crime charged,attempted possession with intent to distribute cocaine we also held that the information was properly admitted for the purpose of proving the informant motive to cooperate,which was put at issue by the defendant we therefore find green distinguishable insofar as the evidence there served to complete the story of the crime charged.here,we conclude that evidence of the outstanding arrest warrant on the unrelated sexual assault charge had nothing whatsoever to do with steiner charged crime of felony possession of a weapon or ammunition under g.
again,to be clear,we do not conclude that any evidence offered for the purpose of providing background is only admissible in conspiracy cases.there may and likely will be other situations in which such evidence is admissible outside of the conspiracy context.nor do we venture to paint the absolute contours of when evidence may be admissible to provide background under rule b.we simply conclude that,on these facts,the district court abused its discretion by admitting the arrest warrant evidence for the purpose of providing background.
to be sure,the district court was not entirely,or even primarily,to blame for its error.the government played a central role.here,the prosecutor wrongly asserted that the government needed the unrelated arrest warrant to prove that steiner was guilty of felony possession.yet it is clear to us that the government did not need the arrest warrant to try a case against steiner at all.the government had stants tip,stants and williams testimony that steiner owned the home in and possessed a shotgun,and a stipulation that steiner was a felon.taken together,this evidence strongly supported the government theory that steiner unlawfully possessed the firearm and ammunition.the only purpose the arrest warrant served was to improperly suggest that steiner was predisposed to commit criminal acts.
in sum,we are deeply troubled by the government inaccurate claim that the arrest warrant was what led officers to steiner trailer in the first place,and we are persuaded that that inaccuracy led the district court to err by admitting evidence of the warrant we therefore admonish the government to take greater care in its representations to the trial court and not brandish rule b so cavalierly 
whether the error was harmless 
while we find that the district court improperly admitted the arrest warrant,we conclude that the error was harmless we can call a nonconstitutional error harmless,and uphold the conviction,if there is a high probability that the error did not contribute to the judgment,requiring us to have a sure conviction that the error did not prejudice the defendant.
first,the arrest warrant evidence had no prejudicial impact on the jury determination as to count one,because steiner was found not guilty of that charge.it is therefore reasonable to infer that the evidence had no effect as to count two.second,the district court did not disclose the conduct underlying the arrest warrant,that is,the alleged sexual assault of a minor.third,at trial,steiner stipulated to having a prior felony conviction.also,when he took the stand,steiner admitted that he was previously convicted of crimes of falsehood burglary,theft,and felony forgery.and finally,the ample evidence presented surrounding steiner ownership and occupation of the home,stants and williams testimony regarding the same,and the lack of evidence linking the antique ammunition in the garage to the ammunition found in the home,convinces us that the additional arrest warrant evidence did not affect the jury guilty verdict as to count two.
we therefore conclude that any error in admitting the prior act evidence under rule b was harmless.
steiner jury instruction challenge 
next,steiner argues in his briefs that the district court erred by refusing to instruct jurors that they must unanimously agree as to which ammunition he possessed to find him guilty under count two.in support of his claim,steiner argues that the government improperly bundled into count two multiple,distinct violations of g,each of which should have been prosecuted as a separate violation of the statute put another way,he claims that the indictment was duplicitous because the government improperly joined possession of separate types of ammunition into one count to cure this defect,steiner contends that the district court should have instructed the jury that it had to unanimously determine which ammunition steiner possessed to find him guilty on count two.by expressly declining to give this curative jury instruction,steiner argues that the district court deprived him of his sixth amendment right to a unanimous jury verdict,and therefore his conviction under count two should be vacated.
we reject steiner argument.in our view,the evidence at trial overwhelmingly demonstrated that steiner possessed the ammunition in one part of the meadow avenue home,which he owned in.for the additional reasons that follow,we therefore conclude the indictment properly charged steiner with a single violation of g under count two and that a special unanimity instruction was not required.
whether an indictment is duplicitous is a question of law subject to de novo review we also review de novo whether the jury instructions stated the proper legal standard.we review the refusal to give a particular instruction or the wording of instructions for abuse of discretion.
duplicity is the improper combining of separate offenses into a single count when a defendant sixth amendment right to a unanimous jury verdict is jeopardized by a duplicitous indictment,a court can cure the indictment by issuing a limiting instruction requiring the jury to unanimously find the defendant guilty of at least one distinct act 
under federal rule of criminal procedure b b,a motion alleging a defect in the indictment must be made before trial.yet while a defendant waives technical errors to an indictment by his failure to object to the duplicity before trial,courts have held that the alleged harm to the defendant substantive rights resulting from a duplicitous indictment can be raised at trial or on appeal,notwithstanding the defendant failure to make a pretrial motion the rationale for this distinction is that,whereas rule applies only to defects in the institution of criminal proceedings,a verdict rendered by a jury violates a defendant sixth amendment rights by a harm that arises from the trial itself.
count two of the indictment charged steiner with a violation of g,which,in relevant part,provides it shall be unlawful for any person who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce,or possess in or affecting commerce,any firearm or ammunition or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.
to determine whether count two was duplicitous,we first focus on the allowable unit of prosecution to decide whether the indictment properly charges a violation of the relevant statute we have held that the allowable unit of prosecution under g is the incident of possession,regardless of whether a defendant possessed more than one firearm,or possessed a firearm and ammunition in other words,we ask if the evidence establishes that the defendant committed a single act of possessing firearms or ammunition,or instead whether the evidence indicates that multiple,distinct acts of unlawful possession occurred.
we have also stated that simultaneous possession of multiple firearms or pieces of ammunition does not give rise to a separate offense for each firearm or piece of ammunition possessed likewise,multiple convictions for possession of multiple firearms may be appropriate where the firearms in question were seized in different locations or if they were acquired in separate transactions 
these observations lead us to the question of how we determine whether an indictment is duplicitous when someone is charged with felony possession of various types of ammunition,all of which are located in the basement of a home.in resolving steiner challenge,our prior cases provide us with sufficient guidance.in this case,we conclude that the indictment was not duplicitous and that a curative jury instruction was not required.
in united states marino and united states frankenberry,we held that the simultaneous possession or receipt of several firearms by a convicted felon constituted a single offense under the predecessor statutes to g,absent a showing that the weapons were separately stored or acquired we further elaborated on the concept of simultaneous possession in united states tann.in tann,the indictment charged the defendant with two separate g violations based upon possession of a gun found in the bathroom where he was arrested and ammunition that was located in his pocket at the same time there,we determined that the two items were simultaneously possessed.as a result,we concluded that possession of both a firearm and ammunition,seized at the same time in the same location,supported only one conviction and sentence under g 
however,in united states kennedy,we held that mere physical proximity does not demonstrate simultaneous possession there,we declined to find simultaneous possession where firearms were stored in two separate vehicles located on the same premises in reaching this conclusion,we specifically noted that,when determining whether firearms are simultaneously possessed,what matters is the defendant course of treatment of the firearms,which may not be viewed in a frozen,momentary state immediately prior to the seizure.we therefore held that the district court erred when it merged two separate felony possession counts for purposes of resentencing the defendant 
these cases demonstrate that determining whether individual firearms or ammunition were simultaneously possessed is a highly inquiry that depends on the circumstances surrounding a defendant alleged conduct.
here,other than steiner testimony,there is little,if any,evidence supporting steiner contention that the ammunition found in the home was acquired at different times and for different purposes,or that it was separately stored in the home.by contrast,the evidence at trial strongly demonstrated that steiner owned the home in and that all of the ammunition was stored in various parts of the basement moreover,at least some of the ammunition was literally found resting under steiner notice of impending warrant of arrest.and,while steiner testified that she brought various types of antique ammunition into the garage in,none of the ammunition that steiner was charged with possessing was located in the garage,and none of the physical evidence specifically linked the ammunition found in the basement to greta steiner or her deceased.moreover,even if we accepted that greta steiner purchased the ammunition found in the basement in the first instance,the jury could have found that steiner himself later acquired the ammunition from greta steiner,and not,as steiner claims,from other sources on other occasions.
in sum,we conclude that the indictment was not duplicitous.accordingly,the district court failure to give a special unanimity instruction as to count two did not constitute a violation of steiner sixth amendment right to a unanimous jury verdict 
to steiner sentence after mathis 
we now turn to steiner challenge to his sentence,which he invoked in his petition for certiorari but not in his initial appeal to us 
by way of background,the offense guideline applicable to steiner g conviction is which sets out various base offense levels that depend on the circumstances of the offense and the defendant criminal history.at sentencing,the district court determined that the appropriate base offense level was corresponding to a a because of a predicate conviction for a crime of violence a pennsylvania burglary conviction.section does not itself define crime of violence.instead,it refers to the language of a,which specifically defines burglary of a dwelling as a crime of violence.alongside steiner criminal history score of vi,a base offense level of yielded a guidelines range of months in prison.as mentioned earlier,steiner was sentenced to the high end of that range,receiving months.
steiner filed a petition for certiorari on the basis of the supreme court intervening decision in mathis united states pointing to mathis,steiner argued that his pennsylvania burglary conviction was no longer categorically a crime of violence.without the enhancement,steiner base offense level would have been,not,thereby yielding a sentencing range of to months imprisonment a range of possibilities all markedly below the sentence he had actually received.
as instructed by the supreme court gvr order,we now consider the application of mathis to steiner sentence.although the parties agree on mathis effect,it is not for them to say.rather,t his question is one for the courts not the parties to decide.
mathis is the latest in the supreme court series of opinions on how prior convictions can be used as predicate violent felonies under the armed career criminal act acca,e,precedent that generally applies also to crimes of violence enhancements under the guidelines mathis further refined the court jurisprudence about when,in applying an enhancement or analysis,a court may use the modified categorical approach appropriate for statutes that are divisible,listing elements in the alternative or describing separate crimes,and which is employed to determine what crime a defendant was actually convicted of instead of the categorical approach,to which we turn when a statute is not divisible 
in mathis,the supreme court analyzed an iowa burglary statute that prohibited unlawful entry into not just buildings or other structures which is the generic federal definition of burglary but also into land,water,or air vehicle s.the court explained that the iowa statute laid out not separate elements,but alternative ways of satisfying a single locational element the statute defines one crime,with one set of elements,broader than generic burglary.because a state crime can not qualify as an acca predicate if its elements are broader than those of a listed generic offense,a conviction under iowa burglary statute could not suffice under the proper categorical approach the district court had erred by using a modified categorical approach instead,treating the statute separate means of committing the offense as if they were elements.the district court therefore looked at the records of mathis prior convictions to determin e that he had burgled structures,rather than vehicles.
the relevant pennsylvania statute has many of the same features as the iowa statute discussed in mathis.the pennsylvania statute defined burglary as enter ing a building or occupied structure,or separately secured or occupied portion thereof,with intent to commit a crime therein,unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the actor is licensed or privileged to enter.occupied structure,addressed one section earlier,meant a ny structure,vehicle or place adapted for overnight accommodation of persons,or for carrying on business therein,whether or not a person is actually present.
the question mathis tells us to ask are these alternate means or alternate elements can be resolved by reference to authoritative sources of state law or,if necessary,the record of a prior conviction itself for the sole and limited purpose of determining whether we confront means or elements in this case,the pennsylvania information charged steiner with feloniously enter ing a building or occupied structure,or separately secured or occupied portion thereof,with intent to commit a crime therein,although the information did identify the specific location immediately following to the extent this is equivocal,we note that pennsylvania model criminal jury instructions,albeit for the current version of the statute,do not require the jury to unanimously agree on the nature of the location it can be a building,or occupied structure,or a separately secured or occupied portion of a building or structure.by contrast,it ap
