at the conclusion of a three week trial,a federal jury found former federal bureau of investigation fbi agent john connolly,guilty of one count of racketeering under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,c,two counts of obstruction of justice,and one count of making false statements.the district court subsequently imposed a sentence of months of imprisonment,followed by a period of supervised release.connolly now appeals his rico conviction,arguing that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the rico charge because the government failed to prove two critical elements of its rico in an enterprise,and a pattern of racketeering activity.see id,defining enterprise and pattern of racketeering activity 
connolly also appeals his sentence,arguing that the district court erred in its calculation of the applicable offense level pursuant to sections,and of the united states sentencing guidelines or guidelines.finally,connolly argues that the district court erred when it denied his request to convene a evidentiary hearing to inquire into the propriety of alleged by jurors.he asks that we remand the case to the district court for an inquiry into possible juror misconduct.
finding no reason to disturb connolly conviction or sentence or to remand to the district court,we affirm.
we provide some general background facts here,saving our more detailed discussion of the evidence for our assessment in part ii of connolly claims of evidentiary insufficiency.connolly joined the fbi in from until he served as an agent in the bureau boston office.during his tenure,he was responsible for handling several,confidential informants with connections to two criminal winter hill gang,and the new england branch of la cosa nostra.according to the government,the winter hill gang is a clandestine criminal organization engaged in multiple crimes,including murder,bribery,extortion,loan sharking,and illegal gambling in the greater boston,massachusetts area.la casa considerably larger,better known,and more established criminal engages in illegal activities in and around boston.despite the fact that the winter hill gang and la cosa nostra were often rivals,members of the two groups frequently cooperated in criminal undertakings.
two of the informants for whom connolly was responsible,james bulger and stephen flemmi,were members of the winter hill gang.bulger and flemmi reported on the activities of both the gang and la cosa nostra for over a decade.shortly after connolly retired from the fbi in,however,bulger and flemmi were closed as fbi,the fbi no longer desired their services.
after bulger and flemmi ceased to serve as informants,their involvement with the gang criminal activities nonetheless continued.for example,at some point in the early,flemmi,working with the boss of la cosa nostra boston family,frank salemme,ran an illegal numbers operation in the boston area.on january,a federal grand jury indicted bulger,flemmi,salemme,and several other persons for multiple counts of illegal gambling,extortion,assault,bribery,obstruction of justice,loansharking,and rico violations.see united states salemme,indictment.flemmi was quickly arrested and taken into custody.bulger and salemme,however,forewarned of the pending indictment,disappeared a few days before its issuance.the authorities apprehended salemme eight months later.bulger remains at large.
the instant criminal proceeding began in december,when another federal grand jury indicted flemmi and connolly on charges of racketeering,obstruction of justice,and conspiracy a superceding indictment was filed in october with additional charges of obstruction of justice and making a false statement.according to the superceding indictment,connolly had led a for over two decades.while serving as an fbi agent,connolly had been intimately involved in the criminal activities of the winter hill gang and its members,receiving and making bribes from and on behalf of members of the gang.even after his retirement from the bureau,connolly allegedly continued to exploit his connections within the bureau to become privy to confidential information that he would then pass along to members of the winter hill gang.
specifically,the superceding indictment included nine counts,which we summarize as follows 
counts and conspiracy to violate rico,alleging that connolly had,through a pattern of racketeering activity,participated in the affairs of an enterprise whose members included bulger,flemmi,himself,and unidentified others.the purpose of the enterprise was to protect bulger,flemmi,and their associates including salemme and members of the winter hill gang from arrest and prosecution,and to facilitate their criminal activities.the two counts detail fourteen different racketeering acts,including allegations of bribery,extortion,and obstruction of justice.
count to obstruct justice,alleging that connolly and flemmi,together with others,had conspired to obstruct justice in the prosecution of bulger,flemmi,and salemme in united states salemme.
count of justice,alleging that connolly had informed salemme of the pending indictment in united states salemme.
count of justice,alleging that flemmi had also provided salemme with news of the pending indictment.
count of justice,alleging that connolly had caused an anonymous letter to be sent to judge mark wolf who was presiding over united states salemme.the letter purported to come from three unnamed boston police officers and credited certain claims made by the defense.
counts of justice,alleging that connolly had persuaded flemmi to give false testimony in united states salemme.specifically,connolly persuaded flemmi to testify that another fbi not alerted him and bulger to the pending indictment.
count statement,alleging that connolly had lied to an fbi agent when he told the agent that he had not been in contact with the defense team in united states salemme.
flemmi ultimately pleaded guilty to counts and the only two counts in which he was named and was sentenced to months of imprisonment.
in may,the trial against connolly began on counts,and at the close of the government case and at the close of all of the evidence,connolly moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to.the court denied the motions.the jury returned guilty verdicts against connolly on four of the five counts at,and acquitted on count.connolly renewed his rule motion after the verdict,and the court once again denied it.
on september,the district court sentenced connolly to a term of incarceration of months followed by a period of supervised release.the district court denied connolly request for release on bail pending appeal,and we denied a similar,subsequent application.we now address connolly arguments of error by the trial court.
connolly claims that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal on the rico count because the government failed to present sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt two essential elements of the rico charge connolly participation in an enterprise,and a pattern of racketeering activity,as defined by statute and applicable case law.see.
in evaluating a claim of insufficiency of the evidence,we review the record de novo,and w e will affirm the conviction if,after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government,and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor,a rational factfinder could find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.united states boulerice,cir quoting united states,cir.we need not believe that no verdict other than a guilty verdict could sensibly be reached.united states gomez,cir quoting united states echeverri,cir.rather,the operative inquiry is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d original emphasis.
to that end,a reviewing court must play a very circumscribed role in gauging the sufficiency of the evidentiary foundation upon which a criminal conviction rests.united states,cir.we will give considerable deference to a jury assessment of the evidence,and we will disturb the jury verdict only if it is premised upon evidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable,insupportable,or overly speculative.united states czubinski,cir.that is to say,we will reverse only if the verdict is irrational.see united states berrios,cir w e must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and reverse only if no rational trier of fact could have found him guilty.
the rico count alleged a violation of c,which provides in pertinent part 
it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
the meaning of enterprise and pattern of racketeering activity is explicated in 
enterprise includes any individual,partnership,corporation,association,or other legal entity,and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity 
pattern of racketeering activity requires at least two acts of racketeering activity,one of which occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of which occurred within ten years excluding any period of imprisonment after the commission of a prior act of racketeering activity 
the supreme court has repeatedly indicated that courts should take a natural and commonsense approach in assessing the elements of a rico violation.northwestern bell,d see reves ernst young,d united states turkette,d see also united states boylan,cir in the absence of any pat formula,the court has instructed us to use a flexible approach deriv ing from a,everyday understanding of rico language and congress gloss on it.quoting,at.against this backdrop,we now turn to connolly specific claims.
enterprise 
the charge 
count of the superceding indictment alleged that connolly,bulger,flemmi,and others were members of an enterprise,that is to say,a group of individuals associated in fact,and that this enterprise,
through its members and associates,acted to protect james bulger,stephen flemmi and their associates,including francis salemme and those in the winter hill gang,from arrest and prosecution for criminal activities including murder,loan sharking,illegal gambling,extortion,obstruction of justice,and bribery and it acted to facilitate those criminal activities of bulger,flemmi,and their associates.
the indictment further alleged that the enterprise protected and fostered its members criminal activities by 
providing bulger and flemmi with confidential law enforcement information regarding grand jury investigations,electronic surveillance,and other investigative efforts deflecting and squelching prosecutions and criminal investigations of their crimes and improperly preserving their status as fbi informants through the filing of misleading official reports and by failing to report information relating to bulger and flemmi which was material to the investigation of criminal activity.
the indictment distinguishes this enterprise from the winter hill gang and la cosa nostra,though individual affiliations do overlap.the indictment also alleges that members of the enterprise committed fourteen different racketeering acts,which included several acts of bribery,obstruction of justice,and extortion.
the evidence 
kevin weeks,who identified himself as bulger man,was the government star witness and provided substantial testimony regarding the existence of the enterprise.for example,weeks testified that a special fund was created from some of the proceeds of bulger and flemmi criminal activities,and that connolly received cash payments from that fund in exchange for a regular flow of information about law enforcement activities that might affect the group.additionally,weeks testified that connolly was the enterprise contact in the fbi,and that bulger had given connolly money in return for protecting the enterprise.according to weeks,bulger told him that connolly was one of ours.john martorano,a member of the winter hill gang,corroborated weeks testimony regarding connolly repeated receipt of gratuities in exchange for information.salemme likewise testified that he and flemmi had twice set aside from the proceeds of their numbers racket to pay connolly for the information he provided.
in return for these payments,connolly provided a wealth of sensitive information,often with dire consequences.for example,martorano testified that connolly told bulger that an informant named richard castucci had provided the fbi with information regarding the whereabouts of two fugitive winter hill members.bulger told martorano of the leak,and martorano in turn murdered castucci in order to silence him.martorano also testified that connolly had told bulger and others that another informant,brian halloran,had implicated martorano in the murder of a recalcitrant associate,roger wheeler.weeks testified that bulger,upon learning from connolly of halloran betrayal,ambushed halloran as he got into a car outside a boston restaurant,and fatally shot both halloran and the driver,michael donahue.
martorano also testified that connolly told bulger and flemmi that the fbi agents who had been working with halloran were going to put pressure on another associate,john callahan,to come clean about the wheeler murder.according to martorano,connolly told bulger and flemmi that they were all going to go to jail for the rest of our life if something does happen to john callahan.worried about the possibility of a breach,bulger and flemmi convinced martorano that callahan had to be silenced.in an effort to deflect any attention away from the ongoing boston investigation,martorano lured callahan to florida where,with another associate,he murdered callahan.
weeks also testified that he and bulger had extorted a person named stephen rakes into selling them a south boston liquor store.after weeks had forcibly acquired ownership of the store,rakes wife went to her uncle,joseph lundbohm,who was a detective in the boston police department.lundbohm testified that he,in turn,went to connolly with the problem,and connolly stated that nothing could be done unless rakes agreed to wear a recording device.lundbohm,out of fear for the safety of his niece and her husband,told connolly that wearing a wire would be unacceptable.connolly did not take any action to stop the extortionate takeover,nor did he report the incident to his superiors.
as for connolly efforts to derail the united states salemme prosecution,weeks testified that on december,connolly came to the south boston liquor store that weeks and bulger had extorted from the rakes,looking for bulger.only weeks was on the premises,however,and connolly led him to the inside of the refrigerator at the back of the store where electronic surveillance would be difficult.there,connolly told weeks that he had just learned that federal indictments were pending against bulger and flemmi and that agents planned to make arrests over the holidays.even though connolly no longer worked at the fbi,he told weeks that he was certain of this information because it had come from assistant special agent in charge dennis.connolly also indicated that only four people in the fbi knew about the pending indictment.connolly instructed weeks to pass along the information to bulger and flemmi immediately.weeks did so.flemmi,in turn,passed along the information to salemme.bulger and salemme both skipped town and managed to avoid arrest.salemme was ultimately arrested eight months later.bulger whereabouts remain unknown.
weeks also testified that he and connolly had worked together to compose a letter that they submitted anonymously to judge mark wolf,the united states district judge presiding over the united states salemme case.the letter,printed on boston police department letterhead,claimed to be from three disgruntled boston police officers,and stated that the wiretaps the government was planning to use in its prosecution had been illegally obtained.judge wolf testified that the letter had caused him to order the parties to submit briefs,to hold a number of pretrial hearings,and to hear testimony on the contents of the letter.weeks testified that connolly eventually told him the identities of the confidential informants who had worn the concealed recorder,and weeks passed along this information to flemmi and salemme in jail.
finally,weeks testified that connolly feared that flemmi would divulge connolly involvement in the enterprise and name him as the person who had leaked the news of the indictments.connolly,through weeks,convinced flemmi to testify that connolly former fbi supervisor,john morris,had tipped him off about the indictments.however,morris had been transferred out of boston in,long before the indictment issued.according to weeks,connolly advised weeks that flemmi should testify that morris had learned of the impending indictments through what is known as a pros memo,prosecution memo that morris had seen while in washington.flemmi ultimately testified to that effect during hearings before judge wolf.
the legal requirements for an enterprise 
as the supreme court indicated in turkette,the government is required to prove both the existence of an enterprise and a pattern of racketeering activity.
the enterprise is an entity,for present purposes a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a course of conduct.the pattern of racketeering activity is,on the other hand,a series of criminal acts as defined by the statute.the former is proved by evidence of an ongoing organization,formal or informal,and by evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.the latter is proved by evidence of the requisite number of acts of racketeering committed by the participants in the enterprise.while the proof used to establish these separate elements may in particular cases coalesce,proof of one does not necessarily establish the other.the enterprise is not the pattern of racketeering activity it is an entity separate and apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.the existence of an enterprise at all times remains a separate element which must be proved by the government.
turkette,at.citation omitted.as this passage makes clear,an enterprise is not merely a related assortment of criminal activities.rather,there must be some goal a purpose of engaging in a course of conduct beyond the isolated benefit that can redound from the commission of each criminal act,and there must be an ongoing organization with associates function ing as a continuous unit.id.the organization need not be formal or have an ascertainable structure.united states patrick,cir.to the contrary,it need only be a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a criminal course of conduct.united states owens,cir quoting united states doherty,cir modification omitted.
connolly arguments 
continuity 
connolly argues that the evidence failed to demonstrate that the members of the alleged enterprise had functioned as an ongoing organization original emphasis.in pressing this claim,he focuses on the fourteen racketeering acts alleged in the indictment these fourteen acts were submitted to the jury for a determination of proven beyond a reasonable doubt or not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.of the fourteen,the jury found nine of them not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.of the racketeering acts found by the jury to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,one was an act of bribery in or,and the other were four acts of obstruction of justice in the mid to in connection with the united states salemme prosecution.
connolly cites these findings to argue that the government had failed to prove continuity in the enterprise,that the enterprise had functioned as an ongoing organization over the period of time alleged,from september to september.since the jury found that all but one of the alleged racketeering acts dating from the and had not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt,connolly argues that there was an insufficient basis for the jury to conclude that connolly was part of an ongoing criminal enterprise.see,united states pelullo,cir noting that rico enterprises should be distinguished from individuals who associate for the commission of sporadic harm.
we reject this argument for two reasons.first,the government introduced significant evidence of the existence of the enterprise apart from the specified racketeering acts.for example,weeks,martorano,and salemme testified about several payments made to connolly over the period in question that do not appear in the alleged racketeering acts.they also testified that these payments were made to guarantee the flow of confidential law enforcement information from connolly to members of the enterprise.this testimony provided evidence of an ongoing criminal relationship between connolly and members of the enterprise,and supported the jury ultimate finding regarding connolly participation in an ongoing.
second,as the government correctly argues,simply because the jury found a specified racketeering act as unproven beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean that the jury found the evidence relating to that act unpersuasive,in combination with other evidence in the case,on the existence of an enterprise.rather,it may only mean that the government did not prove a requisite element of the underlying crime alleged as a racketeering act.for example,the district court instructed the jury that in order to prove act connolly had accepted a government had to demonstrate that connolly had demanded,sought,or received a thing of value as a quid pro quo,or in return for a promise,implicit or stated,to do or omit to do a particular act in violation of his lawful duty.in returning a finding of unproven,the jury could have concluded that the evidence underlying act,while failing to demonstrate this requisite quid pro quo,nevertheless demonstrated a corrupt gratuity evidencing the existence of an illegal enterprise.
likewise,racketeering act,as described on the verdict sheet,alleged that connolly had committed obstruction of justice by alerting bulger that richard castucci was an informant.the district court instructed the jury that in order to prove obstruction of justice,the government had to demonstrate that connolly had knowingly endeavored to obstruct or impede a pending judicial proceeding.the court also instructed the jury that a judicial proceeding is pending once a grand jury,for example,begins its investigation or when an indictment has been returned.the jury might have concluded,however,that connolly leaked information regarding castucci for the purpose of frustrating an fbi investigation,and not to obstruct the grand jury proceedings.
hence,the fact that nine of the fourteen enumerated racketeering acts were found unproven does not compel a finding of no continuity in the enterprise.the evidence relating to those acts remained available to the jury in its evaluation of the enterprise element of the rico charge.united states vastola,cir.holding that findings of not guilty on three of four alleged predicate racketeering acts do not mandate judgment of acquittal on rico count,vacated on other grounds,d.that being so,the inquiry on appeal is whether the jury,in light of the totality of the evidence,was presented with sufficient evidence of continuity to support a conviction.see united states powell,d.given the testimony of weeks,martorano,and others recounting a regular course of criminal conduct over two decades,we have no difficulty in concluding that the government satisfied its burden on this point.
organization 
connolly next argues that the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence demonstrating that the members of the alleged enterprise had functioned as a continuing unit original emphasis.rather,as connolly characterizes it,the evidence demonstrated,at most,the sporadic occurrence of criminal racketeering activity by a group that had no name,no regular business or activities,no cohesion over time,no sense of membership or ongoing association,no sharing of resources or revenues,and no systemic linkage or coordination of activities.hence,according to connolly,there were no indicia of an organization and,therefore,no enterprise.
we disagree with connolly appraisal of the evidence,as well as his reading of the term enterprise.the evidence showed that connolly,bulger,flemmi,salemme,and others worked together in an enterprise over a period of almost two decades,joining forces to protect themselves from prosecution and to further other criminal alleged in the indictment,and others not specifically alleged.there was cohesion in the group over time the membership shared resources and revenues there was,in fact,a sense of membership.
as for the meaning of enterprise,there is no requirement under rico that an enterprise have an ascertainable structure.patrick,at.indeed,as the supreme court noted in turkette,t here is no restriction upon the associations embraced by the statute definition,turkette,at,and congress has instructed us to construe rico liberally to effectuate its remedial purposes.united states london,cir quoting,a,stat,reprinted in note following.hence an enterprise need only be a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a criminal course of conduct.owens,at see also boylan,at what counts is whether it can be said,on the totality of the evidence,that all of the alleged coconspirators directed their efforts towards the accomplishment of a common goal internal quotation marks omitted.
construing the term enterprise broadly,as we must,we have no difficulty in concluding that the alleged in the indictment was sufficiently organized to support a rico conviction,and that the government had adequately proved the existence of that enterprise to sustain a conviction.indeed,there was a discernable structure to the enterprise,with members playing designated roles in keeping the enterprise functioning as a viable unit.for example,martorano could be considered the head of the enterprise enforcement division,executing individuals who could prove to be a liability.connolly role was that of information officer,an intelligence conduit from law enforcement.weeks,as bulger man,managed special funds and functioned as an intermediary between bulger and others.
connolly insists,however,that bulger,flemmi,and others were actually members of the winter hill gang,and that this somehow forecloses the possibility of membership in another enterprise.we fail to follow this logic.as the indictment makes clear,the alleged enterprise in this perhaps overlapping in membership and some criminal activities with the winter hill gang and even la cosa a separate entity,distinguishable from both of these other criminal organizations.membership in the winter hill gang does not,ipso facto,preclude membership in another criminal enterprise.while the evidence demonstrated that bulger,flemmi,and others were associates of the winter hill gang,it also demonstrated that they were members of a separate enterprise dedicated to their own protection and the advancement of their own criminal activities.moreover,evidence was presented suggesting that the enterprise was distinct if not totally separate from the winter hill gang.for example,the jury heard testimony that part of the money that the enterprise members extorted or otherwise illegally procured was used to pay bribes necessary to ensure the enterprise survival.moreover,bulger told weeks that connolly,who was not a member of the winter hill gang,was nevertheless one of ours.the jury could therefore have readily inferred the existence of a continuing unit which included connolly and was distinct from the winter hill gang.
pattern of racketeering activity 
the predicate acts 
racketeering acts and occurred in late or early and concerned connolly to bulger,flemmi,and salemme regarding their indictment.racketeering act occurred in march and concerned the fraudulent,anonymous letter that connolly sent to judge wolf purporting to be from three police officers.racketeering act occurred in and concerns the false testimony that flemmi gave after being coached and directed by connolly 
the legal requirements for a pattern 
while the rico statute does not define in absolute terms what constitutes a pattern of racketeering activity,it does set a minimum requirement proof of a pattern of racketeering activity requires proof of at least two acts of racketeering activity within a period.the supreme court,interpreting rico,has stated that while two acts are necessary,they may not be sufficient.sedima,imrex,d.it is not the number of predicates that determines whether they constitute a pattern of racketeering activity rather,it is the relationship that they bear to each other or to some external organizing principle,at.emphasis added.the two factors most pertinent to this determination,according to the court,are relatedness and continuity.see id.at.it is this factor of continuity plus relationship which combines to produce a pattern.original emphasis citation omitted.
continuity,according to the supreme court,can refer either to a closed period of repeated conduct,or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.id.at.we have previously indicated that it is difficult to formulate in the abstract any general test for the continuity required for a pattern.apparel art int l jacobson,cir quoting,at.see also efron embassy suites,cir we have more than once remarked upon the difficulty of articulating concrete guidelines for this continuity plus relationship standard for identifying a pattern.in the supreme court noted that congress chose not to define pattern of racketeering activity with any degree of specificity in the rico statute.hence,the court instructed lower courts to adopt a flexible approach to rico claims,employing a commonsense,everyday understanding of rico language and congress gloss on it.at.lower courts,in turn,have repeatedly looked to one guidepost contained in a party alleging a rico violation may demonstrate continuity over a closed period by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time,or by evidence that the acts include a specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future.id.at.because rico was intended by congress to apply only to enduring criminal conduct,p redicate acts extending over a few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal conduct do not satisfy this requirement.efron,at apparel art,at.
connolly argument 
connolly concedes that the four racketeering acts at issue are sufficiently related for rico purposes.each act served to protect members of the enterprise.connolly insists,however,that the four racketeering acts simply constituted a single criminal episode,that they did not present the threat of ongoing conduct,and that they therefore were not a pattern of racketeering activity.we disagree.
while we have previously indicated that w e can be reasonably certain that the pattern requirement does not encompass a single criminal episode,a single crime in the ordinary,nontechnical sense of that word,apparel art,at original emphasis,we have also indicated that a single criminal episode is something narrow in scope and purpose,for example,a single interstate bank robbery.as we explained in apparel art,a bank robbery could include several different crimes in the technical sense of the word such as gun possession,threatening a teller,stealing a getaway car,and eventually lying about one they nevertheless do not add up to a pattern of racketeering activity.see id.the instant case,however,is altogether different.here,there were at least three different episodes the disclosing of the indictment,the fabricated letter,and the perjured planned and executed independently of the others over a period of years,and each the result of detailed planning and scheming by members of a criminal enterprise seeking to impede the criminal prosecutions of their cohorts.this is precisely the kind of activity that rico was intended to forestall.see,at.
as for the threat of future criminal conduct,the racketeering acts at issue were part of an ongoing criminal enterprise undertaken to facilitate future criminal acts by other members of that enterprise.the enterprise sought to insure that its members would never be brought to justice,and indeed,one of them is still at large.as the government describes it,the enterprise engaged in a pattern of criminal activity that threatened ongoing criminal conduct of the sort that rico was designed to prevent in short,there was ample evidence supporting the jury conclusion that the government had satisfied the pattern of racketeering activity element of the crime.
in sentencing connolly,the district court relied upon the report psr prepared by the probation office.the psr calculated the appropriate sentence after navigating through a series of as follows with the subject matter underlined for the reader convenience 
under,the base offense level for a rico conviction is the greater of either i,or ii the offense applicable to the underlying racketeering activity,obstruction of justice.
as for the underlying racketeering activity,under,the base offense level for obstruction of justice is.subsection c,however,indicates that if the obstruction of justice interfered with the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense,the court should look to accessory after the fact with respect to the criminal offense obstructed,provided that the corresponding offense level is greater than.
section provides that the base offense level for being an accessory after the fact is levels lower than the offense level for the underlying offense,but in no event less than,or more than.
the psr identified murder as the underlying offense because connolly racketeering activities concerned the obstruction of the prosecution of united states salemme,and the most serious of the underlying offenses charged in the salemme indictment was murder.
under,the base offense level for murder is.
under,however,the maximum base offense level for accessory after the fact is.the probation office therefore recommended a base offense level of.the psr determined that no adjustment was necessary for the multiple counts,or for any other reason,and that connolly should be placed in criminal history category i.the corresponding sentencing range for category i,when combined with an offense level of,is to months.
at sentencing,connolly challenged the calculation of the offense level,arguing that he was not subjectively aware of the more serious charges alleged in the salemme indictment,and that murder should therefore not be considered the underlying offense under.the district court properly overruled connolly objection.see united states mcqueen,cir neither c nor requires such knowledge as a prerequisite to application of the offense level for the underlying offense.it then adopted the factual findings and the guidelines calculation contained in the psr,and sentenced connolly to the maximum of the applicable range,months.
on appeal,connolly abandons his subjective knowledge argument and presses a new argument that the district court made a basic mistake in sentencing when it referenced the murder guideline without conducting any as to what exactly constitutes the underlying offense.since connolly raises this objection for the first time on appeal,we review for plain error only.united states henderson,cir see united states grant,cir noting that as a general rule,appellant may not switch horses and raise new legal arguments not made the basis for objections in the district court.accordingly,connolly bears the burden of proving an error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights.united states,cir.assuming he can meet this high hurdle,connolly must then demonstrate that the error seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states matos,cir.
the plain language of the applicable sections of the guidelines does not support connolly argument.the obstruction of justice guideline,c,provides that 
if the offense involved obstructing the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense,apply accessory after the fact in respect to that criminal offense,if the resulting offense level is greater than that determined above.
emphasis added.we fail to see how this language obliges an evidentiary inquiry into the substance of that criminal offense.moreover,the commentary to section governing the interpretation of indicates that,
a reference may direct that,if the conduct involved another offense,the offense guideline for such other offense is to be applied where there is more than one such offense,the most serious such offense is to be used.
comment.the psr followed these directives to the letter.the jury found that connolly had obstructed the prosecution in united states salemme at various times from late to,including after the grand jury had returned a superceding indictment charging flemmi,bulger,salemme,and others with a number of crimes,including murder.the probation office reasonably looked to the most serious offense contained in the superseding indictment,and,as explained above,calculated the base offense level at.
this is not to say that a factual inquiry into the underlying offense would never be appropriate.for example,if a defendant were convicted of obstruction of justice for lying in a grand jury proceeding,a sentencing court would be justified in probing deeper into the nature of the underlying offense.otherwise,the perjurer,through his false testimony,could cause an indictment for a minor instead of a serious crime to issue,and then gain the benefit of his perjury if the court were to rely solely on the indictment in determining the underlying offense.the converse,of course,is also overzealous prosecutor could seek to enhance the perjurer sentence by spuriously convincing a grand jury to increase the counts in an indictment.hence,the fourth circuit has held that,in such a situation,a factual inquiry into what constitutes the underlying offense would not be inappropriate.see united states dickerson,cir.the ninth circuit,citing dickerson,indicated in united states arias,cir,that a factual inquiry into the underlying offense would be appropriate only if there were a genuine dispute as to its substance.id.at emphasis added.
connolly relies unpersuasively on dickerson and arias in pressing his claim.unlike dickerson,connolly did not perjure himself before a grand jury,and there was therefore no risk of over or of the indictment.and unlike arias,there is no genuine dispute in this case as to the underlying offense.when connolly wrote the fraudulent letter to judge wolf,and when he instructed flemmi on how to lie on the witness stand,the salemme prosecution included charges of murder.moreover,weeks testified during the trial that connolly goal was to get the entire case against flemmi tossed out,and substantial evidence adduced at trial supports that conclusion.finally,even assuming that an inquiry into the underlying offense would be appropriate in this case,and assuming it was error for the district court not to undertake that inquiry sua sponte,any such error would be far from plain,clear,in the sense that it was obvious.united states geronimo,cir internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,the fact that connolly,who was ably represented by counsel below,only belatedly turns to this argument,and cites only two cases from other jurisdictions,belies any claim that the error was truly obvious.
since connolly has failed to demonstrate that the district court committed any or it determined that murder was the underlying offense for purposes of c and,we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.
on the first day of trial,when the jury first entered into the courtroom,the district court judge noticed that one of the jurors was carrying a notebook.without prompting from counsel,the judge informed the jury as follows
