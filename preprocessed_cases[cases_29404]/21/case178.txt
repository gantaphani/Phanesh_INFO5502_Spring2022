defendants juan laureano pérez juan,jeffrey cummings,and christopher laureano pérez christopher collectively,defendants were convicted of various narcotics possession,firearm,and conspiracy charges arising out of their participation in an illicit drug organization.all three appeal their convictions,alleging a host of errors during the pretrial and trial phases of the proceedings cummings and christopher also challenge their sentences.for the reasons explained below,we affirm all of the convictions,as well as cummings sentence.however,we vacate christopher sentence and remand for.
background 
we begin with a general overview of the facts and prior proceedings,reserving additional factual and procedural details for the relevant discussions below.for present purposes,it is enough to know that defendants were members of a large drug organization operating in the residencial villas de monterrey public housing project in bayamón,puerto rico the housing project which sold a wide array of narcotics,including heroin,cocaine base crack cocaine,powder cocaine,and marijuana.additionally,defendants had different roles in the conspiracy.christopher was the leader of the organization.known as both negro and the boss,he owned the majority of the drugs sold in the housing project,and,wanting the organization pushers and runners to be armed,he also supplied the organization with weapons.juan,meanwhile,was christopher brother and known as mcgyver.juan role was an enforcer.finally,cummings,or pitillo,was an enforcer as well,though he would also deliver drugs on occasion.both juan and cummings were known to carry caliber pistols.
cummings was initially indicted on may,and was charged with possession with intent to distribute heroin,cocaine base crack cocaine,and cocaine,each in violation of a,b c,counts one through three,respectively possession with intent to distribute marijuana,in violation of u.a,b d,count four illegal possession of a machinegun,in violation of o,a count five and possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c a i,b ii count six.six months later,on november,a superseding indictment was returned.this superseding indictment retained the initial six charges from the may indictment but also added two more conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances in a protected location,in violation of a,count seven,and conspiracy to possess firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking conspiracy,in violation of c,o count nine.it also brought charges against christopher,juan,and other christopher and juan were both charged with the two conspiracy counts counts seven and nine,while juan was also charged with possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug conspiracy,in violation of c a i,b ii count eight.
trial began on june,and after eight days of trial,defendants were convicted on all counts.juan and christopher were subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment,while cummings was sentenced to months.these timely appeals followed.
ii.pre trial issues 
only cummings raises issues,and he does so both through his attorney and through a supplemental pro se filing.we address each in turn.
a.the disqualification of cummings counsel 
cummings first argues that the district court violated his constitutional right to counsel both when it ordered the disqualification of his attorney,jorge armenteros chervoni armenteros,due to a conflict of interest and when it later refused to armenteros despite cummings attempt to waive the conflict.we review decisions to disqualify an attorney for conflict of interest for abuse of discretion.united states lanoue,cir.here,we find no such abuse.
relevant facts 
on june,the district court granted cummings motion to be represented by armenteros instead of a attorney from the office of the federal defender.a month later,the government became concerned over the source of armenteros attorney fees,so it filed a motion asking the court to determine the source of armenteros attorney fees whether armenteros was retained or paid by an individual other than cummings whether there was a conflict of interest and if there was a conflict,whether cummings was waiving the conflict and whether the district court would accept the waiver.at a status conference on july,the district court set a briefing schedule and hearing date for the issue.
though the government never filed its formal motion,the district court held the hearing on august.at the hearing,armenteros objected,arguing that the hearing was premature because i do know what is the issue or what is the intent.the district court disagreed,stating that the parties were there to figure out the issue.the government then informed the court that it had met with armenteros and that the government had showed him recordings of his defendant,which proved that attorney armenteros was retained by another person who is not the defendant in this case.the government added that armenteros did not deny that he was being paid by another person.in response to this proffer,the district court asked armenteros about the source of his fees,but armenteros refused to answer.instead,armenteros responded 
w ith all due respect we going to claim a due process right now,your honor,because i do think that the hearing can come to find out what was going on.i think the prosecutor must make a claim,and we must respond to it i telling you that i am not clear what is the claim to which i have to respond 
the district court once again explained that the claim was that cummings was not paying his own attorney fees but rather that they were coming from a third party.to this,armenteros replied that that not the information that i have been given.he went on to explain that he had received a initial payment and that his relationship with cummings date d back to another case in which he defended cummings and was successful in having the case dismissed.armenteros conceded that he had heard one of the recordings involving cummings but nevertheless maintained that the only person that i talked to is cummings who told me,go and look for some money,okay,in order to get my fees.
at this point,the government interjected,explaining that it was trying to protect the right of the defendant because it would create a clear conflict of interest if the person paying armenteros fees were someone who the government might require cummings to testify against should he enter a plea.the district court agreed,noting to armenteros that 
i f it true that there is a possibility that a third party is paying for your client defense,and your client is in a situation whereby he facing a year minimum,the government is not going to offer any plea bargaining to him,it is entirely possible that the purpose,that the purpose of somebody else paying for the defense is to keep him shut.
armenteros once again objected,arguing that he underst oo d that those funds came from the defendant and that the government position presupposes that that third person told me to go defend this person.armenteros argued that that has never been the case and i n fact,there are a million phone calls of cummings s wife asking me to go and visit him once after he arrested.armenteros emphasized that he could recognize a conflict of interest and was positive that no conflict existed.
the court then proceeded to hear the two telephone recordings of cummings with counsel for both the government and cummings present.in the first,cummings spoke to ana saurí,cummings girlfriend mother,and told her that his lawyer had come to visit him and that they paid him the money.saurí added that she spoke with armenteros and asked him to get someone she called negrito out of jail,to which armenteros responded,do mention that name.cummings also informed saurí that armenteros had told him that if they work with me on the money and stuff what i ask them in order to help you,then i will come on monday.later on in the call,christopher,who had not yet been indicted,took the phone from saurí and spoke with cummings.cummings thanked christopher a million for the attorney thing and added that armenteros had told him that t hey gave armenteros and that cummings could give armenteros the other when you get out.christopher also stated that he was going to see if he could send something with the attorney,but it was possible.
the second recording involved cummings,saurí,her daughter ashley,and christopher.in this call,cummings asked christopher,what did the lawyerinski say to you and christopher responded that h e has showed up.i have been calling him and he has showed up h e came to talk about money,but he has returned.cummings once again thanked christopher for the money,to which christopher responded that t his is not about the money,this is about being united.at the end of the call,cummings asked christopher to put pressure on armenteros because he does not come here to visit me,and christopher responded that he will try to call and contact him,but he does want to talk to me but,everything that he tells me i will tell you.
once the recordings were finished,the district court asked armenteros if cummings was willing to answer some questions from the court,but armenteros declined the invitation because it was a very dubious situation.the court emphasized that 
in order for me to make a decision,a balanced decision,i have to ask him some questions to figure out,you know,first of all,who is the person that is paying the fees,what is the relationship with him,and advise him of the potential conflicts,et cetera.and he has to make a decision,and then i have to make my own decision.but we have to have an exchange obviously.
still,armenteros declined.he informed the court that cummings was more than willing to listen to whatever the court has to say.however,he not in a position at this point to give any statement to the court the government objected to this refusal,arguing t hat exactly the conflict of interest.the attorney is there,and i do know if the client wants to talk to the court or if the attorney is not letting the client.
the district court agreed 
if it clear to me that a third party is paying for the fees,then i have an obligation to have some sort of dialogue,if you will,that has to be through questions and answers with the defendant,and advise him,get information from him about this situation,and advise him of the potential risks and conflicts.but i am in a situation whereby the defendant does want to deal with that issue with me.so i getting no information from him it is quite clear,that christopher is paying for the fees,and that christopher has control over a bunch of things that pertain to the defense obviously.
all i saying is that it quite clear,quite clear from those tapes that christopher,who is the purported leader,has advanced the funds,retained you to deal with cummings,to represent cummings,and that cummings is eternally grateful to christopher for having done that.not only that,christopher and cummings are going to decide basically what the strategy going to be together,and the strategy is going to be such that christopher will not be prejudiced 
you have been retained and paid by a third party i t goes beyond that,because one thing is the act of a charity of a third party to pay a defense of somebody dear to him.another thing is a situation whereby the defense is being paid by a third party but at the same time there is intervention of that third party and the defendant as to how they going to deal with the issue.basically,not only to defend cummings,but also to make certain that christopher does get involved.
seeing how the court was leaning,armenteros asked the district court to delay making a ruling,but the court refused,stating that i t made.the district court proceeded to explain its ruling as follows 
t he reasons are the ones that i stated no cooperation on defendant side obvious conflict of interest failure on the defendant side,who has a burden,too,to put me in a position to make a balancing,a balancing that is going to be very difficult to make even if he tells me something,because of the content of the tapes.
therefore,i am once again stating that there is a potential material,huge conflict of interest here that will not allow you to be his attorney in this case.
three months later,on november,cummings filed a motion requesting that armenteros be as his attorney.in the motion,cummings stated that 
armenteros has been my attorney since february,i feel that he has allways sic and will continue to have my complete confidence as my attorney.
i do not believe that armenteros has a conflict of interest.but in any case if it were true,i am willing to waive said conflict.
the motion was denied on january.
the district court did not abuse its discretion 
the sixth amendment guarantees the right of an individual accused in a criminal prosecution to have the assistance of counsel for his defence,const.amend.vi,which necessarily includes the right to have an attorney of one own choosing.lanoue,at.this right,however,is not absolute.id.to the contrary,because the essential aim of the sixth amendment is to guarantee an effective advocate for each criminal defendant,wheat united states,d,o ne important limitation on th is right is the trial court interest in ensuring that criminal trials are conducted within ethical and professional standards.in re grand jury proceedings,cir.
to that end,i f there is a realistic potential for conflict of interest,a district court concern may override a defendant sixth amendment right freely to choose his lawyer.id.and while a defendant can often waive the conflict,this,too,is not absolute.see,wheat,at lanoue,at.a district court may decline to accept a defendant waiver not only in those rare cases where an actual conflict may be demonstrated before trial,but also in the more common cases where a potential for conflict exists which may or may not burgeon into an actual conflict as the trial progresses.in re grand jury proceedings,at alteration in original emphasis omitted quoting wheat,at internal quotation marks omitted.still,there must be a showing of a serious potential for conflict to overcome the presumption in favor of a defendant selection of counsel.id.at.
one such serious potential for conflict occurs when a criminal defendant is represented by a lawyer hired and paid by a third party,particularly when the third party is the operator of the alleged criminal enterprise.wood georgia,d see also united states urutyan,cir.the conflict arises because a lawyer could be inclined to prevent his client from obtaining leniency by preventing the client from offering testimony against his former employer or from taking other actions contrary to the employer interest.wood,at.
that was the precise situation facing the district court.the government alerted the district court that it was concerned armenteros was being paid by christopher the leader of the drug organization connected to cummings arrest and wanted the court to inquire further.in response,the district court held a hearing in which it heard two recordings unequivocally showing that armenteros was being paid by somebody other than cummings,most likely christopher,and in which it learned that any plea agreement offered by the government would necessarily entail cooperation against others,including christopher given this evidence,the potential for a conflict of interest was obvious.see lanoue,at the district court in this case did not make the decision to disqualify summarily.it held a hearing and allowed each side to present its arguments for and against disqualification.see also urutyan,at finding no abuse of discretion in district court disqualification of attorney due to a conflict of interest where district court heard a telephone recording between defendant and discussing how a member of the alleged conspiracy could provide defendant with an attorney.add to this the fact that armenteros was uncooperative throughout the hearing and prohibited cummings from partaking in a colloquy with the court,and the district court conclusion that there was a likelihood of a conflict of interest was only further supported united states diozzi,cir finding no conflict of interest where the attorneys were cooperative.accordingly,we find no abuse of discretion in the district court decision to disqualify armenteros.
b.the speedy trial act 
cummings next argues that due to a violation of the speedy trial act,the district court should have dismissed cummings initial indictment with prejudice,thus barring the inclusion of those charges in the superseding indictment.we disagree with cummings that the speedy trial act was violated.
standard of review 
we review the district court speedy trial act determination de novo.united states barnes,cir barnes i.in doing so,we start from scratch in the computation of excludable and nonexcludable time under the act by first do ing the basic mathematics and determin ing the aggregate time elapsed awaiting trial,and then ascertain ing how many days should be excluded from the total time.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.however,we do not go hunting for nonexcludable time exclusions of time not specifically challenged in the district court are waived on appeal.united states gates,cir.
the speedy trial act was not violated 
the speedy trial act commands that a defendant be tried within days of the latest of either the filing of an indictment or information,or the first appearance before a judge or magistrate.barnes i,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.certain periods of time,however,are excluded from this calculation.these include 
a ny period of delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant,including but not limited to 
f delay resulting from any pretrial motion,from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on,or other prompt disposition of,such motion 
j delay reasonably attributable to any period,not to exceed thirty days,during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court.
a any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted by any judge on his own motion or at the request of the defendant or his counsel or at the request of the attorney for the government,if the judge granted such continuance on the basis of his findings that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
id.alterations in original quoting h.
here,the parties agree that we begin counting on june,the date of cummings and that we stop the clock on november,the date the superseding indictment adding cummings was filed.see united states barnes,cir barnes ii holding that the speedy trial act clock resets upon the return of a superseding indictment adding new defendants in order to synchronize the cases and avoid piecemeal prosecutions and duplicative proceedings.this is a total of days.we find the following days to be excludable under the act 
adding all of these days together,days were excludable.this leaves nonexcludable days,five less than the permitted seventy.accordingly,the act was not violated.
c.the sufficiency of the superseding indictment 
in his pro se brief,cummings argues that the superseding indictment was flawed in two key respects.first,he alleges that because the o charge count five failed to provide proper notice of what the government considered a machinegun and what statute made it illegal,his fifth amendment right to due process was violated.second,he claims that the superseding indictment reference to crack cocaine in counts two and seven was insufficient following the supreme court decision in depierre united states,d,which clarified the meaning of cocaine base.cummings never raised these challenges in the district court,and his failure to do so constitutes a forfeiture,which confines appellate review to plain error.united states troy,cir see also.b b stating that challenges to the sufficiency of an indictment must be raised prior to trial.plain error exists when an error occurred which was clear or obvious and both affected the defendant substantial rights and seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.troy,at.we need not go past the first step,however,because neither alleged error has any merit.
count five of the superseding indictment is not defective 
an indictment is legally sufficient if it first,contains the elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,and,second,enables him to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.united states berk,cir quoting united states cianci,cir.
here,count five of the superseding indictment alleges that 
o n or about may,in the district of puerto rico and within the jurisdiction of this court,jeffrey,the defendant herein,did knowingly and unlawfully possess,machineguns,to wit a glock pistol,model,caliber,serial number on the body pdw and another different serial number ete on the side a glock pistol,model,caliber,serial number,both firearms modified to shoot automatically more than one shot,without manual reloading,by a single function of the trigger.all in violation of title,section o and a.
this description contains all of the elements of section o which provides that it shall be unlawful for any person to transfer or possess a machinegun,and it quotes verbatim from b,which defines a machinegun as any weapon which shoots,is designed to shoot,or can be readily restored to shoot,automatically more than one shot,without manual reloading,by a single function of the trigger.it also describes the specific machineguns at issue.as such,cummings was fairly informed of what he had to defend against,and the indictment was therefore sufficient.see berk,at united states just,cir finding indictment for possession of a machinegun sufficient where it only cited to o and did not include language defining a machinegun.
that the superseding indictment only quotes the language of b without citing to the statute directly does not alter this conclusion it is the language describing the elements that puts a defendant on notice,not a simple citation to a statute.united states daniels,cir t he mere citation to the statute of which the defendant is charged with violating is insufficient to cure the failure of the indictment to charge each essential element of the offense because the citation alone does not insure that the grand jury considered and found each of these elements.moreover,while cummings was charged with violating o,this is merely a subsection of.a full reading of directs the reader to for the meaning of a machinegun,see a,b,and it is hornbook statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.sorenson sec y of treasury,d internal quotation marks omitted see also,united states ozuna cabrera,cir.
accordingly,we find no error with count five of the superseding indictment.
counts two and seven of the superseding indictment are not defective 
in counts two and seven of the superseding indictment,the government charged cummings with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base and other narcotics,respectively.in count two,the superseding indictment states that cummings did knowingly and intentionally possess with intent to distribute a measurable amount of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base crack count seven,meanwhile,states that conspirators,including cummings,did knowingly and intentionally combine,conspire and agree with each other to possess with the intent to distribute and eighty grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base crack according to cummings,the inclusion of crack renders the superseding indictment insufficient because depierre decriminalize d certain individual conduct which would have otherwise been aggravated violators.
cummings,however,badly misreads depierre.in depierre,the supreme court h e ld that the term cocaine base as used in b means not just crack cocaine,but cocaine in its chemically basic form.at.in other words,the supreme court expanded the meaning of cocaine base to include other forms of cocaine in addition to crack cocaine id.at.it in no way decriminalized crack cocaine as cummings seems to allege.
counts two and seven of the superseding indictment charge possession with the intent to distribute and conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine base.the parenthetical inclusion of crack simply specified which form of cocaine base was at issue.there is nothing improper about this practice 
iii.trial issues 
defendants also present a number of alleged errors they claim occurred during the trial itself.we address each in turn,noting that unless otherwise stated,the issue was raised in some form by all three defendants.
a.the admission of certain pieces of evidence 
defendants claim that various pieces of evidence the testimonies of marco díaz narváez díaz,carlos rivas serrano rivas or gordo,and officer luis vázquez torres officer vázquez,and the two phone calls between cummings and christopher were improperly admitted.as explained in more detail below,all of the evidence was admissible.
a.the contested testimony 
díaz was a member of the conspiracy who agreed to cooperate with the government.according to díaz,he was a seller in the organization and would also store guns for christopher.after discussing his involvement,díaz testified about three specific instances.the first two involved rounds with juan.during these rounds,cummings take juan to a specified location,find the person they were looking for,beat the person up,put the person in the trunk of cummings car,and then drive for a while before letting díaz out and continuing to drive onward with the victim in the trunk.díaz testified that he never knew in advance where they were going,who they were looking for,or why they were looking for that person.rather,he just followed juan instructions,which were being carried out on christopher behalf.díaz added that juan was armed both times and that christopher was the leader of the conspiracy.
the third incident occurred one night in the housing project.according to díaz,he had been on duty selling drugs late one night when he heard two shots.shortly thereafter,juan and christopher appeared and enlisted díaz help putting a young man with a gunshot wound in his leg into a car.díaz testified that he was later told that juan had shot the young man who was not from the housing project twice at christopher behest.
b.this testimony was properly admitted 
defendants contend that this testimony was irrelevant and thus should have been excluded.because they made this objection at trial,we review for abuse of discretion.united states richardson,cir.contrary to defendants assertion,however,the testimony was relevant.
we reject defendants suggestion that díaz testimony shows that the rounds were not part of the drug conspiracy.though díaz did testify about the rounds in response to questions from the prosecutor about actions aside from the drugs,a review of the transcript as a whole makes clear that the rounds were related to the drug organization.given this relationship,there is little question that the testimony was relevant.see.evidence is relevant if a it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence and b the fact is of consequence in determining the action.the testimony helped establish a connection between defendants juan,acting on christopher orders,used cummings car and between defendants and the drug conspiracy the rounds,being conducted by juan on christopher behalf,were in connection to the drug organization.it also helped to prove at least two allegations in the indictment that the roles of christopher and juan were leader and enforcer,respectively,and that the leaders of the organization would use force,violence,and intimidation in order to protect the conspiracy and maintain control.see united states rivera calderón,cir holding that evidence of murders was relevant to show the existence of a single,overarching drug conspiracy and to prove the defendant involvement in the conspiracy.
as a fallback position,defendants contend that even if the evidence was relevant,it should still have been excluded as unfairly prejudicial under rule of the federal rules of evidence.defendants never raised this objection below,and thus we review for plain error.id.at see also united states ciresi,cir.under any standard,however,this argument fails.evidence is only excluded under rule if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.united states varoudakis,cir quoting.and unfair prejudice is often reserved for evidence that invites the jury to render a verdict on an improper emotional basis or for evidence that is shocking or heinous and likely to inflame the jury.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.díaz testimony does none of these things,and thus its admission was not unfairly prejudicial.
a.the contested testimony 
like díaz,rivas was also a member of the conspiracy who chose to cooperate with the government.rivas testimony focused mostly on christopher.first,rivas described an incident where christopher had a problem because some people shot at his car with his kids in it while they were traveling near a bakery.according to rivas,in response to this attack,christopher and coquito and monchi two of the drug conspiracy triggermen went in search of the shooters.rivas testified that he knew all three were armed because h e was always armed every time that they would go out to solve a problem and they were going out to the shopping mall to look for clothing.they were going out to look for the enemy.
b.this testimony was properly admitted 
like with díaz testimony,defendants allege that rivas testimony is both irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.however,neither of these objections was raised below,so we review for plain error see ciresi,at.once again,we find no error.rivas testimony is relevant because it helps to establish that christopher was a leader of the organization he was targeted shortly after another leader was murdered and it is unlikely that a member of the organization would be targeted for assassination and that the drug organization resorted to violence to protect its territory.moreover,the fact that christopher and his men were armed provides proof of the conspiracy charged in count to possess firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.see.rivera calderón,at.and because the testimony was neither shocking,heinous,nor likely to inflame the jury,it need not have been excluded under rule.see varoudakis,at.
officer vázquez 
a.the contested 
during officer vázquez testimony,a video was played showing christopher and others attending the funeral of miguel ruiz sánchez miguel at the housing project.officer vázquez commented on the video,explaining that a ccording to his investigation,miguel ruiz sánchez was one of the leaders of the conspiracy and that the reason some of the individuals were seen in the video picking up shell casings from the basketball court at the housing project was because according to their investigation,the previous day they were having a wake for miguel ruiz sánchez inside the project.the officer then proceeded to identify one of the individuals in the video as antero rivero marrero rivero.
on,officer vázquez testified that according to his investigation,rivero was serving as an escort for christopher because christopher feared for his life,and was hot in the street.on examination,the government asked officer vázquez about rivero escort services.officer vázquez testified that rivero had a fictitious license to escort dignitaries and agreed with the statement that no license would permit possession of the two ak rifles that were seized from rivero because it is not legal to carry firearms to protect a drug trafficker.
b.this testimony was properly admitted 
defendants once again challenge the relevance and undue prejudice of this testimony.once again,our review is for plain error,and,once again,their challenge fails.see ciresi,at.both pieces of evidence the picking up of the shell casings and the questioning into rivero escort services are relevant.
regarding the shell casings,the evidence is relevant for two reasons.first,the testimony connects christopher with miguel,who was known to be a leader of the drug organization.by establishing that christopher was sufficiently connected to miguel to attend his funeral,the evidence supported the conclusion that the two were part of the same organization.second,the collection of the shell casings helps support the allegation that the organization used weapons thus providing evidence of the conspiracy charge and that the conspirators were familiar with the firearms.see.rivera calderón,at.once again,nothing about this testimony was unfairly prejudicial.see varoudakis,at.
as to the testimony regarding rivero,the majority of this testimony was relevant for much the same reason as the testimonies already discussed it helped establish christopher role as a leader in the organization since a conspirator would likely not need the level of protection that christopher needed.and though the district court could have in its discretion applied rule to exclude officer vázquez agreement that it was not legal for rivero to carry firearms to protect a drug trafficker,its failure to do so does not constitute plain error,especially given our great deference to a district court rulings.see id.in any event,this one comment was harmless given all of the other evidence presented.see united states landrón class,cir.
the recorded phone calls 
a.the contested portions of the calls 
as mentioned above while discussing the disqualification of cummings counsel,two conversations involving cummings were recorded while he was detained at the metropolitan detention center mdc,guaynabo.in both calls one on june,and one on july,cummings spoke with christopher,who had not yet been arrested.besides discussing the payments to cummings counsel,the two also discussed whether juan was looking for gordo recall,this is rivas alias.cummings informed christopher that juan was working in the kitchen at mdc,guaynabo and had been looking for rivas but was unable to find him.in addition,cummings and christopher spoke about the attack on christopher and his family outside the bakery,specifically focusing on the fact that other members of their organization had advance knowledge of the attack and that there would be retaliation against those who shifted loyalties.
b.the recordings were properly admitted 
juan objects to the admission of the two phone calls on hearsay grounds.because he failed to object when the statements were first admitted and at the close of evidence,we review for plain error see ciresi,at holding that to preserve a challenge to the admission of statements,a defendant must object on hearsay grounds when his or her coconspirator statement is provisionally admitted and must renew the objection at the close of evidence.we reject this challenge,as the calls were properly admitted as statements.
though hearsay evidence is generally inadmissible in criminal trials,rule d e of the federal rules of evidence provides that a statement made by a defendant coconspirator during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy may be introduced as the nonhearsay admission of a party opponent.id.quoting.d e.for a statement to qualify,the declarant and the defendant must be members of a conspiracy when the statement was made and the statement must have been made in furtherance of the conspiracy.id.
the calls here meet both requirements.as to the first,the government provided significant evidence that juan,cummings,and christopher were all members of the same drug organization and thus the same conspiracy and there is nothing in the record to suggest that any defendant affirmatively withdrew from the conspiracy.see united states piper,cir where a conspiracy contemplates a continuity of purpose and a continued performance of acts,it is presumed to exist until there has been an affirmative showing that it has terminated.internal quotation marks omitted.
as to the second requirement,the calls did in fact further the ends of the conspiracy.at the time of the calls,cummings and juan had been arrested but christopher had not,and the evidence showed that the conspiracy was still ongoing at the housing project.for example,officer vázquez testified that surveillance continued until november,months after the june and july telephone calls.moreover,when christopher was arrested,additional guns and drugs were seized,suggesting that the contraband seized in the earlier raids had been replenished.see united states elwell,cir finding a conspiracy to be ongoing and defendant to still be a part of it even after his arrest.
given that the organization was still operating,the calls can reasonably be interpreted as promoting the conspiracy.cummings and christopher discussed how certain members of the conspiracy such as rivas knew that christopher was going to be attacked and that christopher was contemplating retaliating against those who were disloyal.maintaining loyalty from others clearly promotes the conspiracy.see ciresi,at finding that statements served to placate and forestall any dissension were in furtherance of the conspiracy elwell,at.
the calls,therefore,properly qualify as statements and were thus properly admitted.
overview testimony 
next,defendants claim that officer vázquez and federal bureau of investigation fbi special agent david james provided improper overview testimony.overview testimony occurs,for example,when a government witness testifies about the results of a criminal investigation,usually including aspects of the investigation the witness did not participate in,before the government has presented supporting evidence.united states rosado pérez,cir.we have repeatedly condemned the use of such tactics,finding it inherently problematic for a number of reasons.united states casas,cir see also united states flores de jesús,cir.first,because it is possible that evidence promised by the overview witness never materializes,flores de jesús,at,the testimony raises the very real specter that the jury verdict could be influenced by statements of fact or credibility assessments not in evidence,casas,at.second,it is similarly possible that subsequent testimony will differ from the assumptions of the overview witness.id.at.
though our concerns with overview testimony are applicable regardless of the witness involved,our skepticism is enhanced when the witness is a law enforcement official because juries may place greater weight on evidence perceived to have the imprimatur of the government.id.at.as we explained in flores de jesús,overview testimony of a law enforcement official is not simply a repetition at best of other evidence.it is also,in effect,an endorsement of the veracity of the testimony that will follow.at.moreover,a law enforcement official is likely to express opinions as to defendants culpability based on the totality of information gathered in the course of their investigation,even though the official did not have personal knowledge.id.at alterations omitted internal quotation marks omitted.such testimony is inadmissible and effectively serves to usurp the role of the jury because the witness inference is based on the same circumstantial evidence presented to the jury.united states meises,cir.
with that background in place,we now turn to the contested testimony here.
officer vázquez 
defendants never objected that officer vázquez was providing overview testimony,and thus we review for plain error.rosado pérez,at.
a.the contested testimony 
officer vázquez testified during the first two days of trial.in explaining his involvement in the investigation,officer vázquez told the jury that he led the bayamón strike force which was tasked with,among other things,conducting video surveillance.this video surveillance,he explained,occurred over fifteen days.on twelve of those days,officer vázquez was either personally operating the camera or assisting a colleague in doing so on the other three days,officer vázquez was on the ground surveilling the housing project.
in addition to authenticating the clips from the surveillance,officer vázquez also described what the clips were portraying.he told the jury that the surveillance was directed toward the site that we had identified as the drug point and that the video clips represented all persons that appear ed engaged in a criminal activity at that point in time.for each video clip,he would point out all of the individuals present noting their role in the drug organization as well as the controlled substances,firearms,and other objects which could be seen.for example,in one clip,officer vázquez explained to the jury that they were viewing cummings holding a package with a number of baggies inside with a white content.the rest of the clips contained similar commentary.
b.this testimony was not overview testimony 
contrary to defendants contention,this was not a new variation of overview testimony derived by the government.in fact,it was not overview testimony at all.officer vázquez was present at each and every surveillance either behind the camera or in front of it and thus was simply testifying about his own observations based on his personal knowledge.and while he did note the apparent roles each defendant played in the organization,he never expressed an opinion as to their culpability.flores de jesús,at when a law enforcement witness expresses opinions as to defendants culpability based on the totality of information gathered in the course of their investigation,these conclusory statements often involve impressible lay opinion testimony alterations omitted internal citation and quotation marks omitted.appropriate testimony does not become improper overview testimony just because one law enforcement official was present throughout the entire investigation and is then called to walk the jury through the investigation from beginning to end.see united states valdivia,cir f ar from being a scripted overview of the government case by uninvolved agents,the testimony represented the fruits of police work.rosado pérez,at finding testimony to be proper where agent was lead investigator,participated in surveillance and controlled drug buys,and testified only on the basis of personal observations.
moreover,none of the problems generally associated with overview testimony are present here.because officer vázquez was providing a account of his observations,while simultaneously playing the video clips of those surveillances,there is no concern that the evidence being testified to would never materialize.nor is there a worry that officer vázquez would make assumptions disputed by later testimony.flores de jesús,at casas,at.
accordingly,the testimony was proper.
agent james 
unlike with officer vázquez,there was an objection to the district court decision to allow agent james to elaborate and clarify his testimony.accordingly,our review is for abuse of discretion.rosado pérez,at.
a.the contested testimony 
agent james was called as part of christopher in an attempt to discredit rivas,one of the government cooperating witnesses.rivas had testified during the government case that christopher was a leader of the organization,but in a interview with agent james,rivas had not named christopher when listing the organization leadership.accordingly,christopher attorney asked the agent to read a paragraph from his interview report which had memorialized the conversation.after reading the paragraph,agent james attempted to clarify the report.he explained over christopher objection that while the report reflected rivas initial interview,he of course corroborated this with other intelligence.he then proceeded to summarize this intelligence 
agent james rivas did not know the name of this individual,but did identify his nickname as negro.if i can provide some context to the court.
court sure.
agent james in these initial interviews,i had a binder that showed different pictures,and so i just show it and they would identify.so this is the number two of the ones whom i showed him whom carlos rivas identified.
so number two,he did not know the name of the individual,but identified his nickname as negro.negro is known to us as by law enforcement as christopher laureano pérez.negro is the other leader of the residential villas de monterrey.negro frequents residential villas de monterrey more than miguel.he visits villas de monterrey approximately three times a week or more.miguel only visits approximately two times a week.he gives orders to the drug point.negro is armed with a caliber pistol.he saw him firing it on new year eve.negro was shooting it into the air.
previously,some enemies of residential villas de monterrey tried to kill negro and his children in order to take over the residential villas de monterrey drug point.negro drives a black toyota carolla sic,and also rides a gray and black scooter.he has a house probably in naranjito or barranquitas.
b.this testimony was potentially improper but harmless 
unlike officer vázquez testimony,this testimony was potentially problematic for two reasons.first,agent james made clear that he was not testifying about his personal knowledge of negro but rather was summarizing everything the investigation had uncovered.second,the context he provided was well beyond the scope of the question asked.
whether this qualifies as improper overview testimony,however,is a determination we need not make because any error that may have occurred was harmless.agent james testified as part of christopher,well after the government had already rested.thus,most if not all of the evidence agent james referred to had already been introduced by other witnesses.at the very least,the government had provided evidence that christopher and negro were the same person and that there had been an attempt on christopher life.given the timing of this testimony and the fact that the same evidence had previously been properly introduced,we are confident that this testimony did not affect the verdict,and thus the error was harmless.see united states hall,cir distinguishing other cases involving improper overview testimony in part because the officer did not testify until near the end of the government casas,at explaining that the admission of improper testimony is harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.
judicial bias 
defendants next allege that numerous actions by the district court show that it was biased against them,and that this bias deprived them of a fair trial.when reviewing claims of judicial bias,we must evaluate the judge actions according to a standard of fairness and impartiality,recognizing that each case tends to be.logue dore,cir quoting united states polito,cir.that being said,it is important to consider isolated incidents in light of the entire transcript so as to guard against magnification on appeal of instances which were of little importance in their setting.united states candelaria silva,cir internal citation and quotation marks omitted.
here the allegations take three general forms endorsement of government witnesses through additional questions by the district court hostile statements made to juan by the district court and adverse judicial rulings.these sorts of claims will only be successful if the party alleging bias can show serious prejudice.logue,at.after thoroughly reviewing the record,we reject the contention that these actions either taken independently or together rise to the level of legally cognizable judicial bias by the district court.
the bolstering of witnesses 
defendants first argue that the district court continually questioned witnesses and interjected comments which improperly bolstered their testimony,thus lessening the government burden and evincing bias towards them.because no defendant objected to the district court practice of asking questions or to any of its specific comments,we review for plain error.united states fernández,cir.
relevant facts 
during trial,the district court asked witnesses a number of questions and made a variety of comments.these included the following 
during the testimony of cooperating witness díaz,the district court asked what are your obligations in relation to the cooperation agreement with the government.in response,díaz stated that his obligation was cooperation in telling the truth.he also testified that he had been offered safety and security out in the street in exchange for his cooperation.when juan objected to the government attempt to elaborate,the district court sustained the objection,stating that it is that he cooperates,he needs security.
during the testimony of cooperating witness rivas,the district court interjected when the government asked what would happen if rivas did not tell the truth.the court stated,do you understand that aside from that point,if you are caught lying,inventing,exaggerating,et cetera,you could face charges for perjury or for obstruction of justice,too rivas acknowledged that e verything would then be in the hands of the judge if he was caught lying,to which the district court responded on top of that,you will always be in my hands,you understand me finally,when rivas revealed that he and the government had agreed on a sentence recommendation of sixty months,the district court again interrupted to make clear that it did not necessarily have to follow the recommendation.
when the district court overruled an objection and allowed officer eric rivera figueroa officer rivera to testify about how a chip converts a pistol into an automatic weapon,it explained its ruling by stating that t his man has been a police officer dealing with firearms and drugs for years.he can tell us whether this is a chip or not.similarly,the district court explained that it was allowing rivera to show the jury how to use a magazine because h e in the police force,in the bayamón strike force,deals with these issues every day of his life.
when officer maría cruz identified an item seized during the search as a cleaning kit,the district court inquired what the kit was designed to clean.
when officer rivera described the items he recovered during the search as cylindrical plastic transparent bottles,containers,the district court tried to clarify their description,asking if they were l ittle bottles.it like little bottles,correct 
in response to officer abizer cotto adorno officer cotto identifying seized items as cocaine vials,the court interjected,clarifying that the officer did not actually know what was inside the vials.
b.the district court did not improperly endorse witnesses 
it is that a judge is not a mere umpire and accordingly has a perfect right albeit a right that should be exercised with care to participate actively in the trial proper.united states ofray campos,cir.this includes asking questions to elicit facts to facilitate a clear presentation of the issues.united states meléndez rivas,cir internal quotation marks omitted.still,a district court needs to be balanced it can not become an advocate or otherwise use its judicial powers to advantage or disadvantage a party unfairly.id.internal quotation marks omitted.so as long as the court preserves an attitude of impartiality and guards against giving the jury an impression that the court believes the defendant is guilty,it may question witnesses.united states rosario peralta,cir.
here,defendants point to the district court comments during the testimonies of díaz,rivas,officer rivera,officer cruz,and agent gonzález to support their claim of bias.however,defendants conveniently ignore the district court comments and questions to officer rivera and officer cotto and its question to agent gonzález regarding the legality of purchasing magazines which show a much more balanced approach to questioning.
taken together,these questions and comments show that the district court asked questions which were helpful and unhelpful to both sides.for example,it asked agent gonzález about the purpose of shortening firearms and whether it was common law enforcement procedure to use magazines questions unhelpful to defendants,but it also asked him whether those same magazines were legal to buy a question helpful to defendants.and while it questioned officer cruz as to the purpose of the recovered cleaning kit a question unhelpful to defendants,it also corrected officer cotto statement that he recovered cocaine vials by interjecting that the officer did not actually know what was inside a question helpful to defendants.we view these questions as a legitimate attempt to clarify testimony and focus the presentation of evidence,and not an indication of a district court using its powers to unfairly disadvantage defendants see meléndez rivas,at.
we also disagree with defendants that reminding the cooperating witnesses of their requirement to be truthful was bolstering the prosecution.if anything,these warning should help defendants,since if the witnesses had a motivation to lie which is the focus of the typical of a cooperating witness the district court comments could have scared the witnesses into telling the truth.the same can be said for the district court action of sustaining juan objection to the government attempt to follow up on díaz safety comment.
similarly,we fail to see how the district court was bolstering the prosecution by explaining its reasoning for finding officer rivera and agent gonzález qualified to answer the government questions.there is a difference between objectively stating the officer qualifications to answer a question on the one hand and suggesting that the officer testimony is to be given enhanced weight and credibility because of these qualifications on the other.here,the district did the former while avoiding the latter.
while all of these interjections may have highlighted issues defendants would rather the jury not have focused on,that does not mean that the district court improper bolstered witnesses,nor does it indicate bias.see rosario peralta,at.
finally,we add that even if the questions did mistakenly give the jury an impression of bias,united states rivera rodríguez,cir,any prejudice was cured by the district court in its closing instructions,where it specifically instructed the jury on this issue 
i have an obligation as a judge to get immersed in questioning if i think i should,but you should not ever take from any question that i m ake or from anything that i say or do an inclination or indication on my part as to what the result of the case should be.that is not the purpose.the purpose is to try to give you the best quality of evidence possible.you are at liberty to disregard any question,any comment that i may have made in the context of this case.
we have previously held that similar jury instructions were sufficient to dispel any impressions that a district court questioning may have caused,and we see no reason to depart from those holdings here.see ayala vázquez,at,rivera torres ortiz vélez,cir meléndez rivas,at there was,for example,no instruction that the jury should not assume the court had any view on the subject of the court questions and that the jury could disregard all the court questions.
the district court admonitions to juan 
juan also argues that the district court was specifically biased against him.
relevant facts 
once during jury selection and again during the trial,the district court observed juan staring at the jury.thinking that this was an attempt to intimidate them,the district court sent juan counsel a note warning juan not to stare at the jury.also during the trial,juan alerted the district court that he believed the prosecutor was making improper hand signals to witnesses.when the issue was discussed outside the presence of the jury,the district court rejected the allegation,telling juan that it was observing the prosecutor and it did not see any improper signaling.juan was unconvinced,and asked the court for permission to raise his hand when he saw the prosecutor making these signals.the district court was having none of it,though,and chastised juan for this request.it told juan to not even think about it and threatened that if he dare d to disrupt th e courtroom,the district court would force juan into his chair or make him watch the trial in front of a tv set in the jail.
b.these admonitions did not evince bias 
j udicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of,or even hostile to,counsel,the parties,or their cases,ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge.liteky united states,d.there is a difference between expressions of impatience,annoyance or ire,on the one hand,which are permissible,and bias or partiality,on the other hand,which are forbidden.candelaria silva,at internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the allegations raised by juan fall into the former category.both actions warning juan not to stare at the jury and prohibiting him from raising his hand in the middle of questioning by the government are simply efforts at courtroom administration which are well within the district court discretion.liteky,at.even the district court alleged threat that if juan dare d to disrupt th e courtroom,the district court could force juan into his chair or make him watch the trial in front of a tv set in the jail is nothing more than an attempt to get juan to behave and not disrupt proceedings.to be sure,these admonishments are stern and somewhat harsh.but that alone is insufficient to establish bias.see id.a judge ordinary efforts at courtroom administration even a stern and judge ordinary efforts at courtroom administration remain immune.candelaria silva,at.
moreover,the district court went out of its way to ensure that the jury did not become aware of these admonishments it sent notes to juan counsel instructing juan not to stare at the jury,and the discussion involving juan raising his hand occurred at a sidebar.given this discretion,we fail to see how juan was prejudiced by the comments.see candelaria silva,at a trial judge frustration displayed at sidebar does not deprive a defendant of a fair trial.logue,at holding that a statement made outside the presence of the jury does not irretrievably taint the trial 
the district court treatment of alleged improper jury contact 
finally,juan and cummings through his supplemental pro se brief also contend that the district court was biased in its treatment of juan allegation of improper contact between the prosecutor and a juror.
relevant facts 
during trial,juan counsel advised the district court of an alleged prohibited contact between the prosecutor and a juror in the cafeteria in which the two discussed the weapons in the case.in response,the district court questioned the prosecutors and the court security officer,all of whom denied the contact.it also agreed to hear the testimony of a witness,but would only do so in open court since the public had a right to know what was occurring.when juan counsel proffered that the witness was unwilling to do so but would testify to the court in chambers,the district court denied the motion,finding the allegation was unsubstantiated and smells like a red herring.it added that it is natural for somebody who is in that circumstance to try to do whatever it takes to try to derail the procedure and that it would believe the word of an official assistant attorney,two of them,that says this did not happen.
b.the district court treatment of the allegation did not evince bias 
there is nothing here to suggest bias on the part of the district court.the court took the allegation seriously and was willing to hold a hearing.it questioned the assistant attorney and the court security officer,and it was willing to question another witness as well.that the district court refused to close the courtroom to question this witness does not show bias rather,it is just an example of the district court exercising its wide discretion to determine the scope of a resulting inquiry and the mode and manner in which it will be conducted.united states paniagua ramos,cir.juan and cummings simply disagree with the court resolution of the issue,which is insufficient to establish bias.see liteky,at j udicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.
the cumulative effect of these circumstances did not evince bias 
even though each of the allegations raised by defendants does not,on its own,show bias,we must still consider whether these allegations in the aggregate demonstrate judicial bias.see candelaria silva,at logue,at.after a thorough review of the record,we are convinced that they do not.these isolated events,none of which showed bias,did not somehow combine to create such a biased atmosphere that defendants were arguments regarding judicial bias.and because we find no credible claim for judicial bias,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant recusal motion due to bias.see united states pulido,cir we review a ruling on a motion to recuse for abuse of discretion and will sustain the district court ruling unless we find that it can not be defended as a rational conclusion supported by a reasonable reading of the record.internal quotation marks omitted.
d.the sufficiency of the evidence for cummings machinegun convictions 
counts five and six of the superseding indictment charged cummings with illegal possession of a machinegun and possession of firearms including machineguns in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,respectively.cummings challenges his convictions on these counts,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to establish his knowledge that the firearms were machineguns.we review these sufficiency claims de novo.united states shaw,cir.
relevant facts 
on may,while executing a search warrant at the housing project,law enforcement officials discovered a closed red and black bag in cummings apartment.the bag contained four firearms,two of which were caliber glock pistols with visible,external chips which converted the pistols into automatic firearms.during his subsequent interrogation,cummings admitted that he often stored weapons and drugs for the organization and was going to be paid around for storing this particular bag.at trial,rivas,one of the cooperating witnesses,testified that he had seen cummings testing fully automatic weapons,including a black pistol which was either a or caliber.
the evidence was sufficient to convict cummings 
in reviewing claims of insufficiency,we consider the evidence,including all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom,in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.id.so long as any reasonable jury could find all the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,we must uphold the conviction.united states lizardo,cir.
here,cummings concedes that the evidence established that he possessed firearms and possessed firearms in furtherance of a crime.he argues,however,that the evidence was insufficient to establish the additional element that he knew the firearms had been modified to fire automatically,thus bringing them under the definition of a machinegun.see united states nieves castaño,cir explaining that to convict under o,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew the weapon had the characteristics that brought it within the statutory definition of a machinegun.internal quotation marks omitted.according to cummings,the government provided no evidence that he opened up the bag or was told what the bag contained,and thus there is no evidence to show that he knew the guns were machineguns and not regular firearms.
though a close call,we disagree.this case is quite similar to a previous case,united states azubike,in which a defendant convicted of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute narcotics argued that while the evidence established that he knew the suitcase he was transporting contained something illegal,the evidence was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he knew the suitcase contained a controlled substance,cir azubike ii,cir azubike i.two separate panels of this court upheld the conviction on sufficiency of the evidence grounds explaining that a number of factors and inferences made it possible for a jury to conclude that azubike would likely have known the contents.these included a recorded phone conversation in which azubike did not want to talk about the stuff over the phone,the close relationship between azubike and the conspiracy leaders,the fact that azubike was entrusted with a large amount of drugs thus suggesting he was trustworthy,and the modus operandi of the crime.azubike ii,at azubike i,at.
many of those same factors are present here.first,cummings admitted during his interrogation that he often stored guns and drugs for the organization.the repetitive nature of this process his modus operandi could lead a jury to infer that simply by being handed the bag and being told how much he would be expected to be paid,cummings would understand what the bag contained.
second,the fact that cummings had stored weapons and drugs before suggests that he was trusted by his,and positions of trust often come with increased access to information.see azubike i,at a reasonable inference of knowledge arises when the defendant is trusted with possession of a large amount of drugs.this is because drug organizations do not usually take unnecessary risks by trusting critical transactions to outsiders.see also azubike ii,at.
third,the evidence established that cummings and christopher one of the leaders of the organization were close.first,remember the phone calls between christopher and cummings while cummings was incarcerated.not only did christopher attempt to pay for cummings counsel,but he also confided in cummings that he believed members of the organization knew that christopher was going to be targeted,and that retribution would be taken on those who were not loyal.second,díaz testified that he would use cummings car when going on rounds for christopher.that cummings was willing to give up his car so that christopher could order these activities further supports a close relationship between the two.given this apparent closeness,a jury could rationally conclude that christopher would have confided in him regarding the details of the bag.see azubike ii,at see also azubike i,at.
finally,rivas testified that cummings had tested the organization weapons in the past and had been seen firing or caliber black pistols which had been modified to fire automatically shortly before cummings was given the bag seized during the may search.given that cummings had been seen with machineguns previously,a reasonable jury could infer that cummings knew that these were the types of guns he was being asked to safeguard 
though far from the strongest of cases,we believe that the cumulation of all of this circumstantial evidence is just enough to sustain the jury verdict.see shaw,at individual pieces of evidence viewed in isolation may be insufficient in themselves to prove a point,but in cumulation may indeed meet the mark.accordingly,we reject cummings challenge.
e.the courtroom closings 
christopher,meanwhile,also argues that the district court violated his sixth amendment right to a public trial when it removed his wife and children from the courtroom.we review this allegation de novo.united states deluca,cir.
relevant facts 
during the fourth day of trial,the district court ordered that christopher wife and two minor children aged ten and fourteen be removed from the courtroom.christopher counsel learned of this exclusion after the day had ended,so he brought the issue to the district court attention at the start of day five.upon raising the issue,the district court acknowledged that it had ordered all three family members removed,stating that they had been disruptive.regarding christopher wife,the district court explained that it had observed her moving her lips at the witness with great distaste and that the witness had seen her doing so.as to the children,the district court explained that they were disrupting a little bit.it added that it d id want the children here,because this is not a place for children to listen to th ese kind of conversations that are recorded,nor to see drugs distributed at a drug point b ecause i do think that nobody should validate or let children be exposed to that to begin with.it went on to note that it would never let a child of mine listen to this thing,nor hear the language spoken on this tape.
after hearing this explanation,christopher counsel asked if christopher wife was barred from returning,to which the district court responded in the negative.the court instructed christopher counsel that if christopher wife wants to come in and behave like a person should and stay seated and put,then she could come back.however,it warned that a court officer would be seated behind christopher wife and if this happens again,the court will get her out,and she will be banned forever.christopher counsel never asked if the children could return,nor did he object to their continued exclusion.
christopher sixth amendment right was not violated 
the sixth amendment guarantees that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.const.amend.vi.this right was created for the benefit of the defendant,as openness in criminal proceedings encourages witnesses to come forward,discourages perjury,and ensure s that judge and prosecutor carry out their duties responsibly.bucci united states,cir quoting waller georgia,d.
accordingly,closing a criminal trial to the public is rare,and before a closure is permitted,a inquiry must be satisfied 
the party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced,the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest,the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding,and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.
id.citing waller,at.
this test,however,applies to total closures where all members of the public are excluded during some portion of the trial.id.in partial closures,where courtroom access is restricted but some members of the public are permitted to attend this court and several of our sister circuits have held that a substantial interest,rather than a compelling one,will justify a partial closure.id.because only christopher wife and children were removed from the courtroom,we analyze the exclusions under the modified waller test for partial closures id.at.
christopher wife 
the exclusion of christopher wife complied with the modified waller test.first,the district court explained that it observed christopher wife making faces and mouthing words of disapproval at the witness,and that the district court believed that the witness saw these actions.we agree that such actions could be seen as an attempt at witness intimidation,and the prevention of witness intimidation is clearly a substantial interest.see martin bissonette,cir upholding the exclusion of defendant family members during the reopening of a witness testimony where the witness stated that her initial testimony had been untrue because she had been given looks by defendant family and felt intimidated united states brazel,cir requiring that the public identify themselves before entering the courtroom constituted a partial closure but was permissible because the district court observed individuals coming into the courtroom and staring at witnesses woods kuhlmann,cir upholding a partial,temporary closure where defendant family was excluded because,after observing the family members and the witness and having a brief exchange with the witness,the district court believed family members were intimidating witnesses.
second,we believe that the district court requirement that christopher wife leave until she promised to behave herself was no broader than necessary to protect this substantial interest.as soon as christopher wife stopped mouthing words and staring at witnesses,she was to be allowed back in,and thus,the removal was neither broader nor longer than was reasonably necessary to end this harassment and secure the witness accurate testimony.martin,at.
third,while it would have been better for the district court to have explicitly stated that it had considered reasonable alternatives to removing christopher wife,we have previously held that such a consideration can be implicit.see id.at.this is especially true here,where no reasonable and alternative existed.christopher suggests that the court should have publicly admonished his wife and warned her to stop before removing her,as opposed to making that a condition for reentry,and that it should have questioned the witness to determine whether he had seen christopher wife actions and been intimidated by them.however,we believe neither of these alternatives to be reasonable under the circumstances.the district court was concerned that the witness was being intimidated and wanted to take action to ensure that that did not happen.had the court stopped the proceedings,questioned the witness,and scolded christopher wife,all this would have done is disrupt the proceedings,draw attention to the situation,and possibly even enhance the intimidation felt by the witness.nothing in waller or in any other case cited by christopher suggests that a trial judge,presented with evidence of witness intimidation must undertake an assessment of the exact level of affrightment before closing a courtroom.id.at.in fact,the law is to the contrary.see id.
finally,as already explained,the district court informed christopher counsel that christopher wife was removed because she was staring at the witness moving her lips with great distaste and that the witness had seen her doing so.this is an adequate finding to support the partial closure.see martin,at brazel,at kuhlmann,at.
accordingly,the exclusion of christopher wife during the fourth day of trial met the modified waller test and did not violate christopher sixth amendment right to a public trial.
christopher children 
in stark contrast to his wife exclusion,where christopher counsel asked specifically whether she was barred and if she could return,christopher counsel remained silent with regards to christopher children and never sought to have them readmitted.this silence is fatal to christopher claim.when the subject matter is unmistakably on the table,and the defense silence is reasonably understood only as signifying agreement that there was nothing objectionable,the issue is waived on appeal.united states christi,cir see also united states acosta colón,cir the judge put the exclusion matter squarely on the table for all the defendants lawyers at sidebar each attorney had the chance to speak up so defendant counsel silence constitutes classic waiver martineau perrin,cir.given that the closure issue was indeed,it was the entire point of the colloquy christopher counsel silence as to christopher children can only be understood as implicit agreement that they should remain barred from the courtroom.accordingly,this argument is nothing but an afterthought on appeal,and thus waived.see levine united states,d due regard generally for the public nature of the judicial process does not require disregard of the solid demands of the fair administration of justice in favor of a party who,at the appropriate time and acting under advice of counsel,saw no disregard of a right,but raises an abstract claim only as an afterthought on appeal.
we pause for a moment,however,to sound a note of caution.a defendant has a clear right to have his family present during proceedings and we know of no exception for minor children.see united states negrón sostre,wl,at cir,w ithout exception all courts have held that an accused is at the very least entitled to have his friends,relatives and counsel present,no matter with what offense he may be charged.quoting in re oliver.internal quotation marks omitted see also united states rivera,app x,cir downs lape,cir chin,dissenting.whether any individual child should be allowed to observe proceedings and possibly be exposed to harsh language,violence,and other untoward situations is a decision for that child parents,not for the district court the court troubling blanket view that the courtroom was not a place for children is not only overly paternalistic,but also potentially in contradiction with the sixth amendment.
cumulative error 
finally,defendants argue that even if no single error warrants reversal,the cumulative effect of these errors form an interconnected web of unfairness.while we agree that i ndividual errors,insufficient in themselves to necessitate a new trial,may in the aggregate have a more debilitating effect,united states sepúlveda,cir,that is not the situation presently before us.
defendants allege a host of errors,but only one has any potential merit agent james testimony as to christopher involvement in the conspiracy which was both beyond his personal knowledge and beyond the scope of the question asked.but as we discussed above,any error was harmless.and there can be no cumulative error when multiple errors do not exist.see united states desimone,cir the cumulative error doctrine is of no use to defendant because the only identified error was harmless.united states stokes,cir by definition,analysis is inappropriate when a party complains of the cumulative effect of.
iv.sentencing issues 
in addition to attacking their convictions,cummings and christopher also challenge their sentences.we review these challenges under a deferential standard,the goal being to ensure that the sentence is both procedurally sound and substantively reasonable.united states trinidad acosta,cir quoting united states dávila gonzález,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also united states maisonet gonzález,cir.because both defendants only challenge the procedures by which the district court arrived at their respective sentences,that is where we focus our discussion.
a sentence is procedurally sound so long as the district court complies with the specifically delineated roadmap we have previously laid out.united states serunjogi,cir quoting united states madera ortiz,cir.this entails calculating the applicable guidelines sentencing range gsr,addressing any objections to the probation department presentence investigation report psr,giving both parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate,considering the a sentencing factors,and explaining the reasoning behind the chosen sentence.see gall united states,d.deviations from this roadmap such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the section a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence constitute procedural error.trinidad acosta,at internal quotation marks omitted see also gall,at.though our overall review of a sentencing is for abuse of discretion,this standard is actually multifaceted w e review factual findings for clear error,arguments that the sentencing court erred in interpreting or applying the guidelines de novo,and judgment calls for abuse of discretion simpliciter.serunjogi,at alteration in original.notably,when a defendant is convicted of more than one count,a district court is expected to render a separate sentence on each count.united states zavala martí,cir.
cummings sentence 
in his supplemental pro se brief,cummings argues that his sentence was procedurally flawed because the district court erred in calculating the base offense level for count seven the drug conspiracy conviction.specifically,cummings contends that he was not automatically responsible for all of the drugs involved in the conspiracy simply because he was convicted as a coconspirator,and the district court failure to make an individualized finding as to the amount specifically attributable to him was error.this argument,while right on the law,is wrong on the facts.
under the sentencing guidelines,a defendant base offense level for drug offenses depends mostly on the quantity of the drugs involved in the offense.c.accordingly,in order to properly calculate the gsr,the district court must first make an individualized finding as to drug amounts attributable to,or foreseeable by,that defendant.united states vázquez larrauri,cir internal quotation marks omitted.drug amounts are foreseeable to a coconspirator so long as he or she could reasonably have anticipated the drugs would be within the ambit of the conspiracy.united states santos,cir citing a b cmt.
here,the psr attributed over kilograms of marijuana to cummings,qualifying him for the highest base offense level level.c.when cummings objected to this calculation,the district court rejected his argument,responding that no matter how you look at this,in the context of what the conspiracy rules are and foreseeability and all of that,he a n offense level of.though perhaps not the clearest or most detailed of explanations,this statement shows that,contrary to cummings contention,the district court did consider whether or not the entire drug amount was individually attributable to cummings,and the court concluded that it was 
because the district court did address the drug quantity attributed to cummings,we are left to determine whether the court committed clear error in adopting the psr finding.it did not.the evidence showed that cummings was an enforcer in the organization,sometimes delivered drugs,and would often store drugs for the conspiracy.with all of these roles,cummings could reasonably have anticipated that such a large quantity of drugs would be involved in the conspiracy,and thus there is no error in concluding that that entire amount was foreseeable to him.see santos,at.
in any event,even if the district court had failed to make an individualized finding,the error would have been harmless.see vázquez larrauri,at explaining that in order to vacate a sentence,a defendant must show that an error occurred and that it affected the defendant substantial rights.the verdict form convicting cummings explicitly found that at least grams of narcotics were involved in the conspiracy,thus triggering a mandatory minimum sentence.see b a iii.since cummings was only sentenced to months or ten years on this count,his sentence would have been the same regardless of the individualized drug finding.
accordingly,cummings sentence was procedurally sound.
christopher sentence 
christopher was convicted on count seven the drug conspiracy and count nine conspiracy to possess firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime of the superseding indictment,and the district court imposed a joint life sentence.christopher argues that this sentence was procedurally flawed for a number of reasons.
first,he contends that the district court relied on the psr for a different defendant,and thus the district court sentence was tailored towards another defendant,and not christopher.this argument is easily dispensed with.though the district court did initially have the wrong psr in front of it,this mistake was quickly corrected.by the time the district court made its comments regarding the guidelines calculation and imposition of sentence,it had been given and had reviewed the correct psr.thus,the sentence was individually tailored to christopher.
second,christopher argues that the district court failed to consider his objections to the gsr calculation on his drug conspiracy conviction count seven,and that this failure resulted in an incorrect calculation.at the outset of the sentencing proceedings,the district court asked if there was any objection that survives,to which christopher responded that he had filed a sentencing memorandum containing all of his arguments for an sentence.the district court replied,okay.very well and made no other specific reference to the memorandum.later in the proceedings,however,the district court stated the calculations regarding drugs are totally correct,and there no objection about that.this latter statement was clearly erroneous,as christopher had indeed objected to the calculation in his sentencing memorandum and had told the district court as much earlier in the proceeding.
this misstatement,however,was harmless because christopher objection was legally incorrect.christopher contended that under alleyne united states,d,the jury was required to find the specific drug quantity he was responsible for,so any drug findings by the district court or in the psr could not be considered.however,all alleyne requires is for the jury to find that the amount of drugs is greater than that necessary for the mandatory minimum in order for that mandatory minimum to be imposed.see united states razo,cir alleyne held that a jury finding was required to trigger a mandatory minimum.
the jury found that christopher possessed at least five kilograms of cocaine,so the district court finding that the psr was correct in its calculation of a drug quantity significantly more than is entirely consistent with the jury entirely appropriate.see united states ramos gonzález,cir.there was thus no error in the district court calculation of a total offense level of corresponding to a gsr of life imprisonment.
in addition to challenging the gsr calculation for count seven,christopher also alleges that the district court erroneously ignored the a factors and considered the life sentence to be mandatory.he bases this contention on the district court statement that it was imposing the mandatory life sentence.however,immediately following this statement,the district court clarified that the sentence was m andatory in the sense that that what the guidelines call for.indeed,the court went on to state that there was nothing before me that would tell me that i should do anything different by departure or by variance,and i will not.thus,though the district court did use the term mandatory,it is clear from its clarification and decision not to impose a variance that this was simply a misstatement,and that the court was well aware that the life sentence was not mandatory.
moreover,the court comment that there was nothing before me that would tell me that i should do anything different was most likely a reference to,and rejection of,the a sentencing factor arguments contained in christopher sentencing memorandum.while we wish this statement was clearer and more explicit,it was sufficient.see united states savoie,cir rejecting defendant argument that the district court failed to address the a factors given the pointed comments delivered by the district court at sentencing see also united states ocasio cancel,cir a sentence usually demands a less detailed explanation than a variant sentence.
finally,christopher argues that the district court erred in failing to calculate the applicable gsr for count nine,instead choosing to group the two counts together since there was no point in calculating the sentence for each count separately.we agree this was error.t he proper procedure during sentencing is to render a separate sentence on each count.zavala martí,at internal quotation marks omitted.this is especially true here where count nine did not authorize a life sentence rather,it carries a maximum penalty see almonte núñez,at c ollateral consequences may arise as a result of an sentence imposed on a particular count it strikes us as both unwise and unfair to place the risk of such harm on the defendant where,as here,the excessive sentence is easy to correct.
accordingly,we vacate christopher sentence and remand so that the district court may impose an individual sentence on each of the two counts of conviction.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the convictions of all three defendants.we also affirm cummings sentence,but we vacate and remand christopher sentence so that the district court can impose an individual sentence on each count.
affirmed in part,vacated and remanded in part.
because juan laureano pérez and christopher laureano pérez are brothers with the same last name,we refer to them by their first names in order to distinguish them.we mean no disrespect in doing so.
none of these other went to trial with defendants.
throughout the hearing,the district court mistakenly referred to christopher as christian.
we reject cummings argument that his due process rights were violated when the district court held the hearing despite the government failure to file a formal motion as ordered by the district court.the government made its concerns clear both through its initial informative motion to the court and through its arguments at the status conference.moreover,the government met with armenteros and previewed one of the recorded phone conversations.any allegation that armenteros was faced with an unfair surprise and was unable to prepare for the hearing,therefore,is disingenuous at best.
that cummings later seemed willing to engage in a discussion with the district court through the filing of a motion to waive any conflict does not alter our analysis.this waiver occurred months after the initial hearing,and after christopher had been indicted as a.christopher indictment only increased the chances of a conflict since armenteros would be representing cummings while being paid not by some third party but by a codefendant with different interests.as such,the district court decision to reject cummings waiver motion was also not an abuse of discretion.see wheat,at in re grand jury proceedings,at.
it is unclear to us why the parties begin counting on june,the date of cummings arraignment.the speedy trial act instructs that we begin counting on the later of a defendant first appearance or indictment it says nothing about a defendant arraignment.see c barnes i,at.cummings was indicted on may,and his first appearance occurred on may.thus,the proper starting date should have been may.however,because cummings never argued for this starting point,any nonexcludable time between may,and june,is waived.see gates,at.
three days elapsed from the filing of the motion on june until its resolution on june.however,we only include two excludable days because june was already excluded as part of the b motion.three days elapsed from the filing of the motion on june until its resolution on june.however,we only include two excludable days because june was already excluded as part of the b motion.
cummings argues that these seven days should not be excluded because the district court never explicitly found that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial as required by the speedy trial act.see h a.however,we have held that a district court need not explicitly state its reasons for granting a continuance nor make a best interest finding if it is obvious and set forth in the motion for a continuance.see united states pringle,cir quoting united states rush,cir.cummings motion for a continuance was premised on cummings counsel being out of the jurisdiction during the continued period.this is considered a sufficient reason to exclude the time.see id.at finding that delays resulting from defense counsel scheduling conflicts and defendant travel outside the jurisdiction were excludable.cummings argues that these seven days should not be excluded because the district court never explicitly found that the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial as required by the speedy trial act.see h a.however,we have held that a district court need not explicitly state its reasons for granting a continuance nor make a best interest finding if it is obvious and set forth in the motion for a continuance.see united states pringle,cir quoting united states rush,cir.cummings motion for a continuance was premised on cummings counsel being out of the jurisdiction during the continued period.this is considered a sufficient reason to exclude the time.see id.at finding that delays resulting from defense counsel scheduling conflicts and defendant travel outside the jurisdiction were excludable.

it is unclear to us why the parties exclude this time.cummings request for an additional status conference does not appear to fit under h d as a pretrial motion,and even if it did,the motion would have been disposed of as soon as the court agreed to hold another conference,since the requested conference itself can not be fairly categorized as a hearing on the motion.similarly,we do not believe the time can be categorized as an excludable continuance under h,since even if it were considered a continuance,there are no findings either explicit or obvious from the record that would qualify it as excludable.nevertheless,because cummings never argues for its nonexclusion,we exclude it.see gates,at.it is unclear to us why the parties exclude this time.cummings request for an additional status conference does not appear to fit under h d as a pretrial motion,and even if it did,the motion would have been disposed of as soon as the court agreed to hold another conference,since the requested conference itself can not be fairly categorized as a hearing on the motion.similarly,we do not believe the time can be categorized as an excludable continuance under h,since even if it were considered a continuance,there are no findings either explicit or obvious from the record that would qualify it as excludable.nevertheless,because cummings never argues for its nonexclusion,we exclude it.see gates,at.

cummings objects to the exclusion of these days because the court never made explicit its findings and rationale for granting the continuance.as we stated above,this is not necessary if the reasons are obvious.pringle,at.the government explains that the continuance was requested due to the impending filing of the superseding indictment.because a continuance in this situation would allow all defendants to be tried together and to avoid piecemeal and repetitive proceedings,the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interests of the defendant in a speedy trial,h a,and thus the days are properly excluded.see barnes ii,at.cummings objects to the exclusion of these days because the court never made explicit its findings and rationale for granting the continuance.as we stated above,this is not necessary if the reasons are obvious.pringle,at.the government explains that the continuance was requested due to the impending filing of the superseding indictment.because a continuance in this situation would allow all defendants to be tried together and to avoid piecemeal and repetitive proceedings,the ends of justice served by taking such action outweigh the best interests of the defendant in a speedy trial,h a,and thus the days are properly excluded.see barnes ii,at.

we do note,however,that in an abundance of caution it would be in the government best interest to cite to all relevant provisions,especially when directly quoting from those provisions.
these include freebase and coca paste.depierre.at.
cummings makes a similar unpreserved argument regarding the jury instructions for these counts,alleging that it was error to instruct the jury on crack cocaine as opposed to cocaine base because crack and cocaine base were no longer synonymous under depierre.for the same reasons discussed above,we reject this argument.
christopher did object to rivas statement that the men were armed and his subsequent explanation as to how he knew this,but the objection was based on a different ground.see united states wallace,cir because that objection was on different grounds,however,we deem the defendant present argument of error,raised for the first time on appeal,as unpreserved.
defendants also challenge parts of officer vázquez testimony as overview testimony.that is addressed in part,infra.
juan did initially object on confrontation clause grounds,but does not renew that objection on appeal.see wallace,at.even if he had,that argument would fail as well,as statements are by their nature,not testimonial,and thus not subject to the confrontation clause.ciresi,at see also bourjaily united states,d.
