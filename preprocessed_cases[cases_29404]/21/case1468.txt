appeals from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered on september,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gleeson,convicting defendant,after a second jury trial,of three counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base,in violation of a,b b iii,and b c.following the convictions,the district court imposed a sentence of incarceration of months a term of supervised release of years and a special assessment.the defendant currently is serving his sentence.
appellant contends that his rights under the grand jury clause and the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment were violated because the trial court provided a special verdict sheet to the jury in which count three of a third and final superseding indictment was split into two parts a and b,with each part describing a different time and place for the charge of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance on may,and the trial court allowed the defendant to be retried on part a following the jury verdict of not guilty as to part b and its failure to reach a verdict as to part appellant also claims that some or all of the testifying police officers lied under oath about material matters at defendant second trial,and,therefore,that the district court abused its discretion in denying his rule motion for a new trial in the interest of justice.finally,appellant argues that he should be entitled to,pursuant to kimbrough united states,d,so that the district court may consider the appellant argument that the sentencing commission disparate treatment of crack and powder cocaine was unwarranted and rendered the advisory sentencing range in this case greater than necessary under.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment of conviction but remand for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to the appellant in light of kimbrough.
background 
i.the first trial 
on june,a grand jury in the eastern district of new york returned an indictment charging peter mccourty with four counts possession with intent to distribute unspecified amounts of cocaine and cocaine base on june,in violation of a and b c count one possession with intent to distribute unspecified amounts of cocaine and cocaine base on or about and between may,and may,in violation of a and b c count two possession of a firearm as a convicted felon,in violation of g count three and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,the crime charged in count two,in violation of c count four.
on july,a grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging mccourty with the same four counts as in the initial indictment but adding to count one a specification of a quantity of five grams or more of cocaine base and a reference to b b iii,which provides an enhanced penalty for possession of that amount of cocaine base.on october,in response to a september,motion made by the defense,the grand jury returned a second superseding indictment.the second superseding indictment separated count two of the superseding indictment into two counts,one charging possession of unspecified amounts of cocaine and cocaine base on may and the other charging possession of unspecified amounts of cocaine and cocaine base on may.these counts became count two may and count three may,respectively.
mccourty also moved in his september,motion for severance of count one of the second superseding indictment he argued that the offense charged in count one involved an incident that took place almost a year before the incidents described in the remaining counts.mccourty also argued that the events of may,involved a chase,as well as an alleged gun possession that might prejudice the jury in regard to count one.the district court granted the motion and ordered that count one be tried separately from the remaining counts.the parties agreed that count four the count would be tried separately from counts two,three,and five and that trial would proceed immediately on count four after the jury returned its verdict on the latter counts.
on december,the grand jury returned a indictment the superseding indictment,which added a quantity of five grams or more of cocaine base to the previously unspecified amount of cocaine base charged in count three may and a reference to b b iii.in sum,mccourty was charged under the superseding indictment with possession of an unspecified amount of cocaine and five grams or more of cocaine base on june,count one possession of unspecified amounts of cocaine and cocaine base on may,count two possession of an unspecified amount of cocaine and five grams or more of cocaine base on may,count three possession of a firearm as a convicted felon count four and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,the crime charged in count three count five.
prior to the start of the first trial,defense counsel raised the issue of a duplicity problem with regard to count three defense counsel claimed that count three alleged that mccourty had possessed both powder cocaine and at least five grams of cocaine base on or about may.accordingly,counsel argued,in the event of a simple guilty verdict returned by the jury as to count three,that verdict would not reveal either the type or quantity of drugs that mccourty would be found to have possessed.defense counsel submitted that the duplicity problem could be cured by a special interrogatory asking the jury if it found that mccourty possessed over five grams of crack cocaine.the district court stated that the issue could be addressed on the verdict sheet verdict sheet for count three and that it would deal with this at the charge conference.the court then swore in the jury,and the first trial began.with regard to counts two,three,and five,the government presented the following evidence in support of its.
count two drug possession on may,
new york police department nypd officers kirk anderson and gabriel dobles testified as follows concerning the events on may,the officers encountered mccourty at approximately,while they were on routine anticrime patrol in an unmarked vehicle.officer joseph rodriguez of the nypd was also in the vehicle with them.the three officers were traveling eastbound on hegeman avenue in brooklyn,new york,when officer anderson saw mccourty standing on the south side of hegeman avenue,across from the east side of the bristol street corner.officer anderson was approximately feet from mccourty when he saw mccourty standing in an unobstructed zone.officer anderson observed mccourty conduct a drug transaction with another individual mccourty was holding an rolling tobacco pouch in one hand and passed a smaller bag from that pouch to another individual.officer anderson then told the other officers in his vehicle what he had seen,and he and the other officers exited the patrol car and approached mccourty.when mccourty observed the officers approaching him,he turned away and dropped the tobacco pouch to the ground and began to walk in the opposite direction.officer anderson then recovered the pouch from the ground.mccourty was placed under arrest,and a search of mccourty revealed baggies of marijuana,which the officers seized.at the time of his arrest,mccourty stated to the officers you taking me for this bullshit next time i just run.the substance contained within the pouch mccourty dropped to the ground tested positive for powder and crack cocaine.
based on this incident,mccourty was charged in kings county criminal court with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree,a class a misdemeanor,and unlawful possession of marijuana,and he was released.the state charges were eventually adjourned in contemplation of dismissal.
counts three drug possession on may,and five firearm possession on may,
the offense described in count three of the superseding indictment encompassed two events 
on or about may,within the eastern district of new york,the defendant peter mccourty did knowingly and intentionally possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance,which offense involved a a substance containing cocaine,a schedule ii controlled substance,and b grams or more of a substance containing cocaine base,a schedule ii controlled substance.
title,united states code,sections a,b b iii and b c title,united states code,sections et.
at trial,officers anderson and dobles provided testimony regarding the events of may.these events served as the basis for the charges included in both counts three and five.at approximately on that day,officers anderson and dobles were on patrol with their supervising officer,sergeant thomas lent.the officers were traveling southbound on amboy street and,when the vehicle reached the intersection of amboy street and hegeman avenue,the officers saw mccourty standing on the northeast corner of the intersection,only two blocks from where mccourty was arrested on may.
the officers were approximately feet from mccourty,who was standing in an area by street lights and also lit by lights along the wall of the parking garage across the street.the officers observed mccourty holding an rolling tobacco pouch in one hand and passing a smaller bag from that pouch to another individual.after observing this,the officers drove their police vehicle up onto the sidewalk,at which time mccourty,who saw the officers and their car on the sidewalk,ran away.mccourty ran across hegeman avenue towards amboy street.while in flight,mccourty dropped the item that he had been holding onto hegeman avenue.officer anderson recovered the item,which was later determined to be a package containing powder cocaine and crack cocaine,and continued to chase mccourty.officer anderson testified that,during the chase,he observed mccourty clutching a gun and attempting to put it into his pocket or waistband.
officers dobles and lent pursued mccourty into a parking lot on amboy between hegeman avenue and linden boulevard,but they did not catch him.the officers then chased mccourty into a house at thomas boyland street,but he eluded the officers at that location.approximately twenty minutes later,the officers went to mccourty grandmother apartment located at linden boulevard,apartment,which was an address where the officers believed mccourty could be found.once there,officer dobles observed mccourty in the doorway of the apartment,apparently attempting to leave.at that moment,mccourty was wearing what appeared to officer dobles to be a knapsack.
mccourty shut himself in the apartment,and the officers knocked on the door,but mccourty would not open the door.the officers eventually gained forcible entry into the apartment,but mccourty was no longer inside,having apparently utilized a balcony to make his escape.within the apartment,the officers found a gun that resembled the one that officer anderson had seen in mccourty hand earlier that night and a knapsack containing drugs,drug paraphernalia,and mccourty new york state identification card.the substances contained within the foil pouch mccourty dropped to the ground and within the knapsack tested positive for powder and crack cocaine the crack cocaine found within the backpack amounted to over five grams.
count four of a firearm 
in the separate portion of the trial pertaining only to count four,the government,in addition to the foregoing testimony,produced stipulations that the gun mccourty allegedly possessed on may,had traveled in interstate commerce and that mccourty was a convicted felon.
d.the defense case 
the defense called an investigator who had taken photographs of the repair shop and street corners on which mccourty was observed on may and may,in an attempt to establish that the officers could not have seen the events to which they had testified.on,the defense witness admitted that he had no knowledge of the officers actual perspective on the dates mccourty was observed nor any personal knowledge of the events on the dates in question.
ii.the charge conference and verdict sheet 
at the charge conference following the close of trial,the district court discussed count three and the duplicity issue raised by defense counsel prior to the start of the trial.because count three of the superseding indictment charged mccourty with possess ing with intent to distribute a controlled substance,which offense involved a a substance containing cocaine,and b grams or more of a substance containing cocaine base on or about may,count three encompassed the entirety of the drugs allegedly possessed by mccourty on may the cocaine and crack cocaine that he threw on the street and the cocaine and more than five grams of crack cocaine found in his knapsack at his grandmother apartment.
the district court indicated that it would structure the verdict sheet in such a way that the jury could indicate whether it found mccourty guilty of either possessing the drugs on the street or possessing the drugs in the knapsack or both,with an additional question as to the five grams as to the drugs in the knapsack.defense counsel objected,claiming that the language of count three required a finding that mccourty possessed five grams of crack cocaine,a requirement that would be defeated by the proposed charge.defense counsel also argued that the division of count three constituted a very substantial amendment of the indictment to essentially break down one charge into two charges.defense counsel acknowledged that the verdict sheet as a practical matter could cure th e problem with ambiguity,but argued that the verdict sheet did not correspond to the way the indictment is written and what was charged and what we have defended against,and what we had notice of,that how we proceeded.in response,the court found that there was no unfairness or lack of notice here and ruled that 
it is commonly the case that more than one way of violating the statute is alleged within a single count.sometimes it a multiple object conspiracy sometimes manufacture and distribution is alleged in a single count,and this case has obviously been about all along the transaction alleged to have been observed in the street and the drugs seized from the backpack.
accordingly,the jury was then charged in conformity with the three counts set forth on the verdict sheet.count two of the verdict sheet provided as follows 
count two possession of cocaine or crack with intent to,
possession with intent to distribute at the intersection of amboy street and hegeman avenue.
guilty not guilty 
possession with intent to distribute at linden boulevard,apartment.
guilty not guilty 
only answer this question if you found the defendant guilty of count two b.has the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed with the intent to distribute more than five grams of crack 
following the jury overnight deliberations,the jury returned the following partial verdict no verdict on count two of the superseding indictment count one on the verdict sheet,regarding mccourty possession with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base on may no verdict as to the part of count three of the superseding indictment regarding mccourty possession of cocaine and cocaine base on the street on may count two a on the verdict sheet not guilty as to the part of count three of the superseding indictment regarding mccourty possession of cocaine and cocaine base found at his grandmother apartment on may count two b on the verdict sheet and not guilty as to count five,regarding mccourty possession of the firearm found at his grandmother apartment count on the verdict sheet.the district court subsequently directed a mistrial as to the hung counts.the court also directed a verdict as to count four count three on the verdict sheet,which pertained to the charged offense of possession of a firearm in connection with a narcotics offense,in light of the jury verdict as to mccourty having allegedly possessed a firearm as a felon on may.
iii.motions 
at the close of trial,defense counsel made a motion for a directed verdict as to the part of count three of the superseding indictment regarding the possession of cocaine and cocaine base on the street appearing at count two a on the verdict sheet,the duplicity issue and arguing that res judicata principles precluded a retrial on this count.the district court stated that it would take up the issues at a later date.
defense counsel also claimed with regard to count three that although the jury was undecided as to whether he possessed crack on the street on may,the court should direct a verdict as to the entirety of count three because the specific wording of count three mentioned five grams or more of crack on may,and it was undisputed that mccourty alleged possession of crack cocaine on the street on that date involved less than five grams of crack.defense counsel concluded that the verdict precluded further prosecution as to the events of may,or at least any prosecution with respect to crack on that date.the district court rejected mccourty challenges and permitted the government to retry mccourty on count three only on the theory that mccourty possessed an unspecified amount of powder cocaine or crack cocaine on the street on may.
iv.the second trial 
a second trial was conducted on march,to resolve the remaining charges set forth in the superseding one,which had been severed from the first trial,and the counts for which the jury could not reach a verdict in the first trial,these being count two and the part of count three concerning mccourty possession of the drugs on the street appearing as count two a on the special verdict form.the second trial resulted in a conviction on all of these counts.at the second trial,the government presented the following evidence in support of its.
count one drug possession on june,
nypd officers anderson and dobles,as well as nypd sergeant lent who had not been a witness at the first trial,testified as follows concerning the events on june,on june,officers anderson and dobles,as well as sergeant lent,were given an assignment to speak with mccourty concerning two outstanding warrants for mccourty arrest and an outstanding domestic violence complaint against mccourty.the district court prohibited the officers from specifically mentioning the warrants and complaint during their testimony.the officers observed mccourty car being towed and followed it to a repair shop in brooklyn.the officers approached mccourty inside the tow yard of the repair shop,and,when mccourty observed the officers,mccourty motioned that he would be with them in a moment.mccourty then reached into the pocket of the sweatshirt he was wearing and threw a bag to the ground in front of him.the bag was recovered,mccourty was arrested,and the substance in the bag was later determined to be a large rock of crack cocaine.officer dobles placed mccourty under arrest and found more drugs on mccourty person,namely,a large baggie of cocaine,a ziplock baggie of crack cocaine,and six ziplock baggies of marijuana.the weight of the crack cocaine found in the bag mccourty threw to the ground was grams,and the weight of the powder cocaine found on mccourty person was grams.
count two drug possession on may,
the testimony of officers anderson and dobles concerning count two mirrored their testimony at the first trial.officer anderson added at the second trial that mccourty was not attempting to hide his behavior during the drug transaction on may.
officer joseph rodriguez who had not been a witness at the first trial testified that while on patrol with officers anderson and dobles,he heard anderson say,there pete,he engaging in a.rodriguez looked over and saw mccourty brush by a taller black male on the south side of hegeman near bristol street.rodriguez was less than ten feet from mccourty when he observed him,and there was nothing blocking his view of mccourty.he and the other officers exited their vehicle,at which time officer rodriguez heard one of the other officers say that mccourty had dropped something.rodriguez looked down by the ground where mccourty was standing and saw a silver shiny packet.the officers arrested mccourty,and as he was being transported to the precinct,mccourty remarked that he thought the officers were after guns and that if he had known they were after drugs he would have ran sic.the foil pouch thrown by mccourty contained bags of crack cocaine and bags of powder cocaine.
count three drug possession in the street on may,
the testimony of officers anderson and dobles concerning count three also mirrored that of the first trial,except that they did not testify about the chase of mccourty or the drugs and weapon found at mccourty grandmother apartment that day.dobles added at the second trial that he was able to recognize mccourty,when the patrol vehicle was right up next to the corner of hegeman and amboy,because nothing was blocking his view of mccourty.he also testified that the area was well lit,and he pointed out the various street and building lights on a government exhibit containing enlarged photographs of the corner in question.
sergeant lent,the supervising officer,testified that while on patrol with the other officers on may he saw mccourty standing on hegeman avenue close to amboy street.sergeant lent was driving the vehicle and recognized mccourty when he stopped for the stop sign at the intersection of hegeman and amboy.sergeant lent testified that there was nothing blocking his view of mccourty and that the area was well lit by street lamps and box lamps on the parking garage.sergeant lent saw mccourty engage in a drug transaction and described the individual with whom mccourty dealt as a black man taller than mccourty.sergeant lent turned the patrol vehicle onto the sidewalk and,as the officers approached,mccourty ran off and dropped a package to the ground.the package turned out to be a foil pouch containing bags of powder cocaine and six bags of crack cocaine.mccourty turned himself in on may.
d.the defense case 
the defense officer dobles in order to impeach him with what the defense believed to be a prior inconsistent statement concerning the drugs recovered on june,count one.the defense also called an investigator who had taken photographs of the repair shop,of the street corners on which mccourty was observed on may and may,and of mccourty grandmother apartment.on,the investigator admitted that he had no knowledge of the officers actual perspective on the dates mccourty was observed nor any knowledge of the weather or street conditions on those dates.
proceedings following the second trial 
after deliberating,the jury returned a guilty verdict as to all three of the counts tried at the second trial.mccourty filed a motion pursuant to rules and of the federal rules of criminal procedure for an acquittal and for a new trial,principally arguing that the government witnesses were not credible and perjured themselves in various respects.specifically,the defense urged that the retrial had been infected by rampant and pervasive perjury committed by each of the testifying police officers.at the outset of the sentencing proceeding,the district court denied the motions in their entirety,concluding that the resolution of the factual issues here is a matter properly left to the jury and that there was no perjury of the kind complained of by mccourty.
as to sentencing,in the second addendum to the presentence investigation report psr,issued on august,the probation department determined that mccourty total offense level under the guidelines was and that his criminal history category was ii,resulting in a range of imprisonment of to months.the second addendum arrived at the base offense level by combining the cocaine and crack cocaine attributable to mccourty based on his convictions for counts one,two and three namely,grams of crack cocaine and grams of powder cocaine.
as directed by application note d to,the second addendum combined these two figures and converted them using the drug equivalency tables into an equivalent amount of this case,kilograms.according to the second addendum,this quantity of marijuana corresponded to an offense level of under the guidelines.in a submission,mccourty argued that,as relevant here,the district court should apply the amendments to the guidelines reducing the base offense level for crack cocaine by two levels.
at the sentencing proceeding on august,mccourty argued for a sentence below the applicable guidelines range for a number of reasons,including the policy considerations surrounding the undue severity of the crack guidelines.he urged the court to consider whether the sentencing guidelines are an unsound judgment on the disparity issue and argued that the supreme court decision in rita united states,d,allowed the district court to impose a sentence below the applicable guidelines range on the basis of the undue severity of the crack guidelines.
the district court indicated that it would apply the proposed amendments to the guidelines and reduce mccourty base offense level by two levels to level and his criminal history category from ii to i.this resulted in a range of a term of imprisonment of to months.the court determined that the imposition of a sentence of months was appropriate and so ordered.mccourty timely appealed the judgment of conviction and sentence to this court.
mccourty principal argument on appeal is that his rights under the grand jury clause of the united states constitution were violated when the district court,over defense counsel objection,divided count three of the superseding indictment into two counts alleging two distinct crimes one charging that he possessed the drugs on the street and another charging that he possessed the drugs in apartment.mccourty claims that the splitting of count three was a constructive amendment of the i ndictment,a per se violation of the fifth amendment grand jury clause that requires reversal.mccourty claims that the only verdict that the first jury was able to reach on the offense charged in count three of the superseding indictment was an acquittal as to possession of drugs in apartment,and he therefore argues that the first jury did acquit him of at least some portion of count three and that the acquittal must be treated as an acquittal of the entire offense.as such,mccourty claims that the double jeopardy clause barred the government from trying him again for that same offense,and the district court therefore erred in allowing the trial of count three in the second trial on the issue of whether he possessed drugs in the street on the same day.

the supreme court has held that t he precise manner in which an indictment is drawn can not be ignored,because an important function of the indictment is to ensure that,in case any other proceedings are taken against the defendant for a similar offen s e,the record will sho w with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or conviction.sanabria united states,d omission and alterations in original quoting cochran united states.as such,a court may not alter or amend the indictment,literally or constructively,once it has been returned by the grand jury.see ex parte bain.see also russell united states,d reiterating bain holding that an indictment may not be amended except by resubmission to the grand jury,unless the change is merely a matter of form.an indictment has been constructively amended when the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to broaden the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment.rigas,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.the jury charge must not so alter an essential element of the charge that,upon review,it is uncertain whether the defendant was convicted of conduct that was the subject of the grand jury indictment.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.a constructive amendment of an indictment is a serious error,united states ansaldi,cir,and a per se violation of the fifth amendment,requiring automatic reversal,rigas,at.
we reject mccourty constructive amendment claim because neither the trial evidence nor the jury charge altered count three of the superseding indictment.count three charges mccourty with only one offense of possess ion of a controlled substance with intent to distribute the controlled substance.count three does identify two bases for this single offense namely,the possession on one day of grams or more of crack cocaine and the possession on the same day of an unspecified amount of cocaine.that the district court distinguished the two bases of liability is of no consequence.no constructive amendment resulted when the district court broke the single offense into two parts to be addressed by the jury.the verdict sheet identification of the apartment as the place of drug possession and the street as another location of drug possession does not alter any element of the single crime of drug possession,which occurred on may.indeed,we have encouraged such special verdict sheets or interrogatories in cases where the indictment may be ambiguous.see,united states sturdivant,cir stating that,in a case involving an ambiguous but not impermissibly vague indictment,it is the government responsibility to seek special verdicts to avoid subsequent double jeopardy consequences internal quotation marks omitted see also united states remington,cir holding that the defendant request for a special verdict on the specific basis of liability for the offense was right and should be given if there is a new trial united states,cir no constructive amendment creating two charges in one count where indictment alleged grams or more heroin but verdict sheet permitted conviction for that amount or,alternatively,for less.

we further note that the use of the verdict sheet did not expose mccourty to a greater possibility of conviction.under mccourty mistaken view of the bifurcation and presentation of count three into count two on the verdict sheet,the two questions on the verdict sheet became separate counts or offenses.however,had the jury found mccourty guilty on count three by answering yes to both of the questions on the verdict sheet,mccourty still would have been convicted of only the one offense he did knowingly and intentionally possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance.the issue of the amount of the controlled substance was presented in a separate inquiry.moreover,had the district court never split count three into two theories of liability,presented as count two,parts a and b on the verdict sheet,the jury still could have returned a verdict of guilty on the basis of either one of the incidents of may.see mejia,at.however,because we have the benefit on appeal of the current record,which includes the jury findings as to parts a no verdict and b not guilty of count two of the verdict sheet,we are able to conclude that had this very same jury in this case been presented with a verdict sheet simply containing the language of count three of the superseding indictment,the jury would either have reported no verdict because it was unable to agree on criminal liability for drug possession in the street or reported the same mixed verdict as appeared on the verdict sheet.in the event of the former,mccourty would have been retried on count three on both incidents of may.thus,the use of the verdict sheet did not expand mccourty liability,and,in fact,the verdict sheet benefitted mccourty in this case because it resulted in less exposure to criminal liability at the second trial.
accordingly,we reject mccourty claim that the verdict sheet constituted a constructive amendment of count three of the indictment.

in united states rivera,cir per curiam,our sister circuit examined an issue similar to that with which we are faced in this case.in rivera,the defendant was indicted for possession of a firearm in violation of g in a single count that alleged possession of the firearm on two different dates,august,and february.id.at.as here,the court used a special verdict form to divide the count into two for each date.id.the jury returned a finding of not guilty as to the february event but reached no decision as to the august event.id.the district court declared a mistrial for the jury failure to reach a decision in response to the second inquiry,and the defendant moved to dismiss the entire count on grounds of double jeopardy and collateral estoppel.id.the motion was denied,and the defendant appealed.id.on appeal,the eleventh circuit affirmed,holding that the double jeopardy clause did not preclude the government from retrying the defendant on the portion of the count to which the jury failed to reach a decision.

id.at citations omitted emphasis supplied.
the only real distinction between this case and rivera is that in rivera the count initially alleged the two bases of liability by identifying the separate dates upon which the offense was committed,whereas here count three did not break down the separate incidents of may by time.count three stated only that the offense involved a,powder cocaine,and b,five grams or more of crack cocaine.this distinction,however,does not affect the significance of two theories being identified in one count when the verdict sheet was presented to the jury here,it did not create two counts or two crimes but two independent bases or theories of liability.where the jury is directed to make specific findings as to the separate bases of liability set forth in the indictment,we see no danger of a double jeopardy violation.the indictment itself puts the defendant on notice of the theories of liability,and there is no broadening of the possibility of conviction or multiple punishments for the same offense.see supra analysis part i a.thus,we hold that the defendant may be retried for a portion of the count to which he was neither acquitted nor convicted provided the jury is particular about its findings with respect to the different theories of liability contained in that count.
the supreme court decision in sanabria is not to the contrary.in sanabria,the defendant was charged under one count of conducting an illegal gambling business involving horse betting and numbers betting.at.the defendant was acquitted of the entire count after the district court excluded evidence relating to the portion of the count.id.at.on appeal,the court of appeals vacated the judgment and remanded for a new trial on the numbers theory.united states sanabria,cir.before the supreme court,the government argued that the district court exclusion of evidence amounted to a dismissal of the portion of the count,and,therefore,double jeopardy did not foreclose the government from pursuing the prosecution of the defendant for conducting an illegal gambling business involving only numbers betting.sanabria,at.the supreme court concluded that the district court evidentiary ruling did not in fact amount to a dismissal of the portion of the count,and,thus,because the defendant was acquitted of the entire count,double jeopardy barred the government from prosecuting defendant for conducting an illegal gambling business as to either horse betting or numbers betting.
no language in the indictment was ordered to be stricken,nor was the indictment amended.the judgment of acquittal was entered on the entire count and found the defendant not guilty of the crime of v
