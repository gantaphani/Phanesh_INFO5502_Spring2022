background 
daley was born in kingston,jamaica,in,and came to the united states at the age of fifteen as a lawful permanent resident.in,daley was indicted in new york for possession of a loaded firearm and bail jumping.after he served a sentence,ins initiated removal proceedings on january,pursuant to section a of the immigration and nationality act which allows removal of any alien convicted of certain firearm offenses.
at daley initial appearance before the ij in february,he was granted additional time to find a lawyer.a preliminary hearing was eventually scheduled for september.in may,however,daley was arrested and arraigned in the eastern district of new york on federal robbery charges under the hobbs act.daley pled guilty on august,but that conviction did not become final until march.
during the summer of because of his hobbs act arrest daley was held without bail at the metropolitan detention center mdc in brooklyn.at daley request,his girlfriend notified the ins that he was in custody at the mdc and submitted a form on his behalf.it was received by ins and listed daley full name,alien registration number,and bureau of prisons number,clearly indicating that daley was now residing at the mdc in brooklyn.
ins somehow misplaced or mishandled this form.presumably because he was not informed of the date,daley failed to appear for his september hearing before the ij.at the hearing,ins suggested that daley might be incarcerated,and the ij adjourned to permit ins counsel to determine daley whereabouts.daley did not appear at the subsequent hearing on october,and ins wrongly informed the ij that daley was not in federal or state custody.the ij ordered daley removed in absentia.
daley was subsequently sentenced to months imprisonment for his hobbs act conviction,and upon completing that sentence in january,he was deported to jamaica.within a year,daley returned to the united states.
in february,daley was again time for allegedly threatening his wife in brooklyn.as a result of that arrest,immigration authorities learned of daley unlawful presence in the united states.a grand jury indicted daley in the eastern district of new york for illegal reentry after deportation,in violation of a,b.
daley moved to dismiss the indictment pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure and d.daley argued,pursuant to d,that it would be fundamentally unfair to rely on the removal order to establish an element of the illegal reentry offense because the removal order was entered in violation of his due process rights.
at a november evidentiary hearing on daley motion to dismiss the indictment,marguerite mills,assistant chief counsel for immigration and customs enforcement,testified as follows concerning ins policy in place at the time if the ij had been notified of daley hobbs act guilty plea on the day of daley removal hearing october,the ij would have administratively closed the case until the hobbs act conviction became final and after the conviction became final,the ij could have reopened the case,denied daley any discretionary relief including cancellation of removal,and ordered him removed.
in response,daley relied almost exclusively on united states scott,cir,arguing that the district court should not consider future occurrences when determining whether entry of the removal order was fundamentally unfair.id.at.
the district court denied daley motion from the bench,on the ground that the failure of notice did not prejudice daley because he would not have been granted cancellation of removal on october.the district court carefully distinguished scott i not looking at future occurrences.i looking at what had occurred at the time of the hearing and it what distinguishes scott.in other words if i am going to look at all of the relevant factors at the time of the hearing,then you lose.tr.of mot.hr g,at,app.the district court explained further 
t he temporal limitation of scott deals with a crime that committed after that hearing.if you wanted to consider what happened,all the relevant information as of the date of the hearing and the relevant information includes his guilty plea for which he was ultimately sentenced,and then the question becomes he would have gotten relief.at most,they would have put off the hearing but he probably would have gotten relief based on the admission that he made that he committed hobbs act extortion 
id.at app.in short,the district court found no reasonable probability that daley would have been granted relief had he been present at the hearing,thus he was not prejudiced,and could not dismiss his indictment for illegal reentry under section d.id.at app.
daley thereafter entered a conditional plea to illegal reentry,preserving his right to appeal the denial of the motion to dismiss.on may,the district court sentenced daley to months imprisonment.after the district court issued its judgment,daley timely appealed the denial of the motion to dismiss the indictment.
discussion 
daley appeal turns on a single issue whether the district court properly determined that there was no reasonable probability that daley would have obtained relief had he been notified of his removal proceeding.before analyzing this issue in light of united states scott,cir,we review the relevant legal standards applicable in these circumstances.
the question whether the district court properly denied daley motion to dismiss the indictment is a mixed question of fact and law,subject to de novo review.united states fernandez antonia,cir.we review the district court factual findings for clear error.united states cerna,cir.
section d places limits on an alien ability to collaterally attack a removal order when seeking to dismiss an indictment for illegal reentry.in relevant part,section d provides 
in a criminal proceeding under this section,an alien may not challenge the validity of the deportation order unless the alien demonstrates that 
the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order 
the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review and 
the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair
