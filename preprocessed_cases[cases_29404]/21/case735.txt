this is an appeal by the government contesting the sentence imposed by the district court on gary milo.milo was arrested in for trafficking in marijuana.he thereafter agreed to plead guilty and assist the government in pending investigations.the government in turn agreed,subject to getting substantial cooperation,to file a motion for a reduced guideline sentence,and a sentence below the mandatory minimum,e.
on april,milo pled guilty to a sealed information alleging conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute marijuana in violation of.the information described milo role in heading a marijuana distribution operation in massachusetts,spanning four years and involving kilograms or more of marijuana.forfeiture of milo proceeds from the operation was sought as well.
as is common in such cases,sentencing was deferred while milo assisted investigators.in may,the cooperation having been completed,the probation officer prepared the report,and the government filed its promised motion.the psr found milo accountable for over kilos of marijuana it found that the conspiracy had been an extensive one involving five or more participants and it found that milo himself had directed at least two individuals to transport marijuana or drug proceeds.it also noted that while under supervision milo had tested positive for cocaine on one occasion.
milo,born in,was described in the psr as having been brought up in an upper middle class home,although it said that he had suffered some abuse.he was married,had attended but not graduated from college and had learned building design from his father.he had a builder license and a realtor license and had worked in both fields and estimated his income apart from drugs at a year.his estimated net worth slightly exceeded million.
the psr calculated the mandatory minimum sentence as years,b a vii,and the guidelines range as to months.the calculation reflected a base offense level of premised on the kilos and no prior criminal history.an upward adjustment for role in the offense matched an equal reduction for acceptance of responsibility.b.milo objected that the kilo amount was overstated the probation officer said that it did not affect the calculation.
in its promised motion,the government described milo cooperation in a number of different investigations.the government moved both for relief from the mandatory minimum,e,and from the otherwise applicable guideline sentence,and proposed to recommend a sentence of months,approximately half of the guideline minimum as calculated by the probation officer.
letters were submitted by those who knew milo.they described him with detailed examples as a caring and decent person,helpful to others set forth his work since his arrest for habitat for humanity and other charitable endeavors attested to his contrition expressed confidence that he would never repeat his crime and,in many cases,expressed hope that he would not have to serve time in prison.
at sentencing,milo experienced counsel said he had seen few examples of such complete remorse and urged that milo be given no time in prison.the prosecutor agreed that milo had done a great job and helped the government in significant and important ways.but,she said,milo had brought thousands of pounds of marijuana into the district over a number of years,and months was a generous reduction from the ordinary guideline sentence.
after milo spoke,expressing contrition and saying that he had sought to turn his life around,the district court said that it would accept defense counsel recommendation.the judge referred without elaboration to milo extraordinary cooperation and the force of the letters in the record and said that the days already spent by milo in detention and the prospect of a very large forfeiture yet to be computed counted as punishment.
the court then sentenced milo to time served,five years of supervised release with the first six months to be served in a community corrections facility,and a fine of.thereafter,in denying a government motion for reconsideration,the district court rejected any suggestion that the government should have been surprised by the sentence and elaborated on what the court said was already in the record before the sentencing hearing 
the sentencing concerned the extraordinary nature of milo cooperation as described in the government presentation.but it also concerned the extent to which milo had changed his life,the steps he had taken in his work,steps which effectively increased the amount of money the government was likely to recover on forfeiture,and his exemplary work with habitat for humanity.
in discussing the government objections,the court said that the milo sentencing was about contrition as well as cooperation that many defendants bargain and cooperate as a kind of business arrangement but that milo was genuinely remorseful and had changed his life addressing his addictions,working for habitat for humanity.the court referred briefly to the large forfeiture judgment expected.it agreed with defense counsel that milo was someone who the court will never see again.
the government has now appealed to this court,arguing primarily that the sentence is unreasonably low specifically,that the district court sentenced a major marijuana dealer to an term of imprisonment even though milo participated in an extensive drug conspiracy yielding him almost million.the government also attacks various of the district court statements in support of the sentence as without support or resting upon factors not properly considered.

the government says that it is of no moment whether the proper guideline sentencing range was as the district court said or as the psr found either range calls for a sentence and,without a motion,the statutory mandatory minimum would be years the sentence imposed amounts to almost no time in prison.the main question posed by the government appeal is the adequacy,given circumstances and the court explanation,of such a sentence for a major drug crime that is ordinarily heavily punished by a sentence of to years.
three subsidiary government arguments warrant brief attention.the first is that the district court improperly relied on the large forfeiture order ultimately million,which by statute must be imposed in addition to any other sentence imposed.a emphasis added see also.but the statute does not say that the forfeiture can never be considered by the district court in determining the overall sentence,and here the forfeiture was calculated on estimated proceeds not profits and so has punitive characteristics.
at the same time,one could hardly give the forfeiture in this case much weight.given his net worth of million,milo may never be able to pay the full forfeiture.and if milo had independent means,avoiding a prison sentence on this account would create an appearance that financially successful criminals can buy their way out of prison.see united states mueffelman,cir united states tom,cir.the district court did not rely heavily on the forfeiture,mentioning it only briefly,and we see no error in the district court apparent decision to afford some minor weight to it.
second,the government argues that the district court gave undue emphasis to milo charitable activities.these are a discouraged factor under the sentencing guidelines which provide military,civic,charitable,or public service contributions and similar prior good works are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a departure is warranted.the government does not claim this reliance to be impermissible but merely to contribute to the unreasonableness of milo sentence.
again,the district court did not place much weight on these activities to justify by themselves a low
