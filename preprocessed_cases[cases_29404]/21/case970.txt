appellant carlos participated in a carjacking,recklessly drove the stolen vehicle against traffic on a crowded street,and eventually struck and killed a police officer.after being charged in a indictment,he pled guilty to one count of aiding and abetting an armed carjacking that resulted in death in violation of.the district court sentenced him to life imprisonment.he now appeals his sentence,arguing that the district court misapplied several provisions of the united states sentencing guidelines.we affirm.
because appellant was sentenced following a guilty plea,w e distill the facts from the plea colloquy,the undisputed portions of the presentence investigation report and the transcript of the disposition hearing.united states brewster,cir.we summarize the facts in this section and recount additional facts in subsequent sections where appropriate.
on june,at about,miguel was driving past the service window of a wendy restaurant in mayagüez,puerto rico.three heredia,david nuñez,and appellant carlos martinez approached car.heredia forced at gunpoint to surrender his vehicle,and martinez ordered him to throw himself on the ground.the three assailants then drove off at a high rate of speed.the police were soon informed of the crime and received a description of the stolen car.
at about,a commonwealth motorcycle police officer saw the car driving on comercio street in downtown mayagüez and followed it.the three assailants noticed the officer pursuing them and,with martinez at the wheel,attempted to escape.during the pursuit,nuñez threw two guns out the window of the car,one of which was later recovered by the commonwealth police.
two additional commonwealth and william the pursuit in a patrol car.they made a on comercio street and stopped their vehicle.officer exited the patrol car and began to stop oncoming traffic.martinez drove the stolen vehicle approximately sixty miles per hour down the wrong side of comercio is,against the flow of toward officer.although martinez had sufficient time to stop or change the direction of his vehicle,he did not do so.instead,he struck and killed officer,then lost control of the car and struck two civilian vehicles before the stolen car finally came to a stop.martinez,nuñez,and heredia were apprehended shortly thereafter.
on july,a grand jury handed down a indictment against martinez.at his arraignment in august,martinez pled not guilty to all three counts.in april,however,he agreed to plead guilty to count one aiding and abetting the taking of a vehicle by force,which resulted in the death of officer in exchange for his guilty plea on count one,the government agreed to request dismissal of counts two and three the parties did not enter into any agreement regarding the application of the sentencing guidelines,except that the government agreed to support a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to 
the presentence report recommended,pursuant to c the robbery to the first degree murder guideline,that martinez receive a base offense level of.it also recommended the following adjustments a upward adjustment pursuant to because the victim was a government officer a upward adjustment pursuant to for reckless endangerment during flight from a law enforcement officer a upward adjustment pursuant to for obstruction of justice and a downward adjustment pursuant to for acceptance of responsibility.the adjustments resulted in a total offense level of.at the sentencing hearing on september,the district court adopted the recommendations in the presentence report and applied a total offense level of.under the guidelines sentencing table,that total offense level requires a punishment of life imprisonment.see ch.pt.
on appeal,martinez argues that the district court misapplied the guidelines as a matter of law first,he argues that the district court improperly applied a base offense level of.second,he contends that the district court imposition of both an upward adjustment for obstruction of justice and a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is inconsistent.finally,he argues that the district court engaged in impermissible double counting by imposing both an upward adjustment because the victim was a government officer and an upward adjustment for reckless endangerment during flight from law enforcement.we review de novo the district court legal interpretation of the guidelines.see united states talladino,cir.
a.the base offense level 
c provides that,in the case of a robbery 
if a victim was killed under circumstances that would constitute murder under had such killing taken place within the territorial or maritime jurisdiction of the united states,apply first degree murder.
this section,which explicitly applies to robbery,also applies to carjacking.see united states,cir per curiam,cert.denied sub nom.united states,d.provides in relevant part murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.every murder committed in the perpetration of robbery is murder in the first degree.finally,mandates a base offense level of for first degree murder.
martinez argues that c is inapplicable in this case because martinez did not kill officer in the perpetration of robbery,but rather during his flight from pursuing authorities.this argument is unavailing.in interpreting,the carjacking statute that applies when serious bodily injury results,we have noted that congress intended to cover a fairly broad range of consequences flowing from a carjacking,and concluded that the injuries covered include those caused by the carjacker at any point during his or her retention of the vehicle.united states,cir.applying this principle to,which is parallel to in all pertinent respects,a death results from a carjacking if that death was caused at any point during the carjacker retention of the vehicle.therefore,the conduct to which martinez admitted in his plea satisfied the elements of.
however,the fact that covers a death incurred during flight does not end our inquiry for sentencing purposes.the offense guideline for is robbery,and the offense level must be calculated under that guideline.the to first degree murder applies only if the requirements of murder are met while it may seem intuitive that a death that results from a carjacking is also committed in perpetration of the carjacking,the analyses are formally distinct because they depend on interpretation of different statutes.moreover,it is possible that a death might meet the standard of result ing from a carjacking while not the potentially higher standard of being committed in perpetration of that carjacking.
we have held repeatedly that the law of this circuit is that the commission of a carjacking continues at least while the carjacker maintains control over the victim and his or her car,at alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted united states,cir,cert.denied,d,at.but those cases all involved injury to the victim of the carjacking itself,not to third parties.indeed,the exact language of and is that the commission of a carjacking continues at least while the carjacker maintains control over the victim and her car.in this case,martinez had relinquished control over the carjacking victim some minutes before the police chase began,let alone the fatal crash 
the problem of applying the felony murder doctrine to a death caused,not to the victim of the predicate robbery during its course,but to someone else during subsequent flight,has arisen in state law more often than under.for example,in people kendrick,cal d,the defendant robbed a store and drove away,unpursued,at about seventy miles per hour.some time perhaps as much as minutes later he was stopped by a traffic officer.the defendant mistakenly believed the officer intended to arrest him for the robbery,and shot the officer.id.at.the california court concluded that the homicide could properly be viewed as committed by defendant in an endeavor to effect an escape.id.at.this conclusion followed from the nature of robbery as a crime that inherently involves flight 
robbery,unlike burglary,is not confined to a fixed locus,but is frequently spread over considerable dista
