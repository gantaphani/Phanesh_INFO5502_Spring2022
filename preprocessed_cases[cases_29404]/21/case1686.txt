these three appeals,which we have consolidated,present the same question were the state court decisions affirming petitioners extended sentences under new york persistent felony offender statute,penal law,contrary to,or an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states d.the relevant supreme court ruling to which the petitions refer is apprendi new jersey,d,which ruled that in order for a sentence to comply with the dictates of the sixth amendment,a factual finding that drives a sentence above the otherwise applicable statutory maximum penalty other than the fact of a prior conviction must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt,or be admitted by the defendant.we hold it was not unreasonable,in light of supreme court precedent,for the state courts to conclude that a sentencing judge opinion as to what type of sentence would best serve the public interest is not a factual finding within the meaning of apprendi.we accordingly reverse the judgments granting writs of habeas corpus in brown and rosen,and affirm the judgment denying the writ in ramos.
background 
i.the new york persistent felony offender statute 
petitioners nelson brown,harry rosen,and betsy ramos,in their separate prosecutions,were each sentenced to extended sentences under new york persistent felony offender statute,penal law.under that statute,each received a longer sentence than new york law would otherwise have permitted.new york law designates two classes of persistent felony offenders persistent violent felony offenders,and persistent felony offenders.a person convicted of a violent felony,after two prior convictions for violent felonies,is deemed with certain exceptions a persistent violent felony offender and is subject under penal law to a mandatory extended sentence.section,which applies to the defendants in this case,provides that a person,other than a persistent violent felony offender,who stands convicted of a felony after having previously been convicted of two or more felonies is a persistent felony offender subject to certain qualifications relating primarily to the nature of the prior offenses,the sentences the defendant received for them,and whether imprisonment for the prior offenses began prior to the commission of the present offense.if the sentencing court is of the opinion that the history and character of the defendant and the nature and circumstances of his criminal conduct indicate that extended incarceration and supervision will best serve the public interest,id,such an offender may be sentenced for the new felony offense as if it were a class felony,notwithstanding the statutory penalty ordinarily provided for the crime committed determinations under this section are made after a hearing conducted under criminal procedure law.for class felonies,new york law imposes an indeterminate sentence with a mandatory minimum of fifteen or years,and a maximum of life imprisonment.see penal law a,a i.
ii.the facts of the cases 
nelson brown 
petitioner nelson brown was convicted,following a jury trial,of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree,in violation of penal law.the prosecution stemmed from a gun fight that resulted in the accidental shooting of a.the jury acquitted brown of all other charges.
criminal possession of a weapon ordinarily carries a maximum sentence of seven years.see penal law d.brown,however,was charged under as a persistent felony offender.at his persistent felony offender hearing,brown conceded that he had two predicate felony convictions.after receiving evidence,the court sentenced brown under,as if he had been convicted of a class felony,to an indeterminate term of fifteen years to life imprisonment.in imposing the sentence,the judge expressed reluctance and some regret that no middle ground existed between the maximum sentence that would otherwise apply and sentencing brown to fifteen years to life as if he committed an felony.
brown appealed,challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction and the sentencing court failure to state on the record with sufficient specificity the reasons why it imposed a persistent felony offender sentence.on january,the new york supreme court,appellate division,held that brown had failed to preserve his claim for appellate review and,in the alternative,that the evidence was legally sufficient to establish brown guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.the appellate division,however,vacated and remanded for resentencing because the sentencing judge had failed to record the reasons for sentencing brown as a persistent felony offender.people brown,leave to appeal denied,table.at resentencing,the trial court elaborated on its reasons and again sentenced brown,as if an felony offender,to fifteen years to life imprisonment.
brown appealed from the reimposed sentence.in the meantime,the united states supreme court decided apprendi.brown argued that his sentence violated apprendi,but the appellate division dismissed this argument as without merit.people brown.brown was denied leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals on august.people brown,table.
brown then petitioned in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york for a writ of habeas corpus under.the district court john gleeson,denied several of his claims,but granted the writ of habeas corpus,concluding that brown persistent felony offender sentence violated apprendi.brown greiner,d.the state then brought this appeal 
harry rosen 
petitioner harry rosen was convicted,following a jury trial,of sexual abuse in the first degree,in violation of penal law,and endangering the welfare of a child,in violation of penal law.the convictions resulted from his sexual abuse of a while riding next to her on a subway car.
sexual abuse ordinarily carries a maximum sentence of seven years see penal law d.rosen was charged as a persistent felony offender under.at his persistent felony offender hearing,rosen conceded that he had been previously convicted of two predicate felonies.the court received evidence concerning rosen psychiatric condition,his extensive history of abusing children,his own history of being abused as a child,and the impact of the crime on the victim family.the court sentenced rosen under the persistent offender statute,as if convicted of a class felony,to an indeterminate term of years to life in prison on the sexual abuse count,with a concurrent sentence of one year on the child endangerment count.
the appellate division affirmed rosen conviction on december.people rosen.rosen was granted leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals,and while his appeal was pending,the supreme court decided apprendi.rosen then argued for the first time before the new york court of appeals that the increase in his sentence beyond the otherwise applicable maximum,based on the sentencing judge findings under the persistent felony offender statute,violated his sixth amendment right to a jury trial.
the court of appeals rejected rosen argument.people rosen,cert.denied,d.the court examined the statutory provision which allows a court to sentence a defendant as if for a class felony if it is of the opinion that the history and character of the defendant and the nature and circumstances of his criminal conduct indicate that extended incarceration and supervision will best serve the public interest.penal law.the court concluded 
it is clear from the foregoing statutory framework that the prior felony convictions are the sole determina nt of whether a defendant is subject to enhanced sentencing as a persistent felony offender.then,the court must consider other enumerated factors to determine whether it is of the opinion that a persistent felony offender sentence is warranted.as to the latter,the sentencing court is thus only fulfilling its traditional due consideration to determining an appropriate sentence within the permissible statutory range.
rosen,at,at,at internal citations omitted.the court thus concluded that the only necessary to the imposition of an enhanced persistent felony offender sentence is of prior convictions and is excluded from the apprendi rule.as for the sentencing court opinion that extended incarceration will best serve the public interest,the court of appeals deemed this conclusion to be not the kind of covered by the apprendi rule,but rather a sentencing assessment of the sort traditionally reserved to the sentencing judge.
after discussing the apprendi issue,the court considered the mode of proceedings exception to the rule against considering unpreserved issues on appeal.the exception allows appellate consideration of certain fundamental errors despite the absence of a timely objection,but is limited to those errors going to the very organization of the court or at such basic variance with the mode of procedure mandated by law that they impair the essential validity of the criminal proceedings.people voliton,see also people ahmed,people kinchen,people patterson,people mclucas.
the court of appeals found that the exception did not apply because rosen had not demonstrated entitlement to a jury trial to establish the only facts necessary to the imposition of his persistent felony offender,the existence of his prior convictions.the court therefore found no fundamental defect in the proceedings and concluded that rosen failure to object before the sentencing court barred him from raising his apprendi claim for the first time on appeal.rosen,at,at,at.
the united states supreme court denied rosen petition for a writ of certiorari on october.rosen new york,d.rosen then filed a petition for habeas corpus relief in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.the district court alvin hellerstein,granted the writ of habeas corpus for substantially the reasons given by judge gleeson in brown.see rosen walsh,civ.july.the state then brought this appeal.
betsy ramos 
petitioner betsy ramos was convicted,following a jury trial,of manslaughter in the second degree,in violation of penal law assault in the second degree,in violation of penal law and obstructing governmental administration in the second degree,in violation of penal law.the jury acquitted ramos on related charges of murder in the second degree.the charges stemmed from a struggle in which ramos boyfriend shot and killed a police officer executing a bench warrant for his arrest.
manslaughter ordinarily carries a maximum sentence of fifteen years.see penal law c.ramos,however,was charged as a persistent felony offender.at her persistent felony offender hearing,ramos conceded that she had been previously convicted of four predicate felonies.the court received evidence of ramos history of drug addiction and of the impact of the officer death on his family.the court sentenced ramos as a class felony offender to an indeterminate term of fifteen years to life on the manslaughter count,with concurrent terms of seven years on the assault count and one year on the obstruction of governmental administration count.
after her sentence,the supreme court decided apprendi.on ramos appeal to the appellate division,she raised an apprendi claim for the first time.the appellate division affirmed.citing the disposition of the court of appeals in rosen,the appellate division held that ramos had failed to preserve her apprendi claim for appellate review.people ramos.ramos was denied leave to appeal to the new york court of appeals on november.people ramos,table.
ramos filed a petition for habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.the district court nicholas garaufis,denied ramos petition as procedurally barred by reason of ramos failure to preserve her objection in the new york courts.ramos lord,october.ramos then brought this appeal.
iii.the rule of apprendi 
apprendi involved an enhanced sentence under new jersey law,which authorized imposition of an extended sentence of ten to twenty years for offenses if the sentencing judge determined that t he defendant in committing the crime acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race,color,gender,handicap,religion,sexual orientation or ethnicity.at.quoting stat.ann.e west,repealed by sess.law serv.west,reenacted as amended,stat.ann.the defendant in apprendi had fired several shots into the home of an family,which had moved into an neighborhood.id.at.the sentencing judge found that the defendant had committed the crimes with a biased purpose and accordingly sentenced him to twelve years for a firearm offense normally carrying a five to term.id.at.the supreme court held that it was unconstitutional for the sentencing judge to sentence above the otherwise applicable statutory maximum based on the judge factual finding as to the defendant intent at the time he committed the crime.the rule formulated by the court was that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.
the fact of a prior conviction exception avoided a conflict between apprendi and united states,d.pleaded guilty to reentering the united states without permission following his deportation,in violation of.id.at.section a provides for a maximum sentence of two years,but b authorizes a maximum sentence of twenty years if the prior deportation was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.admitted that his three aggravated felony convictions preceded his deportation,but argued that his sentence was unconstitutional because the indictment had failed to allege the existence of those convictions,at.the supreme court rejected this argument on the ground that prior convictions function as a sentencing factor,rather than a statutory element,and therefore do not need to be alleged in the indictment.
discussion 
petitioners contend new york persistent offender statute violates the requirements of apprendi because it authorizes the sentencing judge rather than the jury to find facts that increase the sentence beyond the maximum otherwise provided by law for the particular offense and does not require a finding beyond a reasonable doubt.see apprendi,at.they focus on the sentencing judge determinations concerning the history and character of the defendant and the nature and circumstances of the offense,as well as on the conclusion that an extended sentence will best serve the public interest.petitioners contend that these determinations are factual findings,which increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum,and under apprendi,therefore,must be submitted to the jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.see apprendi,at.
the state submits three arguments in opposition.first,the state contends that habeas review is precluded,at least in the cases of rosen and ramos,because the state court decisions rejecting their claims rested on an independent and adequate state procedural ground.see coleman thompson,d.second,it argues that under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,the governing standard in this case is not whether the state courts correctly interpreted apprendi,but whether their interpretation was reasonable at the time.see d.the state argues that the new york courts did not apply apprendi unreasonably in concluding that the sentencing judge may make the determinations upon which persistent felony offender sentencing turns.this is because prior felony offenses are expressly excluded from the apprendi rule,and the sentencing court further determination that extensive imprisonment would best serve the public interest is not a factual finding in the sense intended by apprendi,but rather an appraisal of the defendant and the defendant crime in relation to the objectives of evaluation characteristically made by the sentencing judge.finally,the state contends that the new york courts did not apply apprendi unreasonably in light of the supreme court express refusal to overturn walton arizona,d,until its subsequent decision in ring arizona,d.we reject the first argument,agree with the second,and therefore have no need to evaluate the third.
