the district court weinstein,denied the defendant motion to suppress testimony from the customs and border patrol cbp officer who questioned her without miranda warnings on her arrival at john kennedy international airport.we reject the district court reasoning that either a general exception to miranda for border questioning exists or that the officer intent in posing the questions is relevant.but,based on the totality of the circumstances,we conclude that the defendant was not in custody during the questioning and so miranda warnings were unnecessary.accordingly,we affirm the defendant conviction.
background 
the defendant,traveling under the name sandra calzada,arrived at john kennedy international airport in new york on december,on a flight from the dominican republic.in preparing to process the passengers from this flight,cbp officer frank umowski ran the flight manifest through a database of outstanding warrants and received notice that calzada name appeared on a new york police department arrest warrant.umowski verified that the date and place of birth of the person on the warrant matched that listed on the passport for the passenger and flagged calzada for secondary inspection.upon arrival,an armed guard escorted her to the secondary inspection room,which,umowski concedes,she was not free to leave,and umowski questioned her.
she presented a passport in the name of sandra calzada.he asked her her name,her citizenship,and where and when she was born.she responded sandra calzada,citizen,puerto rico,and gave a date of birth matching the passport.he asked if she had ever been arrested she said no.he took her fingerprints,which failed to match those in the nypd warrant.after a brief computer search,he found her passport application,which requested renewal of a passport,and determined that the application contained the same photograph and information as the passport the defendant presented.he then examined the application,which bore a photograph that he thought depicted someone else.umowski confronted her with that older photograph,and she said she did not recognize the person pictured.
umowski again questioned the defendant about her name and background,including her parents and siblings,this time using a translator.she responded that she had one brother,whereas the passport application listed only one sister.she was unable to recall any addresses where she had lived in puerto rico.in total,the questioning lasted for about minutes.umowski then delivered the defendant to another officer,to whom she gave a sworn statement cbp deemed her inadmissible at that time and held her over for a hearing with an immigration judge.at some later time,different federal agents arrested her on an indictment for making a false statement in a passport application,misusing a passport,id.and aggravated identity theft,id.a c.
in the district court,the defendant moved in limine to suppress her statements to umowski,whom the government had slated as a trial witness,because he failed to provide her with the prophylactic warnings required by miranda arizona.the district court held a hearing and found miranda inapplicable to this situation.it first held that miranda warnings are not required where a person is questioned in a routine border crossing inquiry.united states fnu lnu,cr,dist.lexis,at.it further explained that miranda warnings were unnecessary because it believed umowski testimony that his purpose was to verify if the defendant,in fact,was admissible into the as a citizen.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the court also explained that the interrogation constituted routine border questioning because umowski function or intent was only to determine the defendant true identity.id.it therefore denied the motion.
umowski and the translator testified at trial.the government also presented testimony from the real sandra calzada,who testified that when she had been a cocaine addict,she had sold her passport,birth certificate,and social security card to her drug dealer.she had presented two different stories to the authorities before the one she told at trial and testified pursuant to a nonprosecution agreement covering her passport offenses,her cocaine offenses,and a more recent state shoplifting charge.a state department agent,eric donelan,testified that the defendant possessed a receipt for the passport renewal and a social security card in the name sandra iris calzada.he also testified that her boyfriend had brought the canceled passport,which bore her picture,to the airport after her detention and that her boyfriend had provided cbp with a birth certificate matching the information on both passports.finally,the government called a department of homeland security document expert,wayne laptosh,who testified that the passport had been altered.
the defendant presented no affirmative case,and the jury convicted her on all three counts.the district court sentenced her to months imprisonment,three years of supervised release,and the mandatory special assessment.the defendant timely appealed,challenging only the district court suppression decision.
discussion 
this case presents the question of whether the district court correctly ruled that officer umowski questioning failed to rise to the level of a custodial interrogation under miranda and thus whether that court properly admitted into evidence the defendant statements to umowski.though we generally review a district court evidentiary decisions for abuse of discretion,united states quinones,cir,we review decisions on suppression motions de novo,in re terrorist bombings of embassies in afr.odeh,cir.we may,however,uphold the district court ultimate decision on any ground supported in the record.united states green,cir.
an interaction between law enforcement officials and an individual generally triggers miranda prophylactic warnings when the interaction becomes a custodial interrogation.this determination has two parts a there must be an interrogation of the defendant,and b it must be while she is in custody.see cruz miller.cir recognizing custody and interrogation as separate elements of the miranda determination accord united states ali,cir.neither the government nor the district court suggests that umowski direct questioning of the defendant fails to qualify as an interrogation.an interrogation consists of express questioning or its functional equivalent,which aptly describes the interaction between umowski and the defendant.rhode island innis,under standard miranda analysis,the only issue in the instant case would be whether the defendant was in custody during the interrogation.the government,however,urges that an altogether different analysis should apply in the context of questioning at the border we take up this contention first.
though accepting that miranda applies when the questioning constitutes custodial interrogation,the government insists that r outine border questioning does not constitute custodial interrogation for miranda purposes.appellee br.indeed,it claims there exists a routine border questioning exception to miranda,dating back several decades and undisturbed by developments in fifth amendment law.id.at.this exception stems,it asserts,from the government broad powers to detain,search,and question individuals even absent any reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing at border entry points.id.at.in support of this argument,the government relies primarily on three cases tabbaa chertoff,cir,united states silva,cir,and united states rodriguez,cir.we address each case in turn.
relying on tabbaa,the government contends that border questioning requires miranda warnings only when it becomes.tabbaa rejected a fourth amendment challenge to a series of border searches involving pat downs,fingerprinting,photographing,and questioning lasting several hours.at.under fourth amendment case law,routine border searches fall within a exception to the warrant requirement.the term routine delineates the exception scope,thus explaining the term significance in this line of jurisprudence.see,united states montoya de hernandez,routine searches of the persons and effects of entrants are not subject to any requirement of reasonable suspicion,probable cause,or warrant united states martinez fuerte,authorizing warrantless,suspicionless stops for brief questioning routinely conducted at permanent checkpoints near the border.
but supreme court precedents establish no similar exception to miranda prophylactic requirement under the fifth amendment.pennsylvania muniz,adopting an exception to miranda for routine booking question s new york quarles,recognizing a limited exception to miranda harris new york,holding that statements that were otherwise inadmissible due to a miranda violation were admissible to impeach the defendant trial testimony.
similarly,tabbaa says nothing about miranda or the fifth amendment,and,indeed,as we have previously said,whether a stop was permissible under fourth amendment doctrine is irrelevant to the miranda analysis.ali,at.though tabbaa provides a useful guide for delineating the boundaries of routineness as that word is used in the specific context of fourth amendment warrantless border searches,its usefulness outside that context is inherently limited.united states irving,cir discussing the routine bordersearch exception to the fourth amendment and noting that the level of intrusion into a person privacy is what determines whether a border search is routine.tabbaa does not speak to the primary question we face here does a exception to the requirement of miranda warnings whether limited by routineness or not exist at all.accordingly,tabbaa is of little help to the government here.
the government argues,however,that silva establishes just such a exception for our circuit.it is silva,also,that forms the core of the district court decision admitting the evidence in this case.in silva,the defendant was convicted of making a false statement to a federal official and of attempting to bring a large sum of currency into the country without declaring it.at.after initial questioning at the canadian border during which the defendant claimed to be a citizen,an immigration agent searched her purse,in which he found her venezuelan passport and a bundle of currency.id.at.customs officials then asked her additional questions about the currency,which led to establishing her criminal conduct id.noting that the questioning amounted to no more than routine customs and immigration inquires,we held that the officers questioning of the defendant at the border was permissible.id.at.critically,in so holding,we rejected the defendant argument that she was entitled to miranda warnings as soon as any agent had probable cause to arrest her,that is,as soon as they discovered her venezuelan passport after she had claimed to be a citizen.id.at.
to reach this conclusion,we distinguished a prior case,united states moody,cir,in which we had held that customs agents erred in failing to give miranda warnings to a suspect once they saw her carrying what appeared to be drugs that is,at the moment probable cause arose for her arrest.her response was elicited for the purpose of incriminating her and miranda applied.id.at.
the silva court reasoned in two steps.first,it separated the fact that immigration agents had probable cause to arrest the defendant on the false statement offense as to which no challenged questions had been posed from the issue of whether customs agents had probable cause to suspect a crime with respect to the currency.silva,at.then,it found that the customs agents acted properly in questioning her about the currency because transporting currency unlike transporting drugs,as in moody is not inherently illegal and,therefore,creates no automatic suspicion of criminal wrongdoing.id.in all this,the court continued to focus on whether the agents thought they had probable cause to believe a crime was being committed as the key to determining whether the situation consisted of routine customs and immigration inquiries.id.at.because the inquiries were routine,it concluded,miranda warnings were not required.
on appeal,as she did also below,the defendant argues that reliance on silva is misplaced because a series of later supreme court cases,most notably berkemer mccarty,and stansbury california,have undercut its bases and,therefore,its current validity.berkemer involved a traffic stop during which the officer elicited incriminating statements from the suspect.in concluding that the traffic stop,though a seizure,failed to implicate the coercive aspects of stationhouse interrogation that animated miranda,and thus failed to constitute custody,the court rejected the contention that the officer unarticulated plan to arrest the suspect had any bearing on the determination of custody.at.the motive of the questioner was thus deemed irrelevant similarly,in stansbury,a man considered a witness rather than a suspect accompanied police to their stationhouse for questioning.during the course of that questioning,police began to suspect him of having committed the crime,ceased the interview,and read him the miranda warnings.at trial he moved to suppress his statements.the trial court denied the motion and the california supreme court affirmed,reasoning that the interrogation became custodial only when suspicion focused on the defendant.at.the court remanded the case for reconsideration,explicitly stating more than once that the officer subjective beliefs about whether the interviewee was a suspect were irrelevant to the miranda determination.id.at.
together,these and subsequent supreme court cases establish that the test for when miranda warnings are mandated is objective with respect to the personal attitudes and knowledge of both the questioner and the person questioned.it depends on how a reasonable person in the suspect position would view the situation.see,stansbury,at our decisions make clear that the initial determination of custody depends on the objective circumstances of the interrogation,not on the subjective views harbored by either the interrogating officers or the person being questioned.to the extent that silva and moody rely on the officer subjective motives for the interrogation including the uncommunicated existence of probable cause or intent to arrest in determining whether the interaction qualifies as custodial,we agree with the defendant that berkemer and stansbury abrogate them.this does not mean,however,that silva does not remain important and,indeed,binding on us in some particulars that do not depend on its reliance on the subjective intent of the questioner.specifically,silva holding with respect to the a routineness of the b questioning c at the border,remains our circuit law and distinguishes our approach from both the third circuit in united states kiam,cir,and the first circuit in united states ventura,cir,discussed infra.
rodriguez,the final case on which the government relies,has little bearing on this case.there the defendant,while incarcerated on unrelated state charges,submitted to an interview with a federal immigration officer.no miranda warnings were given.the defendant responses during that interview established that his presence in the united states was unauthorized and,on his release from state custody,the federal government deported him.a year later,he returned to the united states and was arrested at the airport while attempting to enter the country illegally.at his trial for unauthorized reentry and visa fraud,the immigration agent testified regarding the defendant nationality,based on the interview.at.the trial court denied the defendant motion to suppress this evidence pursuant to miranda,and we affirmed.
to begin with,the rodriguez court precise holding evades easy discernment.in rodriguez,we found both a that rodriguez interrogation did not require a miranda warning and b that sufficient other evidence existed to render harmless any error in admitting the agent testimony.id.at.furthermore,we have generally treated the issue of whether questioning requires miranda warnings differently depending on whether the suspect was already incarcerated on unrelated grounds at the time of the interrogation.see,united states willoughby,cir holding that though the defendant incarceration was undeniably custody in the colloquial sense,the con
