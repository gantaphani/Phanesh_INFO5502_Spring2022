the principal question presented is whether,in the circumstances of this case,the imposition of sentencing enhancements under both u.b and b b based on the same underlying conduct transferring firearms with reason to believe they would be used in felony offenses constituted clearly prohibited by the united states sentencing commission the sentencing commission.
liddon young contends that imposing both sentencing enhancements did constitute such prohibited,and on that basis appeals a july,judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york frank geraci,judge sentencing him principally to a term of imprisonment of fifteen years.young further argues that the district court erred by applying a sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice under,refusing to apply an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under,failing to consider his arguments in support of a downward departure and a variance,and imposing a substantively unreasonable sentence.
we find no error in the district court decision not to expressly discuss and reject young arguments for a downward departure and a variance.we conclude,however,that the district court application of the sentencing adjustments was in error.specifically,on the facts presented here,the district court imposition of a sentencing enhancement under b b constituted clearly prohibited by the sentencing commission,and its rulings on adjustments under and were not supported by the requisite factual findings.thus,without reaching young argument,we affirm his sentence insofar as it rests on the district court rejection of his arguments for a downward departure and a variance insofar as the sentence rests on the district court application of sentencing enhancements under b b and and its denial of an adjustment under,we remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
background 
on may,young was indicted for his role in a scheme that involved the unlawful distribution of firearms.without the benefit of a plea agreement,he entered a plea of guilty to three firearms violations 
prior to sentencing,a probation officer interviewed young to assist in preparing a presentence report.in discussing his offense conduct,young told the probation officer that he never sold guns to known drug dealers and had no reason to think that the guns he distributed would be used in connection with felony offenses.he also told the probation officer that he never dealt in firearms before meeting an individual named paul davis in.the probation officer concluded that young was likely being untruthful on both points.
the district court held a hearing to determine whether young had lied to the probation officer about his conduct.at the hearing,davis testified that he met young in,at which time young was already engaged in the illegal sale of firearms.according to davis,he and young developed a business relationship.the two would meet in atlanta,where young would sell guns to davis,eight to ten at a time.davis would bring the guns to rochester to sell them.davis made up to four such trips.between davis trips and direct sales to other customers,young sent between and fifty guns including ak,mac,and tec rochester.
according to davis,he and young discussed their customers early in their relationship.when davis made his first trip northward,young inquired about who might purchase the guns in rochester.davis told young he planned to sell to two cocaine and marijuana dealers.young told davis to be careful.
young also spoke with davis about young preexisting customers.he disclosed that he was selling firearms to his cousin,a rochester cocaine dealer named reggie or reginald.at one point,young gave davis three firearms to deliver to this cousin.
an individual named reggie bullock the cousin reggie known to davis also testified.he told the court,contrary to davis testimony,that young had never provided him with a gun.but he also testified that he was a cocaine dealer and that he had once seen young sell three guns,including a tec,to a person young knew to be bullock primary source of drugs.young also took the stand,testifying that he never sold to anyone he knew to be a drug dealer and had not engaged in trafficking prior to meeting davis.
following the hearing,judge geraci articulated factual findings on the record.he recognized that all three witnesses had reason to fabricate testimony.but he credited davis statement that young had provided him with guns to deliver to young cousin reggie,a drug dealer.he also credited davis testimony that young had been engaged in firearms dealing before the two met.judge geraci declined to credit young testimony that he did not know reggie bullock to be in the drug business.based on the testimony described above and his credibility determinations,judge geraci concluded that young had had reason to believe that the weapons he transferred would be used or possessed in connection with other felony offenses.he also concluded that young had lied to the probation officer who prepared the presentence report regarding his knowledge,intent or reason to believe that the weapons he sold would be used in connection with another felony offense and in telling the officer that he had not illegally sold firearms prior to meeting davis.judge geraci accordingly imposed sentencing enhancements under b b for transferring a firearm with reason to believe it would be used in connection with another felony and for obstruction of justice he also ruled that,in light of his application of the obstruction enhancement,an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under was unavailable.
these rulings,combined with young base offense level of,two enhancements young does not challenge on appeal and a criminal history category of iii,initially yielded a united states sentencing guidelines guidelines calculation of months.the bottom of this range,however,exceeded the year statutory maximum thus,young guidelines sentence was years.see united states dorvee,cir.
prior to sentencing,young requested that the district court depart downward because his category significantly overrepresented the seriousness of his criminal past,and vary from the guidelines range based on such factors as his difficult upbringing,his close relationship with his family,and the need to avoid unwarranted disparities in sentencing the court did not explicitly address the arguments made in connection with these requests and sentenced young principally to a term of fifteen years imprisonment.
on appeal,young argues that the district court erred by imposing a sentencing enhancement under b b the enhancement imposing a sentencing enhancement under the obstruction enhancement declining to apply a sentencing adjustment under the adjustment failing to explicitly address young arguments in support of a downward departure and a downward variance and imposing a substantively unreasonable sentence.
there was no error in the district court decision not to expressly discuss and reject young arguments for a downward departure and a variance.nothing in the record suggests that judge geraci misunderstood his authority to depart downward,and in imposing the sentence he plainly considered the relevant factors under a.we conclude,however,that the district court erred in imposing the and obstruction enhancements and in declining to apply the adjustment.on this basis we vacate and remand for resentencing.in light of this disposition,we need not and do not reach young argument that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.
discussion 
we review sentences under a deferential standard.gall united states.we must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.united states tutty,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although a district court is not required to impose the sentence,the court is nonetheless normally required to calculate the sentencing range that the guidelines recommend.united states carr,cir.
we also review sentences for substantive reasonableness,reversing only when the trial court sentence can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.tutty,at internal quotation marks omitted.in reviewing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence,we take into account the totality of the circumstances,giving due deference to the sentencing judge exercise of discretion,and bearing in mind the institutional advantages of district courts.united states chu,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we do not presume that a guidelines sentence is necessarily substantively reasonable.united states messina,cir.
if a sentence is tainted with procedural error,we may remand to the district court for resentencing without proceeding to a substantive review of the original sentence,or,where circumstances warrant,we may review for both procedural error and substantive unreasonableness in the course of the same appeal.tutty,at internal citations omitted.
requests for downward departure variance 
young requested that the district court depart downward because his category overrepresented the seriousness of his criminal past,see b,and that the court vary from the guidelines range based on a number of factors relevant under a.he contends that the district court erred by not formally ruling on his requests and failing to discuss his arguments during sentencing.we disagree.
a district court decision not to depart downward is within the court broad discretion and rarely reviewed on appeal.united states scott,cir.a district court is not obliged to give reasons for refusing to depart,and,where a defendant has not shown a violation of law or misapplication of the guidelines,refusal to depart warrants vacatur only if the defendant point s to clear evidence of a substantial risk that the judge misapprehended the scope of his departure authority.id.internal quotation marks omitted.a district court silence concerning its refusal to depart downward,generally,does not support an inference that the district court misapprehended its scope of authority.id.in this case,young offers no reason why we should suppose that the district court misunderstood its authority to depart,and we do not think it did.the court was merely silent on the point.
nor need a district judge imposing a sentence recite every a argument advanced by a defendant.rather,we presume that the judge properly considered the sentencing factors even in the absence of protracted discussion pertaining to each of the factors and all of the defendant contentions.united states brown,cir united states fernandez,cir,abrogated on other grounds by rita united states.here,young identifies nothing in the record suggesting that judge geraci failed to consider the a factors or his arguments in support of a variance,and indeed the record shows that judge geraci appropriately discharged his obligations under a.see,app.discussing the factors enumerated in a.we accordingly reject this argument.
ii.b b other felony offense enhancement 
section b b provides for a enhancement if the defendant u sed or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.b b.young challenges the application of this enhancement on three separate grounds.he argues,first,that the district court clearly erred in crediting davis testimony that young gave him a gun to deliver to young cousin,a drug dealer named reggie second,that even if that testimony were credited,the evidence adduced at the hearing did not support a reasonable inference that young had reason to believe the firearms he distributed would be used in connection with other felonies and third,that applying the enhancement constituted impermissible.
young first argument is easily dispatched.the district court decision to credit davis testimony,even in the face of contrary testimony from bullock,is entitled to substantial deference.united states norman,cir.it was reasonable not to believe the testimony from bullock,who had cause to lie about having received guns from young.indeed,young himself suggests elsewhere in his brief that bullock testimony was not credible.we have no reason to disturb the district court credibility determination 
young second argument is no more convincing than his first.the district court specifically found that young unlawfully sold a large number of unusually dangerous weapons ak and tec to people he knew to be drug dealers.that is sufficient to support an inference that he had reason to believe the guns would be used in connection with other felonies.see united states martin,cir affirming application of enhancement based on defendant sale of a large number of easily concealable handguns in unusual circumstances.
young final argument,however,has merit.he contends that applying the enhancement constituted impermissible because the district court also applied a enhancement under b for trafficking in firearms.he is correct 
simple applying more than one guidelines enhancement based on the same conduct is unobjectionable,and indeed commonplace.united states maloney,cir.but is impermissible if the guidelines instruct against it.see united states morris,cir rejecting argument because the defendant offered nothing in the sentencing guidelines or relevant statutes reflecting an intent to preclude the double counting the district court employed.
we conclude that the relevant guidelines provisions and application notes indicate that the sentencing commission intended to preclude application of the enhancement in the circumstances of this case.when a defendant receives a sentencing enhancement for trafficking in firearms under b,application note d to prohibits imposition of an enhancement under b b based on the defendant transfer of a firearm with reason to believe it will be used in another felony offense.
we begin with the text of b b.the enhancement applies if a defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense or possessed or transferred any firearm or ammunition with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.b b.the provision thus consists of two clauses,each of which describes a different set of circumstances.the first clause the clause concerns defendants who use or possess firearms in connection with another felony offense.the second the clause concerns defendants who possess firearms,or transfer them to others,with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe that they will be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.the district court concluded that this second clause applied to young conduct it found that he had knowledge,intent,and reason to believe that the weapons he transferred would be used in connection with other felonies,drug trafficking.
young also received a enhancement under b,which applies if the defendant engaged in the trafficking of firearms.b.application note a to describes what is meant by trafficking of firearms,explaining that the enhancement applies if a defendant 
i transported,transferred,or otherwise disposed of two or more firearms to another individual,or received two or more firearms with the intent to transport,transfer,or otherwise dispose of firearms to another individual and 
ii knew or had reason to believe that such conduct would result in the transport,transfer,or disposal of a firearm to an individual 
i whose possession or receipt of the firearm would be unlawful or 
ii who intended to use or dispose of the firearm unlawfully.
application note d describes the interaction of the trafficking enhancement with the enhancement.it states that if the trafficking enhancement applies,the enhancement also applies i f the defendant used or transferred one of such firearms in connection with another felony offense,an offense other than a firearms possession or trafficking offense,application note d emphasis supplied.
these provisions,read together,preclude application of the enhancement to young.the district court found that young had knowledge,intent,and reason to believe that the guns he transferred would be used in connection with other felonies.in the normal run of things,that is a valid reason to apply the enhancement.but when the trafficking enhancement also applies,as it does in this case,application note d limits the application of the enhancement to those situations in which the defendant used or transferred one of such firearms in connection with another felony offense,incorporating language from the clause set forth in b b emphasis supplied.see note,ante.no mention is made of situations like this one in which the defendant transferred a firearm not in connection with another felony offense,but with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe it would later be used in connection with another felony offense,which would have incorporated language from the clause set forth in b b.
the omission of such an application compels the conclusion that the application of the enhancement is limited to the situations specifically addressed in application note d.put another way,by expressly mentioning one application of the enhancement and conspicuously leaving out the other,the sentencing commission said clearly by negative implication,to be sure,but clearly that when the trafficking enhancement applies,a sentence may be enhanced under the clause but not under the clause.see vkk football league,cir to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of the other alteration and internal quotation marks omitted united states ortega,cir relying in part on the canon expressio unius est exclusio alterius to hold that a guidelines provision stating that p rior sentences are to be counted in the criminal history score,including uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where imprisonment was not imposed implicitly excluded from the computation uncounseled misdemeanor sentences where imprisonment was imposed emphasis in original internal quotation marks omitted.the application note text is,in our view,very much the equivalent of that which the concurrence concedes would prohibit here an express provi sion stating that an additional enhancement under b is permissible only when trafficking occurs in connection with a felony.concurring.accordingly,we conclude that transferring a firearm with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe it will be used in connection with another felony can not support an enhancement in a case where the trafficking enhancement also applies.
as is clear from the analysis above,however,transferring a firearm in connection with another felony offense can support a b b enhancement in trafficking cases.one might argue particularly in view of the broad definition of in connection with set out in application note a that transferring a firearm with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe it will be used in connection with another felony,without more,can be characterized as transferring a firearm in connection with that other felony.but it is not plausible to read in that fashion.if the phrase in connection with another felony offense in application note d includes the concept of transferring a firearm with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe it will be used in connection with another felony offense,the phrase presumably embraces the same concept where it is used in b b.mertens hewitt,identical language appearing in two places in the same statute should be given the same meaning in each instance united states potes castillo,cir ordinary principles of statutory construction apply to guidelines provisions and their explanatory commentary.but if that is so,the second,clause in b b does no work at all.the sentencing commission could have reached the same substantive result by stopping after the first,clause.we accordingly reject this reading of the provision.see united states aleynikov,cir a statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions,so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous,void or insignificant.
our construction of yields a sensible result in light of the sentencing commission apparent concern in this particular instance with.the trafficking enhancement applies in situations among others in which a defendant transfers two or more firearms to another person with reason to believe that that person intends to use the firearms unlawfully,application note a.but for application note d,such conduct would also support application of the enhancement pursuant to the clause,provided the transferee intended to use the firearms not just unlawfully but in connection with another felony.thus,application note d avoids the simultaneous application of two provisions likely in many circumstances to punish the same behavior 
in sum,we conclude that application of the enhancement to young constituted impermissible.accordingly,the district court erred in imposing the enhancement,and we must vacate and remand for resentencing 
iii.obstruction of justice enhancement 
young next argues that the district court erred in applying an enhancement for obstruction of justice under.we agree.
section provides for a enhancement if the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice with respect to the sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,and the obstructive conduct related to a the defendant offense of conviction and any relevant conduct or b a closely related offense.covered conduct includes providing materially false information to a probation officer in respect to a presentence investigation,application note h.it is essential that a court applying this enhancement make a finding that the defendant had the specific intent to obstruct justice,that the defendant consciously acted with the purpose of obstructing justice.united states brown,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it is not sufficient merely to find that the defendant made materially false statements concerning his offense conduct.united states bradbury,cir.
here,the district court found that young made two materially false statements to the probation officer that he did not know he was selling guns to drug dealers,and that he did not traffic in guns before meeting davis.on this basis it imposed the enhancement.the government specifically requested that the court enter a finding that in making those false statements,young had the intent to obstruct justice.app.judge geraci replied that there was no need to articulate young motivation in speaking falsely only to find that the statements were materially false.app.but there was such a need material falsity is not enough to support application of the enhancement.bradbury,at.
the government argues that a finding of specific intent to obstruct justice is not necessary when a defendant has clearly lied in a statement made under oath.united states lincecum,cir internal quotation marks omitted.when the clearly false statement was made under oath,the court need only point to the obvious lie and find that the defendant knowingly made a false statement on a material matter.id.internal quotation marks omitted.but here,the false statements the district court identified were not made under oath.they were made during an interview with a probation officer.app.t his court finds that there sufficient evidence that the defendant obstructed the administration of justice by providing false statements to the probation officer.accordingly,the rule of lincecum does not apply.
we do not mean to imply,of course,that the district court could not have found on this record that young specifically intended to obstruct justice,or that the district court could not have imposed the enhancement based on young sworn testimony without making such a finding.but those determinations are for the district court in the first instance.we leave them for its consideration on remand.
iv.acceptance of responsibility enhancement 
even without making a finding that young specifically intended to obstruct justice,the district court could reasonably have concluded that he was not entitled to an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under.but in refusing to apply the adjustment,the court seems to have relied significantly,perhaps exclusively,on application note to,which reads conduct resulting in an enhancement under obstructing or impeding the administration of justice ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.there may,however,be extraordinary cases in which adjustments under both provisions may apply,application note see app.based upon the court finding that young provided material ly false statement s to the probation officer who was conducting the presentence investigation,this is conduct that inconsistent with the defendant acceptance of responsibility,and the court finds that there are no extraordinary circumstances that would justify the defendant receiving a three step reduction.
thus,it appears that the district court,having imposed the obstruction enhancement,declined to adjust downward for acceptance of responsibility because no extraordinary circumstances justified the application of both adjustments.in other words,the court ruling on the adjustment was premised on its ruling on the obstruction enhancement.the latter having been made in error,the former must fall with it,and application of the adjustment considered on remand.
substantive unreasonableness 
because we vacate young sentence and remand for resentencing on the basis of procedural error,we need not,and do not,consider his argument.see tutty,at where there is procedural error,we may remand to the district court for resentencing without proceeding to a substantive review of the original sentence.
conclusion 
in sum,we hold that there was no error in the district court decision not to expressly discuss and reject young arguments for a downward departure and a variance.but we also hold that the district court application of the enhancement b b constituted impermissible clearly prohibited by the guidelines,and that its rulings concerning the obstruction enhancement and the adjustment were not supported by the necessary factual findings.in light of these holdings,we do not reach young argument that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.we thus remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
i agree with the majority resolution of virtually every issue on appeal,including the challenged enhancement under united states sentencing guideline.even the ultimate outcome reached by the majority on the double counting issue under b,b b,and application note d is sensible.but i am not convinced that these provisions unambiguously work in tandem to preclude application of the enhancement to liddon young as impermissible double counting.because the provisions,and the intended effect of application note d in particular,are in my view ambiguous,i would invoke the rule of lenity to uphold young challenge to the enhancement.as to that issue,therefore,i concur in the judgment.
we have suggested that double counting is impermissible only when the applicable guideline or statute reflects an intent to preclude the application of two or more enhancements in a single sentence.see united states reyes,cir d efendant has not pointed to any passage of either the guidelines or a statute that reflects a legislative intent to preclude the application of both the enhancement and a n adjustment in a single sentence.united states morris,cir holding that a s long as the court does not augment a sentence in contravention of the applicable statute or sentencing guideline,no forbidden double counting occurs,and concluding that d efendant has offered nothing in the sentencing guidelines or relevant statutes reflecting an intent to preclude the double counting the district court employed,and has therefore not shown any impermissible double counting quotation marks omitted united states vizcarra,cir summarizing second circuit precedent as such but see united states maloney,cir allowing double counting where that is the result clearly intended by congress and the sentencing commission.this presumption in favor of double counting rests on the commission general endorsement of the cumulative application of multiple adjustments in application note a to guideline.
the majority advances a narrow textual analysis of b,b b,and application note d and concludes that the application of the enhancement constituted impermissible clearly prohibited by the guidelines.as the majority reads application note d,if b applies,then the application of b b is plainly confined to those cases in which at least one of the firearms was transferred directly in connection with another felony offense.under this view,the enhancement under b b does not apply when the trafficker only has reason to believe that the firearms would facilitate another felony offense and the tie between the trafficking and the separate felony offense is weaker.
as an initial matter,young never advanced this analysis on appeal or before the district court,and the government has had no opportunity to rebut it.setting that obstacle aside,however,there are three reasons to be somewhat skeptical of the majority analysis.
first,the language of application note d does not clearly limit the application of b b.instead,the note refers exclusively to the in connection with language that appears in b when explaining the circumstances in which double counting must or,as the application note phrases it,would occur.had the application note further expressly provided that an additional enhancement under b is permissible only when trafficking occurs more directly in connection with a felony,that language would plainly foreclose,as impermissible double counting,an additional enhancement under the reason to believe prong of b.but application note d does expressly preclude double counting under the reason to believe prong of b b it certainly does do so with the clarity that we come to demand before concluding that the commission intended to preclude double counting.see,united states leung,cir relying on an application note that makes clear the commission intention with express language indicating that it would prevent double counting of offense behavior quoting c,cmt.n.
in fact,the immediately preceding sentence in application note d appears to explicitly endorse double counting in a similar context.it instructs sentencing judges to apply both subsections b and b i n a case in which three or more firearms were both possessed and trafficked.subsection b is the trafficking enhancement,while subsection b applies i f the offense involved three or more firearms.following that sentence,it is entirely possible that the commission intended that both enhancements also would apply assuming their respective criteria are satisfied in a case in which the transfer of firearms facilitated another nonfirearms felony.
had the commission actually intended to preclude double counting in this context through application note d,it presumably would have also referred to subsection b a,which applies to a defendant who transferred a firearm with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe that it would be transported out of the united states,or continued to refer generally to subsection b,and not amended the note to refer only to subsection b b.the commission added prong a to b in order to ensure that we treat that conduct in the same way that we treat the conduct now described in the second clause of subsection b b.see sentencing guidelines manual app.c,amend.likewise,possessing or transferring a firearm with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe that it would be transported out of the united states is conduct sufficiently similar in seriousness to possessing or transferring a firearm with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense to warrant similar punishment.in doing so,the commission cited united states juarez,cir,in which the fifth circuit affirmed the application of both b and b enhancements to the same conduct,namely,the transfer of firearms with reason to believe that they would be illegally smuggled into mexico.the commission stated purpose in amending b and its reliance on juarez cast doubt on the majority suggestion that the commission intend
