the appeals in this criminal case raise two questions of first impression in this circuit.the first asks whether the statute doubling the maximum available penalty for drug distribution in close proximity to a youth center,see a,creates an independent substantive offense or,instead,operates merely as a factor.we conclude that this statute does create an independent offense.we also conclude,however,that the evidence offered at trial was insufficient to support convictions for that offense.
this tees up the second novel question,which asks whether,notwithstanding that the evidence was insufficient to ground convictions under section a,the defendant can be held to account on a lesser included offense theory under a.we answer this question in the affirmative.
after dispatching the remainder of the defendant asseverational array,we vacate the convictions and sentence under section a,order the entry of convictions under section a,and remand for resentencing.at the same time,we affirm a related criminal forfeiture judgment.the tale follows.
travel of the case 
from to,tomás sepúlveda hernández was the marijuana supplier to,and a of,an open air drug market in la trocha ward,vega baja,puerto rico.this drug point was located in close proximity to a public basketball court.
in december of,a federal grand jury indicted the defendant,along with others,on charges stemming from the distribution of marijuana and crack cocaine.for reasons that need not concern us,the crowd thinned and the defendant stood trial alone.following ten days of trial,a jury found the defendant guilty of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute at least grams of crack cocaine and at least kilograms of marijuana count,see a drug distribution,conspiracy,as well as aiding and abetting in the distribution of at least kilograms of marijuana count,see aiding and abetting.on a special verdict form,the jury indicated that the culpable activities described in counts and took place within feet of a private or public youth center intended primarily for use by persons under years of age.the jury also found against the defendant on a related criminal forfeiture count count.see a.the district court elevated the defendant offense level in light of the jury finding that drug sales had occurred in close proximity to a youth center,see ussg a imposed a month incarcerative sentence and set the forfeiture amount at.
these timely appeals followed.in them,the defendant mounts a wide variety of challenges to his convictions,his sentence,and the forfeiture judgment.we examine these challenges sequentially.
ii.sufficiency of the evidence 
the defendant asserts that the government evidence was insufficient in two respects.he argues,first,that the proof failed to establish that the drug point operated within feet of a youth center.he argues,second,that the government failed to prove that he had any role at all in the conspiracy.
we review preserved sufficiency challenges de novo.see united states gobbi,cir.in conducting our inquiry,we examine the evidence in the light most agreeable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence,including all plausible inferences extractable therefrom,enables a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.united states ortiz de jesús,cir internal quotation mark omitted.we will uphold a conviction as long as the jury verdict is supported by a plausible rendition of the record.united states ortiz,cir.
a.the charged crimes.
the charges in this case conspiracy and aiding and abetting implicate a,which provides that any person who commits certain crimes within feet of a public or private youth center shall be subject to twice the maximum punishment otherwise authorized.the term youth center is defined as any recreational facility gymnasium including any parking lot appurtenant thereto,intended primarily for use by persons under years of age,which regularly provides athletic,civic,or cultural activities.id.e.the defendant concedes that the drug market described by the government was within feet of a public basketball court,but he insists that the government failed to prove that the facility was intended primarily for use by minors.
as a threshold matter,the parties wrangle about the quantum of proof required to establish proximity to a youth center.the defendant posits that section a creates an independent substantive offense,so that proximity to a youth center is an element of that crime that must be proven to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states goodine,cir explaining that elements of crimes must be proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.the government demurs.it posits that proximity to a youth center is simply a factor that must only be proven to the judge by preponderant evidence.see id.explaining that sentencing factors may be found by the judge under a preponderance standard.
the distinction between substantive crimes and sentencing factors can often be enigmatic.in any given case,however,this distinction boils down to a question of statutory interpretation.
in interpreting the statute at issue here,we do not write on a pristine page.no fewer than ten of our sister circuits have grappled with the same question,and all of them have concluded that section a creates an independent substantive offense,not merely a factor.see united states osborne,cir collecting cases.we have been unable to find and the government has not cited any contrary circuit court precedent.
in our view,the consensus position is correct.a statute ought to be read as a whole.see fda brown williamson tobacco corp,shalala,cir.here,subsection d of section states that persons convicted under this section are only under certain circumstances.similarly,subsection b discusses the effects of a prior conviction under subsection a.it would be strange for congress to describe a person as having been convicted under a sentencing factor and we do not think that congress indulged such an awkward locution here.thus,we maintain the unanimity of the courts of appeals and hold that section a creates an independent substantive offense.
given this holding,our task is to plumb the record to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to allow any rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the basketball court near the drug market was intended primarily for the use of minors.the government evidence on this point is distressingly vague.it includes the testimony of a longtime resident that different people,children would go there to play,young people,old people,adults.it also includes the testimony of a municipal official who recounted that the court is made available for basketball tournaments and other community uses.neither piece of evidence speaks to whether the facility was intended primarily for the use of minors.
in an effort to fill this void,the government relies on several surveillance videos of controlled drug buys,which show a few children and young people among many others in the background.the government reliance is mislaid it defies reason to think that this video evidence has the capacity to prove that the basketball court was intended primarily for the use of minors.
words in a statute have consequences.p rimarily means essentially mostly chiefly principally.the random house dictionary of the english language ed.it follows,we think,that congress did not intend for drug sales at specific locations to trigger sharply increased penalties simply because minors happen to be in the vicinity of a particular facility from time to time.
in this case,the government has not offered a shred of evidence that the municipality either constructed or maintained the basketball court chiefly or principally for the enjoyment of minors.nor has it produced even a scintilla of evidence that the court regular use was mainly or mostly by minors.given this paucity of proof,the inference that the government asks us to draw is insupportable.
in a rumpel stilts effort to turn dross into gold,the government lauds the decision in united states lee,app x cir per curiam.there,the court upheld a youth center proximity finding with respect to drug distribution near the teen youth center in midland,texas.see id.at.the court discussion of the issue comprises only two sentences.it states that there was uncontroverted and unchallenged testimony that the center was a youth center where children played basketball.id.at.that is far removed from the record here a record that contains neither evidence of the municipality intent to create a facility that might qualify as a youth center nor evidence quantifying or even estimating the extent to which the basketball court was used by minors.
that ends this aspect of the matter.the government has the burden of establishing every element of a charged crime,see united states spinney,cir,and carrying that burden requires more than hopeful supposition laced with a large dose of conjecture.because the evidence here falls woefully short of establishing that the basketball court was intended primarily for the use of persons under the age of,the defendant convictions under section a can not stand.
b.the lesser included offense.
our next task is to gauge the repercussions attendant to vacating the section a convictions.the government asks that we direct the court below to enter convictions for lesser included offenses conspiring with,and aiding and abetting,the drug distribution enterprise in violation of section a a statute that does not include the element of proximity to a youth center the defendant resists the entry of such an order.
congress has given the courts of appeals authority to affirm,modify,vacate,set aside or reverse any judgment and direct the entry of such appropriate judgment as may be just under the circumstances.the courts of appeals have readily embraced the sensible practice of using section as a vehicle for entering lesser included offense convictions.see rutledge united states,discussing practice united states romano,cir similar.
the existence of this authority,however,does not give the courts of appeals free rein.to determine whether the circumstances of a particular case create an environment suitable for the exercise of section authority,the courts have developed a test.see,rutledge,at allison united states,per curiam.although this court has not yet had the occasion to speak to this test,we hold today,as have many of our sister circuits,see,united states rojas alvarez,cir united states dhinsa,cir united states smith,cir allison,at see also united states petersen,cir applying modified version of test,that the test provides the proper analytic framework in a section inquiry.
we synthesize the teachings of the case law.the test demands an inquiry,first,into whether the trial evidence fails to support one or more elements necessary to the conviction.if not,further inquiry is unwarranted.if,however,this first step is satisfied,we proceed to ask,second,whether the trial evidence is sufficient to sustain each and every element of a different offense third,whether that different offense is a lesser included offense of the offense of conviction and fourth,whether any injustice or unfair prejudice will inure to the defendant by directing the entry of a conviction for the lesser included offense.we administer this test here.
in the case at hand,the first and third factors need not detain us.as to the first factor,we already have concluded that the evidence is insufficient to establish the youth center proximity element of a section a offense.see supra part ii a.as to the third factor,it is plain that a section a violation is a lesser included offense of section a because the elements of the former are a subset of the elements of the latter.see united states jones,cir united states jackson,cir united states carpenter,cir united states kakatin,cir united states parker,cir united states freyre lazaro,cir see also united states fenton,cir agreeing with parties concession on point.
the second factor requires consideration of whether the evidence would clearly support a conviction under section a.the defendant does not gainsay the drug market operation but,rather,asserts that no credible evidence establishes that he played any part in the conspiracy.
to counter this assertion,the government relies principally on the testimony of a trio of cooperating coconspirators sonia ortiz,luis camacho,and roy román de jesús.each of these individuals worked at the drug point in some capacity,and each testified extensively about its operations.the three coconspirators identified the defendant as a marijuana supplier to,and a of,the drug point.unless there is some basis for disregarding it,this evidence suffices to defeat the defendant claim of evidentiary insufficiency.
the defendant contends,though,that this inculpatory testimony is not creditworthy.he argues that these witnesses had little or no personal knowledge of his role in the business but,rather,simply parroted what they had heard from others.for example,ortiz testified that jimmy figueroa,another coconspirator,told me that the defendant is still the owner of the drug point.similarly,camacho testified that ortiz and some pushers at the drug point had spoken to him about the defendant leadership role in the ring.other examples abound.
the district court admitted the disputed statements into evidence after conducting a careful inquiry under united states petrozziello,cir it confirmed that each statement was made by a coconspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.see.d e united states piper,cir.the defendant neither challenges the court petrozziello determinations nor articulates any plausible rationale for disregarding those carefully compiled findings.the challenged testimony was,therefore,not hearsay and admissible for the truth of the matter asserted pursuant to the dictates of rule d e.see united states sánchez berríos,f d,cir ortiz,at.
undaunted,the defendant makes the curious argument that,even if this testimony was not excludable as hearsay,it rested on rumor and,thus,was insufficiently reliable to warrant a guilty verdict.this argument lacks force.within wide limits,not approached here,it is the jury role not the role of an appellate court to determine the weight to be given to a witness testimony and to assess the witness credibility.see united states luna,cir united states,cir.thus,even the uncorroborated account of a single coconspirator can ground a conviction if credited by the factfinder.see,united states meises,cir united states torres galindo,cir.
in this instance,the record contains the accounts of not one but three participants in the conspiracy,all of whom incriminate the defendant.the testimony of each of these witnesses corroborates the others testimony.the record also contains circumstantial evidence tending to support an inference of the defendant participation in the drug trade,such as his possession of a money counting machine and the presence of secret compartments in his car.
to say more on this point would be supererogatory.sustaining a conviction requires only that,eschewing credibility judgments and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict,a rational jury could have found the defendant guilty based on the proof presented.united states sepulveda,cir.measured against this benchmark,the evidence here supports a finding of the defendant guilt with respect to both conspiracy to commit and aiding and abetting drug distribution simpliciter.
this leaves only the fourth component of the test.that factor is satisfied because,in the circumstances of this case,the defendant would not be unfairly prejudiced by an order holding him responsible for a lesser included offense.after all,references to section a are featured prominently in the indictment,and all of the elements of a section a charge are encompassed within a section a charge.it follows that the defendant had notice of those elements and both opportunity and incentive to defend against them see smith,at.
here,moreover,the defendant fully availed himself of that opportunity.he vigorously contested many of the common elements of the charge,including the government allegations as to his role in the unlawful drug distribution enterprise.the defendant offers no plausible reason to believe that his defense would have been materially different had the indictment focused on section a rather than on section a.
to cinch matters,the special verdict form yields steadfast assurance that the jury must have found facts beyond a reasonable doubt on all the elements needed to convict for the lesser included offense.we conclude,therefore,that the entry of a conviction under section a would not work any injustice.see rojas alvarez,at vacating conviction under section a and directing entry of lesser included offense conviction under section a parker,at same smith,at same.
this brings us full circle.because every aspect of the test has been satisfied here,we vacate the convictions to the extent that they embody a finding of proximity to a youth center section a and direct the entry of convictions for conspiracy and aiding and abetting with respect to the distribution of drugs simpliciter section a.
iii.alleged trial errors 
the defendant advances three claims of trial error.we address these claims separately.
alleged prosecutorial misconduct.
the defendant avers that the prosecutor frustrated the fairness of his trial by making improper head and eye movements during witness testimony,objecting indiscriminately during defense counsel opening statement and closing argument,and employing an inappropriate analogy during rebuttal.preserved claims of prosecutorial misconduct are reviewed de novo.see united states ayala garcía,cir.unpreserved claims are reviewed only for plain error.see sánchez berríos,at see also united states duarte,cir limning plain error standard.here,however,this distinction is academic because we discern no error,plain or otherwise.
we begin with the defendant allegation that the prosecutor nodded her head and used eye movements to indicate agreement while cooperating witnesses were testifying,thus simultaneously leading and vouching for them.it is a baseline rule that a prosecutor may not place the prestige of her office behind the government case by,say,imparting her personal belief in a witness veracity.united states pérez ruiz,cir.and eye movements,such as are alleged here,theoretically can cross this line and can constitute improper vouching.see,united states collins,cir united states bermea,cir.coaching witnesses through,say,and eye movements is different than vouching but using gestures for that purpose is equally improper.see,united states casas,cir.
the problem here is that the defendant made no contemporaneous objections to any instances of supposed vouching or coaching.while he twice voiced accusations of this sort to the district court,he waited on each occasion until days after the challenged conduct allegedly occurred.these objections were too little and too late,and the record contains no evidence that any or other inappropriate gestures ever occurred.
although this absence of record evidence is enough to defeat the defendant claim,there is more.when the defendant voiced his belated objection for the second time,the trial judge an astute and experienced jurist stated that she had been keeping an eye on everyone and had not observed any impropriety.the defendant has offered us no sound reason for that assessment.
the defendant next complains that the prosecutor tainted the trial by objecting ten times during his counsel opening statement and seventeen times during his counsel closing.although constant,overzealous,and unwarranted objections may unfairly impair a defendant right to a fair trial,united states young,explaining that interruptions of arguments are matters to be approached cautiously,we are unable to find any misconduct here.most of the objections about which the defendant complains were either sustained by the court or elicited clarifications.the rest seem well within the pale.counsel should not be held to standards of perfection,united states polito,cir explaining that a criminal defendant is entitled to a fair trial,not necessarily a perfect trial,and the failed objections here do not seem so groundless as to be vexatious.
the defendant caterwauling about the prosecutor chosen analogy fares no better.the government case was built largely on the testimony of three relatively coconspirators who identified the defendant as a of the drug point.during the trial,the defendant attempted to undercut this testimony by stressing that the cooperating witnesses had little or no personal contact with him.in her final rebuttal argument,the prosecutor rejoined by likening the defendant to the chief executive officer of a large,bank though ordinary branch employees may not ever see the chief executive officer filling up the atm machines,they still know that he is the boss.
although the defendant now argues that this analogy was inapt,he did not object to it at trial.in this instance,the prosecutor analogy was not perfect indeed,few analogies are but it effectively conveyed to the jury the possibility that employees can have knowledge about an organization leadership without having any personal interaction with the leader.we discern no prosecutorial misconduct 
b.the jencks claim.
we turn now to the defendant claim that,despite a timely request for disclosure,the government failed to produce certain materials,in violation of the jencks act.the materials comprise dea reports of witness interviews compiled by the drug enforcement administration dea.
the jencks act obliges the government,once a witness has testified,to proffer upon a defendant timely request any statement of that witness in its possession,whether or not exculpatory,that relates to the subject matter of the witness testimony.see id.b see also united states colón díaz,cir united states neal,cir.the statute defines statement to include,in addition to an adopted writing of the witness or an exact recording of an oral pronouncement,any recording or transcription which amounts to a substantially verbatim recital of a witness oral statement.e see united states gonzalez melendez,cir per curiam.we review preserved claims of jencks error for abuse of discretion,see colón díaz,at,mindful that a material error of law invariably constitutes an abuse of discretion,see united states snyder,cir.
during the trial,the defendant made several requests for jencks material.those requests,however,were not limited to jencks material but simultaneously sought material potentially useable for impeachment giglio material,see giglio united states.these combined requests focused on the dea reports,including those created following government interviews of the three testifying coconspirators.
the trial judge,tramping down a path,see palermo united states,conducted a careful in camera review of the dea reports.she ordered disclosure of two reports,presumably as giglio material,which contained potential contradictions of a government witness testimony.she refused to order production of the remaining reports,impliedly finding that those reports did not constitute jencks material.the defendant challenge is addressed to this implied finding no giglio challenge is advanced.
we discern no abuse of discretion in the district court refusal to order production of the dea reports under the jencks act.we have examined the dea reports that were preserved for appellate review,and we find them to be narrative summaries prepared by dea agents.they are not substantially verbatim witness accounts.we therefore conclude,as did the fifth circuit when confronted with a group of dea reports,that the reports withheld are not jencks material at all but,rather,short,concise,summaries of the witnesses version of the facts as recounted to the agents.united states weintraub,cir internal quotation mark omitted.jencks only inures to statements that can fairly be said to be the witness own rather than the product of the investigator selections,interpretations,and interpolations.palermo,at.the dea reports at issue here do not pass through this screen.
multiplication evidence.
the defendant argues that the district court erred in admitting certain aspects of the testimony of a forensic chemist called by the government.the chemist,after being qualified as an expert,testified as to the average weights of marijuana contained in the small and large bags habitually sold at the drug point.the defendant presses no objection to this testimony.
there was evidence,apart from the chemist testimony,that at least bags of each size were sold at the drug point every day over the life of the conspiracy.using this evidence as a foundation,the prosecutor asked the witness to perform some basic multiplication.this included multiplying the weight that the witness had ascribed to a typical small bag by representing daily sales,multiplying the weight ascribed to a typical large bag by representing daily sales,multiplying each of those subtotals by representing days in a year,and then multiplying each of those subtotals by nine representing years of operation.the government elicited this testimony in an apparent effort to estimate how much marijuana had been sold over the life of the conspiracy.
the defendant first objection is that this evidence had a tendency to mislead or confuse the jury because the underlying sales volume and years of operation were in dispute.although the defendant does not specifically invoke federal rule of evidence,his argument seems to be that any probative value that the evidence might have had was substantially outweighed by its capacity to mislead or confuse the jury.
appellate review of district court rulings admitting or excluding evidence under the aegis of rule starts with a recognition that a trial judge is in the best position to assess the collateral effects of proffered testimony.see united states raymond,cir.only rarely and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances will we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.united states pires,cir quoting freeman package mach,cir.
the record here offers no reason for disturbing the district court rule determinations.the foundational evidence relied on by the government was in the record.although these facts were not gospel it remained for the jury to decide whether to accept or reject them the direct examination was carefully phrased so that the chemist,by doing the requested multiplication,was not vouching for components such as how much business was transacted at the drug point or how long the conspiracy lasted.and the defense was free to build its own theory,asking the chemist on to multiply by smaller numbers or fewer years.it did not exploit this opportunity.
the defendant has another string to his bow he argues that the multiplication evidence was incorrectly admitted as rule expert testimony.this argument,too,is futile.
the defendant posits that the testimony was outside the chemist field of expertise and,thus,outside the scope of rule.but the evidence rules do not distinguish between expert and lay witnesses,but rather between expert and lay testimony so it is possible for the same witness to provide both lay and expert testimony in a single case.advisory committee note on the amendments emphasis in original.the record is indistinct as to whether the challenged multiplication testimony was admitted as expert testimony under rule or as lay opinion testimony under rule.we start,therefore,by clarifying that point.
the line between expert testimony under.and lay opinion testimony under.is not easy to draw united states colón osorio,cir.be that as it may,we have scant difficulty in concluding that rule is the better fit for simple multiplication of the sort that the chemist performed here.lay opinion is generally thought to encompass information that can be deduced from a process of reasoning familiar in everyday life.advisory committee note on the amendments internal quotation mark omitted.simple arithmetic,such as ordinary multiplication,is a paradigmatic example of the type of everyday activity that goes on in the normal course of human existence.one does not need a graduate degree in chemistry to master multiplication in this country,that subject is universally taught in elementary schools.without such a rudimentary skill,ordinary tasks such as figuring a family budget,shopping in a supermarket,and converting a recipe for four into a meal for ten would assume herculean proportions.
the bottom line is that the district court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the chemist to perform simple multiplication.nor did it abuse its discretion in admitting the products of the chemist multiplication as lay opinion testimony.
iv.sentencing issues 
the defendant attempts to raise two sentencing issues.however,the first of these is a though the defendant protests that his month incarcerative sentence is substantively unreasonable,our vacation of the section a convictions and our direction to enter instead section a convictions,see supra part ii,require resentencing.see united states garcía ortiz,cir calling for resentencing when partially successful appeal likely affects the sentencing package.because it is unlikely that the same sentence will be imposed for these lesser charges,evaluating the substantive reasonableness of the original sentence would be a purely academic exercise.see united states wallace,cir.
this leaves the defendant challenge to the district court determination.even though resentencing is required,this claim of error remains live.after all,drug quantity is likely to form an integral part of the revised sentencing calculus.united states ventura,cir explaining that drug quantity is an important sentencing factor in narcotics cases.
in a drug conspiracy case,setting the defendant guideline range requires an attribution to him of the amount of drugs that were reasonably foreseeable to him.see united states colón solís,cir.we review a sentencing court attribution for clear error.see united states platte,cir.this review is deferential,and the district court determination will be upheld so long as the approximation represents a reasoned estimate of actual quantity.united states cintrón echautegui,cir.
the court below started from the supportable foundation that,on average,the small bags of marijuana sold at the drug point weighed grams and the large bags weighed grams apiece.the court then explained that both kinds of bags were delivered to the drug point in larger bundles,with each bundle comprising bags.the drug point operated around the clock,in hour shifts.the court estimated that five bundles of small bags and two bundles of large bags were sold during a typical shift.noting that the drug point had operated days per week,weeks per year from through,the court made a series of calculations and arrived at a total drug quantity of kilograms of marijuana.in light of the defendant status as both the conspiracy marijuana supplier and a of the drug point,the court found that this quantity was reasonably foreseeable to him.
the defendant assault on this calculation centers on the factual predicate employed by the sentencing court.this assault starts with the court use of a figure as the multiplier representing the life of the conspiracy.he insists that,regardless of how long the conspiracy lasted,no witness dated his participation in it to any time before.
even if we accept the factual premise on which this argument rests,the argument does not take the defendant very far.testimony from a coconspirator ortiz places the defendant in the conspiracy no later than the beginning of and the record supports a finding that the defendant continued to toil within the conspiracy until his arrest in november.this is an interval of roughly nine years,so the sentencing court use of a multiplier was not clearly erroneous.
the defendant next questions the district court conclusion that each bundle was composed of bags.while he admits that one of the coconspirators testified to this bundle size,he points out that other coconspirators testified differently.this argument is meritless.i f there are two plausible views of the record,the sentencing court choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.united states santos,cir.
the third branch of the defendant attack opens a new front.the record indicates that,after,the defendant rented the drug point to others,rather t
