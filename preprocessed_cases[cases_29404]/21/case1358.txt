we are asked to decide two questions whether the district court erred in denying bailey motion to suppress evidence obtained during his detention because the search and seizure of bailey person and property were conducted in violation of his rights under the fourth amendment to the united states constitution and whether the district court erred in denying bailey motion because he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his rights under the sixth amendment to the united states constitution.we hold that bailey detention during the search of his residence was justified pursuant to michigan summers,d.the district court therefore did not err in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained during that detention.we also hold that bailey failed to demonstrate,as he must in order to prevail,that his counsel alleged ineffective assistance was prejudicial.strickland washington,d.the district court therefore did not err in denying bailey motion.the district court august,judgment of conviction and its january,order denying the motion are affirmed.
background 
the following facts reflect the findings entered by the district court in the proceedings below,see united states bailey,d,motion to suppress bailey,wl,at motion,and,unless otherwise indicated,are not in dispute.
at on july,detective richard sneider sneider of the suffolk county police department scpd obtained a search warrant from the first district court in the town of islip,new york for the basement apartment of lake drive in wyandanch,new york,on the basis of information from a confidential informant.the search warrant provided that the apartment was believed to be occupied by an individual known as polo,a heavy set black male with short hair,and identified a chrome handgun as the principal target of the search.the search warrant also stated that the basement apartment at lake drive is located at the rear of the premises.the search warrant did not specify that access to the basement door at the rear of the house at lake drive is possible from both the basement apartment and from the house upstairs.
at approximately that evening,sneider and detective richard gorbecki gorbecki,an veteran of the scpd assigned to the special operations team for narcotics enforcement,observed two men later identified as chunon bailey the defendant and bryant middleton middleton exiting the gate at the top of the stairs that led down to the basement of lake drive.both bailey and middleton matched the description of polo provided to sneider by the confidential informant.they exited the yard of the house and entered a black lexus parked in the driveway.rather than confront bailey and middleton within view or earshot of the apartment,sneider and gorbecki watched as bailey car pulled out of the driveway and proceeded down the block after the car traveled about a mile from the house,the officers pulled the car over in the parking lot of a fire station approximately five minutes elapsed between bailey exit from the basement apartment at lake drive and the stop.
after pulling over the vehicle,the detectives conducted a of the driver,bailey,and passenger,middleton,to check for hard objects that could be used as weapons.at sneider request,bailey identified himself and produced a driver licenses bearing a bay shore,new york address.nevertheless,he told sneider that he was coming from his house at lake drive in wyandanch,new york.
middleton also identified himself and told gorbecki that bailey was driving him home in order to comply with a curfew imposed as a condition of middleton parole.middleton stated that bailey residence was lake drive.at that point,the officers placed bailey and middleton in handcuffs and in response to bailey inquiry as to why they were being arrested informed both men that they were being detained,but not arrested,incident to the execution of a search warrant in the basement apartment of lake drive.to that,bailey responded,i do live there.anything you find there ai mine,and i not cooperating with your investigation.
gorbecki drove bailey lexus back to lake drive,while bailey and middleton were transported back in a patrol car.upon arrival,bailey and middleton were informed that,during the search,the scpd entry team had discovered a gun and drugs in plain view in the apartment.bailey and middleton were placed under arrest and bailey house and car keys were seized incident to arrest.later that evening,an scpd officer discovered that one of the keys on bailey key ring opened the door of the basement apartment.in total,less than ten minutes elapsed between bailey stop and his formal arrest.
the evidence obtained during the search of bailey home and his statements to detectives sneider and gorbecki provided the basis for the government indictment.bailey moved,through counsel,to suppress the physical evidence including his house and car keys and his statements to detectives snieder and gorbecki,on the theory that he was unlawfully detained and searched in violation of the fourth amendment.
after holding an evidentiary hearing,the district court found bailey detention lawful under michigan summers,d.see bailey,d at.the district court reasoned that the detectives authority under summers to detain bailey incident to a search of the apartment was not strictly confined to the physical premises of the apartment so long as the detention occurred as soon as practicable after bailey departed lake drive.id.at.moreover,the district court concluded,in the alternative,that bailey detention was lawful as an investigative detention supported by reasonable suspicion under terry ohio,d.id.at.
a trial with respect to count one possession with intent to distribute more than five grams of cocaine base in violation of a and b b iii and count three possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of c a i commenced on october.on november,the jury returned a guilty verdict with respect to both counts 
on december,bailey filed a motion pursuant to seeking to vacate his conviction and order a new trial.bailey sole argument was that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to introduce evidence that access to the basement door at the rear of lake drive could be gained from either the basement apartment or the house upstairs.bailey asserted that when detectives sneider and gorbecki observed bailey exit the gate at the back of the property on july,they could not have known whether he was leaving the basement apartment for which they had a search warrant or the house upstairs for which they did not.bailey argued that this distinction was determinative in the district court adjudication of the suppression motion because the government could not sustain his detention under summers or provide the reasonable suspicion to sustain his detention under terry without demonstrating conclusively that bailey had emerged from the basement apartment.
the district court concluded that,even if the detectives had known that access to the basement hallway was possible from an apartment other than the basement apartment,they still would have had a reasonable basis to believe that bailey and middleton might have emerged from the property for which they had a search warrant.the detectives therefore had the authority under summers to briefly detain bailey in order to ascertain whether he was an occupant of the premises being searched.indeed,as it turned out,the undisputed evidence at the trial was that this door to the main house was not accessible to the basement tenant and that the main house was sealed off from the basement area.united states bailey,wl,at.
because the evidence regarding the layout of the house had no effect on the lawfulness of bailey detention,the district court reasoned that bailey had not demonstrated any prejudice from his counsel alleged failure to offer that evidence.accordingly,bailey had failed to satisfy the requirement of strickland that a successful claim for ineffective assistance of counsel demonstrate that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.at.
bailey appeals from the final judgment of conviction entered by the district court on august,as well as from the january,order denying bailey motion to vacate the conviction pursuant to.on appeal,he makes substantially the same claims he made before the district court in his suppression and motions.however,he limits his arguments on appeal to the lawfulness of his detention pursuant to summers and terry and the adequacy of his assistance at trial.appellant br,
discussion 
appeals from the denial of a motion to suppress evidence and a motion to vacate a conviction pursuant to are both governed under the same standard of review we review the district court factual findings for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.united states lucky,cir reviewing a suppression motion sapia united states,cir reviewing a motion.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson city of bessemer city,d quotation marks omitted accord united states kilkenny,cir.
the basic parameters of our inquiry into the lawfulness of a challenged seizure are.see,united states julius,cir.the fourth amendment proscribes unreasonable searches and seizures.in the absence of probable cause,a limited and temporary detention is generally permissible only if law enforcement can establish reasonable suspicion based on specific and articulable facts as measured by an objective standard.terry,at.the fourth amendment,however,imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion.united states martinez fuerte,d.instead,as in all questions under the fourth amendment,the touchstone of our analysis is reasonableness.palacios burge,cir quoting samson california,d alteration and emphasis omitted.
in michigan summers,d,the detroit police encountered george summers descending the front steps of his house while they were preparing to execute a search warrant of the premises.summers was detained during the search and subsequently arrested when narcotics were found in the house.id.at.the supreme court upheld the initial detention,explaining that a warrant to search for contraband founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.id.at.that is,the court concluded that the detention of occupants even without individualized suspicion during the execution of a valid search warrant is reasonable under the fourth amendment.
the summers court explained that compared with the inconvenience and the indignity associated with a compelled visit to the police station,id.at,the character of the incremental intrusion caused by detention is slight and the justifications for detention are substantial.id.at.in particular,the court justified the detention of george summers by reference to the interests of law enforcement in preventing flight in the event that incriminating evidence is found minimizing the risk of harm to the officers and facilitating the orderly completion of the search.id.at.moreover,the court observed that once a judicial officer has determined that police have probable cause to believe that someone in the home is committing a crime,t he connection of an occupant to that home gives the police officer an easily identifiable and certain basis for determining that suspicion of criminal activity justifies a detention of that occupant.id.at.
we are now asked to decide whether the same authority pursuant to which police officers may detain an occupant at the premises during the execution of a search warrant permits them to detain an occupant who leaves the premises during or immediately before the execution of a search warrant and is detained a few blocks away.while we have extended summers to permit the detention of individuals entering a vehicle in the driveway of a house,see united states fullwood,cir,the question presented here is a matter of first impression in our circuit.
this question has divided the courts of appeals.of the five courts to consider it,three have extended summers on facts similar to those of this case.in united states cochran,cir,for example,police officers went to the defendant residence to execute a search warrant and observed the defendant leaving the premises.id.at.the officers did not want to forcibly enter the premises knowing that there was a guard dog inside,and they therefore stopped the defendant shortly after he exited the house.id.the sixth circuit,relying on summers,held that the detention was reasonable,concluding that summers does not impose upon police a duty based on geographic proximity,defendant must be detained while still on his premises rather,the focus is upon police performance,that is,whether the police detained defendant as soon as practicable after departing from his residence.id.at.
similarly,in united states cavazos,cir,police officers were conducting surveillance when the defendant and two others left the residence in a truck.id.at.the officers followed.id.after the driver of the truck demonstrated his awareness that he was being followed,the officers stopped the vehicle,took the defendant back to the residence,and detained him during the search.id.the fifth circuit observed that,because the defendant conduct warranted the belief that the defendant would have fled or alerted the other occupants of the residence about the agents nearby if he were released immediately after the stop and frisk,the detention was justified under summers.id.at.moreover,the court concluded that the nexus between the defendant and the residence gave officers an easily identifiable and certain basis for determining that suspicion of criminal activity justifie d a detention of that occupant.id.quoting summers,at.
most recently,in united states bullock,cir,officers conducting surveillance observed the defendant exit the house and enter a vehicle with the resident of the house and her children.id.at.officers followed the vehicle and executed a stop about ten to fifteen blocks from the house,transporting all of the occupants of the vehicle back to the house after notifying the driver that a search was underway.id.the seventh circuit concluded that in the absence of anything to suggest that the vehicle was not pulled over as soon as practicable the conduct of the officers was reasonable.id.at.the court observed that o nce aware of the warrant,bullock became a flight risk and a potential risk to the officers safety in executing the warrant given his suspected illegal association with the residence.id.
two circuits have declined to extend summers to permit detention of occupants who have been seen leaving a residence subject to a search warrant.in united states sherrill,cir,officers were conducting surveillance when the defendant left the premises.id.at.the officers stopped him a block away,informed him that they had a warrant to search the house,and detained him during the search.id.at.the eighth circuit determined that,because the defendant had left the area and was unaware of the warrant,the officers did not have any interest in preventing his flight the court therefore held that summers was inapplicable.id.at.nevertheless,the court concluded that the police had probable cause to arrest the defendant in light of the legal arrest,the crack a
