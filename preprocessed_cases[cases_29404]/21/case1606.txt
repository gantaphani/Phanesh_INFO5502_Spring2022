this appeal arises out of a decision of the united states district court for the western district of new york david larimer,judge,on a remand pursuant to united states crosby,cir.on the crosby remand,the district court declined to order resentencing of two who had been convicted of crimes arising out of their participation in a heroin trafficking conspiracy and who were sentenced to substantial terms of imprisonment.
on appeal,defendant art williams argues that the district court used the wrong legal standard when determining whether to resentence him pursuant to crosby,and that his sentence was unreasonable under the standard of appellate review set forth in united states booker,d.with respect to williams,roland onaghinor,who had been indicted and convicted along with williams,onaghinor counsel has submitted a brief pursuant to anders california,d,alleging that there are no grounds on which to appeal and asking to be relieved as counsel.the government has filed a motion for summary affirmance as to onaghinor.while onaghinor appeal was pending,he completed service of his term of imprisonment and was deported.
the parties submissions require us to consider the scope of our review of a district court decision not to resentence pursuant to crosby.we conclude that we retain authority to review for reasonableness both the procedure whereby the district court decided not to resentence and the substance of the undisturbed sentence.we clarify,however,that the law of the case doctrine forecloses reconsideration of issues that were that could have been prior proceedings.
in the matter of defendant williams,we find no reversible error in the district court proceedings on the crosby remand,and we conclude that the sentence imposed on williams by the district court was reasonable.we dismiss the appeal of williams onaghinor as moot.
background 
facts and procedural 
in november,defendants art williams and roland onaghinor were convicted by a jury for their participation in a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute,and to distribute,one kilogram or more of heroin,in violation of a,b a,and.defendant williams was also convicted of thirteen counts of using a communication facility the mail in committing,or in causing or facilitating the commission of,the heroin trafficking conspiracy,in violation of b and.
at their sentencings,which were conducted under the sentencing guidelines regime governing federal sentencing,the district court made a number of rulings favorable to both williams and onaghinor,the net result of which was to reduce substantially the guidelines range applicable to their offenses.for example,the district court held that williams could only be held responsible for conspiring to distribute between grams and kilogram of heroin,despite a jury finding that he was responsible for conspiring to distribute over kilogram of heroin.this ruling,along with other favorable findings by the district court,reduced williams potential sentence for the heroin trafficking conspiracy conviction from a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole,see b a to a guidelines range of to months.the district court also affirmed,over the government objection,a jury finding that onaghinor could not be held responsible for conspiring to distribute more than grams of heroin.the district court did,however,impose a enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to sentencing guidelines manual on both williams and onaghinor,and a enhancement on williams for his role in the offense pursuant to b.
the district court sentenced williams on march,to a term of imprisonment of months on the heroin trafficking conspiracy count,and a term of imprisonment of months on each of the remaining counts,each term of imprisonment to run concurrently with the others.he was also sentenced to three years of supervised release,a fine of on count one,and a special assessment of.onaghinor was sentenced on may,to a term of imprisonment of months,a period of supervised release of three years,and a special assessment.
on appeal,we affirmed defendants convictions and rejected williams challenge to the district court imposition of the obstruction of justice enhancement,see peterson,at,but held the mandate pending the decision of the supreme court in,see id.at.defendants did not challenge any of the district court other sentencing rulings on appeal,although williams filed a supplemental brief challenging the imposition of the role enhancement after his case was briefed and argued.see id.after the supreme court issued its decision in,we remanded the cause to the district court pursuant to our decision in crosby for a determination of whether to resentence defendants.see crosby,at.
on remand,williams asked the district court to reconsider the application of the guidelines enhancements that it had imposed on him for obstruction of justice and his role in the offense.while williams sentencing memorandum sought to convince the district court that williams had not obstructed justice,it did not argue that any of the sentencing factors set forth in a and given renewed vitality by,see crosby,at discussing district court obligation to consider the guidelines and all of the other factors listed in section a when imposing sentence after,would support imposition of a sentence onaghinor sentencing memorandum on remand also challenged the district court previous imposition of the obstruction of justice enhancement,but offered no rationale for resentencing based on the a factors.
ii.the district court decision 
in a published decision and order dated august,the district court declined to resentence either defendant.see united states williams,d.the district court began its discussion of the issues before it by stating that it was familiar with,crosby,and the proceedings in defendants cases that it had reviewed the memoranda submitted by counsel for defendants and that it had considered the sentencing factors listed in a.see id.at.it then proceeded to reject williams renewed attempt to challenge the imposition of guidelines enhancements for his role in the offense and for obstruction of justice.in the course of this discussion,the district court stated 
i understand that the sentencing guidelines are now advisory and that the court must consider them and impose a reasonable sentence after considering all the factors listed at a.if the sentencing were to occur today in light of the new sentencing regime in effect since the booker supreme court case,i would make the same findings as to the guidelines and impose the same sentence 
in sum,i see no reason to order a resentencing in this case since if we were do so sic,my sentence would be the same and would not be affected by the fact that the sentencing guidelines are now advisory and not mandatory.
id.the district court rejected onaghinor request for resentencing using similar language,concluding that w hether the guidelines were mandatory or advisory,it would make no difference in determining what the appropriate reasonable sentence should be.therefore,i decline to resentence roland onaghinor and believe that the original sentence was proper and is a reasonable sentence under the sentencing guidelines and a.id.at.
iii.arguments on appeal and subsequent developments 
both defendants appealed the district court decision not to resentence pursuant to crosby.defendant williams alleges on appeal that the district court used the improper legal standard when determining whether to resentence,and that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable.counsel for defendant onaghinor moved to be relieved as counsel pursuant to anders california,d,submitting a brief in which he asserted that there were no grounds on which to appeal.the government moved for summary affirmance of onaghinor sentence.
on july,onaghinor completed his sentence of imprisonment and commenced service of his term of supervised release.in response to our inquiry at oral argument into onaghinor whereabouts,the government informed us by supplemental letter dated january,that onaghinor was deported to nigeria on december.
discussion 
scope of our review of a decision not to resentence pursuant to crosby 
before adjudicating defendants appeals,we clarify the scope of our review when a district court has declined to resentence a defendant upon a crosby remand.
pursuant to the supreme court opinion in,we review sentences for reasonableness.see,at.crosby,at,see also united states fernandez,cir declaring that sentences held to be unreasonable are imposed in violation of law quoting a.the reasonableness review contemplated by requires consideration not only of the sentence itself,but also of the procedures employed in arriving at the sentence.fernandez,at citing crosby,at.reasonableness review is akin to review for abuse of discretion,under which we consider whether the sentencing judge exceeded the bounds of allowable discretion,committed an error of law in the course of exercising discretion,or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact.id.at quoting crosby,at alteration and omission in original.
we hold here that we review a sentence for reasonableness even after a district court declines to resentence pursuant to crosby.we do so because we are obliged to apply to this case which is pending on direct review.crosby,at.we implicitly adopted this approach in united states park,cir,in which we undertook a reasonableness review of a sentence imposed before the supreme court decision in that remained undisturbed after a crosby remand.see id.at.we also alluded to our authority to review a sentence for reasonableness after a district court decision not to resentence pursuant to crosby in united states garcia,cir,in which we stated,in reviewing a sentence before ordering a crosby remand,o ur present task is not to review the defendants sentences for reasonableness.under the framework established by crosby,that inquiry arises after the district court either has determined that the defendant does not need to be resentenced or has imposed a new sentence.id.at.
our approach also finds support from other circuits that have followed crosby.for example,in united states paladino,cir,the seventh circuit held that,where a district court declined to resentence pursuant to a procedure modeled on crosby,we will affirm the original sentence against a challenge provided that the sentence is reasonable,the standard of appellate review prescribed by booker.at.the proviso is important the mere reimposition of the original sentence does not insulate it from appellate review under the new standard.id.at see also united states ameline,cir en banc providing that,if a district court declines to resentence upon a remand modeled on crosby,the original sentence will stand,subject to appellate review for reasonableness.but see united states combs,cir holding that scope of reasonableness review after a district court declines to resentence upon an ameline remand is limited to consideration of w hether the district judge properly understood the full scope of his discretion in a world.
we note,however,that by the time a district court decision not to resentence pursuant to crosby reaches us on appeal,at least two claims of error related to the sentencing will normally be foreclosed by prior proceedings.first,as we indicated in crosby,any errors in the procedure for selecting the original sentence under the guidelines regime would be harmless,and not prejudicial under plain error analysis,if the judge decides on remand,in full compliance with now applicable requirements,that under the regime the sentence would have been essentially the same as originally imposed.crosby,at.thus,if a district court decides,pursuant to crosby,that it would not have imposed a materially different sentence had it discharged its obligations under the regime,id.at,a defendant will be unable to argue on appeal that the district court committed reversible error by failing to sentence under the advisory guidelines regime created by.
second,the law of the case doctrine ordinarily will bar a defendant from renewing challenges to rulings made by the sentencing court that were adjudicated by this that could have been adjudicated by us had the defendant made the initial appeal that led to the crosby remand.see united states quintieri,cir the law of the case ordinarily forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court.it ordinarily prohibits a party,upon resentencing or an appeal from that resentencing,from raising issues that he or she waived by not litigating them at the time of the initial sentencing.quoting united states ben zvi,cir.for example,as in this very case,we have routinely resolved challenges to a district court calculation of the guidelines range applicable to a defendant before we remand pursuant to crosby,see peterson,at see also,garcia,at ruling on challenges to guideline calculations prior to crosby remand united states maloney,cir same.but see united states irving,cir declining to adjudicate challenges to guidelines calculations prior to crosby remand.in other words,when we have reached the guidelines other sentencing by defendants in their initial appeal,further challenges to our resolution of these issues after a district court has declined to resentence pursuant to crosby will be foreclosed by the law of the case 
the law of the case doctrine will not,however,bar a defendant who is not resentenced after a crosby remand from challenging the procedures used by the district court during the crosby remand.this is so because the doctrine does not prevent a defendant from raising a sentencing issue if it arises as a result of events that occur after the original sentence.quintieri,at.a district court decision not to resentence pursuant to crosby occurs,by definition,after the original sentence and appeal thus,the law of the case will not bar a defendant from challenging the manner in which the district court conducted the crosby remand.
in addition,the law of the case usually will not prevent a defendant who appeals a district court decision not to resentence pursuant to crosby from obtaining reasonableness review of the length of his sentence.in remanding under crosby,we generally decline to consider whether the sentence of a defendant is unreasonably long because of the possibility that a different sentence will be imposed after the crosby remand.see crosby,at because a remand is warranted,we have no occasion on this appeal to consider whether crosby sentence is unreasonable solely because of its length.thus,a challenge to the reasonableness of the length of a sentence usually will only be ripe for review after the district court has decided whether or not to resentence pursuant to crosby.see quintieri,at law of the case only bars relitigation of an issue that was ripe for review at the time of an initial appeal quoting ben zvi,at.
ii.analysis 
having clarified the standards guiding our review of a decision not to resentence made by a district court after a crosby remand,we proceed to address defendants appeals.
williams appeal 
williams first argues that the district court erred by failing to comply with the dictates of a in deciding not to resentence him.specifically,williams asserts that the district court improperly stated that it was obligated to impose a reasonable sentence after considering the a factors,when in fact,the district court duty under a is to impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary,to comply with the purposes set forth in a.see note,ante quoting a.the sufficient,but not greater than necessary clause is known as the parsimony clause of a.see united states,cir discussing parsimony clause.
we have recognized that district courts are to impose sentences pursuant to the requirements of a including the requirements of a parsimony appellate courts are to review the sentences actually imposed by district courts for reasonableness.see,at noting our general agreement with this dichotomy see also united states foreman,cir a district court job is not to impose a reasonable sentence.rather,a district court mandate is to impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary,to comply with the purposes of section a.reasonableness is the appellate standard of review in judging whether a district court has a
