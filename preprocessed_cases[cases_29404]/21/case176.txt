standard of review 
we review federal criminal sentences imposed under the advisory guidelines for abuse of discretion.gall united states,united states madera ortiz,cir.within this framework,we review a district court factual findings for clear error,and its interpretation and application of the guidelines de novo.united states walker,cir.typically,our review of a sentence imposed under the guidelines involves a process.first,we evaluate the procedural soundness of the sentence second,we assay its substantive reasonableness.madera ortiz,at.the procedural dimension of sentencing review includes the correctness of the court application of the guidelines,while t he substantive dimension focuses on the duration of the sentence in light of the totality of the circumstances.united states del valle rodríguez,f d,cir.procedural errors amounting to an abuse of discretion include failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.gall,at.an error of law underlying a sentencing court decision constitutes an abuse of discretion.see walker,at holding that a material error of law is invariably an abuse of discretion.
b.the procedural soundness of the sentence 
vélez soto argues that the district court decision not to impose a fully concurrent to month sentence,and its failure to consider the commentary to c,rendered its sentence procedurally unsound.
a sentencing court has discretion to impose either a consecutive or a concurrent sentence when a defendant is subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment.a.nonetheless,in exercising this discretion,a sentencing court must consider the factors set forth in a,including any applicable sentencing guidelines or policy statements.id.b united states carrasco de jesús,cir.although the guidelines are no longer mandatory,district courts must still give respectful consideration to the guidelines and their accompanying policy statements.united states millán isaac,cir quoting pepper united states.
the applicable version of guidelines b provides for a concurrent or partially concurrent sentence when the defendant is subject to a previously imposed but undischarged term of imprisonment that has resulted from another offense that is relevant conduct to the instant offense of conviction,if the relevant conduct offense was the basis for an increase in the offense level.b.to gain the benefit of b,a defendant must prove that he satisfies each and every element of the guideline,including that the charge underpinning the undischarged term of imprisonment was the basis for an increase in the offense level for the offense of conviction.carrasco de jesús,at.under c,a district court may impose a sentence concurrently,partially concurrently,or consecutively and t he end result need only be reasonable.united states vázquez alomar,cir quoting united states caraballo,cir.
vélez soto did not claim that his undischarged state convictions were relevant conduct during his sentencing hearing,nor does he so claim on appeal.moreover,because the district court accurately held that vélez soto state sentence for second degree murder did not involve relevant conduct,and therefore that b did not apply,the court was under no obligation to impose a concurrent sentence.see carrasco de jesús,at.in declining to impose a to month concurrent sentence,the district court stated 
i am not going to sentence concurrently for to months because i think it well it totally unrelated conduct.this is a drug case,that a murder case.if i sentence concurrently for that number of months,basically he getting a freebie for the murder or for the drugs.
the commentary to c states that in determining whether to impose a concurrent,partially concurrent,or consecutive sentence to an undischarged term of imprisonment,the court should consider the following factors to achieve a reasonable incremental punishment for the instant offense and avoid unwarranted disparity 
i the factors set forth in referencing a 
ii the type,determinate,and length of the prior undischarged sentence 
iii the time served on the undischarged sentence and the time likely to be served before release 
iv the fact that the prior undischarged sentence may have been imposed in state court rather than federal court,or at a different time before the same or different federal court and 
v any other circumstance relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence for the instant offense.
the sentencing transcript reveals that the district court evaluated the factors enumerated in the commentary to c.the district court noted the type and length of vélez soto state sentence the time served on the undischarged state sentence and the time likely to be served before release and it properly took into account that vélez soto
