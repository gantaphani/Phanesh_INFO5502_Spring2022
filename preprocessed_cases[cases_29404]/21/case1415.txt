ronell wilson murdered two undercover police detectives who were posing as gun buyers.wilson appeals from a judgment of conviction and a sentence of death entered on march,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york garaufis.wilson appeals on twelve grounds some with subparts,among them that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding under the violent crimes in aid of racketeering vicar statute,that wilson acted to maintain or increase his position in a racketeering enterprise and the district court abused its discretion in cutting off recrossexamination that had bearing on whether wilson shot in perceived because he thought his victims were about to rob him.we affirm as to those claims and therefore affirm the convictions.
we likewise affirm the district court rejection of wilson arguments that voir dire was unfairly biased and constitutionally inadequate testimony in the penalty phase exceeded what is permissible under the constitution and the federal death penalty act,and required an additional corrective charge and a fellow inmate was acting as a government agent in eliciting admissions from wilson.
however,we vacate the death sentences,and remand,because two arguments made to the jury by the bearing on the critical issues of remorse,acceptance of responsibility,and future wilson constitutional rights.the government argued i that wilson put the government to its proof of guilt rather than plead guilty and ii that wilson allocution of remorse should be discredited because he failed to testify notwithstanding the fact that t he path for that witness stand has never been blocked for wilson.as to the first argument,although a guilty plea may properly be considered to support a sentence mitigation for acceptance of responsibility,the sixth amendment is violated when failure to plead guilty is treated as an aggravating circumstance.as to the second,it is a fair argument for the prosecution to say that an allocution of remorse is unsworn and uncrossed,but the fifth amendment is violated when the defendant is denied a charge that limits the fifth amendment waiver to that which is said in the allocution and the jury is invited to consider more generally that the defendant declined to testify.these constitutional violations were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
accordingly,we vacate the death sentences and remand for further proceedings 
background 
wilson was convicted on five capital counts two counts of murder in aid of racketeering under vicar a,two counts of causing a death through the use of a firearm j,and one count of carjacking with death resulting.he was also convicted on five counts.at a separate penalty phase,the same jury unanimously voted to sentence wilson to death on all five capital counts.eight of the convictions including all five capital counts stem from a march,robbery and murder of new york police department detectives james nemorin and rodney andrews.the other two counts a robbery conspiracy and the use of a firearm stem from a may,aborted robbery.wilson was arrested on march,two days after the murders.
at trial,the defense contended that the triggerman was jesse jacobus,a fellow gang member who was with wilson during the murders and who testified against him at trial but wilson does not appeal the jury finding that he,wilson and not jacobus,fired the shots.
the district court had jurisdiction to hear the case under.this court has jurisdiction over an appeal from a final order of the district court under.
the stapleton crew was a violent gang that operated in staten island from approximately until it was disbanded by the arrest of the principals following the murders committed by wilson.the gang was involved in robberies and the sale of drugs.the core members of this gang were michael whitten,paris bullock,omar green,hason taylor,and rashun cann associated gang members included mitchell diaz,jacobus,and the appellant,wilson 
the stapleton crew collectively owned several guns that were available for the members use.one week before the murders,on march,whitten and green sold one of these guns,a caliber revolver,for.the buyer in that transaction was actually detective nemorin working undercover.he made no arrest at that time because he wanted to further infiltrate the operation and make additional arrests later.accordingly,he arranged to purchase another of the stapleton crew guns the following week.
detective andrews volunteered to accompany detective nemorin as backup at the second transaction.they were accompanied at a distance by officers on foot and in nearby cars one of the putative gun buyers wore a fake beeper that would broadcast audio to officers conducting surveillance.
in advance of the march meeting,members of the stapleton crew decided to rob the buyer of the price rather than deliver the gun.the discussion among wilson,diaz,bullock,whitten,and green in green apartment was as follows jacobus would assist wilson wilson would be armed with one of the communal guns,which wilson was told he might have to use green or whitten raised the possibility that detective nemorin might be a police officer or a thief attempting to rob the stapleton crew wilson committed to go through with the robbery anyway if green and whitten wanted him to do so green and whitten then approved of the planned robbery.
on the night of march,wilson and jacobus got into the back seat of the undercovers car wilson sat behind the driver,detective nemorin.wilson directed the driver to another neighborhood in staten island,where wilson got out,met diaz,and picked up the caliber pistol ultimately used in the murders.wilson and diaz discussed what both recognized to be an undercover police presence in the area,although diaz stated that he told wilson he did not believe the police were deployed on their account.wilson,now armed,rejoined the others in the car,and directed the driver to another neighborhood where the planned robbery would take place.
when they arrived,wilson briefly stepped out of the car.when he got back in,wilson shot detective andrews in the head.wilson then pointed the gun at detective nemorin and said,where the shit at where the shit at where the money where the shit at jacobus testified that detective nemorin was pleading for his life before wilson shot him in the head.
wilson and jacobus left the car with the victims bodies inside,walked quickly to the nearby apartment of wilson stepfather,entered with wilson key,and stashed the murder weapon in a closet.wilson and jacobus then returned to the car and pulled the bodies out to search them for money.leaving the bodies in the street,they drove off in the bloodstained car.as they drove away from the crime scene,jacobus asked wilson why he shot the men wilson responded,i do give a fuck about nobody.
wilson and jacobus parked the car near the stapleton projects and began to search it for money.wilson found a gun under the front passenger seat and said,t hey was going to get us before we got them.jacobus testified that wilson had not previously suggested that the killings were preemptive.wilson kept the gun he took from the car.
as wilson and jacobus walked back to the projects,wilson yelled something to a passing police car.the police car stopped and the officers got out wilson and jacobus ran,and the officers pursued jacobus was arrested a short distance away.
wilson escaped into the stapleton projects,and went to green apartment,where green was with diaz.diaz testified that wilson was asked what happened,and wilson responded that he,wilson,had popped the buyers.diaz recalled that wilson said other things as well,but in a ruling contested on this appeal,questioning of diaz on that issue was terminated.wilson left the apartment with green and diaz.
wilson was arrested two days later in brooklyn.in his pocket the arresting officers found among other things rap lyrics he had written that arguably describe the murders.
in march,wilson was indicted in state court for murder,and the district attorney filed notice of intent to seek the death penalty.in june,the new york court of appeals ruled that the state death penalty statute violated the new york constitution.
the federal government then took up the prosecution.on november,a federal grand jury indicted wilson,bullock,whitten,and two other members of the stapleton crew.wilson four each pled guilty to racketeering and narcotics charges,and have been imprisoned for a term of years.
a notice of intent to seek the death penalty was filed in federal court on august.in september,the grand jury approved a superseding indictment that served as the trial indictment,charging wilson on five capital counts two charges of murder in aid of racketeering,two charges of firearm murders during a robbery,and one charge of carjacking murder as well as five counts three of which stem from the march,robbery and two from a previous aborted robbery.
the government gave notice that it was seeking the death penalty on the basis of six aggravating factors.the two statutory aggravating factors were i that he committed the murders in the expectation of the receipt of something of pecuniary value and ii that he intentionally killed more than one person in a single criminal episode.see c,c.the aggravating factors were iii that the victims were law enforcement officers murdered during their official duties,iv that wilson faced contemporaneous convictions for serious acts of violence,v that wilson was a continuing danger to others,and vi that the victims deaths impacted survivors.see a.on appeal,wilson argues that the victim impact evidence should have been limited to family,and that in any event he was prejudiced by the emotional content of the victim impact testimony.
approximately potential jurors were assembled in september and filled out a questionnaire.individual voir dire of approximately potential jurors began in october and ended on november,during which time the parties submitted and objected to proposed written questions for the court to pose.after voir dire,the defense moved to discharge all twelve seated jurors the motion was denied.on appeal,wilson argues that the voir dire was biased to favor the prosecution and unconstitutionally omitted a critical willingness of the jury to consider childhood deprivation as a mitigator.
at the guilt phase of trial,the government largely proved the case set out above in connection with the march,double homicide.wilson argues on appeal that the trial evidence did not sufficiently prove that he killed for pecuniary gain or for position in the gang,an element of murder in aid of a racketeering activity.on december,the jury returned guilty verdicts on all ten counts against wilson.
at the penalty phase of the trial the government relied on six aggravating factors to justify a sentence of death.the two factors expressly listed in the statute had been the subject of evidence in the guilt phase killing for pecuniary gain and killing multiple people in a single incident.see c,c.of the four factors,two had been the subject of evidence in the guilt phase killing law enforcement officers in the course of duty and contemporaneous convictions for serious acts of violence the earlier aborted robbery.the government case at sentencing was therefore focused on two aggravating factors victim impact and future dangerousness.
the government victim impact evidence consisted of five witnesses who testified primarily about detective andrews his widow,son,cousin,and a friend in the police department five witnesses who testified primarily about detective nemorin his widow,sister,former supervisor,and a friend in the police department photos of the detectives as they were in life and an excerpt from a documentary film sponsored by one of the police witnesses in which detective nemorin discussed his job as an undercover police officer.wilson objected to much of this evidence on a number of grounds.
to show future dangerousness,the government adduced wilson record of increasingly serious offenses,starting at age.the offenses included robberies and assaults.the victim of an assault committed when wilson was years old required stitches.between ages and,wilson was confined to a maximum security juvenile facility for robbery at,he entered rikers island for one year.wilson murdered detective andrews and detective nemorin when he was years old.the prosecution also cited a long disciplinary record of prison offenses.moreover,the prosecution established that wilson was a member of the bloods gang,stayed a member while in prison,and had on at least two occasions told fellow gang members to pop off,attack the guards.
to testify about the bloods structure and organization,and how acts of violence move a member up within the gang hierarchy,the government put on a cooperating witness,shabucalik geralds,a former bloods member who was still to some extent affiliated with the gang at the time he testified.geralds,who encountered wilson in prison while wilson was detained following the murders,also testified to statements made by wilson.the defense argues on appeal that geralds testimony about the bloods was unreliable opinion testimony lacking a foundation of personal knowledge and that geralds was a government agent when he elicited information from wilson.
wilson put on an expert witness to refute the idea that he would be a danger in prison.donald romine,a former bureau of prisons supervisor,testified that prisons have many effective controls in place to prevent violence,that wilson prison disciplinary record was unremarkable,and that the bloods gang does not present a particularly high risk within the federal prison population.on crossexamination,the prosecution elicited testimony from romine about the internal workings of the bloods,including that acts of violence could lead to promotion within their ranks.
wilson affirmative case in the sentencing phase focused on mitigating factors relating to his dickensian upbringing.his father was largely absent his mother was a drug addict and he lived in poverty either with them or with other relatives.state child services intervened on several occasions.wilson lived for a time with his grandmother in a apartment in the stapleton projects,along with twelve other people.when wilson was six years old,he was hospitalized three times for psychiatric difficulties,including suicidal tendencies.prior to his hospitalizations,child services had taken him away from his mother,and given him over to his aunt.wilson exhibited both sadness and aggression at school.his iq has been tested in the high.the defense also called members of wilson family to testify about his loving relationship with them,and how they would suffer if he is executed.
the defense received permission for wilson to read aloud an allocution of remorse,both to support the mitigating factors of remorse and acceptance of responsibility and to counter the prosecution aggravating factor of future dangerousness.the defense argues on appeal that the district court improperly limited the scope of wilson allocution of remorse and that the court rulings and the prosecution improper arguments on summation ultimately caused the jury to hold against him his allocution of remorse,his exercise of the right to trial,and the fact that he did not testify.
the jury unanimously voted to sentence wilson to death on each of the five capital counts.the special verdict form reports unanimous findings beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecution established the two statutory aggravating factors and each of the four aggravating factors.further,the jury unanimously found that mitigation factors were proven by a preponderance of the evidence.no juror found that wilson was remorseful or that he took responsibility for his actions.the district court entered judgment on march.wilson appeals from that judgment.
discussion 
two grounds of appeal would impact wilson convictions whether the evidence was sufficient to support a finding under the vicar statute that wilson committed the murders to maintain or increase his position in the gang see point i and whether the district court abused its discretion in curtailing that had bearing on whether wilson shot the detectives out of perceived see point ii.we affirm as to these claims and,therefore,affirm the convictions.
the remaining grounds of appeal challenge the sentence of death.these include whether the judge voir dire inquiries were improperly biased see point iii whether testimony in the penalty phase exceeded what is permissible under the constitution and the federal death penalty act,and required a corrective charge see point iv and whether a fellow inmate was acting as a government agent in eliciting admissions from wilson see point v.we reject those challenges.
however,we vacate the death sentences,and remand,on the grounds that two arguments made by the prosecution,both bearing on the critical issue of wilson claimed remorse and acceptance of responsibility,violated wilson constitutional rights see points vi and vii.these constitutional violations were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt see point viii,and so we vacate and remand.
wilson further appeals his sentence of death on additional grounds that we can reject without making new law see point ix.
wilson contends that the evidence was insufficient to support a jury finding that he had acted with any of the motives required for conviction under the vicar statute,and that his convictions on counts one and two of the indictment must therefore be vacated.
the vicar statute provides,in pertinent part 
whoever,as consideration for the receipt of,or as consideration for a promise or agreement to pay,anything of pecuniary value from an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity,or for the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position in an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity,murders any individual in violation of the laws of any state or the united states shall be punished by death or life imprisonment,or a fine under this title,or both.
a.the government undertook to show that wilson acted for pecuniary gain and for the purpose of maintaining or increasing position within the stapleton crew.id.because we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that wilson acted for status and position we need not consider pecuniary gain.
to show that wilson acted for the purpose of maintaining or increasing position,the prosecution must show i that wilson had a position in the enterprise,and ii that his general purpose in murdering detectives nemorin and andrews was to maintain or increase his position in the enterprise.united states concepcion,cir.m aintaining or increasing position in the racketeering enterprise need not have been defendant sole or principal motive.id.t he motive element is satisfied if the jury could properly infer that the defendant committed his violent crime because he knew it was expected of him by reason of his membership in the enterprise or that he committed it in furtherance of that membership.see also united states dhinsa,cir s ection encompasses violent crimes intended to preserve the defendant position in the enterprise or to enhance his reputation and wealth within that enterprise.emphasis omitted.
there is evidence that wilson murdered the two detectives in order to improve his position within the stapleton crew.jacobus made the connection between violence by crew members and status within the crew.he testified that he himself committed crimes to raise his status within the group,that wilson enjoyed a certain status due to his reputation for violence,and that violent acts,especially the murder of police officers,would enhance one status within the stapleton crew.that such conduct would enhance wilson status is confirmed by evidence of the crew violent character.the gang members regularly committed violent acts on behalf of the crew with fellow members.members were expected to adopt each other grievances,and to react with violence toward offending outsiders,including any member of the rival gang.the crew possessed firearms for use by its members.photographs show members of the stapleton crew brandishing firearms and displaying gang signs.rap lyrics written by a member celebrate the crew rivalry with the.finally,as diaz testified,wilson went from the murders to the apartment of one of the crew leaders,reported to those present that he had popped,shot his victims,and produced detective nemorin pistol.
in reviewing a conviction for sufficiency of evidentiary support,the trial evidence is viewed most favorably for the government and dall reasonable inferences a jury may have drawn favoring the government must be credited.united states wexler,cir.we affirm if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at emphasis omitted quoting jackson virginia.
we conclude without difficulty that there is sufficient evidence of wilson position in the enterprise.concepcion,at.it is a closer question whether wilson general purpose in murdering detectives nemorin and andrews was to maintain or increase his position in the enterprise,but we find sufficiency.
first,jacobus testified that violent acts by members of the stapleton crew enhance status within the group this testimony was reinforced by evidence that the crew encouraged and even glorified violence members regularly organized and committed violent crimes and retaliatory acts of violence the crew made available firearms for such purposes photographs and rap lyrics reflect group pride in its violent character.
second,there is evidence that the murders were contemplated and implicitly authorized by the group leaders.green directed wilson to commit the robbery,and it was decided that wilson would carry the firearm,which was provided by the crew.at the planning meeting in green apartment,which included the group leaders,it was acknowledged that wilson might have to use the gun with which they were going to commit the,that wilson might have to shoot one or more of the victims,and that one or another of the victims might be a cop or he may be trying to rob wilson or jacobus.when wilson was then asked whether he wanted to go ahead with the robbery,he deferred to green and of the group it was decided that the robbery would proceed notwithstanding the risks.
third,wilson actions after the murders suggest that he was proud of the crimes and wanted others to be made aware of them.when asked immediately after the murders why he had killed the officers,wilson responded with bravado,i do give a fuck about nobody and when wilson was returning to his apartment after the murders,he called out to a police car,w hat,are you looking for more trouble furthermore,wilson reported back to one of the crew the murders.finally,given the modest expected yield from the robbery the gun transaction totaled,the jury may rationally have concluded that wilson had an additional,motive for committing such a crime.
wilson argues that,in any event,maintenance or increment in gang status is not a purpose that falls within the category of qualifying statutory motives.the argument is premised on a distinction between status,which jacobus testified would be increased by violence,and position,the word used in the vicar statute.that distinction is not so clear as wilson makes it out to be in ordinary usage the words are synonyms,and in the dictionary they reference each other.one definition of status is position or rank in relation to others.webster third new international dictionary unabridged philip gove,ed.and position in turn,means social or official rank or status.id.at.position should not be construed so narrowly as to distinguish it from status.it does not matter,for example,that the stapleton crew did not promote by grade in a ramified hierarchy.
wilson contends that,on this record,status was at most a secondary or incidental motive for his crimes,and that the evidence therefore does not sustain a conviction under the vicar statute.see,united states thai,cir insufficient evidence to sustain vicar conviction because the only evidence of motive suggested defendant had acted for pecuniary gain united states jones,d,insufficient evidence to sustain conviction where there was little evidence that act was motivated by anything other than personal animus.wilson argues that in fact the primary motive was.however,the only evidence bearing upon a theory is testimony by jacobus that,when he and wilson returned to the detectives car following the murders,wilson found a gun under the driver seat,and said t hey was going to get us before we got them.this statement says nothing about wilson belief or motivation at any point prior to the moment he found the gun,after the deed was already done.in any event,the evidence discussed supports a jury finding that incremental status was one of wilson primary motives that is enough.see united states farmer,cir the government was not required to prove that defendant sole or principal motive was maintaining or increasing his position,so long as it proved that enhancement of status was among his purposes.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
finally,wilson argues that there is no evidence the murders increased wilson status in fact.this argument is foreclosed by farmer,at t he question is not whether defendant position was advanced in fact by the murder he committed,but whether his purpose in committing the murder was to benefit his position.
accordingly,we hold that sufficient evidence supported wilson convictions for murder in aid of racketeering in violation of,counts one and two of the indictment.
soon after the murders,wilson returned to the stapleton apartment of green.according to the testimony of was in the apartment with announced that he had popped the two victims.green did not testify but he was the subject of a brady letter,according to which green informed the government that wilson actually said that he killed the victims because they were going to rob us.see generally brady maryland.green material indicated that wilson also said the victims were pulling out their weapons.see united states rigas,cir noting that codif ies the government disclosure obligations during criminal proceedings.
for the first time,on,the defense asked diaz if he had heard wilson make the statements attributed to him in the brady letter and other related statements.the court sustained the prosecution repeated objections that the questions were outside the scope of redirect.the relevant passage in the government directexamination of diaz is as follows 
prosecution what did wilson say 
diaz i do remember his exact words,but he said something to the e ffect that he popped him.
prosecution the word pop you used,is that a word that the defendant used 
wilson concedes that d efense counsel did not diaz about what wilson said on his return to green apartment.on this topic,touched only on whether diaz had a clear memory of wilson declaration that he had popped the victims.on redirect,the government therefore rehabilitated diaz memory of wilson admission 
prosecution when the defendant said i popped them,what did you understand him to mean 
diaz that he shot them.
prosecution shot who 
diaz the victims.
prosecution human beings people 
the government concluded diaz redirect with the following line of questioning 
prosecution do you have any doubt,any doubt at all,that when you got back to omar green house,that wilson came into the house and said i popped them do you have any doubt about that 
defense objection to the leading form of the question,your honor.
court you may answer.
prosecution do you have any doubt about that,sir 
on recross,defense counsel turned to wilson admission that he had popped the victims 
defense wilson said more than popped him,is that correct 
defense he said something like they pulled out,did you hear that 
prosecution outside the scope,your honor.objection.
court sustained.
defense he said something like,they were trying to rob us 
prosecution objection.
court sustained.
defense do you remember hearing anything like that 
prosecution objection,judge.outside the scope.
court sustained.
defense there were more words than popped him,is that correct,sir 
prosecution objection.the same objection.
court you may answer.
defense you do remember those other words,is that correct,sir 
prosecution objection.that not what he said.
court sustained.
defense while all this was going on,you were a nervous wreck,is that correct,sir 
defense thank you.
wilson contends that this curtailment of diaz recross was error,that diaz answers might have indicated that wilson acted out of a perceived need for,and that reasonable doubt thereby would have been raised regarding wilson pecuniary and position motives for the murders.
should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.the court may,in the exercise of discretion,permit inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination.b.the scope and extent of are generally within the sound discretion of the trial court,and the decision to restrict will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.united states rosa,cir.in the exercise of discretion,a district court should consider the need to ascertain the truth,avoid needless consumption of time,and protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.a see also delaware van arsdall,explaining that the district court has wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on.based on concerns about,among other things,interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.a good faith basis for proposed questions is relevant to these considerations.on the facts of this case,we detect no abuse of discretion in the district court control of diaz.
the precluded questions were outside the scope of diaz.as the transcript excerpts show,the defense effort on recross was to place wilson admission in the context of other and additional statements,whereas the government had returned to the subject on redirect for the sole purpose of countering the defense attack on the clarity of diaz memory concerning that one admission.even though the precluded questions were outside the scope of redirect,the district court retained discretion to permit them.but wilson failed to adduce his good faith basis for the precluded questions or explain the significance of diaz potential answers,and did not request a sidebar conference to argue any basis upon which the district court should have permitted this line of questioning.see jones berry,cir a party whose prospective questioning is threatened with curtailment should make all reasonable efforts to alert the court to the relevance and importance of the proposed questions.
no doubt,there was a good faith basis for wilson precluded questions but the trial court was not made aware of it.the brady disclosure which,along with green material,furnished the good faith basis was copied to and discussed with the district court on august.however,more than three months intervened before diaz december.green himself did not testify,and the district court had no occasion to review the brady disclosure or green material in preparation for testimony by diaz.there is no reason to believe that the good faith basis for the precluded questions would have been fresh in the district court mind,and there is no indication of any defense effort to refresh.
moreover,there is no reason to believe that the district court would have understood the significance of diaz potential answers.defense counsel could have asked the precluded questions on diaz,and the judge could assume that the questions would have been asked then if they were of great import.furthermore,the precluded questions represented a wholly new departure.throughout the guilt phase,wilson theory of the case was that jacobus pulled the trigger,not wilson,whereas the precluded questions were based on the idea that wilson pulled the trigger,albeit out of a perceived need for selfpreservation.
accordingly,we detect no abuse of discretion in the district court control of diaz,and we therefore find no error.
as we find no error in the guilt phase,we affirm wilson convictions.
the district court declined to include in its written jury questionnaire the following question,proposed by wilson 
if ronell wilson is found guilty of murder for the intentional killings of detectives nemorin and andrews,without any legal excuse or justification,the defense might present evidence at a sentencing phase of the trial about ronell wilson childhood and background in support of a sentence other than the death penalty.how relevant is information like that to you when making a decision about punishment for murder wilson requested similar questions during oral voir dire,but the district court declined to pursue the subject uniformly,or at the level of particularity wilson sought.a counterpart to this issue is wilson eighth amendment in the margin the prosecution penalty phase summations improperly urged the jury to give little or no weight to wilson mitigation evidence.
wilson assigns constitutional error to these refusals,argues in addition that the propounding of specific questions requested by the prosecution conferred unfair advantage in identifying prospective jurors,and requests that we vacate his death sentence and remand for resentencing 
when a district court chooses to examine veniremen itself,it may ask questions submitted by counsel if the court considers the questions proper.a b.refusal is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states lawes,cir.that discretion,however,is subject to constitutional limits.united states kyles,cir.the trial court must ask a proposed voir dire question if refusal would render the defendant trial fundamentally unfair.virginia,see also morgan illinois,fundamental unfairness arises if voir dire is not adequate to identify unqualified jurors.morgan,at.in capital cases,a juror is constitutionally unqualified if he has views on capital punishment that would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.that category includes those prospective jurors who would always impose death following conviction.id.at.thus,in morgan,sole reliance on general to willingness to follow the court instructions on the law even though you may not agree and ability to be fair and impartial did not afford defense counsel an opportunity to identify and challenge for cause those jurors who would automatically impose the death penalty id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
voir dire in this case proceeded in two stages.first,veniremen completed a questionnaire that included,inter alia,questions about background,relevant media exposure,opinions and biases,and ability to follow the law and discharge a juror duty.one question proposed by the government asked whether the fact that the victims were killed while working undercover and posing as individuals engaging in illegal conduct would affect your ability to fairly and impartially evaluate the evidence in this case.another asked whether 
you hold any beliefs or opinions that would affect your ability to evaluate testimony given pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government from witnesses who have lengthy histories of narcotics trafficking and violent criminal conduct and have pled guilty to some of the most serious crimes in the indictment.
with respect to capital punishment,the questionnaire advised 
should a penalty phase be necessary,the question for the jury to decide is whether the defendant should be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment without the possibility of release.the jury makes this decision by weighing a variety of factors.
the court proceeded to ask the following questions 
do you have any personal beliefs about what the law is or should be regarding the death penalty that would affect your ability to follow the court legal instructions 
would knowing that the defendant faced the death penalty as a possible punishment make you reluctant to impose a sentence of life without the possibility of release even if you thought the circumstances of the case warranted a sentence 
second,the district court orally examined prospective jurors in person.at the outset of oral voir dire,the district court read a statement to the venire 
the indictment charges,among other things,that in march of,the defendant murdered two undercover police officers,detectives james nemorin and rodney andrews,who were attempting to purchase firearms from wilson and other members of the stapleton crew.
the court emphasized,as it had in the jury questionnaire 
should a penalty phase be necessary,the question for the jury to decide is whether the defendant should be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment without the possibility of release.the jury makes this decision by weighing a variety of factors.
thereafter,the district court started questioning the individual veniremen,outside the presence of the other prospective jurors.counsel was not permitted to ask questions,though both proffered inquiries for the court to make.
with two exceptions,each member of the petit jury whose voir dire wilson was asked some variation of the following question concerning evidence of character and background w ould you be willing to consider evidence about the convicted individual character and background of this case and listen to argument from the defense that the death penalty should not be imposed in this case and each challenged member of the petit jury with one exception was asked some variation of the following question would you be able to meaningfully consider life in prison instead of the death penalty as the correct punishment for someone who commits a murder 
what was done was constitutionally sufficient,and the district court refusal of wilson proffered questions was not error.each juror was informed that in the event of conviction the jury would determine the sentence based on various factors,and most of them were informed that those factors would include wilson character and background.and each juror confirmed,by questionnaire and in person,that he could meaningfully consider life in prison as a possible sentence.morgan requires nothing more.see at see also united states tipton,cir finding morgan satisfied where district court asked questions sufficient to determine whether any venireman would automatically vote for death.the district court was not required to allow inquiry into each juror views as to specific mitigating factors as long as the voir dire was adequate to detect those in the venire who would automatically vote for the death penalty.united states mccullah,cir see also id.at.
wilson argues that there is a great disparity between the questioning allowed the prosecution and what wilson was allowed.however,morgan demands adequacy,not parity.it requires only that defendants be afforded an opportunity to identify constitutionally biased jurors.
in any event,the record does not reflect the disparity wilson alleges.he cites four alleged points of error i the district court asked whether juror impartiality would be affected by the fact that the victims were undercover police officers posing as individuals engaged in illegal conduct ii the court asked whether jurors held any beliefs or opinions affecting their ability to evaluate testimony from cooperating witnesses iii the court informed the venire that the murders were multiple and iv the court informed the venire that the victims were police officers.
wilson argues that the two questions afforded the prosecution more information than the defense was allowed,and that the reference to two victims,both police detectives,highlighted two of the expected aggravating factors,making each subsequent question more particularized and thus more helpful to the government.viewed in the context of a lengthy questionnaire and extensive oral examination,the two cited questions are hardly sufficient to render the voir dire meaningfully imbalanced,especially since the answers would have been helpful to the defense as well as the prosecution.as to disclosing that there were two victims,both of them police officers,those facts were also built into questions that the defense affirmatively sought,and can not be deemed prejudicial.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting wilson proposed written and oral voir dire questions.
during the penalty phase,one of the four aggravating factors that the prosecution undertook to prove was victim impact.the jury unanimously found that the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that d efendant ronell wilson caused loss,injury,and harm to the victims and the victims families.
to prove this aggravating factor,the prosecution called ten witnesses seven family members of the murdered detectives including and three police officers who testified that the murders caused them anguish and had a profound influence on other officers who worked with detectives andrews and nemorin,and who admired them personally and professionally.
wilson challenges the victim impact evidence on three grounds i the testimony of members,the three police officers was outside the constitutional and statutory scope of admissible victim impact evidence in a capital case ii the testimony in the aggregate was prejudicially emotional and the court failed to give proper jury instructions to counteract this and iii the jury improperly inferred and took into account the witnesses views on sentencing.we hold that all of the testimony was correctly admitted and that the jury instructions were proper.
the constitution.the eighth amendment does not erect a per se bar to the admission of victim impact evidence in a death penalty case.payne tennessee.evidence concerning the personal characteristics of a victim and the effect of a murder on survivors i s simply another form or method of informing the sentencing authority about the specific harm caused by the defendant crime in a capital case.id.at evidence of harm is evidence of a general type long considered by sentencing authorities.
at issue in payne was testimony from a family member of the victims but while the holding of payne is therefore expressed in those terms,id.at,nothing in the court reasoning suggests that the principle is so limited.elsewhere in the opinion,the court states that a factfinder should be allowed to measure the specific harm the defendant caused by committing the murder,id.at,a phrase broad enough to embrace the loss felt by friends or who were close to the victim.the opinion refers repeatedly to the specific harm caused as encompassing loss felt by community or society.id.at,see also id.at,concurring.
we therefore hold that the constitution allows evidence from members about their own grief and about the loss felt by other members.other circuits are in accord.see,united states bolden,cir united states fields,cir united states barrett,cir united states nelson,cir united states bernard,cir.
the fdpa.wilson also argues that the federal death penalty act fdpa,et,limits victim impact evidence to impact on family members.the fdpa governs whether and under what circumstances a sentence of death may be imposed on a defendant,and includes the requirement that the government prove one or more specified aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt in order to establish that a defendant is eligible for the death penalty.c.the government may also present additional,aggravating factors in order to convince the jury that the defendant deserves a death sentence,so long as the government gives notice of which factors are to be presented.id.
as the fdpa was enacted after payne,congress specifically indicated that victim impact evidence could be included as a aggravating factor 
the factors for which notice is provided under this subsection may include factors concerning the effect of the offense on the victim and the victim family,and may include oral testimony,a victim impact statement that identifies the victim of the offense and the extent and scope of the injury and loss suffered by the victim and the victim family,and any other relevant information.
a.wilson argues that this provision should be read to limit victim impact evidence to impact on the family alone.we read this passage as language of inclusion,not exclusion.it speaks to what may be include d.see also c the jury,or if there is no jury,the court,may consider whether any other aggravating factor for which notice has been given exists.the final phrase and any other relevant information,though ambiguous,is read most naturally as a for what may be deemed relevant by the court.wilson reading assumes that unless the victim has family,no one suffered loss other than the that a distant cousin may testify,but not a fiancé or a partner or a friend or a colleague.
other circuits allow testimony from friends including friends who are regarding the impact of a victim death,rejecting challenges similar to wilson.barrett,at allowing testimony from police colleagues of victim,and rejecting argument that congress limited victim impact evidence in federal death penalty cases to evidence concerning the effect of the offense on the victim and the victim family internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also fields,at allowing victim impact testimony from members nelson,at same bernard,at same.
utilitarian loss and societal harm.wilson argues in the alternative that,even if impacts are not excluded categorically,the constitution and fdpa prohibit evidence of utilitarian losses to a workplace or evidence of the victims professional accomplishments.the police officers here testified for the most part that i the victims had close relationships with their families ii the victims continue to be mourned by members of the new york police department who worked with them,including the witnesses themselves and iii the victims were exemplary,heroic policemen.wilson argues only the first type of this testimony is admissible.we disagree.
wilson relies on the tenth circuit decision in fields,which distinguished between who were also friends with the victim who could testify and per se who could not.at.the court disapproved of testimony focused on impersonal utilitarian considerations such as the loss of the victim contribution to an office,unit,or team the kind of loss that businesses insure with key man policies.id.holding nonetheless that the testimony at issue in the case came from a who was a friend and therefore was acceptable.whether or not we are persuaded by fields,the victims colleagues in this case testified to personal loss,even though it concerned in part loss experienced in a workplace that fosters intense loyalty and camaraderie.they did not adduce the impersonal utilitarian considerations that concerned the court in fields and therefore the colleagues testimony was properly admitted.
wilson characterizes as utilitarian in character the testimony describing detectives andrews and nemorin as heroic individuals who loved their work and inspired other policemen.such testimony is permissible to show a victim uniqueness as an individual human being.see payne,at internal quotation marks omitted.as the payne concurrence explains,the prosecution may,consistent with the constitution,show all that is special and unique about the victim,including their hopes,dreams,and fears.id.at,concurring.
to demonstrate that victims in capital cases were special and unique human beings,courts have allowed testimony concerning a victim professional life.see,barrett,at allowing testimony about the personal and professional characteristics of the victim bernard,at allowing testimony that the victims were religious youth ministers in part b ecause religion played a vital role in their lives,and so it would be impossible to describe their uniqueness as individual human beings without reference to their faith internal quotation marks omitted united states mcveigh,cir numerous witnesses testified about the professional and personal histories of victims who perished in the bombing,including reflections on the admirable qualities of the deceased.
the police officers testimony that dealt with the victims outstanding careers,including the excerpted documentary videotape that showed detective nemorin discussing his job,was therefore properly admitted.
finally,wilson contends that the testimony by the police officers went beyond evidence of the specific harm caused by the defendant,as allowed in payne,and invoked a generalized community harm.see fields,at noting its concern with replacing a focus on persons closely or immediately connected to the victim with a wide view encompassing generalized notions of social value and loss.however,no prohibition on such evidence is generally recognized.see,united states battle,cir allowing testimony about how much more difficult a prison was to administer after the murder of a guard bernard,at allowing testimony related to the victim proselytizing due to its relevance to a community loss at the victims demise quoting south carolina gathers,dissenting,overruled by payne.
in any event,once the testimony of the detectives heroism and professional accomplishments is properly characterized as evidence of their uniqueness as human beings,and therefore admissible,wilson argument on generalized societal harm comes down to a single sentence one police colleague testified that the murder of detective andrews robbed the city of new york of another layer of security,and,more importantly,took away a father from his children.in that sentence,harm to the city is expressly subordinated to the harm suffered by the victim children.moreover,the reference to societal harm does not appear to go beyond the scope of what is deemed permissible payne references harm to society or community,but teaches that the constitution allows only evidence that describes the specific harm caused by the crime.see payne,at,see also id.at,concurring.
the victim impact testimony given by the victims police colleagues was admitted without error.
due process is violated when victim impact evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair.payne,at.similarly,the fdpa requires remand if the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion,prejudice,or any other arbitrary factor.c a.wilson argues that his sentence was an arbitrary outcome resulting from unduly prejudicial victim impact testimony.
wilson concedes that he lodged no contemporaneous objection to the testimony.we thus review for plain error.see puckett united states.we conclude there was no error in the admission of the testimony,or in the district court refusal to grant a mistrial.
the family members of detectives andrews and nemorin delivered emotionally charged testimony.the anguished testimony of detective nemorin widow described how her children visit the cemetery on father day and other occasions,write letters to their father,and embrace his headstone.even such testimony does not appear to exceed or approach the margins of what has been allowed it can not be expected that victim impact testimony will be cool and dispassionate.some deaths cause more suffering than others.the only way to ensure against victim impacts caused by one murder of a human being is to take care to murder no one at all.
courts are reluctant to conclude that the jury was unduly prejudiced by emotional testimony if the defendant presented mitigating factors that the jury found proven and if the trial court instructed the jury about not giving a verdict based on emotion.see mcveigh,at see also nelson,at discussing how the presentation of mitigators reduces risk of jury prejudice from victim impact evidence.we presume that juries follow instructions and a jury diligent and dispassionate enough to find mitigating factors is unlikely to have been overmastered by emotion.see richardson marsh,juries are presumed to follow instructions.wilson jury found mitigating factors,one of them peer pressure a factor not even argued by the defense.we therefore go on to consider the instructions to the jury.
consistent with the statutory prohibition,the jury was charged not to rule on the basis of passion,prejudice,or arbitrary factors.see c.before the final five victim impact witnesses testified,wilson requested that the court instruct the jury not to be overpowered by emotion.the judge complied and told the jury that 
you are about to hear more testimony about the impact of the murders on the victims family members and colleagues.the law permits you to hear this evidence.however,by its nature,it is highly emotional.i instruct you not to let this evidence overwhelm your ability to follow the law as i will instruct you before deliberations.you must decide the proper punishment without undue passion or prejudice.
before final deliberations,the court charged 
in engaging in the weighing process,you must avoid any influence of passion,prejudice,or undue sympathy.your deliberations should be based upon the evidence you have seen and heard and the law on which i have instructed you.passion,prejudice,and arbitrary considerations have no role to play in your efforts to reach a just result in this case.
see c.these instructions were sound 
we conclude that the testimony was not overly prejudicial and was admitted without error.
t he admission of a victim family members characterizations and opinions about the crime,the defendant,and the appropriate sentence violates the eighth amendment.payne,at.wilson argues that the jurors were improperly influenced because they could infer that the victim impact witnesses wanted execution.however,no evidence as to the witnesses preferred sentence was actually admitted.because there was no evidence to exclude,this claim necessarily fails 
the victim impact evidence presented in this case was properly admitted,was not overly prejudicial,and was considered in the light of jury instructions that were properly framed.
shabucalik geralds,a gang associate of wilson and a former member of the bloods,testified for the prosecution about the bloods one of wilson affiliations and about an admission made by wilson when both men were confined in the same prison unit.wilson argues that geralds was a government agent at the time wilson confided to him that his,wilson,efforts on behalf of the bloods entitled him to senior status in the gang,and hence that the testimony was inadmissible under the supreme court decision in massiah united states.wilson contention that geralds and another witness gave testimony about the bloods that was inadmissible is rejected in the margin 
wilson had met geralds through fellow bloods members green and whitten.when wilson encountered geralds during wilson detention,geralds was subject to a cooperation agreement in another case.in their first conversation in prison,geralds testified,geralds mentioned that a blood known as the original gangster staten island or og si was in the same prison.wilson expressed the view that this og si was a government informant,and added with a smile that wilson himself should be the og si because he had put in sufficient work.geralds clarified for the jury that work meant violence,and that killing police officers would constitute this kind of work.geralds also testified that in later conversations,wilson enlisted geralds help in finding a woman who would bear his child,and in checking out the gang status of a fellow inmate.
wilson objected on the ground that geralds was acting as a government agent when he elicited these admissions,and that admission of geralds testimony regarding his prison conversations with wilson therefore would violate wilson sixth amendment right to counsel.massiah,at holding that surreptitious interrogations after defendant indictment conducted outside the presence of counsel violated defendant right to counsel.a jailhouse informant is deemed to have conducted an interrogation in violation of a defendant sixth amendment massiah rights if the informant was acting as a government agent who deliberately elicit ed the incriminating information information is only excluded if it is obtained as a result of the government intentional efforts.united states stevens,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court denied wilson objection after a hearing based on geralds testimony at this hearing,i find that he did not act as a government agent when he spoke with wilson,that he did not deliberately elicit any statements from wilson,and that the government made no intentional effort to obtain statements from wilson through geralds.united states wilson,d,quoting stevens,at.
the standard of review for evaluating the district court ruling on a suppression motion is clear error as to the district court factual findings,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,and de novo as to questions of law.united states rodriguez,cir.the sequence of events is as follows,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government geralds became a cooperator in the course of cooperation,before geralds or the prosecutors knew that wilson and geralds were in the same prison unit,geralds identified wilson as a gang member known to him,and was questioned by prosecutors about wilson wilson learned that geralds was housed nearby and initiated contact with him geralds and wilson had their conversation about wilson pretension to be the og si geralds reported this conversation to prosecutors,who instructed geralds to not get any information from wilson in further conversations,geralds and wilson discussed topics from girls to music to cars,and wilson asked for help in finding a woman and in checking on the gang status of another inmate.
even assuming that geralds deliberately elicited information from wilson in the first conversation about og si,geralds was not a government agent at that time.more than a cooperation agreement is required to make an informant a government agent with regard to a particular defendant.united states birbal,cir.an informant becomes a government agent a defendant when the informant is instructed by the police to get information about the particular defendant.id.this first prison conversation was initiated by wilson,and geralds was under no government influence.true,the prosecutors had showed interest in wilson in a meeting with geralds before this before wilson or the prosecutors knew that geralds would meet wilson in evincing interest did not amount to an instruction sufficient to make geralds a government agent.united states henry,holding that an informant was a government agent where the investigators were aware that the informant had access to the defendant and they singled out the defendant.
further assuming arguendo that geralds became a government agent after he reported the og si conversationwhen the prosecutors knew that geralds had access to wilson and had delivered information about testimony still did not violate wilson sixth amendment rights.there is no evidence that geralds did anything in the later conversations with wilson but follow the government instructions to merely listen.see kuhlmann wilson.
in any event,the only damaging admission to which geralds testified was wilson claim to og si status in the first conversation,at which point geralds was not a government agent.geralds testimony did not infringe wilson sixth amendment right to counsel.
during summation,the prosecution made the following argument to the jury,of which the emphasized passage is challenged 
ronell wilson up until the very moment that he addressed you last week has done everything he could to escape responsibility for his crimes.he has an absolute right to go to trial,put the government to its burden of proof,to prove he committed these crimes,but he ca have it both ways.he ca do that,then say i accept responsibility.defense objection overruled.and say i sorry,only after you prove i did it.that not acceptance of responsibility.that is a manipulative criminal saying what he has to,saying what he knows you want to hear when it in his interest to say it.
at emphasis added.wilson argues that this comment unconstitutionally burdened his sixth amendment right to a jury trial.we agree 
under the unconstitutional conditions doctrine,the government may not do indirectly what it can not do directly.united states oliveras,cir per curiam.the doctrine keeps the prosecution from trench ing on a defendant constitutional rights and privileges.united states parker,cir.the prosecution can not use the defendant exercise of specific fundamental constitutional guarantees against him at trial.burns gammon,cir.for that reason,a statute can not disallow the death penalty for those who plead guilty but allow it for those who exercise their right to a trial.united states jackson.by the same token,a scheme can not allow the jury to draw an adverse inference from constitutionally protected conduct such as a request for trial by jury if the government invites the jury to find the existence of an aggravating factor based on inferences from conduct that is constitutionally protected for example the request for trial by jury,due process of law would require that the jury decision to impose death be set aside.zant stephens.
we maintain a distinction between increasing the severity of a sentence for a defendant failure to cooperate and refusing to grant leniency.united states stratton,cir emphasis added.stratton itself illustrates the ratchet it is permissible for a sentencing court to consider that,if the defendant were willing to assist us to bring the other person to justice,i would find it very easy to be reasonable and lenient,id.quoting mallette scully,cir,but it is unconstitutional to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences solely on account of the defendant failure to cooperate,id.similarly,the federal sentencing guidelines treat acceptance of responsibility usually via a plea as a basis for leniency,see sentencing guidelines manual,but do not provide a harsher sentence for failure to plead.
this distinction is the only rule that recognizes the reality of the criminal justice system while protecting the integrity of that system.mallette,at.sometimes the rule may be difficult to apply,or even somewhat illusory,stratton,at internal quotation marks omitted but not in this case.in purpose and effect,the government used wilson demand for trial to evidence lack of remorse and refusal to accept responsibility,characteristics offered to undermine wilson defenses to a sentence of death.the government also emphasized wilson lack of remorse as support for the aggravating factor of future dangerousness.see.at what else tells you about the incredible danger that this man poses the fact that the defendant has absolutely,absolutely no remorse whatsoever for his actions.in so doing,the prosecution contravened zant,at,and jackson,at,and crossed the line drawn in stratton,at 
whether a sentencing differential is a reward for cooperation or a penalty for invoking a constitutional right depends on the normal sentence that would be meted out if constitutional rights were not salient.united states klotz,cir.there is no doubt that the baseline sentence in this case is life without parole,and that a verdict of death is an increase in severity.to achieve a death penalty,the government was required to prove the aggravating factors justifying death beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury.see c,e.wilson constitutionally protected decision to go to trial was cited as a reason to sentence him to death,and thus to enhance what would otherwise be a life sentence.
the government relies heavily on united states mikos,cir,which observes if it is proper to take confessions,guilty pleas,and vows to improve one life into account when deciding whether a murderer should be put to it is unquestionably proper for the judge or jury to do it must also be proper for the prosecutor to remind the jury when none of these events has occurred.internal citation omitted.mikos then suggests that of the sentencing guidelines institutionalize s this practice,and that in a capital case what happens automatically as a result of must be argued for.the two are equally appropriate.id.we are unpersuaded.the quoted language is arguably dicta,id.at if error occurred in this penalty proceeding,it was harmless.it conflicts with earlier seventh circuit precedent,see united states saunders,cir u nder the unconstitutional conditions doctrine a defendant may not be subjected to more severe punishment for exercising his or her constitutional right to stand trial.and it misconstrues section of the sentencing guidelines,which does not contemplate increased punishment for a failure to cooperate 
for these reasons,we conclude that the government unconstitutionally burdened wilson sixth amendment right to trial because wilson fifth amendment rights were also unconstitutionally burdened see point vii we consider harmlessness cumulatively see point viii.
at the start of the sentencing phase,defense counsel advised the court that wilson wanted to read to the jury a statement of remorse in his own words,without taking the witness stand.on advice of counsel,the statement would omit any evidentiary discussion of the crime itself.the government objected on the grounds that the statement was to be unsworn and not subject to.
following a series of disputes concerning the permissible scope of wilson allocution wilson read this statement of remorse to the jury 
good afternoon.i,ronell wilson,wrote a statement that i want to read to you,the jury.i want you to understand my deepest sorrow towards the victim s family and friends.i have seen the pain that i have caused the family and friends of the victims and to my own family and friends.i know that the wives and children and loved ones are also victims.
i would never wish this for anyone because i know how painful it is.so i can not be remorse less and show no sympathy to these men families and friends.
i am not good with words.i wish i could explain myself more better,but i am not i am truly sorry for the pain i have caused them all.i know that i have caused a great deal of pain to them all and i say it again and again,i am so sorry.
i am sorry that i caused so much pain throughout my life to others,especially my family and the families of the victims.
i know that the victims families may not accept my apology but i pray that god will give them all the comfort and strength that they need to move on from this tragedy.i have the same prayer for my family also.
before summations,wilson consented to an instruction allowing the jury to consider that his statement of remorse was neither sworn nor subject to,and that charge was ultimately given to the jury.wilson request for the following instruction was denied 
y ou may draw no inference whatsoever from the fact that the defendant has chosen not to testify at the sentencing phase of this trial.he is entitled to make that choice and there may be many reasons for him having done so.the fact that he did not testify is,quite simply,to play no part whatsoever in your at this stage.
in its summation,the prosecution properly pointed out that wilson allocution was unsworn and uncrossed,but then went on to emphasize wilson decision not to testify the problem wording is emphasized 
i want to talk to you a minute about the statement itself.you may have noticed that when he made that statement,ronell wilson was sitting up there on the witness stand under oath,subject to.he chose to do it from there indicating.the path for that witness stand has never been blocked for wilson,had that opportunity too.he chose,like many other things in this case,to do it that way.
you may ask yourselves well,what more would we have if he took that stand,what would be the difference well,we might have been able to ask him when did you come up with this how did you come up with it why did you come up with it why now why now of all times are you sorry we might be able to test the credibility of the statement,the veracity of it.you might have information that could help you decide if you need to believe it.ronell wilson did want that.he wanted to say it from there,take my word for it now after all this,i sorry.
at emphasis added.
after summation,defense counsel argued that the prosecution had suggest ed that he should have taken the stand and been under oath my concern is that the jury should come away with the misimpression that somehow the defendant has the burden of taking the stand in a capital case and be subjected to.that just not the defendant burden.the defense requested a curative be inserted in the charge that explained how to evaluate the statement of it not the burden of the defendant to take the stand or to be subjected to.the government maintained that its argument was proper.the court instructed the jurors that,w hen considering the defendant statement of january,you may take into account that the defendant made the statement without being sworn in and without subjecting himself to crossexamination.but the court gave neither of the requested instructions.
wilson concedes on appeal that it was within bounds for the prosecution to comment in summation that the allocution was not made under oath and was not subject to crossexamination.wilson argues,however,that the allocution did not effect a waiver of his fifth amendment right and that the prosecution therefore violated that right by telling the jury that t he path to that witness stand has never been blocked for wilson.that approach accords with the view of some courts,which have distinguished between comments that focus on the fact that an allocution was unsworn and uncrossed deemed permissible and comments that emphasize the defendant failure to testify deemed impermissible.see,depew anderson,cir united states martin aguilar,state.skatzes,wl,at.we consider,however,that this permeable line is ineffective for preserving the right it is altogether too likely that a jury will naturally and sensibly equate testimony under oath subject to with testimony from the witness stand.we adopt a different approach,premised on waiver,a principle that inheres in the uncontroversial rule that prosecutors can emphasize that an allocution is unsworn and uncrossed.we start with first principles.
it is settled that prosecutors may not comment adversely on a defendant invocation of his fifth amendment privilege not to testify.griffin california,t he fifth amendment forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.this protection extends to capital sentencing proceedings.see estelle smith,we can discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of respondent capital murder trial so far as the protection of the fifth amendment privilege is concerned.to secure these protections,the fifth amendment requires that a criminal trial judge must give a jury instruction when requested by a defendant to do so.carter kentucky.
the test governing whether a prosecutor statements amount to an improper comment on the accused silence in violation of the fifth amendment looks at the statements in context and examines whether they naturally and necessarily would be interpreted by the jury as a comment on the defendant failure to testify.united states knoll,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,a defendant conduct can result in a limited waiver of his fifth amendment rights against selfincrimination and against the drawing of an adverse inference from his invocation of that right.for example,a defendant who testifies on direct can not claim fifth amendment immunity from on matters that his own direct testimony put into dispute brown united states,see also harrison united states,a defendant who chooses to testify waives his privilege against compulsory with respect to the testimony he gives lesko lehman,cir explaining that an adverse inference may be drawn when the defendant has testified as to some facts concerning the crime charged,but has refused to testify as to other facts within his knowledge.limited waiver accommodates the need of both sides for the opportunity to meet fairly the evidence and arguments of one another.united states robinson,see also id.at,holding that government argument that defendant could have taken the stand and explained it to you,anything he wanted to,was permissible because it fairly respond ed to an argument of the defendant.
applying the principles of limited waiver articulated in these cases,we hold that an unsworn,uncrossed allocution constitutes a limited fifth amendment waiver that allows the prosecution to argue for an adverse inference from a defendant failure to testify as to that to which he has allocuted.accord booth state,explaining that the defendant allocution constitutes,at a minimum,a waiver of any privilege to avoid comment by the prosecutor on the allocution,rev on other grounds,booth maryland,overruled by,payne tennessee.thus,wilson allocution constituted a limited waiver of his right under griffin to be free from adverse comment on his failure to testify and of his right under carter to a blanket jury instruction prohibiting the jurors from considering his silence.
although wilson allocution effected a limited waiver of the fifth amendment rights he enjoyed under griffin and waiver was limited.the prosecution attempted conscientiously to focus solely on the subject matter of the allocution and to maintain that context.even so,there is something expansive about saying t he path to that witness stand has never been blocked for wilson,and a juror could think that never is a period that extends back to the guilt phase of the trial and extends as well to the full penalty phase rather than just to the reading of the allocution.in any event,and despite his limited waiver,wilson remained entitled to a carter instruction upon request.
neither request made by wilson was wholly free from defect.the charge that wilson requested was a fair statement of law at the time.true,it did not take into account the adverse inference that may be drawn from the expression of remorse by allocution rather than by testimony but that is doctrine clarified in this opinion.the instruction that wilson sought would have barred a permissible adverse inference from wilson failure to express remorse from the witness stand.
nevertheless,the denial of any carter instruction risked transforming wilson limited waiver into a complete one,particularly in view of some wording in the government summation.the district court should have issued a variant of the carter instruction that allowed the jurors to consider wilson failure to testify as to the subject of his allocution,but that forbid them from considering his failure to testify for any other purpose or as to any other part of the defense case 
we next consider whether this error combined with the sixth amendment error see point vi requires us to vacate the death sentences.
wilson has adequately preserved both his sixth and fifth amendment claims harmless error review therefore applies.see satterwhite texas.accordingly,we will vacate the sentences unless the prosecution can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a constitutional error did not contribute to the verdict.id.because there are two errors,we consider whether vacatur is required by these errors in the aggregate.see united states rahman,cir per curiam t he effect of multiple errors in a single trial may cast such doubt on the fairness of the proceedings that a new trial is warranted,even if no single error requires reversal.
the prosecution cited two constitutional elections made by go to trial and not to reasons to reject two of wilson offered mitigators acceptance of responsibility and remorse.and the government then cited the lack of remorse as evidence of an aggravating factor wilson future dangerousness.see.at what else tells you about the incredible danger that this man poses the fact that the defendant has absolutely,absolutely no remorse whatsoever for his actions.at now,during jury selection,many of you talked about wanting to believe that someone who committed murder would wake up every day and feel sorry about it,feel some remorse about what he had done.well,ronell wilson is not that person.
moreover,the focus on wilson decision to elect a trial had an uncontrollable resonance for the jury.after acknowledging wilson absolute right to go to trial,the government suggested that if wilson had accepted responsibility,he would not have put the government to its burden of proof,to prove he committed these crimes.not incidentally,however,the burden thus placed on the prosecution to mount its case placed a counterpart burden on the jurors to sit through it.
these arguments were juror found that wilson accepted responsibility or showed remorse,and every juror found that wilson presented a risk of future dangerousness.
on these facts,it is hard to see how the government can prove that these errors were harmless.indeed,the government emphasis on these arguments during summation suggests they were not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see clemons mississippi,the prosecution reliance on a particular issue bears on whether error regarding that issue is harmless.and the district court acknowledged that lack of remorse and future dangerousness as evidenced,in part if not in whole,by a lack of acceptance of responsibility were among the most influential factors that moved the jury to return a verdict of death.that insight accords with experience,intuition,and research the prosecution recognized as much in this case.see.at d uring jury selection.m ost of you talked about acceptance of responsibility and remorse and how important those things would be to you when you decide what punishment would be appropriate.
the harm might have been mitigated if the jury could have relied on a carter instruction given in the guilt phase.however,the district court instructions in the sentencing phase implied that the principle articulated during the guilt phase affirmatively did not apply to the sentencing phase 
i t is my responsibility to instruct you as to the law that governs this phase i t would be a violation of your oaths as jurors to base your sentencing decisions upon any view of the law other than that given to you in these instructions.
some of the legal principles that you must apply in this phase duplicate those you followed in reaching your verdict as to the guilt of this defendant.others are different.the instructions i am giving you now are a complete set of instructions about the law applicable to the penalty phase.
that complete set of instructions about the law applicable to the penalty phase omitted any principle.
in light of these considerations,we can not say beyond a reasonable doubt that the effects of the two constitutional errors were harmless accordingly,we vacate the death sentences only and remand to the district court for a new sentencing phase.
applying rules of law,we find that wilson arguments addressed in this point are meritless.however,in a death penalty case we are statutorily obliged to address all arguments in writing,and we do so here.c.
wilson asserts that in the penalty phase summations,the prosecution castigated defense counsel for i presenting the mitigating evidence,and ii shifting the blame for the murders to the victims and others.we will reverse on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct only if that misconduct caused substantial prejudice by so infecting the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.united states elias,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in assessing whether prosecutorial misconduct caused substantial prejudice,this court has adopted a test the severity of the misconduct,the measures adopted to cure the misconduct,and the certainty of conviction absent the misconduct.id.here,misconduct if any could not be deemed severe.see united states newton,cir cautioning against disproportionate emphasis on isolated incidents of alleged error elias,at t he severity of the misconduct is mitigated if the misconduct is an aberration in an otherwise fair proceeding.moreover,wilson can not show substantial prejudice the jury charge directed broad consideration of mitigation factors,and the challenged comments did not bolster the government aggravating factors or undermine wilson mitigating factors.
the district court instructed the jury that in order to decide that wilson constituted a future danger a nonstatutory aggravating factor,it needed to find that the defendant is likely to commit criminal acts of violence in the future that would constitute a continuing and serious threat to the lives and safety of others.emphasis added.wilson argues that the district court erred in rejecting his proposed jury instruction,which used both likely and probable to describe future dangerousness.
since the two words are synonymous,the court instruction viewed as a whole,see united states wilkerson,cir,did not mislead the jury as to the correct standard,see people randall,defining likely as synonymous with probable see also fadiga attorney of the,cir t he proper inquiry is whether there is a reasonable likelihood or,synonymously,a reasonable probability.wilson own proposed instruction used likely and probable interchangeably.wilson related argument that the prosecutor summation filled a supposed void as to the probability standard also fails,because any possible prejudice from the prosecutor summation was cured by the district court proper instruction.see united states salameh,cir per curiam.
wilson contends that the jury was left to think that failure to deliver a unanimous verdict would allow the court to impose some other,lesser sentence.in support,wilson cites the district court refusal to charge that if the jury deadlocked,wilson would be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole,coupled with two features of the special voting form,which i solicited a unanimous vote as to either death or life without the possibility of parole and ii for three of the capital counts,directed a jury that had not reached a unanimous vote on either sentencing option to vote on whether some other sentence authorized by law shall be imposed.wilson posits that a juror who would vote against the death penalty if a life sentence without the possibility of parole was the certain alternative might vote for death to avoid creating a deadlock that would allow wilson future release.
a capital defendant is not entitled to a jury instruction on the effect of deadlock.jones united states,t he proposed instruction has no bearing on the jury role in the sentencing process.rather,it speaks to what happens in the event that the jury is unable to fulfill its deliberations break down and the jury is unable to produce a unanimous sentence recommendation we have never suggested,for example,that the eighth amendment requires a jury be instructed as to the consequences of a breakdown in the deliberative process.
to show that the instructions and decision forms confused the jury,a defendant must demonstrate that there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that violates the constitution.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the adverse effect that wilson posits was foreclosed by repeated instructions that wilson would be sentenced either to death or to life in prison without the possibility of parole.there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury misunderstood the charge the jury unanimously found proven the mitigating factor that wilson would stay in prison for the rest of his life if he were not sentenced to death.see boyde california.
in a capital case,a defendant may present to the jury as a mitigating factor the fact that a nother defendant or defendants,equally culpable in the crime,will not be punished by death.a.the district court allowed wilson to stipulate that other members of the stapleton crew who participated in the crime whitten,green,and bullock had not been sentenced to death.wilson wanted the jury to learn that they had been sentenced to a term of years,not life in prison.when that request was denied,wilson withdrew this mitigating factor.in the sentencing phase of a capital trial,this court gives deference to the district court decision on the admissibility of evidence and will not overrule it so long as it does not abuse its discretion by acting arbitrarily or irrationally.united states pepin,cir.
the district court ruled that the stipulation provided all the relevant information required by the statute,and that further evidence as to specific prison sentences would have low probative value,would confuse the jury,and would provoke or require trials within the trial concerning the other defendants,their cooperation,and their roles in the murders.that decision was no abuse of discretion the reasons adduced by the court are either explicitly permitted by the statute or have been accepted by this court.see c i nformation may be excluded if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,or misleading the jury.pepin,at ruling that the district court decision to exclude evidence of the defendant prior crimes for fear that they would confuse the issues at hand by requiring a diversionary trial within a trial was not an abuse of discretion.
even assuming that the jury would find the other defendants equally culpable in the crime though it was wilson who pulled the probative value of additional specific sentences was small.the jury had already learned,when two of wilson fellow gang members testified,that both jacobus who was with wilson during the murders and diaz who provided the murder weapon were sentenced to a minimum of years imprisonment.the defense attorney in summation pointed out that jacobus could therefore be out of prison in twelve years.
wilson argues that united states whitley,cir,requires vacatur of his life sentence for count six use of a firearm during a crime of violence,c a iii,as well as his life sentences for counts seven and eight causing death through the use of a firearm,j.we hold that any error here is harmless and so we affirm as to this issue.
section c a provides,in relevant part 
except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law,any person who,during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime for which the person may be prosecuted uses or carries a firearm,or who,in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm,shall,in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime 
iii if the firearm is discharged,be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than years.
c a iii emphasis added.the underlying predicate offense need not be a firearms offense t he except clause includes minimum sentences for predicate statutory offenses arising from the same criminal transaction or operative set of facts.united states williams,cir.section j provides in turn that a person who,in the course of a violation of subsection c,causes the death of a person through the use of a firearm,shall if the killing is a murder be punished by death or by imprisonment for any term of years or for life.j emphasis added.
capital sentences imposed under j counts seven and eight withstand whitley.section j is triggered by a violation of c.see j.but c has both a substantive component describing criminal conduct and a punishment component setting out the range of permissible sentences for criminals who engage in that criminal conduct.a plain reading of j,therefore,indicates that a j sentence is proper if the defendant violates the substantive component of c whether that defendant can be properly sentenced under c is of no moment.since wilson c conviction stands,so do his sentences under j.any error specific to count six would be harmless,due to the mandatory minimum sentences of life without the possibility of parole already in place.see united states rivera,cir.therefore,we affirm as to this issue.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the convictions,vacate the death sentences only,and remand for a new sentencing phase consistent with this opinion.
the majority concludes that the jury five capital sentencing determinations must be set aside on two separate grounds,each involving the government response to ronell wilson claims,in mitigation,that he felt remorse for the murders of detectives andrews and nemorin and that he accepted responsibility for his actions.first,the majority determines that about fifty allegedly errant words in the government summation during the penalty phase unconstitutionally burdened wilson sixth amendment right to a jury trial.second,it concludes that wilson fifth amendment rights were violated by three additional words in the summation,coupled with the trial court failure to give a no adverse inference instruction pursuant to carter kentucky,albeit one modified for the special circumstances of this case.because i conclude that there was no sixth amendment violation,and that any fifth amendment error that took place was indisputably harmless,i respectfully dissent from parts vi,vii,and viii of the majority opinion,and from the judgment vacating the death sentences.i join in the remainder of the majority opinion.
i.the penalty phase of wilson trial 
proper assessment of the purported errors on which the majority relies requires a fuller presentation of the background facts regarding wilson sentencing hearing.the penalty phase of ronell wilson trial,conducted before the same jury that convicted him of five capital crimes,lasted for nine days,involved some forty witnesses,and encompassed nearly pages of trial transcript.the federal death penalty act required the government to prove at least one threshold culpability factor and one statutory aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt before wilson was eligible for the death penalty.c,e.the government relied on trial evidence alone to prove four threshold culpability factors two statutory aggravating factors,and two additional aggravating factors the government penalty phase evidence thus focused on its remaining aggravating factors that wilson had caused loss,injury,and harm to the victims and their families and that he represented a continuing danger to the lives and safety of other persons.
the government called ten victim impact witnesses,among them maryanne andrews,detective andrews sixteen year old christian andrews,one of detective andrews two sons rose nemorin,detective nemorin widow and the mother of his three children and detective nemorin sister,nemorin.the government introduced an additional seventeen witnesses and many exhibits attesting to wilson violent past,which began early in childhood,as well as his ongoing membership and leadership role in the bloods and his continuing violent behavior in custody after being arrested for the murders of detectives andrews and nemorin.
the federal death penalty act provides that the defense may,if it wishes,ask the jury during the penalty phase to find specific mitigating factors,which must be shown by a preponderance of the evidence.id.c.wilson identified eighteen such factors for the jury to consider.wilson presented thirteen witnesses during his defense case,including his mother,cheryl wilson his father,robert earl barnes and his sister,depetra wilson.the defense also introduced numerous exhibits,including dozens of photographs of wilson as a child and many documents depicting aspects of his troubled upbringing,which was the principal focus of the defense mitigation case.other defense evidence purported to show that wilson had adjusted to federal prison and would not be a danger in the future if spared the death penalty.without taking the stand,wilson himself read a prepared,unsworn statement to the jury that expressed remorse for his crimes 
at the close of the evidence,the jurors were instructed that they were called upon to make a unique,individualized judgment about the appropriateness of imposing the death penalty.tr.each juror was instructed to weigh the aggravating factors that all jurors had agreed on unanimously against any mitigating factors that the individual juror believed to be present.the jurors were then instructed to determine whether they unanimously concluded that the aggravating factors sufficiently outweighed any mitigating factors or,in the absence of mitigating circumstances,whether the aggravating factors by themselves justified a sentence of death.id.at.wilson jury was specifically instructed that no jury is ever required to impose the death penalty and that the jury may decline to do so without giving a reason for that decision.id.urged by the court to give careful and thorough consideration to all the evidence,id.at,the jurors deliberated for over a day and half.
the jury agreed unanimously that the government had established each of its four threshold culpability factors and the six aggravating factors upon which it relied beyond a reasonable doubt.the jurors also agreed unanimously that wilson had established thirteen mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence,and that one additional factor was present which the jury itself identified no juror concluded that wilson had established,as he attempted,that he felt remorse for his crimes,that he had accepted responsibility for them,or that he had adjusted well to federal prison.the jury unanimously voted to sentence wilson to death on each of the five capital counts.
ii.wilson sixth amendment claim 
wilson presented as mitigating factors during the penalty phase that he had take n responsibility for his actions and that he ha d remorse for the murder s of detectives andrews and nemorin.verdict form at,app x at.the principal,the only wilson offered in support of these mitigating factors was the prepared,unsworn statement that he read to the jury without taking the stand.in it,wilson claimed to be truly sorry for the pain he had caused,and he expressed his deepest sorrow towards the victim sic family and friends.tr.the majority concludes that the government unconstitutionally burdened wilson sixth amendment right to a jury trial in challenging the credibility of this allocution during its summation.respectfully,i disagree.
the government allegedly improper words came not in the principal part of its summation,which addressed the evidence supporting each of the aggravating factors on which the government relied,but in that portion of the summation discussing the mitigating factors that wilson urged to be present.the majority focuses solely on the language in italics,which reads in its broader context as follows 
ronell wilson takes responsibility for his actions.ronell wilson has remorse for the murders of detective andrews and nemorin.did ronnell wilson show remorse after he killed detective andrews and when he turned the gun on detective nemorin,killed him as he begged for his life from the moment of those murders up to the start of this trial,did you hear any evidence,is there any evidence in the record of remorse or acceptance of responsibility there none.
ronell wilson up until the very moment that he addressed you last week has done everything he could to escape responsibility for his crimes.
he has an absolute right to go to trial,put the government to its burden of proof,to prove he committed these crimes,but he ca have it both ways.he ca do that,then say i accept responsibility and say i sorry,only after you prove i did it.that not acceptance of responsibility.that is a manipulative criminal saying what he has to,saying what he knows you want to hear when it in his interest to say it.
the timing of his statement alone should tell you it nothing more than a selfish man trying to save his own skin.
the majority contends that this explicitly states that wilson had an absolute right to go to trial nevertheless unlawfully burdened his sixth amendment right to jury trial by using wilson constitutionally protected decision to go to trial as a reason to sentence him to death.op.at.this contention,however,simply mischaracterizes the government summation.the government did not,as the majority contends,cite as a reason to sentence him to death that wilson had elected to go to trial.id.instead,the government appropriately responded to wilson mitigation evidence.
the challenged comments occurred in response to wilson endeavor to persuade the jury that he had accepted responsibility for his actions,and that in light of this mitigating factor he placed before the sentence of death was not justified.the government did not,as the majority contends,seek to characterize the request for trial by jury as an aggravating circumstance,zant stephens,citation omitted a reason to sentence wilson to death.op.at.instead,it sought only to draw into question the credibility of wilson expression of remorse,which wilson proffered as a basis for concluding that the government evidence in aggravation did not justify the multiple death sentences for which he was eligible 
united states stratton,cir,on which the majority relies,is therefore inapplicable.stratton recognized a distinction between increasing the severity of a sentence for a defendant failure to cooperate,which is prohibited,and refusing to grant leniency,which is not.stratton,at.but stratton would only be relevant here,to the extent relevant at all,if the government had urged the jury to consider wilson exercise of his jury trial right as a reason to sentence him to death.again,this is not what the government did.the prosecutor remarks came not in his discussion of aggravating factors,but in his examination of the mitigating evidence put forward by wilson,and in the context of explaining why this evidence should not be credited.
the prosecutor comment,to the effect that the allocution lacked credibility as a statement of remorse because it came only when wilson faced punishment for his crimes,was entirely proper.it is both natural and irresistible for a jury,in evaluating the sincerity of a statement of contrition,to note when it comes only at the point a defendant is seeking to avoid the maximum penalty and when it is utterly devoid of corroboration.in an analogous situation,the supreme court has indicated that prosecutorial comment pointing these facts out to the jury impairs no constitutional rights.see portuondo agard.in portuondo,the supreme court determined that it did not unlawfully burden a defendant sixth amendment rights to be present and to confront the witnesses against him for a prosecutor to comment,in summation,on the opportunity that the exercise of these rights provided the defendant to tailor his testimony in light of the government case.the court noted that it is natural and irresistible for a jury,in evaluating the relative credibility of a defendant who testifies last,to have in mind and weigh in the balance the fact that he heard the testimony of all those who preceded him.id.prohibiting the prosecutor from making this point,as the majority would do in this case,is unjustifiable to do so either prohibits inviting the jury to do what the jury is perfectly entitled to do or it requires the jury to do what is practically impossible.id.at.
this case is thus substantially less difficult than united states mikos,cir,in which the seventh circuit determined that the government was entitled to rely on the defendant supposedly demeanor in essence,on his decision to go to trial and remain silent prove an aggravating factor that the defendant had no remorse for his crimes.the majority criticizes mikos,but the seventh circuit analysis is wholly apt to explain why the remarks at issue here were proper 
the defendant fought every charge every step of the way.that was his right,but in the process he showed no remorse,compared with a person who conceded some culpability if it is proper to take confessions,guilty pleas,and vows to improve one life into account when deciding whether a murderer should be put to it is unquestionably proper for a judge or jury to do so,see williams taylor,d then it must also be proper for the prosecutor to remind the jury when none of these events has occurred.
in truth,this case is quite akin to united states fell,cir,which goes largely unaddressed by the majority.the defendant in fell introduced evidence during the penalty phase of his capital trial that he had offered to plead guilty in exchange for a sentence of life imprisonment without he said was relevant to establishing that he had accepted responsibility for his actions.sentenced to death,fell challenged the government summation comments to the effect that if fell wanted to plead guilty,he could have pled guilty 
let move on to the next mitigating factor donald fell offered to plead guilty to kidnapping and murder knowing that the law requires a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release and he has maintained that offer to this day.
ladies and gentlemen,the judge instructed you.you know the law.life imprisonment without the possibility of release is the minimum sentence that donald fell faces for kidnapping with death resulting.it the minimum sentence.when he offered to make that plea,he knew the evidence against him was overwhelming 
ladies and gentlemen,we had to try to convict him.if he wanted to plead guilty,he could have pled guilty.we had a guilt phase in this case,ladies and gentlemen.we put on our case.we met our burden.we proved it.and now we are here to decide what is the just sentence.the minimum sentence or the death sentence 
trial tr.at,united states fell.july.this court determined that the government remarks constituted a reasonable response to fell evidence in mitigation and that n o error occurred.id.at 
both fell and wilson exercised their constitutional right to go to trial.both thereafter sought to persuade the jury that they had accepted responsibility,and that this was a factor in mitigation that the jury should take into account.fell attempted to do so by showing that he was willing to accept punishment short of death,wilson with his statement of contrition.the jury in each case could have considered this evidence and found it persuasive.at the same time,however,the government was entitled to point to reasons that jurors should not take this course.portuondo,at united states robinson,noting that where a prosecutor reference to the defendant opportunity to testify is a fair response to a claim made by defendant or his counsel,the fifth amendment is not violated.it is thus wholly irrelevant that fell is distinct from this case,as wilson and the majority contend,because wilson,unlike fell,introduced no evidence that he had offered to plead.op.at.
in fell case,the prosecutor legitimately argued that an offer to plead guilty in exchange for the minimum penalty authorized for one conduct does not demonstrate acceptance of responsibility.fell,at see also br.of appellant at,fell,noting that the plea offer was introduced in an attempt to demonstrate acceptance of responsibility as a mitigating factor.it was in that context that the prosecutor stated,we had to try to convict him.if he wanted to plead guilty,he could have pled guilty.we had a guilt phase in this case,ladies and gentlemen.we put on our case.we met our burden.in wilson case,the government argued that a statement of contrition that came at the last minute and was uncorroborated by any other evidence was not worthy of belief.it was in that context that the prosecutor said,wilson has an absolute right to go to trial,put the government to its burden of proof,to prove he committed these crimes,but he ca have it both ways.in neither case did the prosecution urge the jury to sentence the defendant to death because he went to trial and in neither case were the defendant sixth amendment rights violated.there was no error here,much less error requiring vacatur.
iii.wilson fifth amendment claim 
although wilson fifth amendment argument is marginally more substantial,it is doubtful any error occurred and certain that if there was error,it was harmless.the issue here concerns the fifth amendment consequences of wilson election to offer his statement of remorse but not to open himself up for cross examination with regard to it.the majority first concludes that the introduction of such a statement effects at least a limited fifth amendment waiver that allows the prosecution to argue for an adverse inference from a defendant failure to testify as to that to which he has allocuted.op.at emphasis omitted.the majority next determines that carter kentucky,nevertheless entitles the defendant in such a situation to a modified adverse inference instruction directed at matters other than those to which the defendant allocuted,and that the failure to give such an instruction,coupled in this case with the prosecutor use of three errant words essentially a wrong choice of verb tense in referring to the defendant decision not to take the stand,requires vacatur.with regard to the second determination,i respectfully disagree.
i,like the majority,start with first principles.op.at.wilson was entitled to the protections of the fifth amendment during the penalty phase of his trial,meaning that he had a right not to testify and that the government could not use his silence against him,at least with regard to factual determinations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.mitchell united states.the supreme court has not yet determined whether silence in this setting properly bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse.id.at.because wilson did not remain silent at his sentencing proceeding,this open question need not be answered here.
i agree with the majority that wilson decision to speak to the jury constituted a waiver of his fifth amendment rights with regard to the subject matter of his allocution,and thus that the prosecution was permitted,as the majority states,to argue for an adverse inference from the defendant failure to testify as to that to which he allocuted.op.at.given this determination,the majority rightly finds wholly legitimate the government argument in summation that if wilson had taken the stand,the sincerity of his allocution could have been better assessed.indeed,because it accepts that wilson waived his fifth amendment rights with regard to the allocution,the majority finds fifth amendment fault today with but three words in the government summation 
i want to talk to you a minute about the statement itself.you may have noticed that when he made that statement,ronell wilson was sitting up there on the witness stand under oath,subject to.he chose to do it from there indicating.the path for that witness stand has never been blocked for wilson,had that opportunity,too.he chose,like many other things in this case,to do it that way.
you may ask yourselves well,what more would we have if he took that stand,what would be the difference well,we might have been able to ask him when did you come up with this how did you come up with it why did you come up with it why now why now of all times are you sorry we might be able to test the credibility of the statement,the veracity of it.you might have information that could help you decide if you need to believe it.ronell wilson did want that.he wanted to say it from there,take my word for it now after all this,now i sorry.
the subtlety of this error can not go unremarked.for it is indeed the difference between was not and has never been on which the majority relies.by the majority own holding today,the government was fully entitled to argue that t he path to that witness stand was not blocked,and that wilson decision not to take the stand to testify to his remorse was a reason to doubt its credibility.the majority contends,somewhat tepidly,that tense makes a difference,and that a juror hearing has never been might think that never is a period that extends back to the guilt phase and extends as well to the full penalty phase.op.at.but the government made no argument that the defendant decision not to take the stand was relevant to anything other than the credibility of his allocution.so the only possible error must boil down to three errant words.
this is a slim reed indeed on which to hang a constitutional infirmity meriting the vacatur of five capital sentences rendered by jurors who,between the trial and the penalty phase,devoted over three weeks to hearing testimony in this case.the majority knows as much.indeed,it concedes that the prosecution attempted conscientiously to focus solely on the subject matter of the allocution.op.at.it states again e ven so,there is something expansive about saying has never been.id.it then hurriedly drops the subject,moving on to discuss the district court failure to give a modified carter real heart of the problem.
carter kentucky held that a trial court has a constitutional obligation,upon request,to instruct a trial jury that no adverse inferences are to be drawn from a defendant election not to take the essence,that it may not treat the defendant silence as substantive evidence of his guilt.carter,at see also robinson,at noting that the fifth amendment prohibits the judge and prosecutor from suggesting to the jury that silence may be treated as evidence of guilt.the supreme court has never expressly held that this obligation extends to the sentencing phase of a criminal proceeding,much less that it applies in a situation in which the defendant has waived his fifth amendment rights,at least with regard to the subject matter of an allocution he has introduced.i will assume for now,with the majority,that wilson was entitled to an instruction that the jury should not draw any adverse inference from his decision to remain silent with regard to matters other than his alleged feelings of remorse.and i will pass over,as the majority also does,that wilson never asked for such a modified adverse inference only instruction that could have been appropriate in the context of this that it is not our normal practice in such circumstances to afford relief.see united states desinor,cir noting that judgment will not be reversed based upon the denial of a requested instruction where the instruction requested was not legally correct or was not supported by an adequate basis in the record.
the majority concludes and i agree that harmless error analysis is appropriate in the context of carter error.see,united states soto,cir holding that failure to give carter instruction is subject to harmless error analysis united states brand,cir same hunter clark,cir en banc same united states ramirez,f d,cir same.it is here,however,that we again part ways.any error that resulted from the government errant three words has never been and the district court failure to give a modified carter instruction one that was never requested was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.see united states hasting,i t is the duty of a reviewing court to consider the trial record as a whole and to ignore errors that are harmless see also satterwhite texas.this case thus falls well short of presenting any circumstances that warrant vacatur of the jury work,even assuming that error occurred.
first,as already noted,the government never argued that wilson decision not to take the stand should be used by the jury to make factual determinations favorable to the government with regard to anything except for wilson matter that the majority concludes was properly the subject of an adverse inference.this is significant because carter itself recognized that the instruction it requires is prophylactic.carter,at.in fact,it is a prophylactic instruction to protect the prophylactic rule that the prosecutor can not ask a jury to draw an adverse inference from the defendant failure to testify which in turn protects the defendant actual constitutional right to refuse to testify.hunter,at.it is thus at least two steps removed from the constitutional privilege,and n either giving nor withholding the instruction has a certain,powerful,effect on the jury work.id.at easterbrook,concurring the supreme court in carter determined that requiring such an instruction,upon request,guards against the danger that an unguided jury might use a defendant silence as evidence of his guilt.carter,at.the failure to give such an instruction,however,does not mean that this injury has occurred.even assuming,then,that a modified carter instruction was appropriate here,the absence of any direct argument from the government that wilson silence be used in an unlawful manner weighs strongly against the conclusion that the failure to give such an instruction was harmful.
the jury own determinations,moreover,strongly suggest that it did not draw any inference adverse to wilson with regard to matters other than his statement of remorse.as previously noted,the jury unanimously found that wilson had established thirteen of the eighteen mitigating factors he put forward and,indeed,it identified an additional mitigating factor not even cited by the defense.the jury thus broadly accepted wilson evidence of a troubled childhood and difficult time in he had grown up in poverty and deprivation,for instance,that his parents were substance abusers,that he was exposed to drugs and violence as a child,that he performed well below grade level in school and had a history of depression.eleven jurors found,in addition,that wilson had been exposed to an unsafe and unsanitary home environment,and three found that his scores on standardized tests were below average.indeed,the jury unanimously rejected only his claims that he accepted responsibility and felt remorse the two mitigators about which he allocuted and that were properly the subject of an adverse inference and that he had adjusted well to federal final claim in mitigation that was simply not credible,in light of the government evidence of future dangerousness.
the evidence establishing the government aggravating factors,moreover,was overwhelming.the district court itself said,in sentencing wilson,that ronell wilson guilt has been proved not merely beyond a reasonable doubt,but beyond all doubt.transcript of sentencing imposition,tr,at.indeed,the evidence presented at trial proved four of the six aggravating factors before the penalty phase even began the picture this evidence painted,moreover,was itself devastating to wilson position that a death sentence could not be justified.
thus,the trial evidence showed that before these murders took place,wilson discussed the possibility with his confederates that the man he intended to rob,detective nemorin,might be a police officer,and that wilson might have to shoot him.on the day of the crimes,as he set his plan in motion,wilson expressed concern that he was being followed,and that there were undercover police vehicles in the vicinity.minutes later,wilson climbed into the back seat of the undercover officers car,pulled out the caliber revolver he was carrying,and shot without warning detective andrews,who had accompanied nemorin to meet with wilson that day,in the back of the head.wilson then shot nemorin,again in the head,as the detective pleaded for his life.at wilson direction,wilson and his confederate,jessie jacobus,searched the bodies,looking for money,before dumping them in the street and driving off in the undercover officers car.when jacobus asked wilson why he had killed the men,wilson said simply,i do give a fuck about nobody.tr.the jury finally heard evidence that at the time of his arrest,two days after the executions of detectives andrews and nemorin,wilson,whose nickname is rated r,was carrying rap lyrics he had written that celebrated violence and that could have been interpreted to refer to the crimes 
come teast rated u better have dat vest and dat a slogs in da back of ya head cause u cause i getin dat bread i ai goin stop to im i getin dat money and when y say rated do forget da 
the district court stated in pronouncing sentence that wilson allocution was not convincing,tr.at.it must have seemed weak,in light of the character of wilson crimes,his behavior thereafter,as well as his many additional acts of violence,both before and after the murders of the detectives.during the penalty phase,the jury learned from three of his victims that wilson,as a young teenager,had repeatedly assaulted other one case,attacking a old on a city bus and breaking his jaw in the course of robbing him.there was evidence of a fight in times square with a man wilson had attempted to extort when both were prison fight in which wilson slashed the man in the face in front of a crowd,leaving a wound that required stitches to close.additional evidence went to violence in assaults on corrections officers,to fist fights with other inmates.there was evidence that wilson believed he deserved og status within the highest status,reserved for those who have committed the most acts of violence on behalf of the gang.there was evidence that wilson used his position in the bloods to incite other inmates to commit violence.the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that wilson represented a continuing danger to others,and that he was likely to commit acts of violence again.the court at sentencing stated its conclusion that wilson is capable of committing extreme acts of violence without warning or provocation,tr.at,and it characterized the proof in support of the jury future dangerousness finding as overwhelming,id.at.
so,too,was the evidence that wilson crimes resulted in loss to the victims,their families,and to others.the district court observed in pronouncing sentence 
those of us when we heard the detectives family members testify will never forget christian andrews,detective andrews older son,recounting his daily chess games with his father,or their annual family trips to universal studios in florida.nor will we ever forget nemorin,detective nemorin sister,explaining how she gave her baby brother the nickname tichou,which means little sweetheart,or rose nemorin,detective nemorin widow,describing how their three children now celebrate father day in a cemetery where they hug a cold wall instead of their father.
may,tr.at.the judge further observed that w hen wilson murdered detectives andrews and nemorin,he took two police officers from this city,two fathers from their children,two husbands from their wives,two brothers from their siblings,and two sons from their parents.id.at.the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that wilson crimes had caused loss,injury,and harm.
i have my doubts whether carter kentucky prophylactic rule properly applies in a sentencing proceeding in which the defendant has chosen not to remain silent,but instead to speak.because the obligation to give a carter instruction arises only upon request,i have further doubts that it ever arose in this case,given that the instruction actually requested by the defendant would have covered matters about which the defendant had waived his fifth amendment rights.that said,i have no doubt about the harmlessness of the alleged fifth amendment error on which the majority relies.i conclude without hesitation that neither the prosecutor three errant words has never been nor the district court failure to give the modified carter instruction that was never requested,influenced this jury decision to any degree.
the supreme court has said that the severity of a death sentence mandates careful scrutiny in the review of any colorable claim of error.zant stephens,at.chapman,however,requires at least a reasonable possibility that the error complained of might have contributed to the result before an error warrants reversal.chapman california,u,quoting fahy connecticut,internal quotation marks omitted.n ot every imperfection in the deliberative process is sufficient,even in a capital case,to set a judgment aside.zant,at.indeed,if this were not the case,congress decision in the federal death penalty act to give to juries the delicate and difficult decision as to when a capital sentence is justified would be wholly undone.
the jury here heard evidence over the course of eighteen days.this evidence cast a strong light on the defendant on his crimes,his character,the harms he has caused,and his case in mitigation.the district court noted,in sentencing wilson,that the jury here was among the most attentive and serious it had ever seen,and that the jurors listened carefully to every argument and the witness testimony,and examined every piece of evidence introduced in this case,tr.at.
i conclude that if there was fifth amendment error i find it error had no impact on the jury that sentenced wilson.with regard to the sixth amendment,there is simply no error to review.having reached these conclusions,i believe the death sentences should be affirmed.i respectfully dissent from parts vi,vii,and viii of the majority opinion and from the judgment vacating the death sentences,while joining in the rest of the majority opinion.
there is no merit to wilson argument that the case need be remanded to a different district court judge.see united states.demott,cir per curiam.
the government called diaz and jacobus as cooperating witnesses in the guilt phase of this case to testify about the criminal activities of the gang and the murders of the police officers.both these men had pleaded guilty to felony murder in state court and would be sentenced to years to life in prison.
wilson contends that jacobus lacked knowledge of facts sufficient to provide a rational basis for his testimony on the status effects of violent acts by members of the stapleton crew,and that this testimony was therefore admitted in violation of federal rule of evidence.see united states rea,cir the requirement of is the familiar requirement of knowledge or observation.quoting.advisory comm.note on proposed rules.we disagree.jacobus testified generally to what an act of violence would do for a member status,not directly to what wilson knew or believed.united states kaplan,cir united states garcia,cir.there is ample evidence of jacobus many connections to the stapleton crew and relationships with its members.this foundational evidence supported a conclusion that jacobus had sufficient knowledge about the crew culture,hierarchy,and organization to testify to the status effects of violence.admission of his testimony was not an abuse of discretion.kaplan,at.

the eighth amendment forbids a capital sentencing regime in which the jury is precluded from considering,as a mitigating factor,any aspect of a defendant character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.quarterman,internal quotation marks omitted.according to wilson,the prosecution summations advised the jury that only defenses to the crime and the aggravating factors could be considered mitigating evidence,that a death sentence should be imposed irrespective of the mitigation because a sentence of life without parole was appropriate for certain less serious crimes,and that wilson merciless conduct rendered him categorically ineligible for mercy.on review,we ask whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jurors believed themselves to be precluded from considering the mitigating evidence.united states fell,cir citing ayers belmontes.we see no such likelihood.first,the government summations deprecated the weight of the mitigating evidence,explained why a life sentence is insufficient,and argued that the victim impact evidence militated against mercy but the government summations did not urge the jury to ignore mitigation and repeatedly instructed the jury to consider every mitigating factor.second,the final jury charge in the penalty phase instructed the jurors to consider the mitigating evidence broadly.third,the jury heard several days of testimony concerning mitigation,and the prosecution extensively argued the weight of that evidence it is improbable the jurors believed that the parties were engaging in an exercise in futility all that time.ayers,at see also brown payton,boyde california,fell,at.fourth,the verdict form evidences the jury active consideration of the mitigating evidence.
even though the same jury sat throughout,the constitutional error wilson alleges had bearing only on the sentencing phase,so the proper remedy would be vacatur of the death sentence.morgan illinois.
though these cases interpret the fourteenth amendment,the supreme court has indicated that the relevant protections in state and federal court are coextensive.see morgan,at see also united states tipton,cir applying morgan to a federal capital trial united states mccullah,cir same.
in morgan had requested in the trial court the following voir dire question if you found defendant guilty,would you automatically vote to impose the death penalty no matter what the facts are at internal quotation marks omitted.
wilson concedes that the voir dire of three jurors was sufficient.
juror answered this question in substance in response to a different inquiry.
wilson objections on this point are preserved.after losing his in limine motion that sought to prohibit all testimony,wilson attempts to limit that testimony in specific ways did not amount to concession or waiver.
the victim impact testimony deemed admissible in payne was delivered by a witness who was mother to one victim and grandmother to a second.she testified that her grandson,a small child at the time of trial,cries for his mom.he does seem to understand why she does come home.and he cries for his sister lacie.he comes to me many times during the week and asks me,grandmama,do you miss my lacie.and i tell him yes.he says,i worried about my lacie.payne,at internal quotation marks omitted see nelson,at no undue prejudice where a fair summation of the witnesses collective testimony is that the witnesses provided emotional and,on occasion,tearful testimony about the victim and the impact of her murder on their lives this included testimony from the victim sister who began testifying but broke down and was unable to continue united states chanthadara,cir allowing young children to testify in tears about their murdered mother mcveigh,at allowing intensely emotional testimony from numerous witnesses.
wilson challenges the sufficiency of these jury instructions on the ground that the first instruction should have been repeated immediately before deliberations.since the charge given at the end effectively expressed what the defendant wanted conveyed,the district court did not err in refusing the repetition.see generally united states desinor,cir mcveigh,at allowing much more victim impact testimony while only giving a single instruction,similar to the second of the two instructions given here.
wilson subsidiary the court erred by refusing an instruction that the jury ignore the victim impact witnesses opinion as to for the same reason as the witnesses presented no such views,there was nothing for the jury to disregard.in any event,the court captured the essence of this instruction when it charged the jury that the question whether to sentence the defendant to death or not is a decision that the law leaves entirely to you.
wilson also challenges geralds competence to testify about the bloods.geralds had been a member of the bloods for a short time,long in the past however,much of his testimony was explicitly based on personal observation,and the rest could be readily inferred to have been learned through personal observation during his long auxiliary affiliation with the bloods after his membership lapsed.see united states tocco,cir evidence should not be excluded due to a witness lack of personal knowledge unless a court finds that no reasonable trier of fact could believe the witness had personal knowledge internal quotation marks omitted.wilson also objected to some of the testimony elicited on of defense expert donald romine,a former prison administrator.romine testified on that the prison system was capable of preventing wilson from harming others.romine was as to whether members of the bloods would be motivated to commit acts of violence in prison in order to raise their status.romine was competent to testify about the nature of that threat,based on his long administrative experience at several prisons and in the bureau of that included examining prisoners records to determine their threat district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing geralds and romine testimony regarding the bloods.see united states kaplan,cir.
wilson also argues that he did in fact offer to plead guilty and that the prosecutors therefore impermissibly misled the jurors into thinking otherwise.our constitutional holding obviates that dispute.
as to wilson sixth amendment right,the dissent argues that stratton is not germane because the prosecution remark about wilson exercising his trial right is located in the discussion of wilson mitigating evidence,and thus did not argue for aggravation on this ground.we disagree.the nature of the penalty phase,structurally,is to determine whether the sentence of life should be raised to a sentence of death.furthermore,wilson decision to go to trial was used not only to undermine his proposed mitigator acceptance of responsibility it also was used to show depravity,which supported an inference of future dangerousness,a proposed aggravator.
see mikos,at posner,concurring in part and dissenting in part t here is a difference between a defendant arguing for leniency on the basis of his admitting to having committed the crime with which he is charged and the government asking the jury to draw an inference of heinousness from his failure to admit that.this distinction reflects the concerns that underlie this court decision in stratton.
the dissent accurately observes that united states fell,cir goes largely unaddressed by the majority in the discussion of sixth amendment error.dissent at.the ground of distinction that renders fell unhelpful here is that fell willingness to plead was put in issue by him,so that the government argument was responsive.united states fell,cir we believe the government arguments were reasonable responses to fell use of his offer to plead guilty.here,wilson did not put in issue his decision to go to offered no proof beyond his allocution of his argument that he accepted thus the government response unconstitutionally burdened that protected decision.
wilson raises two arguments regarding the scope of his allocution.first,he contends that the district court abused its discretion by redacting the following it just hurted me to hear that young kid detective andrews son,christian his brother justin will never have they father there to be the father most men refused to be like my own.i would never wish this for nobody because i know how painful it is.second,he argues that the prosecution unfairly exploited that ruling by citing to the jury wilson failure to specify the conduct for which he was claiming remorse,murdering the two detectives.as to the first argument under the fdpa,the district court has the discretion to exclude evidence if the probative value is outweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice,confusing the issues,or misleading the jury,c,or if it is so unreliable that it might render a trial fundamentally unfair,united states fell,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the district court therefore excluded from the allocution,inter alia,any arguments raised by the prosecution other than their argument that wilson lacks remorse for murdering detectives andrews and nemorin or any reference to the testimony of any witness,including members of the victims families who were sworn in and subject to we review the district court decision limiting the scope of wilson allocution for abuse of discretion.fell,at.applying that standard,we find no second argument overlooks the district court ruling explicitly allowing wilson to allocute to his remorse for the specific crime of having murdered detectives andrews and nemorin.at precluding wilson from allocuting to any arguments raised by the prosecution other than their argument that wilson lacks remorse for murdering detectives andrews and nemorin.emphasis added.therefore,we find no error here,either.
the transcript shows the word as remorseful,but this appears to have been a typographical error.
wilson analogizes an unsworn,uncrossed allocution to a defendant use of his prior statement and cites cases that refuse to find waiver in such circumstances.see,horne trickey,cir porter.estelle,cir.the analogy is inapt,because the type of allocution at issue here,read aloud to the jury by the defendant,is a close analog to testimony and does not sound like silence.accord booth state,a llocution is more like testimony than silence and for fifth amendment purposes is testimonial,rev on other grounds,booth maryland,overruled by,payne tennessee.
as to the fifth amendment error,the dissent contends that our whole argument of harm rests on a mere three words reflecting an unfortunate choice of tense.dissent at.a jurisprudence based on would transform this area of law for the worse.in any event,the three words has never been are embedded in a pair of crucial,emphatic sentences,and drive the predicate the path for that witness stand has never been blocked for wilson,had that opportunity too.he chose,like many other things in this case,to do it that way.the dissent questions whether a jury would think as we think that never is a period that extends back to the guilt phase and extends as well to the full penalty phase.majority at.how far back,one wonders,does the dissent consider that never extends back the word never is a humble word,but it is emphatic.see oxford english dictionary draft ed.june at no time or moment on no occasion not ever.
see,riggins nevada,kennedy,concurring in a capital sentencing proceeding,assessments of character and remorse may carry great weight and,perhaps,be determinative united states mikos,cir posner,concurring in part and dissenting in part citing studies and articles supporting this proposition michael simons,born again on death row retribution,remorse,and religion,cath.law,the importance of a defendant remorse in capital sentencing is well documented.empirical studies of capital juries have demonstrated that a defendant remorse or lack of remorse is one of the single most important factors in the jury sentencing decision.footnote omitted theodore eisenberg,stephen garvey,martin wells,but was he sorry the role of remorse in capital sentencing,cornell,in short,if south carolina jurors believed that the defendant was sorry for what he had done,they tended to sentence him to life imprisonment,not death.william geimer jonathan amsterdam,why jurors vote life or death operative factors in ten florida death penalty cases,am.
the dissent finds no sixth amendment violation,and punts as to whether there was a violation of the fifth amendment.we,therefore,do not join issue with the dissent on whether a fifth amendment error alone would be harmless.our analysis concludes only that the two reinforcing and amplifying the other on the critical issues of remorse,acceptance of responsibility,and future be found harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
these four factors were that wilson intentionally killed his victim s that he intentionally inflicted serious bodily injury that resulted in the death of his victim s that he intentionally participated in an act,contemplating that the life of a person would be taken or intending that lethal force would be used in connection with a person,other than one of the participants in the offense,and the victim s died as a direct result of the act and that he intentionally and specifically engaged in an act of violence,knowing that the act created a grave risk of death to a person such that participation in the act constituted a reckless disregard for human life and the victim s died as a direct result of the act.a a d.
the two statutory aggravating factors relied on by the government were that wilson committed the offenses for pecuniary gain,c,and that he intentionally killed more than one person in a single criminal episode,id.c.the two aggravating factors for which the government relied on trial evidence were that wilson murdered two law enforcement officers during the course of their official duties,and that this factor tended to support imposition of the death penalty and that he faced contemporaneous convictions for other serious acts of violence charged in the counts in the indictment on which he had been convicted.
the full text of the statement reads as follows good afternoon.i,ronell wilson,wrote a statement that i want to read to you,the jury.i want you to understand my deepest sorrow towards the victim family and friends.i have seen the pain that i have caused the family and friends of the victims and to my own family and friends.i know that the wives and children and loved ones are also would never wish this for anyone because i know how painful it is.so i can not be remorseful and show no sympathy to these men family and am not good with words.i wish i could explain myself more better sic,but i am not i am truly sorry for the pain i have caused them all.i know that i have caused a great deal of pain to them all and i say it again and again,i am so am sorry that i caused so much pain throughout my life to others,especially my family and the families of the know that the victims families may not accept my apology but i pray that god will give them all the comfort and strength that they need to move on from this tragedy.i have the same prayer for my family also.thank.
