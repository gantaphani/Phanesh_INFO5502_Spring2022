in this criminal appeal,fermin hern√°ndez raises a question of first impression concerning the application of section d of the federal sentencing guidelines.although an oddly placed transitional expression in an application note and the ingenuity of able counsel combine to give us momentary pause,we conclude that the guideline provision says what it means and means what it says.hence,the district court did not commit any interpretive error and the defendant sentence must be affirmed.
because this appeal follows the entry of a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the colloquy,the uncontested portions of the presentence investigation report psi report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states dietz,cir.we limit our recital to those facts that are helpful to an understanding of the issue on appeal.
in late,the government began a protracted investigation of a heroin trafficking ring.the probe eventually led to an indictment that charged fifteen persons,including the defendant,with conspiracy to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin during the period from december of to january of.see a.as matters turned out,the evidence of the defendant direct involvement in the conspiracy boiled down to i his participation in the delivery of about grams of heroin on june,and ii testimony that he had participated in at least two deliveries at unspecified times during the life of the conspiracy.
the defendant originally maintained his innocence but,on december,entered a guilty plea to the conspiracy count as framed.the district court convened the disposition hearing on april.
the defendant criminal history revealed one relevant entry a new york state conviction for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol oui.see veh.traf.law.the new york court convicted the defendant of that offense on july,and sentenced him on the same date to,among other things,a period of criminal supervision to begin immediately and to expire on july.
the psi report in the federal criminal case recommended that this conviction yield an aggregate of three criminal history points one for the conviction itself,see ussg c and two more because the federal offense was committed while the defendant was under a criminal justice sentence emanating from the state oui offense,see id.d.the government supported this recommendation.
the defendant objected to the enhancement under section d.he argued that,for sentencing purposes,the federal offense should be deemed to have occurred on june,the date of his proven personal involvement in the conspiracy.since that specific conduct transpired prior to the imposition of the state criminal justice sentence,section d should not apply.
the district court rejected this reasoning and overruled the defendant objection.noting that the july oui court supervision sentence had been imposed within the span of the conspiracy,the court ruled that section d required the addition of the two disputed criminal history points.the resultant criminal history score rendered the defendant ineligible for relief.see ussg a.consequently,the court sentenced him to the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment sixty months.see b b.this timely appeal followed.
we review a sentencing court interpretation and application of the guidelines de novo.united states goodhue,cir.the guideline provision here at d requires a sentencing court to add two points to a defendant criminal history score if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence,including probation.for guideline purposes,offense is defined as the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context.ussg,cmt.h.
in this case,the offense of conviction is conspiracy.the indictment makes manifest that the offense spanned a period from december to january.the criminal supervision sentence for the unrelated oui offense was imposed about midway through this span.the defendant pleaded guilty to the conspiracy as charged.at first blush,then,it seems as though the instant offense or,at least,some part of it was committed while the defendant was under a criminal justice sentence.
to counter this construction,the defendant points to an application note to section d.the note states that t wo points are added if the defendant committed any part of the instant offense,any relevant conduct while under any criminal justice sentence.ussg,cmt.emphasis supplied.the defendant posits that the underscored transitional expression equates any part of the instant offense with any relevant conduct and,thus,that the latter limits the former.accordingly,his thesis runs,section d,read through the prism of note,focuses not on the offense of conviction simpliciter but,rather,on whatever act s the defendant himself committed within the confines of that offense.he adds that the qualifier to the guideline definition of offense which reads unless a different meaning is specified or is otherwise clear from the context,ussg,cmt.h opens the door for reading note to disrupt the plain meaning of section d.
to be sure,note is not a model of literary elegance.the transitional expression which literally translates as that is appears imprecise in this context,and its use tends to obfuscate the note meaning.but it is a quantum leap to assume,as the defendant would have it,that this awkward locution should be regarded as a clear or specific signal from the sentencing commission that it desired to alter the meaning of instant offense in section d.at most,the defendant has pointed out a possible inconsistency between the guideline and note any inconsistency between a guideline provision and a piece of guideline commentary must be resolved in favor of the plain meaning of the guideline itself.see stinson united states,d united states fiore,cir.
in all events,we think that the inconsistency envisioned by the defendant is more imagined than real.the most plausible reading of note is not as a direction to substitute relevant conduct as a universal proxy for instant offense but,instead,as a means of reminding a sentencing court that the phrase any part of the instant offense includes any relevant conduct whether or not occurring within the four corners of the offense as charged.in that way,note confirms that the potential reach of section d includes relevant conduct.
the reading that we propose is consistent with the guideline definition of offense as the offense of conviction and all relevant conduct.ussg,cmt.h emphasis supplied.it also comports with the existing case law although there is no reported case directly on point,courts applying section d in analogous circumstances have interpreted the application note relied on by the defendant as allowing the use of relevant conduct to broaden the boundaries of the offense of conviction rather than to shrink those boundaries.see,united states williams,cir united states sherwood,cir united states harris,cir.
we add a coda.at bottom,the defendant argument smacks of an attempt needlessly to import the complexities of conspiracy law into a case that calls for nothing more than a straightforward reading and application of a carefully scripted guideline provision.while there are situations that require a sentencing court to make findings as to the specific acts attributable to a particular coconspirator,see,united states,cir attributing amount of loss united states,cir attributing drug quantity,this is not one of them 
we need go no further.here,the defendant committed the instant offense while under a criminal justice sentence,ussg d,and the district court appropriately elevated his criminal history score by two points on that account.
a different analysis might have been necessary had the defendant presented evidence to the district court of his abandonment of or withdrawal from the conspiracy prior to the imposition of sentence in the oui case.here,however,the defendant offered no such evidence instead,he entered a plea of guilty to the conspiracy as conspiracy that he admitted was ongoing on the date of,and after,the oui sentence was imposed.see united states grant,cir when a criminal
