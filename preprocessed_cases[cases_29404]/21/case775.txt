manuel pacheco pleaded guilty to a count that charged,in effect,that he conspired to distribute controlled substances.see a.in imposing a sentence,the district court departed upward from the guideline sentencing range gsr pursuant to ussg,which authorizes a departure in the event that significant physical injury has resulted from the offense conduct.the defendant appeals.discerning no error,we affirm.
background 
because this appeal follows a guilty plea,we take the relevant facts from the colloquy,the unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report,the victim hospital records submitted by the defendant to the district court,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states,cir united states dietz,cir.all enumerated events occurred in,unless otherwise indicated.
on july,a massachusetts college student,mg,was found by his mother in a barely responsive state.close by were two bottles of ketamine,some empty vials,and some hypodermic syringes.mg mother also discovered an empty envelope,apparently sent by one on june.the envelope bore a return address in reseda,california,and mg mother reasonably concluded that the ketamine had arrived in it.
emergency medical personnel transported mg to a nearby hospital.physicians admitted him to intensive care and provisionally diagnosed a ketamine overdose.mg later informed hospital staff that he had taken heroin approximately one hour before he ingested milligrams of ketamine twice his usual dose.subsequent diagnoses reflected mg ingestion of both drugs.after a few days,mg left the hospital,contrary to medical advice.the defendant does not dispute that mg physical injuries were significant.
in the ensuing investigation,the authorities learned that the defendant,under the nom de guerre the doc,advertised various substances for sale over the internet.they also learned that,between may and july,mg had ordered ketamine from the defendant approximately ten times.most of the orders were for five bottles,although at least one order specified twice that number of bottles.each bottle contained ten milliliters of ketamine 
the defendant filled these orders with shipments to a mailbox that mg had rented for the express purpose of obtaining the contraband.a search of the mailbox revealed an unopened package from,which had been sent on july.that package contained five bottles of ketamine and an invoice listing mg address.
with this background information in hand,federal authorities began to probe more deeply into the defendant activities.in and after august,they intercepted three incoming mailers addressed to at a mailbox rented by the defendant near his reseda residence.each envelope contained cash or a money order.the agents also intercepted a number of outgoing shipments,shipments from the reseda address listed as the return address on the june envelope that had been sent to mg containing steroids of various types.
on october,federal agents armed with a warrant searched the defendant reseda residence as well as a mercury sable parked in the driveway.the search yielded a price list from a store in mexico for,among other things,ketamine.the search also turned up approximately boxes of steroids,packaging materials,envelopes and labels,and a loaded revolver.
the agents proceeded to interview the defendant.he took responsibility for the mailings,thus admitting use of the pseudonyms and the doc.however,he professed that his main business was the distribution of substances.he claimed that he had stopped distributing horse tranquillizer that no one presently asserts is a hearing that people were using it to get high.
on november,customs agents stopped the mercury sable on a return trip from mexico.a vehicle search revealed units of steroids.the car occupants residents of the rear house at the defendant reseda address told the agents that the steroids were destined for delivery to the defendant.
after a federal grand jury in the district of massachusetts returned a indictment against him,the defendant pleaded guilty to the lead count,which charged conspiracy to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute ketamine and anabolic steroids.at a sentencing hearing held on august,the district court,without demurrer from either side,arrived at a gsr of months.on the government motion and over the defendant objection,the court then invoked ussg and departed upward on the ground that the defendant actions had resulted in significant injuries to mg who did not testify at the disposition hearing.accordingly,the court imposed a incarcerative sentence.this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
in united states booker,d,the supreme court revolutionized federal sentencing practices.in the world,a sentencing court must follow a progression.the court task begins with calculating the applicable gsr.it next must decide whether any departures are in order.then,the court must ponder the factors set forth in a,as well as any other relevant information.finally,the court must determine what sentence whether within,above,or below the gsr is appropriate in the particular case.see united states pelletier,cir united states,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.we emphasize that these four steps are not mechanical as long as the sentencing court touches all of the relevant bases and explains what it has done,it may combine steps or vary the order.
in the case at bar,the defendant trains his fire on the second step of the sentencing pavane the lower court decision to effect an upward departure.we turn,then,to that decision.
the departure provision relied upon by the sentencing court allows for an upward departure i f significant physical injury resulted from the offense conduct.ussg.the guideline further provides 
the extent of the increase ordinarily should depend on the extent of the injury,the degree to which it may prove permanent,and the extent to which the injury was intended or knowingly risked.when the victim suffers a major,permanent disability and when such injury was intentionally inflicted,a substantial departure may be appropriate.if the injury is less serious or if the defendant though criminally negligent did not knowingly create the risk of harm,a less substantial departure would be indicated.
the defendant assigns error to the district court application of this guideline.in his view,the evidence was insufficient to prove that mg significant physical injuries resulted from ketamine that he furnished.
this line of argument has two branches.first,the defendant claims that mg had other suppliers,so the defendant was not necessarily responsible for selling him the ketamine that contributed to the overdose.second,the defendant claims that,in all events,the ingestion of heroin broke the chain of causation.we examine these claims separately.we start,however,with the standard of review.
standard of review.
under an advisory guidelines regime,we review the ultimate sentence for reasonableness.booker,at.nevertheless,the underlying guideline computations must be legally correct.united states gobbi,cir.that brings other standards of review into the equation.
we review de novo claims that a sentencing court committed an error of law in interpreting or applying the guidelines.united states pho,cir.conversely,we review a sentencing court factual findings,including the findings that undergird departure determinations,for clear error united states wallace,cir.
ketamine origination.
the defendant admits to supplying mg with ketamine in the spring of.he argues,however,that even if the injuries mg sustained can be attributed to a ketamine overdose,the evidence is too thin to prove that not some other the ketamine.he attempts to bolster this argument in two ways.first,he characterizes mg as a habitual user of ketamine whose daily as much as milligrams,five times a exceeded the quantities furnished to him by the defendant.second,he emphasizes the span of time between the date of the last shipment that mg actually received from him june and the date of the overdose july.as he sees it,that five and week hiatus calls into serious question the theory that he was the supplier of the dose of ketamine.
although cleverly contrived,this argum
