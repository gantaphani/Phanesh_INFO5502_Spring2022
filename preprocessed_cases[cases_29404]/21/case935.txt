prochner argues for the first time on appeal that his sentence should be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing under united states booker,d.he also challenges the enhancement for use of a special skill,the special conditions that he undergo evaluation for sex offender treatment and refrain from certain contact with minors,and the loss calculation for purposes of awarding restitution 
a.the arrest 
on august,prochner was trying to enter canada from new york when canadian law enforcement officers conducting border inspections discovered that he was carrying papers and a notebook containing numerous credit card numbers.further investigation revealed that the credit card numbers had been reported as stolen or lost and that fraudulent activity had been reported on the accounts.prochner did not have the permission of the credit card accounts owners to use or possess the credit card numbers.after being advised of his rights,prochner admitted that he had obtained the credit card numbers on the internet.in a written statement to law enforcement,he explained that he accessed website order logs to obtain the credit card numbers and then accessed channels where he determined that the numbers were still valid.
in addition to the credit card numbers,prochner had in his possession a handwritten journal that included references to adolescent males.
b.the plea and sentencing 
on july,prochner pled guilty in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts to the indictment,which charged him with possessing or more unauthorized credit card numbers with the intent to defraud.see a.according to the government,prochner possessed unauthorized credit card numbers and had used at least one to purchase airline tickets and to stay at a hotel.prochner agreed with most of the facts but argued that the list of unauthorized credit card numbers he had in his possession at the time of his arrest had only numbers written twice,not the numbers the government alleged.
the presentence report psr determined that prochner base offense level was.a the psr added levels for the loss of multiplied by credit card numbers,id.b c,cmt.f i levels for the number of victims between and,id.b a levels for the use of a special skill,id.and levels for obstruction of justice,id.the resulting offense level totaled.because prochner had no prior convictions and zero criminal history points,he was assigned to criminal history category i.the resulting guideline sentencing range was to months.the probation office calculated that prochner owed in restitution.
prior to sentencing,prochner objected to the enhancements for the amount of loss,special skill,and obstruction of justice,as well as the restitution figure.he argued that he should have been granted a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,and sought downward departures because of his mental and emotional condition,see,and family and community ties,id.
after a hearing,the district court sentenced prochner on january.the court rejected the objections to the psr and denied prochner requests for downward departure.the court sentenced prochner to months in prison and three years of supervised release,and ordered him to pay restitution in the amount of.the court recommended that prochner be designated to a facility where he could undergo sex offender evaluation.it also imposed special conditions of supervised release,including that prochner participate,if directed to do so by the probation office and the court,in a treatment program,that he be prohibited from engaging in any occupation,business or profession that would require direct supervision of children under the age of,and that he be prohibited from hav ing any unsupervised contact with anyone under the age of.
booker challenge 
prochner argues that we should remand his case for resentencing in light of united states booker,d at the invitation of this court,both parties submitted supplemental briefing after the supreme court decision in booker.as prochner concedes,he did not raise any question in the district court concerning the constitutionality of the guidelines nor of their application to his sentence under apprendi new jersey,d,or blakely washington,d.accordingly,we review his booker contentions for plain error.united states antonakopoulos,cir.
prochner must satisfy the test in united states olano,d that there is an error that is plain,and that the error affects substantial rights and seriously impairs the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.the first two prongs are met because the defendant sentence was imposed under mandatory guidelines.antonakopoulos,at.to meet the third prong,prochner must show there is a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new advisory guidelines booker regime.id.at see also united states heldeman,cir describing the booker plain error inquiry as whether there is reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.
in support of a remand for resentencing,prochner argues that the district court made the following findings enhancing his sentence beyond that authorized by facts admitted by him in violation of the sixth amendment the amount of loss,number of victims,special skill,and obstruction of justice.we said in antonakopoulos,however,that the judge found additional facts which raised the sentence authorized solely by the jury verdict or guilty our view is insufficient to meet the third and fourth olano prongs on review.at 
more to the point,he also argues there is a reasonable probability that the district judge,in an advisory guidelines system,would have reached a different result.see heldeman,at.at sentencing,the district judge considered and rejected prochner requests for downward departures based on mental and emotional condition and family and community ties.after reviewing the report prepared by prochner mental health expert,the judge noted that the expert does conclude that he mentally unbalanced in the real sense.she thinks that he depressed,which,of course,i am sometimes,too.the judge also stated that the expert concludes the defendant,obviously,has troubles,but they are troubles that manifest themselves more in a state of depression than they do really in terms of the kind of mental fragility or disturbance that might,under the not a terribly encouraged might under the guidelines qualify for a downward departure.these comments indicate that the judge denied prochner request for a downward departure because of skepticism that he suffered from a mental condition serious enough to warrant a downward departure.the judge went on to say,beyond that,i frankly do see any basis for a downward departure that otherwise applies in the case.he then sentenced prochner to the middle of the to month range.
while the district court made these comments in the context of considering whether to grant a downward departure on grounds not terribly encouraged under the guidelines,rather than pursuant to its greater discretion to consider such mitigating factors in an advisory guidelines regime,nothing suggests that the mandatory nature of the guidelines prevented imposition of a lesser sentence in this case.indeed,without even departing downward,the court could have imposed a lesser sentence under the existing guidelines range.see,united states,cir.on this record,we see no reasonable probability that a more lenient sentence would be imposed under advisory guidelines should the case be remanded.see antonakopoulos,at.
as for the special skill enhancement,prochner contends that the district court made a sentencing error under the guidelines,the correction of which ordinarily would have led to a lower sentence in the era.id.at.we turn now to this contention,concluding there was no such error.
special skill enhancement 
prochner contends the court erred in finding that,to facilitate the offense,he used a special skill,as defined in,to obtain the credit card numbers.this court reviews the district court legal interpretation of the term special skill de novo and its underlying factual determinations for clear error.united states,cir.
the guidelines direct that a enhancement is applied i f the defendant used a special skill,in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.a special skill is defined as a skill not possessed by members of the general public and usually requiring substantial education,training or licensing.id,cmt.examples include pilots,lawyers,doctors,accountants,chemists,and demolition experts.id.
we have held that a defendant need not necessarily have formal education or training in order to be found to possess a special skill.see,at united states,cir united states noah,cir.a special skill may also be acquired through experience or.noah,at finding that a,professional tax preparer utilized a special skill in preparing and electronically filing tax returns.
the district court adopted the psr conclusion that prochner used computer skills to hack into website order logs.prochner argues,however,that there is no evidence that he has education or training even in computers.but a court can reasonably infer requisite from the nature and extent of the skill possessed.here,prochner own description of what he did and could do to hack into secure websites and purloin data revealed a high and unusual level of computer.the court could infer that this came from and experience if not from more formal training.
in his written statement to law enforcement at the time he was arrested,prochner explained how he had obtained the credit card numbers 
after accessing the internet,via telnet and and accessing websites order logs via internet credit card ordering programs,i scanned twenty some credit cards credit cards can be checked for validity via bots,scripts that check cards are still,and i used a mirc based program via windows,on an undernet channel and a dalnet based channel to check three or four amex cards and found them to be extremely valid.
prochner went on to elaborate on what he called carding,including how websites use ssl encryption,how one can rewrite the websites cgi scripts which ultimately hold the logs for credit card orders for a particular website,and how one can download an international chat client to access thousands of channels where one can check the validity of all kinds of credit card numbers.he stated that these channels are where the true criminals are.prochner went on to explain that he can easily access these places at any computer at any time of the day,via a windows based program.he also claimed that e ven without log orders or hacking for lack of a better word tools,a novice internet surfer can access these channels and still get hundreds of credit cards in less than hours.
a judge might reasonably take with a grain of salt prochner assertion that even a novice internet surfer could do what he indicated.but even if so,we have said that nothing in the guidelines suggests that the specialness of the faculty necessarily hinges on the complexity of the task to be performed.noah,at.a skill can be special even though the activity to which the skill is applied is mundane.id.the critical question is whether the defendant skill set elevates him to a level of knowledge and proficiency that eclipses that possessed by the general public.id.
focusing on that critical question,prochner description of the processes to obtain the credit card numbers amply supports the district court conclusion that prochner special skills,including the ability to hack into website order logs and computer networks and to cgi scripts,exceed the knowledge of the average internet user.even without expert evidence,prochner affidavit supports finding a level of sophistication well beyond the ordinary.we are unable to say,therefore,that the district court determination that prochner possessed a special skill not possessed by members of the general public is clearly erroneous.
we recognize there may be cases where a particular ability,even if not generally possessed by members of the public,may be so limited in kind or scope as to fall outside the purview of.but sophisticated computer aptitude like prochner evidences a skill of sufficient breadth and applicability as to be found to come within the guideline.it is true that some courts outside this circuit have limited the category of cognizable special skills more strictly.compare,united states aubin,cir trained service repairman for atms possessed a special skill facilitating atm robbery,with united states harper,cir knowledge of atms gained during employment insufficient.courts in the sixth and ninth circuits have,on occasion,gone quite far in insisting,as a sine qua non,upon an extensive amount of formal education,training and licensing.see,united states lee,cir united states godman,cir.as noted,we do not go so far.where the record supports a finding of a skill of sufficient kind and scope at a level well beyond that of a member of the general public,we will affirm the reasonable judgment of the district court.the ninth circuit own case of united states petersen,cir,found a special skill in circumstances fairly similar to those here.see id.at defendant ability to hack into credit reporting services to obtain information which he used to order fraudulent credit cards warranted special skill enhancement.
we affirm the district court finding of a special skill enhancement.
special conditions of supervised release 
for the first time on appeal,prochner challenges as abuses of discretion three of the special conditions of supervised release imposed by the district court that he participate,if directed to do so by the probation office and the court,in a treatment program that he is prohibited from engaging in any occupation,business or profession that would require direct supervision of children under the age of and that he refrain from hav ing any unsupervised contact with anyone under the age of.
this court ordinarily reviews the district court imposition of a special condition of supervised release for abuse of discretion,but if the issue was forfeited,review is for plain error.united states york,cir.as prochner concedes,he did not lodge with the district court an express objection to the special conditions.he argues,nevertheless,that his failure to do so should be excused in light of the court statement during an conference just before the beginning of the sentencing hearing that it was having trouble finding anything in the record suggesting that he has a problem with children.we are not persuaded.a judge sentencing determinations after or at the end of a hearing take priority over earlier remarks which may be based on incomplete information or simply thrown out to invite response or test the waters.prochner forfeited his right to object to the special conditions by not objecting promptly after announcement of the conditions.had he done so,the district court would have been able to reconsider its proposed judgment in light of his objection and,if persuaded,modify it.see,united states,cir.the mere beginning ruminations of the court plainly did not cure prochner later failure to state,once the court intent became manifest,that he was in any way bothered by the specified conditions.we review,therefore,solely for plain error see olano,at.
