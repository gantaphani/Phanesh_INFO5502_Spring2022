mary landry was indicted in the united states district court for the district of maine on nine counts involving wire fraud,aggravated identity theft and social security fraud the district court held a trial,and the jury returned a guilty verdict on all nine counts.after sentencing,landry filed a timely notice of appeal in her appeal,she claims that the district court committed reversible error when it admitted two pieces of evidence,that the prosecutor engaged in improper argument during closing arguments and that the district court improperly considered the general increase in identity theft crimes in determining the appropriate sentence.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
from to,landry was employed as a customer account manager by mbna,a credit card company.at mbna,landry job involved the collection of past due credit card accounts.she was granted a security clearance,which gave her access to customers social security numbers and dates of birth.in,mbna,following its established policy,terminated landry employment for a conviction.beginning in november,landry was employed by verizon.at verizon,landry could access customer accounts,including social security numbers and dates of birth.
admiral mary landry admiral landry,not the defendant,was notified in by discover that someone was using her date of birth and social security number to open a credit card account.admiral landry immediately placed fraud alerts on her credit cards and enrolled in a fraud monitoring system.while landry was employed at mbna,admiral landry had a credit card,but was never late in any of her payments.in,admiral landry had opened an account with verizon for cable,phone and dsl in her home.
in april,the defendant,landry,received offers in the mail for two credit cards,one from chase bank and another from discover bank.landry applied online for both cards,providing her own name.according to landry,she entered her own birth date,but,because of her apprehension about internet security,she entered all as her social security number.chase approved landry credit card application,but discover required further review.landry ultimately decided not to open a card with discover.
in may,after making a purchase at fashion bug,landry applied for a store credit card upon the encouragement of the sales clerk.fashion bug procedure required the sales clerk to input the customer name,address and date of birth from a driver license.the customer would then input her social security number on a number pad.landry maintains that she again entered all as her social security number.landry application was not approved.
around june,landry was unable to access her chase credit card account online.when landry called chase,it asked her to verify the last four digits of her social security number.landry provided the last four digits of her social security number,which did not match the credit card account.landry also tried providing all,which also did not match.chase closed the account.
landry was indicted on nine counts three counts of wire fraud,three counts of aggravated identity theft,two counts of social security fraud and one count of fraud in connection with an access device or credit card.the charges were based on landry allegedly knowing and unauthorized use of another individual identity to apply for three credit cards,to obtain a credit card and to use that credit card.
the government maintains that landry had access to admiral landry identification information through her employment,and having defaulted on student loans,landry poor credit provided her with a financial motive.her alleged plan was to deceive credit card companies by using the social security number and date of birth of an individual who shared her same first and last name.the government maintains that landry used admiral landry social security number and date of birth on the chase and discover applications.for the fashion bug credit card,however,the government submits that landry used only admiral landry social security number because,under that store procedure,the store clerk enters the customer date of birth based on the customer provided identification.
a trial took place in.to support its claim,the government provided the testimony of mbna and verizon representatives.both employers stated that landry had the security clearance to have accessed admiral landry social security number and date of birth through their systems.the government also presented evidence that landry was in debt,had defaulted on her student loans of over and was subject to a wage garnishment order.employees from different credit card companies testified that an applicant must supply her own social security number and that the computer system would not input a social security number on its own.
we shall present additional,relevant factual background in the course of our consideration of each of landry specific contentions.
discussion 
landry submits that her conviction should be reversed because the district court admitted evidence of a traffic stop at which she supplied false identifying information the district court admitted evidence of the conviction the government referenced in its closing arguments the cost and expense of bringing expert witnesses and the district court considered the growth of identity fraud crimes during sentencing.we consider each issue in turn.
landry first contends that the district court erred in admitting,under federal rule of evidence b,evidence about a traffic stop at which she supplied false identification information.we review a district court ruling on the admissibility of evidence under rule b for an abuse of discretion.united states hicks,cir,cert.denied.we conclude that the traffic stop is admissible under rule b.
in june,after landry had filled out the credit card applications,but prior to her indictment in this case,officer steven jordan stopped landry for a traffic infraction.when asked for her name,social security number and date of birth,landry provided officer jordan with her sister name,a social security number and a date of birth.officer jordan ascertained landry actual identity by checking vehicle registration,booking photographs and verifying physical traits,and discovered that landry had a suspended license.
before trial,the district court initially directed the government not to mention evidence of the traffic stop,but warned landry that the evidence would be admissible if she opened the door to it.after landry opening statement indicated a defense of good faith and computer error,the district court ruled that the evidence of the traffic stop would be admissible.the court explained that the evidence goes directly to the specific issues that are isolated in the rule.trial tr.vol.i.the court pointed out that landry was claiming a computer system error and a defense and that the jury therefore was entitled to consider evidence that she had used,in another instance,another name,including a social security number that was not hers.id.that evidence could be used,the court explained,to conclude opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,and absence of mistake or accident.id.at.
federal rule of evidence b prohibits the admission of prior bad acts to establish an individual character or propensity to commit a crime.rule b does permit,however,the admission of prior bad acts for other purposes,such as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident.b.bad acts committed subsequent to the charged behavior are admissible under rule b as long as they meet the criteria set forth in the rule.see united states tse,cir.
consonant with the established case law of our circuit,a district court employs a test to determine admissibility of evidence under rule b.udemba nicoli,cir.first,it must determine whether the evidence has special relevance other than establishing propensity with respect to this inquiry,rule b list of purposes is not exhaustive.id.in udemba,we concluded that the evidence was admissible under rule b in part because it was specially relevant to a contested issue in the case,namely,the extent of damages attributable to emotional distress.id.in so concluding,we reject ed the concept that rule b contains a comprehensive list of all the ways in which evidence of other bad acts may be specially relevant.id.to determine whether proffered evidence has special relevance,the court considers the temporal relationship of the other act and the degree of similarity to the charged crime.united states varoudakis,cir.second,the court must consider whether rule requires exclusion of the evidence because the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value.id.at.
specially relevant 
in admitting evidence of the traffic stop,the district court said that it showed opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,and absence of mistake or accident.trial tr.vol.i.we believe,more precisely,that the traffic stop is relevant to show intent or knowledge because the evidence rebuts an innocent involvement defense.
bad acts,other than the behavior charged,can be the basis for inferr ing that,after being involved in a number of similar incidents,the defendant must have had a mental state that is inconsistent with innocence.jack weinstein margaret berger,weinstein federal evidence a ed.this circuit,and others,have admitted evidence under rule b to rebut a defense of innocent involvement.the cases do not always specify under which of the enumerated categories of rule b the evidence is admitted,recognizing the overlapping and nature of that listing.in united states rodriguez,cir,the defendant was charged with conspiracy and attempt to import,with an individual named vega,illegal drugs at a pier.he submitted as his defense that he was at the sea with vega for an innocent reason.he claimed that,as a fisherman,he occasionally would fish in those waters.id.at.the government introduced evidence of another drug importation,at the same location,that involved the defendant and vega.id.at.we determined that the district court had not abused its discretion in admitting the evidence because the government had a right to counter the idea that the defendant was just innocently caught up in the events.id.at.similarly,in united states wyatt,cir,cert.denied,there was a suggestion that the defendant was tricked into participating in fraudulent transactions by others.we concluded that evidence of the prior fraudulent transactions in which the defendant had participated would assist the jury in determining whether the defendant was duped or whether the defendant fully understood the fraudulent nature of the charged transactions.id.also,in united states lugo guerrero,cir,we held that the district court had not abused its discretion in admitting prior evidence of robberies to counter the defendant theory that he was present innocently in the getaway car with two bank robbers.we commented that evidence of the prior bank robberies makes it unlikely that the defendant presence in the vehicle was a mere coincidence.id.
other circuits also have allowed rule b evidence,not always under any specific category,to counter an innocent involvement defense.see,united states howell,cir holding rule b evidence of previous drug convictions relevant to rebut defense that the defendant was merely present quotation marks omitted united states huels,cir allowing,on plain error review,rule b evidence to show absence of mistake because the defendant had maintained that he wandered into the marijuana garden by chance while hunting for deer and had never been on that plot of land previously united states zackson,cir admitting rule b evidence of prior drug trafficking with to show intent because defendant denied any participation and claimed innocent association.
landry defense is one of innocent involvement.she does not contend that she made a mistake.rather,she claims that she acted innocently,providing her own date of birth and a social security number of all.the culprit,according to landry,is the computer system,which mixed up her identity with that of admiral landry.the line of cases admitting rule b evidence to counter a defense of innocent involvement supports the district court determination that the circumstances of her encounter with officer jordan at the traffic stop are relevant to show intent or knowledge 
we also believe that the traffic stop is sufficiently similar to be relevant.the other bad act need not be identical to the crime charged so long as it is sufficiently similar to allow a juror to draw a reasonable inference probative of knowledge or intent.united states,cir.we have considered landry contention that the traffic stop is not sufficiently similar because she provided the officer with a social security number,not an actual one as alleged in the charged crime.we find probative,however,her willingness in both situations to lie when asked for personal identification information.because landry defense was good faith and computer error,landry willingness to give a false,even if,social security number is suggestive of her intent to provide another identity as her own.
the bad act also was not so distant in time from the charged event as to be irrelevant.the submission of the credit card applications and use of the chase card occurred from april to june,the traffic stop occurred on june.the traffic stop,then,occurred a little over a year after the charged crimes.see lugo guerrero,at concluding that the prior bank robberies were not too remote because they occurred within fifteen months of the charged robbery.
the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the traffic stop was specially relevant under rule b to show landry intent.
we now turn to the second part of the test,namely whether the evidence meets the standard of rule.rule provides that relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.danger of unfair prejudice occurs if the evidence invites the jury to render a verdict on an improper emotional basis.varoudakis,at.moreover,rule judgments are typically battlefield determinations,and great deference is owed to the trial court superior coign of vantage.united states shinderman,cir.
the district court was entitled to conclude that it was unlikely that the jury would be influenced emotionally by evidence of the traffic stop.the traffic stop involved no graphic or shocking events that might play upon a jury passions.the district court was also careful in handling the traffic stop evidence.it provided a specific limiting instruction cautioning the jury not to consider the traffic stop as evidence of propensity.in addition,the district court allowed the evidence only after verifying that landry would be raising a defense of good faith and computer error.given the limiting instruction and nature of the evidence,the danger of unfair prejudice from the traffic stop was low.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of the traffic stop under rule b.
landry also seeks review of the district court decision to admit evidence of her conviction for which mbna terminated her employment.we review the district court admission of this evidence for abuse of discretion.hicks,at.the district court determined that all of landry prior convictions on her driving record were inadmissible under rule a.specifically,the district court found that the driving record convictions were not germane to landry credibility.some convictions were very remote,with one at least eight years old,and no similarity existed between the convictions and the alleged crime.the district court also determined that,under rule a,the prejudicial effect of the driving record convictions outweighed any probative value.in particular,the district court observed that t he plain fact of the matter is jurors do tend to like people who drive drunk,and their view of the defendant two convictions might affect their ability to view fairly the evidence in this case.trial tr.vol.ii.
during landry testimony,however,the district court ruled in a sidebar that it would allow evidence of the charge that had lead to landry termination from mbna.landry testified on direct examination
