defendant appellant martin kimber pled guilty in the united states district court for the northern district of new york lawrence kahn,judge on november,to an information charging him with one count of use of a chemical weapon in violation of a count one,one count of possession of a chemical weapon in violation of a count two,and one count of consumer product tampering in violation of a count three.the charges arose from kimber dispersing liquid mercury at the albany medical center amc in albany,new york on four separate occasions between march and march in an effort to disrupt the facility services in retaliation for what he considered to be substandard care and excessive billing.kimber was sentenced on september,principally to months imprisonment on counts one and two,and months imprisonment on the count three,to run concurrently.
on appeal,kimber challenges his conviction on counts one and two,arguing that his conduct is not covered by a in light of the supreme court decision in bond united states.bond ii.he also claims that his counsel below was ineffective for failing to raise such a challenge.additionally,kimber argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the sentencing court erred in i applying a offense adjustment for use of a special skill in the commission of the offenses ii applying a adjustment for the vulnerability of the victims of the offenses iii failing to adequately consider the factors enumerated in a and iv failing to adequately explain its choice of sentence.we conclude that a reaches kimber conduct and that his sentence was not procedurally unreasonable.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
after receiving medical treatment from the amc in december,martin kimber grew irate over what he considered to be substandard care and excessive billing.a new york licensed pharmacist for years,he decided to retaliate by dispersing elemental mercury throughout the amc for the stated purpose of causing panic at the hospital and its cafeteria and an attendant loss of business when people became fearful of gaining treatment and eating there.app x at.elemental mercury is a neurotoxin that can be absorbed through ingestion,contact with unbroken skin or,if evaporated,through inhalation.once in the body,mercury enters the bloodstream and can linger for years.it can cause death,brain and nervous system damage,and other serious bodily injuries,with particularly severe effects on young children and in utero fetuses.
on march,kimber drove the fifty miles to the amc from his home in ruby,new york to launch his first of four attacks.he deposited several pounds of mercury in various sections of the amc,including outside a postoperative care unit and near the triage window in the emergency room.the attack caused hospital officials to close the emergency room while emergency response units collected the mercury,delaying care for many waiting patients.kimber returned to the amc for three additional attacks.he deposited another one to two pounds of mercury in an amc hallway and bathroom on april,and another approximately two pounds in an amc corridor and pedestrian ramp on june.the fourth attack,on march,focused on the amc cafeteria.kimber placed mercury in,among other places,a salad bar,a toaster,a freezer,and in a container of chicken tenders being warmed under a heat lamp.an amc employee who purchased the chicken tenders was taken to the emergency room after potentially ingesting the mercury.luckily,neither she nor anyone else suffered mercury poisoning from the attacks.
prior to the fourth attack,the amc had installed additional security cameras in response to the previous incidents.the local news displayed photographs of a suspect taken from the security footage,and the albany police department received three tips identifying the suspect as kimber.on march,kimber was arrested at his home.officers seized a container of mercury from kimber car and another from his garage.
kimber pled guilty to the information on november.under the terms of his plea agreement,kimber waived his right to appeal or collaterally attack his conviction and any sentence of imprisonment of months or less.the plea agreement included a section titled factual basis for the plea.in that section,kimber acknowledged that the purpose of his attacks was to retaliate for hospital bills that he felt were unfair by causing panic at amc and an attendant loss of business when people became fearful of gaining treatment and eating there.app x at.kimber admitted that he understood mercury harmful effects on humans and that to receive and maintain his license and work as a licensed pharmacist,he received education and training on the effects,harmful and otherwise,of chemicals and substances on the human body,as well as how to research such effects.id.at.kimber also acknowledged that he understood that the heating of elemental mercury,including the placing of mercury on or in toasters,and on or around heated food,greatly increased the likelihood that mercury would vaporize into the air and be inhaled by individuals consuming such food or located near such heating devices.id.at.
the presentence investigation report psr,issued on july,elaborated on the risks inherent in kimber attacks.it noted that elemental mercury is a silvery liquid at room temperature that has a very high vapor pressure and readily evaporates into the air at room temperature,where it can cause an extreme hazard if inhaled.psr.the psr found that a t room temperature mercury is highly volatile and absorbed into the blood with efficiency approaching by inhalation and that,at temperatures reached in a toaster,even a teaspoon of mercury can cause concentration levels within five feet to exceed times the observable toxic effect level for persistent nervous system damage.psr.
the psr calculated a base offense level of and recommended a increase for substantial disruption of public,governmental,or business functions or services pursuant to b,a increase for use of a special skill in the commission of the offenses pursuant to,and a decrease for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to.the resulting total offense level of and criminal history category of i yielded a guidelines range of to months.
kimber did not contest the facts presented in the psr but challenged the increase for use of a special skill on the ground that the offenses,as committed,involved no special skill.for its part,the government argued that the psr was mistaken in not recommending an additional increase pursuant to,which applies i f the defendant knew or should have known that a victim of the offense was a vulnerable victim.the psr explained that a adjustment was considered in view of the commission of the offense at a hospital wherein individuals who are vulnerable due to their physical condition could potentially have been victimized,such as patients in the emergency room,but the adjustment was not recommended because no known vulnerable victims have been identified as being impacted or targeted by the offense.psr.the government contended that patients whose care was delayed when kimber attack shut down amc emergency room were victims of his offenses,and that did not require that a victim be targeted because of her vulnerability.
kimber was sentenced on september.the court adopted the findings and recommendations of the psr,except that it applied a vulnerable victim adjustment because 
the amc has confirmed that at the time of the mercury attacks there were patients in the impacted areas who were critically ill and not in a position to seek treatment at another hospital or otherwise in a position to protect themselves.additionally,the executive vice president and chief operating officer of the amc has stated that the facility is the sole trauma center for miles in all directions with over million people in this service area.
app x at.this resulted in a revised offense level of and a guidelines range of to months.stating that it had considered the relevant factors under a,the court sentenced kimber principally to months on counts and,and months on count,to run concurrently.the court explained that it had imposed a sentence at the top of the guidelines range because 
the guidelines do not take into consideration the fact that the defendant dispensed mercury at the amc on four separate occasions,one of which was directly into food which was readily available for consumption by employees,visitors and the general public.furthermore,the defendant substantially endangered public health and safety,acting in a manner which was deliberate,planned and in doing so,significantly caused a risk for public health and security.
app x at.kimber did not object to the court explanation for the sentence,its consideration of the a factors,or its application of the adjustment.
the terms of the plea agreement permitted kimber to appeal his sentence because it exceeded months.he did so on september,arguing that the sentencing court had erred in applying the and adjustments,and in failing to adequately explain its sentence or consider the a factors.on june,after kimber had filed his principal brief,the supreme court in bond ii vacated a conviction under a on the grounds that the provision does not cover the unremarkable local offense of an amateur attempt by a jilted wife to injure her husband lover with chemicals,which ended up causing only a minor thumb burn.kimber sought and obtained leave to file a supplemental brief addressing whether his conduct violated a i in light of bond ii.the government elected not to seek enforcement of kimber appeal waiver with respect to this challenge.kimber also argued in his supplemental brief that his counsel below was ineffective for failing to challenge kimber prosecution under a.
discussion 
convictions under a and ineffective assistance claima.chemical weapons convention implementation act of 
congress enacted the chemical weapons convention implementation act of the implementation act,stat,to implement the convention on chemical weapons the convention,ratified by the united states in.the convention,prompted in part by the tokyo subway attacks,aimed to expand the prohibition on chemical weapons beyond state actors in wartime.bond ii.at.accordingly,the implementation act makes it unlawful for any person knowingly to develop,produce,otherwise acquire,transfer directly or indirectly,receive,stockpile,retain,own,possess,or use,or threaten to use,any chemical weapon.a.chemical weapon is defined broadly as any toxic chemical and its precursors.id.a.toxic chemical,in turn,is defined as any chemical which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death,temporary incapacitation or permanent harm to humans or animals.id.a.the implementation act excludes from the definition of chemical weapon any chemicals and precursors intended for a purpose not prohibited under this chapter,defined in part as a ny peaceful purpose related to an industrial,agricultural,research,medical,or pharmaceutical activity or other activity.id.a,a.violation of is punishable by imprisonment for any term of years,or if a victim death results,the death penalty or imprisonment for life.id.a.
the bond saga began when carol anne bond,a microbiologist from lansdale,pennsylvania,learned in that her husband was having an affair with her best friend,myrlinda haynes.she did not take the news well.on at least two dozen occasions,bond placed on haynes car door,mailbox,and door knob a mixture of chloro phenoxarsine,an compound that bond had stolen from her employer,and potassium dichromate,a chemical commonly used in cleaning laboratory equipment that bond had purchased on the internet.while both chemicals are toxic and potentially lethal in high doses,bond did not intend to kill haynes,hoping instead that haynes would touch the chemicals and develop an uncomfortable rash.bond ii.at.haynes was able to avoid the easily visible chemicals all but one time,when she suffered a minor chemical burn on her thumb,which she treated by rinsing with water.id.bond was charged with two counts of possessing and using a chemical weapon,in violation of a.after entering a conditional guilty plea,she challenged her conviction,arguing that the implementation act was an unconstitutional encroachment on state sovereignty under the tenth amendment.the third circuit held that bond lacked standing to bring such a challenge,united states bond,cir,and the supreme court reversed without expressing a view on the merits.bond united states,at.bond i.on remand,bond renewed her constitutional argument and,alternatively,contended that the implementation act did not reach her conduct.the third circuit rejected both arguments,holding that the implementation act clearly covered bond conduct and was a constitutional exercise of congress authority to enact legislation under the necessary and proper clause.united states bond,cir.
the supreme court again reversed,concluding that the implementation act expressed no clear intention to reach local criminal activity traditionally left to the states.bond ii.at.absent such a clear intention,the court held that a does not cover the unremarkable local offense of an amateur attempt by a jilted wife to injure her husband lover,which ended up causing only a minor thumb burn.id.at.the court reasoned that to hold otherwise would transform the statute from one whose core concerns are acts of war,assassination,and terrorism into a massive federal regime that reaches the simplest of assaults.id.at.
the court explained that the applicability of a depends on both the particular chemicals that the defendant used and the circumstances in which she used them.id.at.no reasonable observer when describing bond act of revenge born of romantic jealousy would say that a chemical weapon was deployed in norristown,pennsylvania.id.at.moreover,the court observed that the chemicals bond used bear little resemblance to the deadly toxins that are of particular danger to the objectives of the convention.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.those same chemicals might,however,be chemical weapons if used,say,to poison a city water supply.id.at.
the court hypothetical formed part of its explanation that the bond case is unusual,and the court analysis is appropriately limited.id.at.the court recognized the federal government substantial interest in enforcing criminal laws against assassination,terrorism,and acts with the potential to cause mass suffering and explained that its holding will not disrupt the government authority to prosecute such offenses.id.at.it contrasted the facts of bond with those of the handful of other prosecutions that have been brought under m ost of which involved either terrorist plots or the possession of extremely dangerous substances with the potential to cause severe harm to many people.id.for example,in united states crocker the defendant attempted to acquire chlorine gas and vx nerve gas in order to attack a federal courthouse.app x cir.and in united states fries the defendant set off a homemade chlorine bomb,requiring evacuation of a residential neighborhood.no.cr,wl.
applying a to kimber conduct in light of bond ii 
kimber argues that bond ii precludes his prosecution under the implementation act because,as in that case,his crime was purely local,caused no significant injury,and involved a commercially available chemical.each of these contentions ignores important distinctions from bond ii.
to begin,we reject kimber characterization of his offenses as purely local.kimber did not place liquid mercury at the private residence or on the personal vehicle of a neighbor.instead,he targeted an institution fifty miles from his home that provides the public with vital services.exposing many members of the public to a dangerous chemical presents a far cry from the local assault s aimed at one individual at issue in bond ii.at.moreover,the amc is the only trauma center for miles in all directions,meaning that its disruption could affect entire regions of new york and neighboring states.
that kimber attacks happened not to cause significant injury is not dispositive.rather,it is sufficient that he placed many people at risk of serious harm.as bond ii explains,a applies to acts with the potential to cause mass suffering and substances with the potential to cause severe harm to many people.at emphasis added.unlike bond,kimber placed chemicals in highly trafficked public locations,where many people would naturally be exposed.at temperatures reached in a toaster,even a teaspoon of mercury can cause concentration levels within five feet to exceed times the observable toxic effect level for persistent nervous system damage.psr c.and while vaporized mercury posed perhaps the most acute risk,dispersing liquid mercury throughout the amc likewise exposed amc staff and visitors to a risk of significant harm.to choose but one example,an amc cafeteria customer might easily have placed her hand in the freezer to retrieve food and absorbed mercury through her unbroken skin.
nor is the commercial availability of mercury dispositive.section clearly extends to commercially available chemicals by exempting some chemicals covered by the implementation act when they are used for peaceful purpose s related to an industrial,agricultural,research,medical or pharmaceutical activity.a.for example,chlorine is commercially available,yet,as bond ii suggested,it may serve as a chemical weapon when used to make a chlorine bomb.at,citing crocker,app x,and fries,wl.the chemicals at issue in bond ii were also commercially available and b ore little resemblance to the deadly toxins that are of particular danger to the objectives of the convention.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,the court noted that those very chemicals might be fairly classified as chemical weapons if used to poison a city water supply.id.at.
thus,we consider not only the particular chemicals that the defendant used but also the circumstances in which he used them.id.at.in stark contrast to the facts of bond,kimber acts in addition to having the potential to cause severe harm to many people,id.at were calculated to provoke fear among the public and thereby affect its behavior.kimber explained that the purpose of the attacks was to retaliate against amc by causing panic at the and an attendant loss of business when people became fearful of gaining treatment and eating there.app x at.kimber stated purpose of coercing and intimidating the public into forgoing treatment at the amc renders his conduct quintessential terrorism.see webster ninth new collegiate dictionary defining terrorism as the systematic use of terror esp ecially as a means of coercion defining domestic terrorism,in part,as activities that involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the united states and appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population.the supreme court made clear in bond ii that the federal government undoubtedly has a substantial interest in enforcing criminal law against terrorism.at,and that addressing acts of terrorism was a core concern of the implementation act,id.at.
we therefore conclude that kimber attempt to deter the public from seeking treatment at a regionally important medical center for fear of exposure to a dangerous chemical violates a.
ineffective assistance claim 
kimber contends that his counsel below was ineffective for failing to challenge his prosecution under a.he argues that,although bond ii was not decided until after his guilty plea in,its holding should have been anticipated in light of the supreme court ruling in bond i in that bond had standing to challenge the implementation act.kimber has also submitted an affidavit stating that,had he known that the charges under a were susceptible to challenge,he would not have entered into the plea agreement.
when a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised on direct appeal,we may decline to hear the claim,permitting the appellant to raise the issue as part of a subsequent petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to remand the claim to the district court for necessary factfinding or decide the claim on the record before us.united states morris,cir.i n most cases a motion brought under is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance.massaro united states,see also united states khedr,cir.however,we may decide ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal when their resolution is beyond any doubt or to do so would be in the interest of justice.united states griffiths,cir,quoting khedr,at.here,resolution of kimber ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal is appropriate because the claim depends entirely on a legal question the applicability of a to his conduct that is the subject of kimber appeal on the merits.
ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations can invalidate a guilty plea and make granting withdrawal appropriate,to the extent that the counsel deficient performance undermines the voluntary and intelligent nature of defendant decision to plead guilty.united states arteca,cir.under the familiar strickland test,to establish an ineffective assistance claim kimber must show that his counsel conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.strickland washington,
kimber claim fails at the first prong,as he can not show that his counsel was constitutionally deficient in failing to challenge his prosecution under a.at the time of kimber guilty plea,the supreme court had not granted certiorari to hear bond ii,and no federal appellate court,let alone the supreme court,had held that the implementation act did not reach conduct that might be described as local.a n attorney is not required to forecast changes or advances in the law in order to provide effective assistance.mccoy united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.moreover,as this opinion explains,a covers kimber conduct even in light of bond ii.because a challenge to the applicability of a to kimber conduct fails,kimber counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise it.see aparicio artuz,cir because petitioner claim was meritless,petitioner trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise it.
ii.sentencing challenges 
kimber argues that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable because the sentencing court erred in i applying a offense adjustment for use of a special skill in the commission of the offenses ii applying a adjustment for the vulnerability of the victims of the offenses iii failing to adequately consider the factors enumerated in a and iv failing to adequately explain its choice of sentence.we review de novo the legal question of what constitutes a special skill and review for clear error a sentencing court finding that use of a special skill significantly facilitated the commission of an offense.united states spencer,cir.because kimber challenged only the application of the special skill adjustment before the sentencing court,we review his other claims for plain error,asking whether there was an error that was plain that affected defendant substantial rights and that seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states morris,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
special skill adjustment 
the district court adjusted kimber offense level upward by two levels under,which applies i f the defendant used a special skill,in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.an application note to this provision defines a special skill as a skill not possessed by members of the general public and usually requiring substantial education,training or licensing,and includes chemists as an example of those possessing a special skill.cmt.
kimber does not contest that as a licensed pharmacist he possessed a relevant special skill namely,a knowledge of chemicals and their effect on the human body.instead,he contends that there was no finding or evidence that he used this special skill in the commission or concealment of his offenses.
this contention is defeated by the facts admitted in kimber plea agreement,which include that kimber understood that the heating of elemental mercury,including the placing of mercury on or in toasters,and on or around heated food,greatly incr
