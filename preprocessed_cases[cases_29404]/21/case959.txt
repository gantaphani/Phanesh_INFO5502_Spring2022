this case is before us for a second with the parties roles reversed.in its first iteration,a panel of this court set aside the district court entry of judgment for the defendants and reinstated guilty verdicts returned by the jury.see united states moran,cir moran i.the district court subsequently declared untimely the defendants belated efforts to secure a new trial and imposed sentence.the defendants now appeal.
this time around,we are asked to reconsider the original panel decision to reverse the district court determination that the defendants did not file a timeous motion for new trial and to grant relief from the judgments of conviction on the ground that the defendants were burdened by ineffective assistance of counsel.in addition,the defendants advance,for the first time,claims of instructional error and prosecutorial misconduct.we reject outright the vast majority of these animadversions.as to the ineffective assistance claims,however,we find the record insufficient to rule definitively,and so dismiss those claims without prejudice to their renewal in proceedings under.
background 
we sketch the facts of the offenses of conviction,referring the reader who hungers for more exegetic detail to our earlier opinion.see moran i,at.following the established praxis,we rehearse these facts in the light most compatible with the verdicts.see,united states hussein,cir.
in october of,john moran,an attorney who represented,inter alios,first american bank for savings,met with edgar puente and david boersner,aspiring real estate developers,who were seeking financing for a pair of projects in boston,massachusetts.the developers hired moran as their mortgage broker and agreed to pay him of the face amount of any loans that he procured on their behalf.moran arranged a meeting between the developers and a first american loan officer,edmund noke,during which noke agreed to lend puente and boersner.following this meeting,the developers agreed that moran would receive a profit interest in the two projects.his wife,nora sat on the board of directors of first the moran development group trust mdg trust to hold the equity interest and named herself sole trustee.under state law,the identity of the beneficiaries of the mdg trust was not a matter of public record.
in november of,moran submitted formal loan proposals to first american on behalf of puente and boersner.he disclosed neither his profit interest nor his anticipated brokerage fee,even though he was duty bound to do so.first american executive committee approved the loans in december,and the bank designated moran as its closing attorney.moran conducted the closing,charged the bank handsomely for his services,and unbeknownst to the bank collected from the developers.he never submitted the customary settlement sheets,which would have detailed the use of the loan proceeds and,thus,would have revealed his conflicted interests.
the record indicates that the loans were among loans approved that month by the bank executive committee.the committee considered those loans for approval in two groups.the first vote approved a block of loans,and the second approved the remaining.the loans were part of the second smaller lot.the executive committee sent a report of its december activities to the bank board of directors,but only provided details as to the first batch of loans.
in january,the board of directors,including moran,met to consider the december report.the parties fiercely contest exactly what transpired at that meeting.the government version,disputed by the defendants,is that moran voted either to ratify or approve the loans instead of disqualifying herself due to her and her husband financial interests.whatever happened that day,it is clear that moran never disclosed to first american the morans financial interests in the loans.
by,the loans were underwater.spurred by the prospect of a substantial loss,first american began an investigation that would eventually uncover the manifold irregularities surrounding the loans and the morans interests in them.in a meeting with first american outside counsel,moran admitted that she knew about her husband financial stake at the time the loans were approved.for his part,moran claimed that he had fully recounted his conflicted interests to noke.the bank records did not reflect any such disclosure.
even though the loans eventually soured and the bank failed,the saga continued.on july,a federal grand jury indicted the morans for,inter alia,committing bank fraud by failing to disclose their financial interests in the projects,aiding and abetting bank fraud,id,and conspiring to commit bank fraud,id.trial commenced on may.as to moran,the government introduced evidence describing his fiduciary duties to the bank.it also adduced evidence showing that the paperwork he had submitted to first american did not disclose either the brokerage or arrangements.finally,noke testified that moran never divulged his economic stake in the development projects and stated that such a revelation would have led to the filing of an insider transaction report.the government then showed that no such report appeared in the bank archives.
the government case against moran was thinner.it did,however,introduce evidence limning her regulatory and fiduciary duties and showing that she was involved in various ways with the loans,she had visited the sites during a inspection,had created the mdg trust and named herself as trustee,and was generally privy to her husband financial dealings.the government also proved that moran had failed to apprise her fellow board members about the morans financial interests in the projects 
the defense moved for judgment of acquittal following the close of the government case in chief.a.the district court denied the motions.during the defense case,moran testified that he had made full disclosure to noke.moran did not testify.the government presented one rebuttal witness.at the close of all the evidence,the defense again moved for judgment of acquittal.the district court reserved decision.b,and the jury found the defendants guilty on all the submitted counts.
the verdicts were recorded on july,and judgment entered on that date.the next day,the morans filed a renewed motion for judgment of acquittal.see.c.the district court granted the morans an extension of time within which to file supplemental memoranda.on september,each defendant filed a supplemental memorandum that asked the court,among other things,to treat the joint july motion,in the alternative,as a motion for new trial under.the government opposed both the motion for judgment of acquittal and the requests for conversion.the district court pondered the matter at length on july,it granted the motion for judgment of acquittal without addressing the conversion requests.
the government appealed from this ruling.we reversed.moran i,at.as to moran,we found ample evidence to support the verdict he had a plain duty to disclose his sharply conflicted financial interests to the bank,and his testimony that he had made the disclosure allowed the jury,based on credibility and demeanor,to disbelieve him and credit noke contrary testimony.id.at.to buttress that permissible finding,the record supported the conclusion that moran intentionally failed to disclose the information in order to gain a financial advantage.id.at.in sum,there was sufficient evidence to allow a rational jury to conclude,beyond a reasonable doubt,that moran concealed his financial arrangements with puente and boersner pursuant to an affirmative endeavor calculated to defraud first american.id.at.
as to moran,we found that although the government theory that she had voted to ratify or approve the loans did not pass muster,see supra note,there were other,independently sufficient grounds for upholding the verdict.id.at.specifically,the government had presented adequate evidence to allow a rational jury to conclude that moran,aware of her husband outside dealings and arrangements concerning the projects prior to the consummation of the transactions at issue,chose not to disclose the conflicts because she anticipated that a financial windfall would accrue to her husband and by extension to her should the loans be approved.id.we also discerned significant evidence that moran had aided and abetted her husband scheme she accompanied her husband on an inspection of the properties before the loan applications were submitted she created the mdg trust two days before the bank executive committee approved the loans and she named herself as trustee instead of moran secretary as was their custom.id.we also observed that moran regularly shared financial matters with her husband and that she was,in her own right,an astute real estate broker and bank director familiar with the affirmative duties of disclosure.id.at.taken as a whole,this evidence sufficed for a rational jury to convict moran of both bank fraud and conspiracy.id.at.chief judge boudin joined in the reinstatement of the convictions but wrote separately to suggest that the thinness of the evidence against moran probably would support an order granting her a new trial if the district court found that she had timely sought that anodyne.id.at boudin,concurring.
on remand,the morans moved for a hearing on their outstanding requests to convert their rule motion into a rule motion.the government filed an opposition.the district court rebuffed the conversion requests,ruling that the defendants had not seasonably moved for a new trial.the court proceeded to pronounce sentence.these timely appeals followed.
ii.analysis 
we divide our analysis into several discrete segments,corresponding with the variety of the defendants arguments.
law of the case.
we start with moran explicit beseechment that we revisit and repudiate the prior panel opinion.the government counters that we are without the power to conduct such a review under the law of the case doctrine and that,in all events,the predecessor panel got it right.we give each side half a loaf.on the one hand,we agree with moran that,as a theoretical matter,we have some limited reexamine our earlier decision.on the other hand,we agree with the government that the circumstances at hand do not warrant displacing the earlier ruling.
the law of the case doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.arizona california,d.the doctrine has two branches.the first mandate relitigation in the trial court of matters that were explicitly or implicitly decided by an earlier appellate decision in the same case.united states vigneau,cir.the second branch contemplates that a legal decision made at one stage of a criminal or civil proceeding should remain the law of that case throughout the litigation,unless and until the decision is modified or overruled by a higher court.see christianson colt indus.oper g,d.that branch binds,for example,a successor appellate panel in a second appeal in the same case,see cohen brown,cir,and a successor trial judge who steps in to complete a pending case,see flibotte.truck lines,cir.
we are dealing here with the second branch of the law of the case doctrine.that branch is prudential and,accordingly,is more flexible than the first.we recently catalogued several situations in which a court might appropriately reconsider its past decision.see ellis united states,cir.moran asseverates that this case comes within that taxonomy as a case in which reconsideration may be appropriate to avoid manifest injustice.id.at.
while ellis recognized this we reaffirm its litigant seeking to fit within its confines must negotiate a steep uphill climb.in this context,a finding of manifest injustice requires,at a bare minimum,a definite and firm conviction that a prior ruling on a material matter is unreasonable or obviously wrong,and resulted in prejudice.id.at.moran can not scale these heights.
in mounting her argument,moran relies exclusively on chief judge boudin concurring opinion in moran i.what she seemingly fails to appreciate is that even the author of that concurrence concluded that there was sufficient evidence upon which to ground a conviction.moran i,at boudin,concurring.that conclusion is antithetic to moran claim that the concurrence necessitates or even supports a finding that the earlier panel opinion was,in the ellis phrase,unreasonable or obviously wrong.ellis,at.since moran points to no other authority to support such a finding,there is no basis for suspecting manifest injustice here.we therefore decline moran invitation to disturb the decision in moran 
b.the attempted conversion.
a motion for a new trial in a federal criminal case,other than a motion alleging newly discovered evidence,must be filed within seven days next following the initial entry of judgment.b.moran filed no such motion within the allotted interval.in an endeavor to repair this omission,he asseverates that the defendants timely motion for judgment of acquittal should have been considered alternatively as a motion for new trial and that,therefore,the district court should have converted that rule motion into a rule motion for a new trial this asseveration is hopeless.
the motion to which moran alludes was captioned motion for judgment of acquittal and for additional time to file memoranda.the body of the motion reads in relevant part 
now come defendants john and nora moran,through counsel,and pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure and hereby renew their motions for this honorable court to enter a judgment of acquittal as to all counts of the superseding indictment.in support thereof,counsel states the following 
t he government failed to offer sufficient evidence upon which a rational jury could find the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crimes of bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
the government evidence is equally consistent with guilt as it is with innocence which requires a judgment of acquittal.
assuming arguendo that the government established that the defendants violated bank policy civil banking regulations,the government failed to introduce any other conduct which may form the basis for a bank fraud conviction.
the government has failed to prove intent on the part of the defendants.
assuming arguendo that the government has proven that the defendants intended to defraud first american bank,it failed to prove that their statements or omissions were material.
wherefore,based upon the foregoing arguing sic arguments and authorities this honorable court is respectfully urged to permit the defendants additional time to file memoranda in support of the instant motion and to enter a judgment of acquittal as to all counts of the superseding indictment.
moran suggests that this motion was sufficient to permit a judge to grant him a new trial based on the following syllogism i the substance of a motion,not its title,controls ii a motion pointing out that the government did not have enough evidence to convict a defendant,a priori,supports a claim that the weight of the evidence tipped greatly in the defendant favor iii such a finding would support the granting of a new trial and so iv a motion seeking judgment of acquittal because of insufficient moran motion logically must encompass a request for a new trial.
taken in the abstract,some of these premises are correct.for example,we have stated that i n addressing a motion,a court is not bound by the label that the movant fastens to it and may reclassify the motion as its substance suggests.vasapolli rostoff,cir.so too a timely motion for new trial may be granted when evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict.united states wilkerson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.but two swallows do not a summer make,and moran syllogism falls apart when one analyzes its conclusion that a motion seeking a judgment of acquittal on grounds necessarily must be read as requesting a consolation prize in the nature of a new trial.
that reading is neither logically compelled nor legally appropriate.where the motion papers can not be fairly construed as a request for a new trial,a district court does not have the authority,sua sponte,to convert a motion for judgment of acquittal into a motion for a new trial.united states navarro viayra,cir united states brown,cir.that choice is the defendant and the defendant alone.what is more,it must be exercised within the time parameters prescribed by the criminal rules.
as said.b specifies that a motion for new trial,other than a motion grounded on newly discovered evidence,must be filed within seven days of the jury verdict,the entry of judgment.that rule was amended in to make it clear that a judge has no power to order a new trial on his own motion once judgment has entered.advisory committee notes amendments.simultaneously,the advisory committee made it pellucid that the criminal rules forbid an interpretation that would allow a district court,on its own initiative,to evade the temporal strictures of rule by reading into a rule motion for judgment of acquittal a request for a new trial,not solicited by the movant.see.advisory committee notes amendments,subdivision c explaining that rule c precludes an interpretation that gives the district court power to order a new trial even though the defendant has not asked for one.
viewed against this backdrop,it is transparently clear that even if a motion for judgment of acquittal contains a substantive basis sufficient to ground the grant of a new trial,a court is without power to treat the motion as a motion for a new trial unless it also contains some overt indication that the movant desires that relief.the motion in this case contained no such indication.it invoked rule,not rule,and the only relief requested was an outright acquittal.it was not until september,beyond the moran informed the district court of his desire for a new trial.that was too late 
that disposes of this assignment of error.the criminal rules gave moran seven days within which to move for a new trial.he failed to seek that relief,and his timely motion for judgment of acquittal did not fill the void.consequently,the district court acted appropriately both in denying moran belated conversion request and in refusing to grant a new trial.
ineffective assistance of counsel.
the defendants next claim that the failure of their trial attorneys to file timely new trial motions constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and,as such,justifies retrial.this claim,raised for the first time in this venue,is premature.
we have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that claims of ineffective assistance can not make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions,but,rather,must originally be presented to,and acted upon by,the trial court.united states mala,cir collecting cases.this rule is prudential in nature.a claim of ineffective assistance requires a showing that the attorney turned in a constitutionally deficient performance that prejudiced the defendant substantial rights.see strickland washington,d united states,cir.claims of this sort typically require the resolution of factual issues that can not efficaciously be addressed in the first instance by an appellate tribunal.mala,at.in addition,the insights of the trier,who has seen and heard the witnesses at first hand and watched the dynamics of the trial unfold,are often of great assistance.see,united states fish,cir united states mcgill,cir.
this is such a case.no ineffective assistance claim surfaced in the district court,and the record is barren of evidence as to why the lawyers did what they did.there are both tactical and strategic reasons why a party might seek a judgment of acquittal but not a new trial for example,a fear that the prosecution will learn from its mistakes and put in a more persuasive case the second time around,a fear that the decisionmaker will take a request for acquittal less seriously if a possible as a new on the table,or a fear that a shift in judges will lead to a stiffer sentence.although hindsight is always,we can not tell from this record whether the decision not to seek a new trial,when made,was a calculated stratagem or a mere oversight.factfinding will be required to make that determination,which means that the district court should hear the claim in the first instance.see,mcgill,at.
we add,moreover,that even if the failure to ask for a new trial betokens objectively unreasonable and,therefore,constitutionally deficient performance on the part of the matter on which we take no remains to be determined whether any such failure was prejudicial within the meaning of strickland.a finding of prejudice here would require a subsidiary finding that,but for the error,the moving defendant probably would have received a new trial.see,flores demskie,cir.that question is not open and shut.each defendant must independently demonstrate that,given the holding of this court in moran i,an objectively reasonable district court would likely have granted a new trial see butcher united states,cir ouber guarino,cir.the nisi prius court is the proper forum in which the defendants may attempt to make this showing.
for these reasons,we decline to entertain the ineffective assistance claims here and now.instead,we dismiss them without prejudice to their reassertion,should the defendants so choose,in proceedings under.
miscellaneous assignments of error.
there are two other issues lurking at the periphery of these appeals both defendants argue that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on the bank fraud count and moran urges that the prosecutors summation misstated both the facts and the law.before addressing these issues,we turn to a threshold question are these claims of error foreclosed by the defendants failure,as appellees,to pursue them during the original appeal moran i 
preclusion.we begin our discussion on a cautionary note the government did not make a preclusion argument in its main appellate brief,but,rather,frontally addressed the substance of the morans assignments of error.we recognized the possibility of preclusion during oral argument and requested supplemental briefing on the point.the government,in its supplemental brief,has argued for its failure to raise the preclusion issue in a timely manner is reason enough to deem it waived.see united states,cir united states,cir.
to be sure,we have discretion,in the interests of justice,to overlook this kind of lack of developed the government in a criminal case.see,united states rose,cir.even were we prone to exercise that discretion here,it would not profit the government.we explain briefly.
in general,available claims of error not raised in an initial appeal may not be raised during subsequent appeals in the same case.see united states,cir explaining that appellate courts will refuse to consider trial court rulings that could have been raised on an earlier appeal see also united states ticchiarelli,cir.here,however,the morans were appellees during the first appeal.that juxtaposition may make a material difference where,as here,the judgment from which an appeal is taken is entirely favorable to the appellee and that party,after losing the appeal,then seeks to raise a new issue during a later appeal of an unfavorable judgment.see,laitram nec,crocker piedmont aviation.absent a,an appellee can only raise arguments in support of the judgment during the course of an appeal.united states am.ry.express.martin tango restaurant,cir.a normally is improper when taken by a defendant from a favorable judgment,field mans,cir,and arguably impermissible when taken by a defendant from a judgment of acquittal in a criminal case.see united states boyd,cir united states williams,cir.
given these authorities,we need not decide definitively whether a might have been permitted in connection with the government earlier appeal of the judgments of acquittal.when an appellee fails to contest a point that is irrelevant unless the main appeal results in reversal or remand,this court,even if a theoretically might have been possible,has been reluctant to find preclusion.see field,at abjuring preclusion based solely on a failure to file a procedurally dubious relating to what might originally have seemed an entirely redundant point.
let us be perfectly clear.there are times when even an appellee who is defending an entirely favorable judgment must either raise an error purportedly committed by
