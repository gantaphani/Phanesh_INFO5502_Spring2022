jason moreno was involved in a scheme as an appraiser who supplied inflated appraisals to other members of the scheme in exchange for money.he was also more directly involved as broker,buyer,or seller,for instance in other fraudulent transactions.at trial,moreno was found guilty of five counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.after receiving his sentence of months imprisonment,moreno appealed.
three issues are presented in this appeal.first,at trial,a cooperating witness read statements of a secret service special agent into the record,which moreno claims violated both the confrontation clause and the rule against hearsay.second,at sentencing,the district court concluded that there were more than victims in the case and thus applied a enhancement under the sentencing guidelines on that basis.moreno contends that the record does not support such a finding and that the district court application of the enhancement was plain error.third,during moreno sentencing allocution,the prosecutor,without leave of court,engaged in a vigorous of moreno.on appeal,moreno says that the district court plainly erred in permitting this.we will affirm moreno conviction and the district court application of the sentencing enhancement,but we will vacate moreno sentence and remand for resentencing based on the violation of moreno right of allocution.
this case arose out of schemes that were perpetrated in the pittsburgh area from july to november,and centers on the involvement of jason moreno,an appraiser.moreno and his business partner,joel reck,started an appraisal company called platinum appraisal services.reck was a licensed appraiser,but moreno was not.early in platinum appraisal services existence,reck became ill and,for the most part,stopped working.to fill the void left by reck,moreno began performing the appraisal work himself,frequently signing reck name electronically to appraisals without reck knowledge.many of these appraisals violated professional norms and assigned inflated values to properties.moreno provided these appraisals to two different companies engaged in schemes pittsburgh home loans,which was owned by a mortgage broker named robert arakelian and easy realty solutions,which was owned and operated by james platts.
the pittsburgh home loans scheme worked by helping with bad credit and limited assets get lender financing.to accomplish this in a given transaction,arakelian of pittsburgh home loans would provide a false settlement statement at closing,which would contain an inflated sales price.based on the inflated sales price,a bank would lend more than the actual sales price of a property,and the extra money would cover the cost a down payment,closing costs,and a payment to arakelian.as a result,banks often gave loans in amounts that were of the actual purchase price.because a lender would receive paperwork representing the inflated purchase price,the lender would believe the loan met its underwriting guidelines typically an ratio.at closing,however,loan proceeds would be distributed according to the true nature of the transaction the seller would receive less than the reported purchase price,arakelian would receive an undisclosed payment,and loan funds would be used to make the and cover closing costs.a number of people were essential to the successful operation of the scheme including moreno,whose appraisals matched the fraudulent sales prices provided by arakelian.
the easy realty solutions scheme was similar.platts of easy realty solutions located distressed houses and buyers to whom they could be sold,and then acted as a secret intermediary to the transactions.platts would purchase a house and then resell it to a buyer at a higher price using a mortgage transaction.buyers paid nothing out of pocket.easy realty solutions involvement as an intermediary was concealed from lenders so that,in a given transaction,it appeared that the original seller sold the house directly to the eventual buyer.platts would pocket the difference between the sales prices.platts made numerous misrepresentations to lenders he concealed his role as conduit he misrepresented buyers assets he falsified settlement statements to show that buyers were making down payments that platts had actually made and that buyers had received permissible seller financing that was actually a sham for this scheme,moreno provided inflated appraisals to support the higher values needed.
at trial,the government offered documentary evidence of mortgage transactions which were financed by different lenders that were affected by one scheme or the other.testimonial evidence was provided for some of those transactions the government called buyers as witnesses,each of whom testified that the house he or she purchased was in poor condition and had been purchased with no down payment.most buyers who testified stated that they went into foreclosure shortly after closing.
moreno gave inflated values for houses he appraised.pittsburgh home loans used moreno specifically because he was willing to provide the necessary inflated appraisals,and,in exchange,pittsburgh home loans would pay moreno an extra fee ranging from to.moreno did not offer objective opinions of value but instead started with the predetermined value requested by pittsburgh home loans and worked backwards,manipulating the selection of comparable houses and misrepresenting condition reports for properties.the government introduced testimony from buyers and sellers who said that the houses in these transactions were in far worse condition than reported the government also introduced an appraiser who evaluated twelve platinum appraisal services appraisals and concluded that each substantially overstated the actual value of the house.in some instances,moreno received extra payments from buyers for whom he was providing inflated appraisals.for example,earl rodgers,a buyer who worked with arakelian,paid moreno an extra because the comparable houses would not substantiate the necessary value.once paid,moreno drew up an appraisal with the requested value.
moreno provided similarly inflated appraisals for easy realty solutions.for example,in one transaction,easy realty solutions purchased a property for and sold it almost immediately to a buyer with bad credit and no money for.platinum appraisal services valued the property at,citing numerous improvements that had never actually been done.easy realty solutions took approximately of the loan proceeds.
moreno involvement in the pittsburgh home loans and easy realty solutions schemes was not limited to providing inflated appraisals.the government introduced evidence that in seven instances moreno deals or arranged to purchase properties.by so doing,he received significant payments from the loan proceeds.in one deal,moreno and platts purchased a property for and resold it the same day for.moreno appraised it at,once again using reck name.moreno received of the buyer earnest money and once the deal closed.
moreno and arakelian completed several similar transactions.for instance,moreno purchased a house for and,with arakelian help,sold it to an impoverished buyer the same day for.moreno appraised the property at.arakelian took from the loan proceeds,and moreno took roughly.moreno appraisal of that house stated that it was functionally adequate,had no physical deficiencies,and had been completely remodeled.none of this was true the house was in deplorable condition.in another deal,moreno purchased a house through his mother for.despite serious problems with the septic tank which he did not disclose,moreno appraised the property at.the settlement statement showed a cash payment at closing,which the buyer had never made.moreno took more than from the loan proceeds,and arakelian took roughly.
moreno purchased another house for.he appraised the house at,misrepresented the house condition,provided false information about bank accounts and his monthly income,and falsely represented that he was putting into the purchase.arakelian convinced the realtor to change the listing price so that the lender would not discover that moreno appraisal overstated the house actual value.moreno participated in several other similar transactions from which he profited.
moreno was charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud,in violation of and five counts of wire fraud in violation of and.he pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial.on september,the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all seven counts.
arakelian was one of the government cooperating witnesses at trial.on,defense counsel attempted to impeach arakelian with his government cooperation.specifically,moreno lawyer asked arakelian questions about how his sentence could be affected by his cooperation against moreno.early in the government direct examination of him,however,arakelian had admitted that he had entered into a plea agreement with the government,that he was cooperating with the government,and that he hoped to receive a lighter sentence as a result of his cooperation.defense counsel on this subject was duplicative of arakelian earlier testimony.
nevertheless,on redirect,the prosecutor sought to admit as substantive evidence portions of memoranda written by secret service special agent keith heckman,which summarized heckman pretrial interviews with arakelian.defense counsel objected,though it is unclear whether he did so on the basis of hearsay or the confrontation clause.the prosecutor argued that the memoranda should be admitted pursuant to federal rule of evidence d b,which permits as prior consistent statements of a witness offered to rebut a charge of recent fabrication or improper influence.the district court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence.
the prosecutor gave arakelian four memoranda of interviews to review silently.arakelian confirmed that each accurately reflected information he had provided,and so the prosecutor then had arakelian read portions of each into the record.the portions included heckman assertions that according to arakelian,moreno greatly inflated values and was sometimes paid extra for doing so moreno partnered with arakelian on the acquisition of a property and pocketed some of the loan proceeds and moreno thought he was insulated from criminal liability for the fraud because the appraisals bore reck signature.
in february,moreno was sentenced.at the sentencing,moreno called eight character witnesses.defense counsel asked questions of each,and the prosecutor questioned three of them.after the final witness,defense counsel informed the court that moreno wanted to exercise his right of allocution.then moreno,under oath,addressed the court directly without questions from defense counsel.he asked the court for mercy and listed several mitigating circumstances for the court among other things,he apologized to his victims,explained that he was relatively young when he committed the crimes,spoke of recent changes in his life,said that he had become more religious,and stated that he was dedicating his life to preventing others from making the mistakes he had made.he also stated that he was prepared to accept the consequences of his actions,and he asked the court for mercy.he did not attempt to factual issues of innocence and guilt.
when moreno had finished speaking,the prosecutor without leave of court engaged in an extensive in which he questioned moreno about his criminal conduct.defense counsel did not object.moreno,who had not testified at trial,had no choice but to testify on matters of his guilt.the prosecutor explained to the district court,w hat i trying to figure out is what he knowingly,fraudulently submitted to the lenders.app.the prosecutor asked moreno tell the court,what were the other lies that were in these appraisals that you were submitting to the lender app.when moreno asked for clarification on a question,the prosecutor responded,tell the court,you the one accepting responsibility now.app.the prosecutor got moreno to admit that the evidence of fraud introduced at trial was just the tip of the iceberg.app.
after the,the district court offered defense counsel the opportunity to ask questions,which he took.the district court then made findings of fact regarding the testimony of the witnesses,moreno statement,and the prosecutor.the prosecutor sentencing argument addressed moreno statement and then argued that the seriousness of the offense had been ratcheted up based on what he had been able to drag out of moreno on.app.the prosecutor also referred to the to undercut moreno expression of remorse.
when explaining the sentence,the district court referenced the in rejecting various defense arguments for a lower sentence.the district court also noted moreno admission during the that he had prepared more than the fraudulent appraisals that had been proven at trial.the district court also concluded that the case involved more than victims and thus imposed a enhancement pursuant to b.defense counsel did not object to the application of this sentencing enhancement.
after concluding that moreno had a criminal history category of i and a total offense level of,the district court determined that the applicable guidelines range was months imprisonment.the court varied downward based primarily on moreno rehabilitation and after consideration of all the factors under u.a.the district court then imposed a sentence of months imprisonment for each count,which were to run concurrently,three years supervised release,and in restitution.following the sentence,moreno appealed.

our confrontation clause inquiry is twofold.first,a court should determine whether the contested statement by an declarant qualifies as testimonial under davis washington,and its progeny.berrios,at footnote omitted.s tatements made under circumstances that would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial are testimonial.united states hinton,cir.the core class of testimonial statements includes material such as affidavits,custodial examinations,prior testimony that the defendant was unable to,or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials,such as affidavits,depositions,prior testimony,or confessions.melendez diaz massachusetts,alteration omitted quoting crawford,at.
the second step in our confrontation clause inquiry requires that a court apply the appropriate safeguard if the absent witness statement is testimonial,then the confrontation clause requires unavailability and a prior opportunity for.berrios,at quoting crawford,at.
it is clear that a confrontation clause violation occurred here.first,the memoranda that arakelian read into the record were testimonial.they were heckman summaries of what arakelian purportedly told him during a series of interviews that is to say,they are investigative reports prepared by a government agent in actual anticipation of trial.as such,they were statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.melendez diaz,at quoting crawford,at.second,heckman was available but did not testify at trial 
our conclusion that a confrontation clause violation occurred,however,does not end the analysis.if we determine that the error was harmless,we may nevertheless affirm the conviction.a united states jimenez,cir the erroneous admission of testimonial hearsay in violation of the confrontation clause is simply an error in the trial process itself that we may affirm if the error was harmless.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.b efore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless,the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.chapman california.t he relevant question under chapman is not whether,in a trial that occurred without the error,a guilty verdict would surely have been rendered,but whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable to the error.united states waller,cir quoting gov t of the martinez,cir.
we consider several factors in determining whether a confrontation clause violation was harmless to a defendant,such as the importance of the testimony to the government case,the cumulative nature of the evidence,the existence of corroborating evidence,the extent of allowed in the case,and the strength of the government case as a whole.jimenez,at citing delaware van arsdall.we conclude that the confrontation clause violation was harmless because the statements were of limited importance to the government case and because the government case against moreno was,as a whole,very strong.
first,the statements at issue,heckman memoranda,played a small role in the government case.the prosecutor introduced the memoranda after defense counsel arakelian about his cooperation with the government.the memoranda merely summarized what arakelian had told heckman in a series of interviews before arakelian entered into a plea agreement with the government.the purpose of introducing the memoranda,then,was to rebut defense counsel attempt to undermine arakelian credibility.but defense counsel in this regard added nothing to what arakelian had already admitted at the beginning of direct examination that he had entered into a plea agreement with the government,that he was cooperating with the government in the moreno investigation,and that he was doing so in order to receive a more lenient sentence.app.the memoranda were,therefore,not important to the government case 
second,the government case as a whole was undeniably strong.that would remain true even if we were to discount the entirety of arakelian testimony.the easy realty solutions scheme was not connected to the pittsburgh home loans scheme that was run by arakelian.moreno involvement in that scheme was proved by other witnesses,such as bernhard flugher,who performed closings on behalf of easy realty solutions,and deean haggerty,who was a mortgage officer associated with the scheme.the government also presented substantial evidence that moreno participated personally profited real estate deals,some of which did not even involve arakelian.furthermore,the government introduced testimony about moreno involvement with arakelian from other witnesses.for example,joel reck,moreno business partner at platinum appraisal services,testified that moreno regularly provided fraudulent appraisals,that moreno signed reck name to hundreds of appraisals without his knowledge that these appraisals dramatically overvalued properties and that moreno said he would deny his own participation in creating the appraisals to which he had signed reck name.app.
the record reveals a strong government case that was not affected at all by the admission of heckman statements the guilty verdict here was surely unattributable to the unnecessary rehabilitation provided by the memoranda thus,despite our conclusion that a confrontation clause violation occurred,we will affirm the verdict because the government has demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilty verdict here was not affected by the admission of statements from heckman memoranda.
moreno also contends that the admission of heckman statements was a violation of the rule against hearsay.a preserved evidentiary error is harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the judgment.united states brown,cir quoting united states cunningham,cir.thus,the government needs to meet a slightly less onerous standard if it is highly probable that the hearsay violation did not contribute to the verdict,then we should affirm.
having already concluded that the confrontation clause violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,we need not reach the hearsay issue.even if we concluded that the district court admission of the testimony was a hearsay violation,it would necessarily be harmless.
we turn now to moreno contention that the district court erred in applying a sentencing enhancement for or more victims.because moreno failed to object that the district court had incorrectly applied the guidelines,we review for plain error.wood,at.we exercise plenary review over the district court interpretation of the guidelines.united states smith,cir.the burden of proof for facts at sentencing is preponderance of the evidence.united states grier,cir.on appeal,we review factual findings relevant to the guidelines for clear error.id.at.a finding is clearly erroneous when,although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing body on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
the sentencing guidelines provide that if the offense involved or more victims,a enhancement should be applied.u.b b amended.a victim under is any person who sustained actual loss.smith,at quoting cmt.actual loss,in turn,is defined as the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.id.quoting cmt.a i.pecuniary harm is monetary harm or harm that is otherwise measureable in money.id.the bar is not high.for example,in the bank fraud context,monetary harm can include even the expenditure of time and money to regain misappropriated funds and replace compromised bank accounts.id.at.the reason for this is that an account holder who must spend time and resources to dispute fraudulent activity,recoup stolen funds,and repair his or her credit and financial security has suffered a monetizable loss that is a reasonably foreseeable and direct consequence of the defendant theft or fraud.id.
the district court noted that evidence had been introduced at trial that moreno was responsible for over fraudulent appraisals and that the presentence report indicated that the number was closer to fraudulent appraisals.app.this alone would be sufficient to establish that more than victims were affected by moreno crimes because buyers paid for appraisals that were fraudulent.there is also the financial impact on buyers who were induced by moreno appraisals to purchase properties for prices above their market values.as the district court explained,moreno criminal conduct involved the procurement of fraudulent loans which totaled in excess of million and caused losses between million and million to lenders and the unsophisticated buyers who were duped into purchasing properties well in excess of their true fair market values app.
on this record,the district court conclusion that more than victims were affected by moreno crimes was not clearly erroneous.we will therefore affirm its application of the sentencing enhancement pursuant to b b.
finally,we turn to the issue of allocution.before imposing sentence,a district court must address the defendant personally in order to permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.i a.moreno contends that this right was violated when,immediately following the allocution,the prosecutor engaged in a vigorous and lengthy of him.moreno concedes that the issue was not preserved and is therefore subject to plain error review.
