on november,presented his change of plea to the district court for its acceptance.at this time a,cecilio ceballos,also sought acceptance of his own guilty plea for his involvement in the same conspiracy.ceballos was represented by attorney fernandez,who had been appointed by the court to represent him.fernandez was the same attorney who signed plea agreement for rivera,his appointed attorney.when appeared before the district judge for his change of plea hearing,fernandez rose to represent him.fernandez explained to the court that rivera,his law partner,was too ill to attend the hearing and had asked fernandez to stand in for purposes of the change of plea only.the court immediately advised and fernandez of the existence of a potential conflict of interest and offered to appoint another attorney,see infra,for more details of the colloquy.the court recessed to provide with an opportunity to discuss the situation with fernandez.after a brief discussion,advised the court that he would continue with the change of plea with fernandez as his counsel.at the conclusion of the hearing his change of plea was accepted by the court.
