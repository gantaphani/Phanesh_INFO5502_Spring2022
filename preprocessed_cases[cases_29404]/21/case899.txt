anthony robinson pled guilty to a charge under the violence against women act,for the interstate violation of a protective order.the district court concluded that the federal sentencing guidelines recommended application of the maximum sentence authorized by the statute,a term of years,and sentenced robinson accordingly.robinson now contests the court application of a sentencing enhancement for prior threatening and abusive behavior and challenges the court failure to reduce his sentence for acceptance of responsibility.finding that the sentence imposed was reasonable,we reject robinson challenges.
background 
until,anthony robinson lived in the state of washington.in,he began a short prison term for assaulting his wife,rebecca.upon his release in,a protective order issued by the state court in washington came into effect.the order barred robinson from having any contact with his wife.
in the summer of,robinson fled washington and headed for maine with his wife and two children in tow.in june,a man identifying himself as rebecca father called the county sheriff office in hancock county,maine,to inform that office that he had reason to believe that robinson and his wife had settled in the county after leaving the state of washington.soon afterwards,the washington department of human services contacted its maine counterpart to ask it to locate the robinsons children and investigate their.the maine agency in turn supplied the sheriff department with information that enabled the investigating detective from that office to locate the robinson family.robinson and his wife were found living together at a campground and working at a local cannery.robinson was arrested and charged with violating the federal statute that prohibits the interstate violation of a protective order.
robinson pled guilty to the charge without a plea agreement.the court explained to robinson that it was not bound by the government sentencing recommendations and that if it departed from those recommendations,robinson would not be entitled to revoke his guilty plea.robinson acknowledged that he understood these conditions,and the court accepted the guilty plea.the probation office prepared and submitted to the parties a proposed presentence investigation report that concluded that the applicable guidelines sentencing range was to months.after robinson objected to some portions of the report,the probation office submitted to the court a final,revised report that recommended a sentence of between and months.
the court,sentencing robinson in april,after the supreme court decided united states booker,d,appropriately understood the guidelines to be merely advisory but nevertheless an important consideration in sentencing,and applied the guidelines to robinson case to determine an appropriate sentence.having done so,the court found the applicable range to be substantially higher than the range suggested by the final presentence report.
the guidelines,the court noted,supply a base offense level of for violations of.see ussg.robinson requested that the court reduce his sentence under ussg because he had accepted responsibility for his conduct,but the court determined that he did not merit such a reduction.the court applied a enhancement to the offense level under ussg b d because the crime involved a pattern of activity involving the same victim.
in his sentencing order,the district judge noted that the burden of demonstrating eligibility for acceptance of responsibility lies with the defendant,and that robinson had not carried his burden.although he pled guilty to the offense,which went some way towards demonstrating contrition,the judge was unconvinced.the judge found that three facts strongly suggested that robinson had not fully accepted responsibility for his crime.first,robinson attempted to justify his flight from washington,which he explained was motivated in part by his desire to put some distance between the robinson family and rebecca father,who was constantly trying to get robinson locked up.second,robinson tried to excuse his conduct he told the court that he been advised by an attorney that the order had no effect outside of the state of washington,and so had believed that by moving to maine he could evade the restrictions the protective order had imposed.third,and most important,robinson persisted in making illegal contact with rebecca while he was incarcerated pending sentencing,robinson had written a number of letters to his wife.some of these letters were gentle,some threatening,but all were written in violation of the protective order,which prohibited communication between robinson and his wife.this ongoing contact with his wife,the judge found,demonstrated that robinson had not accepted that his continued contact with rebecca had been wrongful.
the court next considered the applicability of ussg b d,which provides for a enhancement of a defendant offense level where the criminal activity under involves a pattern of activity involving stalking,threatening,harassing,or assaulting the same victim.the judge noted three past incidents in which it was demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that robinson had harassed,threatened,or assaulted rebecca.these included an attempt by robinson to choke his wife on april,in lakewood,washington,which resulted in an assault conviction a second incident of abuse in pierce county,washington,on march,which resulted in a second assault conviction and the series of letters to rebecca that robinson had written while incarcerated and awaiting sentencing on the instant charge,which were prohibited by the protective order and in some of which robinson threatened rebecca with harm.these incidents,the district court concluded,constituted a pattern of activity that merited a enhancement under b d.
the court determined that robinson merited a criminal history level of v,a determination that is not challenged here.with the enhancement to his base offense level in place,robinson offense level was.the criminal history level and offense level taken together yielded a recommended sentence of to months.the maximum sentence robinson could receive under was months,and the court therefore imposed the full maximum sentence.robinson timely appealed his sentence.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,robinson challenges the district court decisions to deny him an reduction and to impose the enhancement.we discuss each issue in turn.
enhancement for pattern of activity 
standard of review 
robinson was sentenced in april,after the supreme court decided united states booker,d.in booker,the supreme court excised the portions of the that purported to make the united states sentencing guidelines binding upon the district courts during sentencing.after booker,the guidelines are merely advisory,which means that a district court has considerable leeway to impose a sentence that falls outside of the range suggested by the guidelines.
in booker,the court also severed and excised e,the portion of the federal sentencing act that once provided the standard under which courts of appeals would review sentences.see booker.at.to fill the vacuum thus created,the court named the new standard courts of appeals would review sentences for reasonableness.id.
before proceeding to evaluate robinson claims,we must determine what reasonableness review means when we are faced with a challenge to a sentencing court legal interpretation of a guidelines provision.in the past,our general rule has been to review interpretations of the legal meaning of the guidelines de novo.see united states disanto,cir.we conclude that booker new reasonableness standard leaves our review of such questions unchanged.
despite booker excision of certain portions of the statute,the sentencing act still imposes certain requirements on a sentencing court.it prescribes a set of factors,set forth at a,that a sentencing court must take into account in imposing a sentence.in booker,the supreme court recognized that those factors would guide appellate review for reasonableness.see booker.at section a remains in effect,and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing.those factors in turn will guide appellate cou
