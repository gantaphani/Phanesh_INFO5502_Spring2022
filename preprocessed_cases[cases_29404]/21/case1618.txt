the question presented by this appeal is whether stanley burrell criminal judgment became final after the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,thus entitling him to the retroactive application to his sentence of the new constitutional rule announced in booker.to answer this question,we must first determine how the finality of burrell criminal judgment was affected by our ruling on his previous appeal in which we affirmed his conviction and sentence on one count but remanded the case to the district court to correct the judgment to reflect dismissal of another count for which he was also convicted and sentenced.this determination turns on whether our remand was strictly ministerial in that it required a routine,nondiscretionary act by the district court that could not have been appealed on any valid ground,or whether our mandate left the district court the authority on remand to entertain the new arguments burrell advanced.for the reasons that follow,we hold that our remand for the entry of an amended judgment was strictly ministerial and that burrell conviction therefore became final for purposes of direct review either when the supreme court denied his untimely petition for a writ of certiorari or when the time for filing such a petition expired.in either case,burrell conviction was final before the district court acted on remand and before the supreme court decided booker.burrell may therefore advance the claim that he should be resentenced under advisory sentencing guidelines pursuant to united states crosby,cir,only on collateral review via a motion pursuant to.
background 
as we described in our previous opinion and summary order in this case,following a jury trial in february,burrell was convicted of conspiring to distribute crack cocaine and heroin and being the organizer of a continuing criminal enterprise cce.united states burrell,cir united states burrell.cir.in april,the district court entered judgment against burrell,sentencing him principally to two concurrent life sentences on the conspiracy and cce convictions.the district court found burrell total offense level on the two counts of conviction to be with a category of six,which the court noted required it to impose a sentence of life imprisonment on each count.the record reveals that,at the time burrell was sentenced,the sentencing guidelines required the district court to impose a sentence of life imprisonment for the cce conviction alone regardless of burrell conspiracy conviction given his adjusted offense level of on the cce count.
on appeal,we affirmed burrell conviction on the cce charge but vacated his conviction for conspiracy because it was a lesser included offense of the cce conviction.burrell.at citing rutledge united states,d.we also rejected burrell challenge to his sentence on the cce count under apprendi new jersey,d,because,e ven in the absence of a jury finding on narcotics quantity,the court properly could have sentenced stanley burrell to life imprisonment on the cce count.burrell,at.we thus affirmed burrell conviction and sentence on the cce count,id.at,and remanded in order that the district court may correct the judgment to reflect the dismissal of only the conspiracy conviction,burrell.at.after denying burrell petition for rehearing en banc by order dated august,we issued a mandate on september,directing the district court to correct its judgment.burrell thereafter filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the united states supreme court on january,which was denied on march,burrell united states,d.
on remand approximately two years later,by order dated march,the district court directed the clerk of the court to file an amended judgment reflecting our dismissal of the conspiracy claim.in a letter dated april,certified as delivered to prison officials on april,and filed with the district court on april,burrell argued that the district court march order should be corrected in the light of booker.on april,the district court clerk office,acting on the march order,entered an amended judgment stating that burrell conspiracy charge was dismissed pursuant to our mandate.the district court subsequently summarily denied burrell request to correct the judgment in the light of booker.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
burrell challenges the district court amended judgment,which embodies a sentence imposed by the district court under sentencing guidelines that were mandatory at the time of his sentencing in april,as violating his sixth amendment rights under booker.burrell contends that his judgment of conviction was not final at the time booker was decided and that booker rule therefore applies in his case because under the supreme court ruling in griffith kentucky,d,a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases,state or federal,whose judgments are not yet final,id.at.
this case requires us to determine whether a criminal judgment is final when we have affirmed a defendant conviction and sentence on at least one count,but remanded for the district court to dismiss the defendant conviction and sentence on another count.in order to resolve this question,we must consider the interplay between the law governing the finality of criminal judgments and the mandate rule,a branch of the doctrine.both questions.a criminal judgment is final and whether our mandate foreclosed the district court from exercising issues of law over which we have plenary review.see united states camacho,cir stating that whether a criminal judgment is final for purposes of federal rule of criminal procedure is a question of law subject to de novo review.because we conclude that our mandate required only a ministerial act,burrell conviction was final,at the latest,when the supreme court denied his untimely petition for a writ of certiorari on march,before the district court acted on remand and before the supreme court decided booker.burrell may therefore advance his booker claim,if at all,in a motion pursuant to.
the supreme court has made clear that a judgment of conviction includes both the adjudication of guilt and the sentence.deal united states,d teague lane,d as we have often stated,a criminal judgment necessarily includes the sentence imposed upon the defendant.berman united states.final judgment in a criminal case means sentence.the sentence is the judgment.a criminal judgment becomes final for purposes of appellate review,therefore,after the district court sentences the defendant and disassociates itself from the case.camacho,at quoting clay united states,d.moreover,when a defendant is convicted at one trial on multiple counts of an indictment,the district court enters a single judgment of conviction.see.k.
of course,f inality is variously defined,and its precise meaning depends on context.clay,at.in camacho,we discussed finality for purposes of federal rule of criminal procedure,which formerly provided that a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence was timely as long as it was filed before or within two years after final judgment.amended.we held that a conviction is final for these purposes following the affirmance on appeal of the adjudication of guilt,notwithstanding a remand for resentencing,because a defendant ability to bring newly discovered evidence to light in a new trial in no way hinges on the fate of the sentence imposed on his or her original conviction.at.with respect to motions to vacate under,which may be filed within one year from the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final,we noted that it makes sense,from an efficiency standpoint,to require criminal defendants to file such motions only after both their convictions and sentences have withstood appellate scrutiny.id.we subsequently noted that a judgment of conviction becomes final for purposes of when the supreme court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari,or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.moshier united states,cir quoting clay,at.we have not yet considered,however,when a criminal judgment becomes final for purposes of retroactivity of a new constitutional rule when we affirm one count of conviction and its sentence but remand for the district court to enter an amended judgment reflecting the dismissal of another count of conviction.
we find it noteworthy that the supreme court,in assessing its jurisdiction to review final state court judgments pursuant to,has not found all remands to lower state courts to undermine a judgment finality.instead,the court has traditionally considered whether a remand left more than a ministerial act to be done.where a remand is only for a ministerial purpose,such as the correction of language in the trial court judgment for the defendants,the judgment of the state court is final for purposes of.abood detroit bd.of,d republic natural gas oklahoma.i f nothing more than a ministerial act remains to be done,such as the entry of a judgment upon a mandate,the decree is regarded as concluding the case and is immediately reviewable.see also bateman arizona,d rehnquist,in chambers concluding that the decision in the case was not final in denying a motion for bail pending certiorari because the state highest court did not remand simply for the performance of a ministerial,the reinstating of a judgment of conviction and for the initial imposition of a sentence.a ministerial duty is one that involves obedience to instructions or laws instead of discretion,judgment,or skill.black law dictionary ed work united states ex rel.rives.mandamus issues to compel an officer to perform a purely ministerial duty.it can not be used to compel or control a duty in the discharge of which by law he is given discretion.
we followed this logic in morgan united states,cir.in morgan,we determined that we had jurisdiction under because the district court decision had concluded the litigation and remanded the case to the magistrate judge on purely ministerial matters.id.at.we held that jurisdiction under existed because when what remains to be done is merely routine,that routine decision will not spark an appeal.id.our ruling in morgan on the finality requirement of accords with the supreme court analysis of the finality requirement of.
we see no reason why the principle underlying these a ministerial remand does not delay a judgment finality because the lower court entry of a corrected judgment could not give rise to a valid not apply in determining when a criminal conviction is final for purposes of retroactivity of a new constitutional rule.we must,therefore,determine whether our remand in this case was strictly ministerial and left nothing for the district court to do but enter an amended judgment in accordance with the dictate of our mandate,or whether our mandate left the district court some discretion to act on remand.
ii.the mandate rule 
the mandate rule is a branch of the doctrine.this rule holds that where issues have been explicitly or implicitly decided on appeal,the district court is obliged,on remand,to follow the decision of the appellate court.united states minicone,cir united states ben zvi,cir the mandate rule compels compliance on remand with the dictates of the superior court and forecloses relitigation of issues expressly or impliedly decided by the appellate court.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,the trial court is barred from reconsidering or modifying any of its prior decisions that have been ruled on by the court of appeals.of course,there is a corollary to this an issue was not part of the appellate decision,a trial court may consider the matter.minicone,at internal citation and quotation marks omitted.put differently,w hen an appellate court has once decided an issue,the trial court,at a later stage in the litigation,is under a duty to follow the appellate court ruling on that issue.united states cirami,cir.to determine whether an issue remains open for reconsideration on remand,the trial court should look to both the specific dictates of the remand order as well as the broader spirit of the mandate.ben zvi,at.
we have recently explained the mandate rule application in the sentencing context,noting that t he nature of the issues for resolution in the district court on a remand from the court of appeals depends principally on the issues that had been presented in the appeal and the directions given by the court of appeals in ordering further proceedings.united states barresi,cir.we have stated that a resentencing usually should be de novo when a court of appeals reverses one or more convictions and remands for resentencing or otherwise effectively undoes the entire knot of calculation under the sentencing guidelines.united states quintieri,cir.on the other hand,absent explicit language in the mandate to the contrary,resentencing should be limited when the court of appeals upholds the underlying convictions but determines that a sentence has been erroneously imposed and remands to correct that error.id.this rule that the district court authority on remand is limited to those issues left open by the mandate is a firm one and rigidly binds the district court see id.at.
iii.analysis 
our mandate in this case directed the district court to undertake a single act.it is significant that although we remanded for resentencing of brian burrell,appellant brother and,because the district court finding of drug quantity increased the maximum sentence that could be imposed for brian burrell conspiracy conviction in violation of apprendi,we explicitly affirmed appellant conviction and sentence on the cce count and remanded his case solely so that the district court could correct the judgment to reflect the dismissal of only the conspiracy conviction.burrell.at.although our opinion did not state why we did not remand for resentencing in the light of our vacating of burrell conspiracy conviction,the record reflects that we affirmed burrell sentence because the guidelines mandated a sentence of life imprisonment on burrell cce conviction alone.this is one of the rare cases,therefore,where our reversal of a conviction did not affect the knot of calculations under the guidelines and where remand for resentencing was unnecessary.see quintieri,at.
in affirming burrell cce conviction and sentence,our mandate foreclosed the district court from modifying either of them on remand.burrell could have undone his conviction or sentence only by a timely petition for a writ of certiorari or some other appropriate procedural vehicle.under both the specific dictate and the spirit of our mandate,no issues,including sentencing issues,remained open for reconsideration on remand.this was not a mandate that permitted the district court to undertake any action other than the ministerial correction explicitly set forth.our directions to the district court unambiguously permitted nothing more than the entry of an amended judgment reflecting the dismissal of burrell conspiracy conviction.relitigation of any issue in the district court would therefore have been beyond the scope of the district court authority under our mandate.our remand directing the dismissal of the conspiracy count was therefore strictly ministerial 
having concluded that our remand was ministerial and thus incapable of disturbing burrell conviction once it became final,we must next determine whether appellant conviction became final before booker was decided.as we have discussed,a remand for ministerial purposes,such as the correction of language in a judgment or the entry of a judgment in accordance with a mandate,does not delay a judgment finality.we hold that because we affirmed burrell adjudication of guilt and sentence on the cce count and our remand was strictly ministerial,his conviction became final for purposes of retroactive application,on remand from direct appeal,of new constitutional rules either when the supreme court denied his petition for a writ of certiorari or when his time for filing a certiorari petition expired.see clay,at.we need not and do not decide here at what point a conviction becomes final when the supreme court denies an untimely petition for a writ of certiorari.assuming that burrell conviction became final on the latest possible the supreme court denied hi
