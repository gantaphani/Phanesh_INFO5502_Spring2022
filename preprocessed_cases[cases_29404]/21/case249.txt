we grant the petition for panel rehearing,withdraw our previous opinion in this matter,see cir,and substitute the opinion that follows.
the district judge twice conducted plea colloquies and thrice imposed sentences for carlos sevilla oyola sevilla,each one shorter than the last.still dissatisfied,sevilla asks us for another bite at the sentencing apple before a different district judge.to support his claim before this court,sevilla says the judge lacked authority for actions taken after entry of the first sentence,and flaws in the initial plea colloquy warrant vacation of the first judgment.alternatively,he says that even if the judge later actions were authorized,they were plagued by additional errors.
standing alone,these imperfections are not enough to justify setting aside the first sentence.but given the peculiar circumstances of this case particularly the developments at and after oral argument we ultimately do vacate and remand to the same judge for resentencing.our reasoning follows.first,some background.
background 
on july,sevilla and codefendants were indicted as part of a vast drug ring operating in and around several public housing projects in bayamón,puerto rico.the indictment charged sevilla with conspiring to possess narcotics with intent to distribute,in violation of a,count one,and aiding and abetting his coconspirators in the use and carriage of firearms in relation to a crime,in violation of c a count two.it singled out sevilla as a leader,manager,and enforcer for the organization.
a.the first guilty plea 
on august,sevilla entered into an agreement with the government,pleading guilty to both counts of the indictment.the parties stipulated that sevilla was accountable for conspiring to possess at least but less than kilograms of cocaine.this amount pegged sevilla base offense level at under the sentencing guidelines the guidelines.see.the parties further agreed that sevilla would be subject to a twolevel increase,see id.a a twolevel leadership enhancement,see id.c and a reduction,see id,resulting in a total offense level of.the parties did not come together on sevilla category,but they agreed to forgo seeking further adjustments or departures.
in the agreement,sevilla acknowledged that the district judge retained his sentencing discretion and was not bound by the parties accord.sevilla also waived his right to appeal if the judge accept ed the agreement and sentence d him according to its terms,conditions,and recommendations.
at the hearing that same day,the district judge advised sevilla of the statutory penalties for the charged offenses based on the stipulated drug quantity a mandatory minimum term of five years and a maximum term of eighty years of imprisonment as to count one,see b ii,and a consecutive minimum term of five years of imprisonment as to count two,see c a i 
the judge failed to inform sevilla that count two carried the possibility of a life sentence.see united states ortiz garcia,cir explaining that the maximum penalty for an offense under c a is life imprisonment and is derived from case law however,he did draw sevilla attention to the penalties mentioned in the plea agreement,which correctly stated that the maximum penalty for count two was life imprisonment,and sevilla said he understood.the judge also neglected to tell sevilla that he did not qualify for probation,a suspended sentence,or parole 
pitufo enters the scene 
the probation office filed sevilla investigation report on november.it applied a leadership enhancement,rather than the two levels agreed upon by the parties,bumping sevilla total offense level up to.based on sevilla five prior convictions including two violent felonies it also labeled sevilla a career offender and set his category at vi 
shortly thereafter,sevilla filed objections to the presentence report as well as a memorandum disputing the augmented leadership enhancement and his designation as a career offender.the probation office followed up with an addendum standing by its recommendations.
then,on january,the probation office dropped a bombshell on the proceedings.in a second addendum to the presentence report,the office alleged for the first time that sevilla had murdered josé manuel torres morales,pitufo or,in english,smurf,in front of the federal courthouse in hato rey,puerto rico,on november.pitufo was a fellow member who was then under federal supervision.the brazen murder of a federal supervisee outside the courthouse rocked the puerto rican legal community to its core.
no one has ever been charged with this notorious murder.the probation office learned of sevilla alleged involvement from a cooperating witness,carlos manuel burgos rodriguez burgos,also a fellow member,who claimed that sevilla admitted to killing pitufo after reading the allegations in the second addendum,the district judge ordered the government to produce burgos at sevilla sentencing hearing.sevilla did not object to this order,did not argue the judge could not consider the pitufo information,and did not ask for a continuation of the hearing.
c.the first sentencing hearing 
sevilla first sentencing hearing took place on january.burgos took the stand to testify about sevilla alleged role in the pitufo murder.he was questioned by the government and by defense counsel.notably,defense counsel did not argue that burgos testimony was impermissible and instead objected only on the basis that she needed more time to prepare.the district judge denied the objection because the second addendum to the report,filed twelve days prior,provided sufficient notice,and because counsel had not sought a continuance before the hearing.sevilla subsequently testified on his own behalf,disclaiming any involvement in the pitufo murder and challenging the trustworthiness of burgos testimony.
at the hearing conclusion,the judge made several findings.first,considering sevilla serious criminal past especially his prior violent felony convictions,the judge confirmed sevilla designation as a career offender who belonged in category vi then,considering burgos testimony about sevilla alleged role in the pitufo murder,as well as sevilla testimony denying any involvement,the judge found that the and labels underrated the seriousness of sevilla criminal past accordingly,the judge departed upward to offense level,which is accompanied by a guidelines sentence range of months to life.given the depraved nature and devastating impact of sevilla offenses,the judge determined that the highest available sentence was appropriate.consequently,he sentenced sevilla to life imprisonment.
the following day,the judge issued an order apportioning sevilla sentence into months on count one and life imprisonment on count two,to run consecutively judgment entered against sevilla on january.
subsequent proceedings 
a few days later,on february,sevilla moved to set aside the judgment and to correct,reduce,and reconsider his sentence,citing federal rule of criminal procedure a rule a sevilla said the district judge had erred at the sentencing hearing by considering the pitufo murder where that crime had not been included in the indictment,and according to sevilla,defense counsel had not been given adequate time to prepare to refute the allegations before the hearing.
soon after filing,sevilla lawyer fell ill and had to undergo emergency surgery.as a result,the district judge could not hold a hearing on sevilla motion before rule a strict deadline expired.
however,on february,one day before the buzzer sounded,the district judge sua sponte issued an order purporting to correct sevilla sentence under rule a on different grounds.the order sought to rectify two alleged sentencing mistakes.first,the judge said he had intended to sentence sevilla to months on count one,followed by life imprisonment on count two,but he had erroneously entered only months on count one.second,the judge pointed out that the sentence imposed on count two was defective under federal rule of criminal procedure rule because he had not informed sevilla during the plea colloquy that count two carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.to correct these errors,the judge upped sevilla sentence to months on count one and reduced it to months on count two,to run consecutively for a total of months years.amended judgment entered on february.
in the same order,the judge scheduled a hearing a few days later to consider sevilla unresolved rule a motion from february.that hearing was subsequently postponed to february at defense counsel request.
on february,the day of the hearing,sevilla filed a second motion requesting recusal of the district judge due to bias and personal knowledge a santobello hearing to determine whether the government had breached the plea agreement and vacation of the february judgment because rule errors at the hearing could not be corrected in a rule a order.the motion also highlighted a litany of supposed rule violations in the plea colloquy beyond the judge admitted failure to advise sevilla of count two maximum penalty chief among them was that the judge had neglected to inform sevilla that parole had been abolished from the federal penal system.sevilla maintained that these additional alleged errors could only be corrected by an appeal and remand,or by allowing sevilla to withdraw his plea,and not by the district judge issuing an order under rule a 
at the hearing that day,the district judge considered both sevilla february and february motions afterwards,the judge issued another order under rule a this time purporting to set aside both the original guilty plea and the february amended sentence to remedy his failure at the colloquy to inform sevilla about the maximum penalty on count two and the impossibility of parole the judge noted,however,that the plea agreement still stood,and said he would schedule a new hearing after he issued a separate written ruling denying sevilla recusal and santobello requests.
later that day,sevilla filed a notice of appeal from both the amended judgment of february and the february order intended to set aside that judgment.
on february,while that appeal was pending,the district judge issued the promised written order denying sevilla recusal and santobello requests.the judge then scheduled a supplemental plea colloquy and resentencing hearing for march.he further announced he would not consider the pitufo murder at the resentencing hearing,as sevilla had requested in his february motion.to explain his decision,the judge cited such factors as the timing and seriousness of the accusation,the fact that sevilla had never been charged with that crime,and the judge own concerns for justice,fairness,and due process.
on march,sevilla moved to vacate the judge order scheduling the supplemental plea colloquy and resentencing hearing,arguing that the judge had no authority to conduct the colloquy or to further modify his sentence because rule a was not an appropriate vehicle for correcting rule errors.
thereafter,on march,we issued an order deferring our consideration of sevilla appeal until after the newly scheduled plea and resentencing proceedings,so that any subsequent appeal could be consolidated with the pending appeal.
on march,the district judge denied sevilla motion to vacate his order scheduling the supplemental plea and resentencing hearings then,on march,over sevilla objection that a full colloquy was required,the district judge conducted a truncated supplemental plea colloquy to ensure sevilla understood that the maximum possible penalty for count two,specifically,was life imprisonment,and that he was ineligible for parole,probation,or a suspended sentence.although defense counsel requested an entirely new colloquy,the judge did not conduct one because he thought there was no point in repeating what had already been said.instead,the judge advised sevilla of the information missing from the initial colloquy and asked if sevilla wanted to abide by the plea agreement.sevilla said yes 
four days later,on march,the judge held sevilla resentencing hearing.even without considering the pitufo murder,given sevilla extensive criminal history,the judge again applied the guideline and varied upward.the judge sentenced sevilla to months on count one and months on count two,to run consecutively for a total of months years and months.judgment entered on march.
on march,sevilla filed an amended notice of appeal,challenging all three judgments january,february,and march the february order purporting to vacate the february judgment and the february order denying his recusal and santobello requests.
discussion 
sevilla raises a panoply of issues on appeal.he claims that the district judge lacked authority to issue the february amended judgment,as well as authority to take all subsequent actions both the initial and supplemental plea proceedings were defective the final sentence was unreasonable and the judge erred in rejecting his recusal and santobello requests.the government counters that the appeal waiver in the plea agreement bars this challenge.but we bypass this issue because sevilla claims,if successful,could invalidate both the plea itself and the waiver of his right to appeal and so we forge ahead with the merits of sevilla appeal.
a.the district judge authority 
sevilla first argues that rule a did not empower the district judge to issue the february judgment,which modified the original january judgment by boosting sevilla sentence from months to months on count one and cutting his sentence from life imprisonment to months on count two.consequently,sevilla says,the february judgment and all of the judge subsequent actions was null and void.
on appeal,the government concedes that rule a did not authorize the district judge actions on february.no matter,the government says the judge derived his power to take subsequent action from,a habeas corpus provision but before we tackle the government fallback habeas position,we explain why we agree that rule a did not empower the judge to act on february.
we review issues of law,including the district judge interpretation of a federal rule of criminal procedure,de novo.united states leja,cir citing united states encarnacion,cir.
rule a empowers a district judge to correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical,technical,or other clear error within fourteen days after sentencing.a.the function of rule a is narrowly circumscribed it permit s correction of an illegal sentence.hill united states.for rule a purposes,a sentence is illegal if t he punishment meted out was in excess of that prescribed by relevant statutes,multiple terms were imposed for the same offense,or the terms of the sentence itself were legally or constitutionally invalid in any respect.id.rule a does not,on the other hand,enable a judge to fix errors committed at trial or during proceedings prior to the imposition of sentence.id.as such,rule a does not provide a means to revisit possible errors in the plea colloquy.see united states vinyard,cir finding rule a was not an appropriate vehicle for addressing possible rule b h violation in plea colloquy.
when vacating the january sentence and imposing an amended sentence on february,the district judge invoked rule a to correct two purported errors the judge selfprofessed mistaken entry of a sentence of months,rather than months,on count one and the judge failure to inform sevilla during the plea colloquy that count two carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.because neither of these alleged infirmities resulted in an illegal sentence,rule a by its terms does not provide a cure for either.
first,the month sentence that the judge says he entered mistakenly on count one was not illegal in the sights of rule a.it was not in excess of statutory limits.see b ii,setting the maximum penalty at eighty years,or months.it did not impose multiple terms for the same offense.see hill,at.and no one has argued it was otherwise legally or constitutionally invalid.see id.
second,the rule defect diagnosed by the judge in the plea colloquy namely,the judge failure to tell sevilla that count two was punishable by life imprisonment occurred before sentencing and,thus,is not a sentencing error.it is therefore decidedly outside the bounds of the type of glitch that rule a is designed to mend.see vinyard,at.
accordingly,like the parties,we conclude that the district judge could not rely on rule a for authority to issue the february judgment aiming to remedy mistakes he spotted in the january judgment.
the question,then,is whether gave the judge power to act on or after february 
before us,the government argues for the first time that sevilla february motion requesting recusal,a santobello hearing,and vacation of the february judgment for lack of authority,as well as alleging a string of rule errors in the plea colloquy authorized the judge actions on or after february because the motion functioned as a collateral attack on sevilla conviction and sentence under.sevilla did not caption the motion under any particular rule or statute,but simply dubbed it an omnibus motion regarding sentencing.and the district judge clearly viewed it as another rule a motion nonetheless,because a motion character depends upon its substance,not its appellation,united states ortiz,cir,the government says we can and should treat the february motion as a challenge based on its content,even though it does not wear a label.
we begin with a brief primer.section appears in the chapter devoted to habeas corpus and gives a federal prisoner a means to collaterally attack his sentence.a.specifically,it permits a prisoner to move the court that imposed his sentence to vacate,set aside,or correct the sentence because the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states,the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence,the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law,or the sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack.id.
notwithstanding this broad language,a motion alleging a violation of federal law is generally cognizable only if it involves a fundamental defect that inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice,or an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.hill,at see also united states vonn,quoting united states timmreck.by this standard,relief is not available to remedy a failure to comply with the formal requirements of a rule of criminal procedure,absent any evidence of prejudice or other injury to the defendant.see davis united states,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in particular,a defendant will rarely,if ever,be able to obtain relief for rule violations under,united states borrero acevedo,cir quoting united states dominguez benitez,because such errors seldom result in the type of complete miscarriage of justice or proceeding inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure that deserves redress under the statute,see timmreck,at finding the court failure to inform defendant of special parole term,in violation of rule,was not a fundamental defect.
moreover,a defendant usually gets only one complete round of collateral review under.melton united states,cir see munoz united states,f d,cir per curiam.second or successive motions are severely limited and require certification by the appropriate court of appeals.h see castro united states,munoz,at.accordingly,though we may choose to recharacterize a motion styled otherwise as falling under based on its content,trenkler united states,cir compiling cases,we must be mindful that doing so may deprive a defendant of his chance to bring a second,possibly stronger claim under that statute,see castro,at,id.at scalia,concurring 
against this backdrop,we choose not to recast sevilla february motion in a mold.no one sevilla,not the government,and certainly not the district the motion under.before us,only the government says we should view the motion under.this was sevilla motion,not the government,and the important concerns outlined above counsel against our recharacterizing the motion under that statute.
accordingly,we find that the february motion which we view as decided only pursuant to rule a did not provide the judge with authority for his post february actions by way of,and the january order remained the final order of the court we therefore need not reach sevilla arguments that the supplemental plea colloquy was defective the final sentence imposed was unreasonable and the district court erred in not granting sevilla february recusal and santobello requests.rather,we now turn to sevilla direct appeal of the january judgment.
b.the initial guilty plea 
most curiously,before us,sevilla seems to have forgotten what brought him here in the first place.at the february hearing,when the district judge asked sevilla what he wanted to do about alleged rule defects in the initial plea colloquy,sevilla insisted he wanted to address those defects on appeal rather than reopen the plea proceedings.however,he says little in his brief about the impact of rule errors in the initial colloquy on the first judgment,and instead focuses his attacks on purported errors at the supplemental plea level.
arguments raised in only a perfunctory and undeveloped manner are deemed waived on appeal.rodríguez municipality of san juan,cir united states zannino,cir.sevilla entire argument about the effect of rule errors in the first colloquy on the first judgment is as follows 
pursuant to this court opinion in united states ortiz garcia,cir,the district court failure to inform sevilla at the change of plea hearing that the maximum sentence for count two was life imprisonment instead of the years mentioned mandates setting aside the final judgment entered on january,where a life sentence was imposed on count two the change of plea transcript does not inform him of a maximum time of life imprisonment and it is by no means clear he would have pleaded guilty under those circumstances.the case should be remanded for resentencing before a different district court judge.emphasis added.
though sevilla has identified an error and a possible argument that he might not have pleaded guilty but for the error he has done so only in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work,create the ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.zannino,at.this we will not do.id.as a result,sevilla rule claims are not merely forfeited and subject to plain error review as they would be because sevilla did not object on rule grounds during the initial colloquy or move to withdraw his plea in the district court see united states anderson,cir united states ortiz garcia,cir reviewing underlying rule claim for plain error because defendant failed to object to the error or move to withdraw his plea in the district court igartúa united states,cir a rguments that are not raised in a timely manner are forfeited,and p lain error review may be available for forfeited arguments.rather,because sevilla did not adequately challenge these errors on appeal,his rule claims are waived entirely.see anderson,at igartúa,at explaining that plain error review is seldom available for claims neither raised below nor on appeal.
though we may,on rare occasion,exercise our discretion to address waived arguments for instance,when they become available only as a result of intervening changes in law we see no reason to do so here.see anderson,at igartúa,at review is unavailable for waived arguments unless the court engages in the rare exercise of its power to excuse waiver.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.furthermore,even if we did exercise our discretion to hear sevilla rule claims,they would not survive the high hurdle of plain error review.see anderson,at citing united states padilla,cir en banc thus,we turn to sevilla first sentence.
first sentence 
having found that the district judge lacked authority to do what he did after issuing the original january judgment with the result being that the initial plea remained intact we originally remanded with instructions to reinstate the first sentence,a life sentence as we stressed,this was not an unfair result because we had believed counsel had on our instructions certified that sevilla understood this outcome was a risk of pursuing his appeal.at oral argument,we had explicitly asked sevilla counsel if sevilla understood that this appeal could subject him to an increased sentence.and after counsel submitted an unresponsive motion that did not address whether sevilla understood the risks,we entered a written order again instructing counsel to inquire whether sevilla wished to pursue the appeal even though in this matter presented the risk to sevilla of receiving a sentence greater than his current sentence of months and up to life imprisonment,particularly if the district court were to consider either sevilla alleged involvement in the pitufo murder or calculate a base sentencing level and make appropriate upward departures.emphasis in original.counsel filed a second motion confirming that sevilla wanted to proceed despite the risk.
writing in support of sevilla petition for panel and en banc review,counsel now says he did not appreciate that sevilla faced the risk that the initial punishment of life imprisonment would be reinstated by this court,and the case remanded.and because he misunderstood our request,counsel only warned sevilla that remand might result in a higher sentence,not that the initial sentence might be reinstated by us.given this development,we modify the panel opinion,simply vacate the sentence imposed do not ourselves reinstate any sentence,and remand for resentencing by the same judge 
conclusion 
with our work finished,we vacate all judgments and orders of the district court and remand to the same judge for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
carlos sevilla oyola sevilla was sentenced by the district court to months in prison.on appeal,he brings numerous errors to our court attention.the majority,finding several of these claims meritorious,initially granted a most unusual form of relief life in prison.upon panel rehearing,the majority recognized this irrational result and now withdraws its opinion,leaving in its place a revised opinion which vacates sevilla sentence and remands to the same judge for resentencing.outside of this revised result,however,the court analysis on the merits of sevilla appeal remain unchanged.while i commend the majority for correcting its initial error and vacating sevilla sentence,i strongly disagree with its reasoning in reaching this result.moreover,i disagree with the decision to remand the case to the same judge.sevilla should be resentenced by a different judge,one that does not have any preformed opinions about this case.
i.the comedy of sentencing errors 
this tale of judicial woe begins at sevilla plea colloquy on august.there,the sentencing judge informed sevilla,correctly,that he faced a statutory maximum of eighty years for count of his indictment,conspiracy to possess narcotics with intent to distribute,pursuant to a.the judge,however,failed to inform sevilla of the statutory maximum for count of his indictment.although a conviction for aiding and abetting in the use and carry of a firearm in relation to a crime,pursuant to c a,is punishable by a term of life in prison,the judge only informed sevilla that count carried a term of months mandatory.sevilla pleaded guilty to both counts.
sentencing proved a confusing process,replete with mistakes and misstatements on the part of the sentencing judge.it began on january,when the sentencing judge orally pronounced sevilla sentence.as recited,the sentence was as follows life imprisonment,and that will include of course the consecutive sentence that had to be imposed on the firearms,because it would be ridiculous to impose a life term plus five years.that does make any sense.
on january,the sentencing judge set this oral sentence down in writing.in apparent contrast to the prior day pronouncement,the written sentence imposed a term of months on count and life imprisonment on count.the judge explained that his oral pronunciation of the sentence had been a misstatement,requiring correction by way of apportionment 
on february,sevilla filed a motion seeking a correction,reduction,or modification of his sentence.before that motion was considered,however,the sentencing judge independently undertook to correct additional errors in sevilla sentence.on february,the judge issued a written order.therein,he stated that although he had intended to enter an order apportioning the sentence to years on count months,he had mistakenly entered a sentence of months in the same order,the judge acknowledged that count of the written sentence,subjecting sevilla to life in prison,also suffer ed from a defect when the judge conducted sevilla plea colloquy he failed to mention that this count could carry a maximum term of life in prison.undertaking to correct both of these mistakes,the judge entered a new sentence.this time,sevilla was sentenced to months imprisonment on count and months imprisonment on count.the judge purported to act under federal rule of criminal procedure a.
on february,sevilla filed another motion,specifically noting the defective rule plea colloquy and seeking to withdraw his plea.a hearing on this motion was held the same day.at this hearing,sevilla stated that he could seek to appeal the sentence rather than undergo additional corrections at the level.the sentencing judge admitted that sevilla could utilize appellate review,but attempted to dissuade him from doing so 
counsel h e could proceed to file a notice of appeal today,and that would be his right to proceed.
the court he could,and you are going to get with that to where we are now,a remand for a a remand to strike the plea and setting the matter again in the normal course of events.
counsel all right.in light 
the court for new plea negotiations or for whatever,trial,as the case may be.
eventually,the sentencing judge extended sevilla right to appeal by thirty days.sevilla agreed with this course of action,but stated that he intended to file a protective notice of appeal,so as to preserve his claims in case the court of appeals later determined the judge was,indeed,without power to resentence.with both sevilla and the government in agreement that the plea colloquy was defective,the judge then issued an order set ting aside the sentence imposed,as well as the plea colloquy that resulted in the defendant entry of a plea of guilty.
on february,the sentencing judge published an order that,among other things set forth a schedule for a supplemental plea colloquy.sevilla filed another motion,asserting that the sentencing judge had no power to conduct a supplemental plea colloquy or enter additional modifications to his sentence,as federal rule of criminal procedure a was not an appropriate vehicle through which to correct rule errors.
on march,the sentencing judge responded,stating that the opinion and order of february,should have made clear that rule a and rule were not the exclusive reasons for setting aside the sentence,as defendant contends.the judge claimed to have acted,as well,under a grant of authority established in a supreme court case from.see united states benz.
on march,the judge conducted a supplemental plea colloquy.sevilla objected,claiming that the initial deficiencies in his plea could only be corrected by conducting a completely new colloquy,not by simply undertaking to supplement the first.the district court disagreed,finding no point in repeating what had been said seven months before,in august.finally,on march,the judge sentenced sevilla again.this time,he imposed a term of months on count and sixty months on count.sevilla filed another notice of appeal,bringing his claims before our court.
ii.the rule error and its impact 
sorting through this procedural mess,the majority concludes,and i agree,that the court had no power under rule a to impose either the second or the third sentence that,however,is where our agreement in the analysis ends.reasoning that sevilla did not properly challenge the rule plea colloquy error either before the district court or on appeal,the majority continues to conclude that sevilla first sentence is justifiable,despite ultimately vacating the sentence on different grounds.taking this analysis to its logical end,therefore,the majority appears to suggest that,had the miscommunication at oral argument before us not occurred,it would have struck down a prison term of slightly under years and put in its place a term of life plus months.in other words,the majority revised opinion,which now reverses course,vacates sevilla sentence,and remands for resentencing,has nothing to do with the legality of sevilla first sentence although i agree sevilla sentence must be vacated and that he is entitled to be resentenced,with due respect,i find the majority analysis rejecting sevilla substantive claims regarding the validity of his first sentence to be supported by neither law nor reason.
appellate waiver 
the majority states that sevilla says little in his brief about the impact of rule errors in the initial colloquy.i disagree.sevilla brief quite plainly makes this argument 
pursuant to this court opinion in united states ortiz garcía,cir,the district court failure to inform sevilla oyola at the change of plea hearing that the maximum sentence for count two was life imprisonment instead of the years mentioned mandates setting aside the final judgment entered on,where a life sentence was imposed in count two the change of plea transcript does not inform him of a maximum time of life imprisonment and it is by no means clear he would have plead ed guilty under those circumstances.the case should be remanded for resentencing.emphasis added 
this in the argument section of sevilla brief is also foreshadowed in his presentation of the facts.therein,sevilla states that the sentencing judge failed to advise sevilla that he faced a potential life sentence as to count two,informing him only that you have a consecutive term of imprisonment of i think it five years on account of firearms.
it is true,of course,that arguments raised only in a perfunctory and undeveloped manner are deemed waived on appeal.united states zannino,cir.sevilla argument,however clearly falls outside the scope of our waiver doctrine.compare united states salimonu,cir deeming waived a claim made without argument or citation to case law,with united states dunbar,cir finding that,even where a claim was not stated artfully it was not waived where the appellate brief identified relevant facts and cited relevant case law,and holmes spencer,cir holding waiver inappropriate where an appellant brief reveals enough of the raw materials underlying a claim so as to allow the court to have no trouble reading his argument.
sevilla has identified a specific error.see.b t he court must inform the defendant of,and determine that the defendant understands any maximum possible penalty,including imprisonment,fine,and term of supervised release.he has provided case law.see ortiz garcía,at.he has assessed the identified error under the appropriate doctrinal test.see united states raineri,cir considering whether rule error influenced the defendant decision to plead guilty.in sum,his though it may in no way grounds for waiver.united states sepúlveda contreras,cir this is not a situation where we are forced to piece together the defendant argument for him,and we therefore find no waiver.internal citation omitted.
in fact,the majority admits that sevilla identified an error and a possible argument.nonetheless,omitting mention of the fact that this argument was also undergirded by specific reference to case law,it goes on to baldly assert that sevilla claim was pleaded in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work.see zannino,at.given that sevilla has identified a factual error,highlighted governing precedent,and applied that law to the facts at hand,however,i fail to see what work has been left undone.in light of the content of sevilla brief,the assertion that his claim has been waived is simply unsupported.united states watson,cir waiving an argument presented only as an oblique suggestion,absent any reference to applicable case law or a governing standard dimarco zappa cabanillas,cir simply noting an argument in passing without explanation is insufficient to avoid waiver.
if our standard for escaping waiver required that arguments be pled with the highest degree of craftsmanship,or that they be situated in the most persuasive and logical order,i might well find myself in agreement with the majority.for good reason,however,that is not our rule.as it stands,we require only that an argument be raised,and raised squarely.see,dunbar,at sepúlveda contreras,at.this is a requirement that sevilla has more than met.
the flawed nature of the majority holding is made even more apparent when considered in context.after all,what reasonable defendant would expend any more than a succinct portion of his or her brief arguing against a sentence which had already been vacated by the sentencing judge,and for which the government was not advocating see united states ayala vázquez,cir holding that a perfunctory statement was sufficient to avoid waiver where it served to put the court on notice of clearly applicable argument.that sevilla had the foresight even to include this argument in his brief,perhaps to ward off just such an overly formalistic and strained reading as the majority now adopts,is in itself impressive.still,the majority demands that he should have expended more of his appellate efforts tilting at windmills.i can not agree that this claim was waived by sevilla on appeal.
indeed,if any waiver occurred,it was the government which waived the argument that sevilla first sentence should be reinstated.it was not until the government opposition to sevilla motion for rehearing that this position was first argued.
plain error review 
the majority continues on to say that,even if sevilla rule claim were not waived,it would still fall under plainerror review,because sevilla did not object on rule grounds during the initial colloquy or move to withdraw his plea in the district court.
it is true that sevilla did not object at his plea colloquy however,sevilla february,motion explicitly put forth this error as grounds for withdrawing his plea.in fact,elsewhere in its opinion,when discussing sevilla motion,the majority acknowledges this fact.recognizing that a motion to withdraw was filed,the majority instead rests its forfeiture finding on the subsequent motion hearing,in which sevilla stated that he did not want to reopen the hearing.a thorough review of that hearing transcript,however,shows that sevilla preferred course was significantly less clear than the majority purports 
counsel h e does not want to reopen the hearing and stands by all his arguments in the pleading filed today.
the court he does want to reopen the hearing 
counsel only because of all the arguments we presented,that we understand that the rule can not be cured by your honor rule a motion.
the court a rule 
counsel that would be a forfeiture 
read in context,sevilla statement was specifically intended to preserve on appeal the claim that the sentencing judge was acting beyond his power a claim the majority has since deemed meritorious.at the same time,however,sevilla purported to stand by all of his arguments,including the request to withdraw his plea.
certainly,this portion of the record invites confusion.the apparently contradictory statements,however,do not require that our court completely ignore the fact that sevilla clearly and expressly moved to withdraw his plea.united states isom,cir considering on the merits a defendant claim that he should have been able to withdraw his plea,notwithstanding the fact that the defendant vacillated between requesting the right to withdraw and stating an intent to stand by that plea.moreover,when presented with sevilla motion,the sentencing judge who repeatedly proclaimed that he retained jurisdiction over the considered and agreed with sevilla argument.that the district court attempted to effectuate the withdrawal of sevilla plea in a manner beyond its power is most certainly an error the court own but it is not an error that,in my view,negates the fact that sevilla clearly raised this claim,and it was squarely considered.in fact,i can think of no better evidence that the rule claim was raised than that which is present here the sentencing judge awarded the relief sought.he withdrew the plea.
at the risk of piling on,i note that even if this court blinded itself to the clear record evidence that sevilla claim was raised and considered,review would be wholly inappropriate.forfeiture of claims,after all,is not intended to be a technicality or a trap for the indolent.ass of soc.workers harwood,cir.to the contrary,the doctrine is intended to protect key values of judicial economy and fairness,and our court has warned not to prize consistency in its application over reason and equity.see also united states la guardia,cir when all is said and done,rules of practice and procedure are devised to promote the ends of justice,not to defeat them.alteration and citation omitted.
our precedent acknowledges that c ontext is important,united states gallant,cir,and that there are situations where it simply would be unfair and unwise as a matter of policy to hold that the defendant forfeited the argument,id.at.this case,in which the sentence was vacated by the district court and no party argues for its imposition on appeal,is clearly one such situation.after all,this is a far cry from a case where our court has been deprived of useful factfinding,harwood,at,or of the district judge insights into the point,sandstrom chemlawn,cir.rather,the record on the issue is fully developed,and the sentencing judge view on the nature and effect of the error is more than clear.similarly,the government was clearly put on notice of this claim and had every opportunity to respond.harwood,at the absence of unfairness has a definite bearing on a decision to overlook this type of procedural default.at the february,motion hearing,the sentencing judge specifically asked the government if it agreed that allowing sevilla to withdraw his plea was necessary,and the government answered affirmatively.the government appellate brief also never suggests either that sevilla sentence is still intact,or that it should be.
moreover,in imposing the sentence orally,the judge did not sentence sevilla to life in prison on count.at the sentencing judge rather strained explanation judge imposed a general sentence,without apportionment between the counts.this robbed sevilla of a significant opportunity to uncover and object to the rule error prior to the final imposition of his sentence.see united states domínguez benítez,applying review to a claim of rule error where no objection was made a t the sentencing hearing united states mateo,app x,cir o ur review is for plain error,unless the defendant was not afforded a sufficient opportunity to present to the district court the argument which forms the basis of this appeal.citations omitted united states cortésclaudio,cir a objection is not necessarily required to preserve the issue for appeal if the defendant could not reasonably have anticipated the issue would arise until after the court ruled.see also united states delgado hernández,cir applying review where the defendant had ample opportunity to object prior to the sentence imposition quoting united states negrón narváez,cir.there is simply no sense of fairness or equity in allowing one error by the sentencing judge to shield another error from our review even had sevilla claim not been clearly raised and treated,the facts here provide precisely the sort of context that counsels against the overly rigid application of review.see gallant,at.
before the district court,sevilla sought to withdraw his plea,the government did not object,and the sentencing judge awarded the relief sought.the plea was withdrawn and the sentence vacated.to now hold that sevilla never brought this claim to the court attention is quite a bait and switch.review is simply inappropriate in this circumstance.
remand to the district court 
there is little question that this rule error was not harmless,such that the sentence can not stand,see.h a variance from the requirements of this rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights,and as expected in a case where the government agrees that the sentence should not be imposed the government makes no attempt to prove otherwise.see united states olano,stating that the burden of proving that an error was harmless is on the government.moreover it is the sentencing judge who is best positioned to assess what,if any,impact the rule error had on sevilla understanding of his plea.see,united states cotal crespo,cir noting that rule requires a sentencing judge to ascertain that the defendant plea is voluntary and intelligent internal quotation marks omitted.on february,the sentencing judge made clear that,i have to set aside the plea,because the plea is invalid.and if the plea is invalid,the sentence is invalid.he went on to state that he was correcting for clear error emanating from the defective plea colloquy,and that,in this case,the consequences of an imperfect colloquy and the potential sentence are of real significance to the defendant.thus,the harmfulness of this error is clear,and nothing gleaned from the appellate record shows otherwise.remand is necessary for this reason alone,and not because of any procedural misunderstanding between sevilla counsel and this court at oral argument 
iii.resentencing before the same district judge 
i also strongly disagree with the majority decision to remand the case back to the same district judge for resentencing.we have previously held that i t is difficult for a judge,having once made up his mind,to resentence a defendant.mawson united states,cir emphasis added.i believe this to be especially true under these circumstances where,following the court initial sentence of life imprisonment on january,the district judge altered sevilla sentence three separate times to months imprisonment on count and life imprisonment on count on january to months imprisonment on count and months imprisonment on count on february and finally to months imprisonment on count and months imprisonment on count on march.given the vast disparity between these sentences,as well as the litany of errors in the sentencing process as detailed above,i question whether remand will actually result in a fair resentencing or whether it will just be an exercise in futility.cirilo muñoz united states,cir torruella,concurring.thus,both for the judge sake,and the appearance of justice,mawson,at,we should follow our longstanding policy,united states curran,cir,and require that sevilla be resentenced before a different judge.see also united states.craven,cir remanding for resentencing before a different judge united states vélez carrero,cir same united states mercedes amparo,cir noting the normal practice of remand ing for resentencing before a different judge united states canada,cir same.
iv.parting words 
sevilla sentencing was fraught with mistakes,misstatements,and omissions on the part of the sentencing judge.the unique posture of this case,arising from a sentencing process replete with errors of the district court own making,and concerning an error that no party seeks to defend,is well fit for a simple resolution remand for a correction of the rule error and imposition of a new sentence.let us not forget that the district court judge himself determined the initial sentence to be erroneous and improper,and no party had sought to defend it on appeal until the court invited such briefing following sevilla motion for rehearing.
instead of acknowledging the errors of the district court,the majority continues to support the rationale behind its original opinions sua sponte imposition of the first sentence,and it only ultimately agrees to vacate sevilla sentence after being faced with motions for rehearing and a,postargument misunderstanding by counsel over a single question posed by the court.nevertheless,i agree with the majority decision to vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing,notwithstanding my emphatic urging that this take place before a different judge.
after setting out the mandatory minimum and statutory maximum penalties on count one,the judge somewhat unclearly told sevilla he also had a consecutive term of imprisonment of i think it five years on account of the firearms.then,when explaining the guidelines range that applied to sevilla under the plea agreement,the judge stated the range for count one,plus months mandatory on count two.
this court did not explicitly recognize that c a had a maximum penalty of life imprisonment until we decided ortiz garcia in december several months after sevilla august plea colloquy.at.however,we explained there that when ortiz garcia pleaded guilty in june the district judge in his case should and did already know the maximum penalty under the statute he simply forgot to state it at the hearing.id.at.it appears the same thing happened here,where,as the judge later candidly admitted,he mistakenly missed stating the maximum penalty while taking sevilla plea.
federal rule of criminal procedure rule requires a district judge to address a defendant in open court before accepting a guilty plea in order to ensure the defendant understands the consequences of his plea.b.among other things,as part of this colloquy,the judge must inform the defendant of any maximum possible penalty before accepting the plea.b h.the rule does not require the judge to tell the defendant about eligibility for probation,a suspended sentence,or parole.see.b.
sevilla committed the two most violent offenses roughly one month apart in.first,on may,sevilla and others fired shots at a car carrying three individuals.sevilla was arrested and charged with attempted murder,among other things.then,on july,while out on state bond,sevilla again fired shots at a vehicle.this time the car belonged to the state witness protection program.inside were two police officers and four civilians,including an infant.only one person was hurt.sevilla was charged with six more counts of attempted murder and several weapons offenses.he pleaded guilty to both sets of charges on may,and was subsequently sentenced to twelve years for the first shooting and eight years for the second shooting,to run concurrently.
burgos first mentioned sevilla involvement in the pitufo murder briefly during his testimony before a grand jury.sevilla suspects the government played some part in notifying the probation officer of this testimony,which led the officer to interview burgos and to amend sevilla investigation report with the pitufo murder information.but it is unclear from the record how the probation officer in fact learned of burgos statements.
the judge stressed that sevilla past convictions were not for mickey mouse or heartland crimes,but rather were a string of amazing convictions which include crimes of violence like s hooting at vehicles and t rying to kill witnesses in a witness protection program while released on bail from the other major case of attempted murder.
throughout the hearing,the district judge who had been chief judge of the federal courthouse when pitufo was killed expressed his outrage and dismay at the havoc the murder had wreaked on the court system.for example,he said the murder stopped the operation of this court.the murder not only stopped the operation of this court for almost a whole day,it was a disaster what happened here.the fbi had to take control of the building.we did know where this was coming from.can you imagine,allowing somebody to use the perimeter of this court to kill supervisees imagine getting involved to the point that you basically interfering with the legitimate governmental function of administering justice.can you imagine that they killed him right in front of the courthouse.right in front of the courthouse it was a horrible thing.
at the january hearing,the judge had said i am sentencing the defendant to life imprisonment,and that will include of course the consecutive sentence that had to be imposed on the firearms,because it would be ridiculous to impose a life term plus five years.that does make any torruella,in his opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part,says this strongly suggests that sevilla was sentenced to life imprisonment on count,above the year statutory maximum,and a term on count.but on january,the judge offered an alternative explanation on january,he had intended to look at the two counts together and,after making the corresponding departures,sentence the d efendant to life imprisonment.then,realizing that he should have apportioned the sentence between the counts,see united states zavala marti,cir explaining that the proper procedure is to render a separate sentence on each count internal quotation marks and citation omitted,on january he divided the total life sentence imposed on january among counts one and two.sevilla has not challenged the judge authority to apportion the sentence and treats the january and january sentences as one sentence.
rule a permits a district judge to correct a sentence within fourteen days after sentencing if it resulted from arithmetical,technical,or other clear error.a.more on this later.
for those not in the know,santobello new york,stands for the proposition that prosecutors must abide by their plea agreements.
specifically,sevilla claimed the judge had violated rule when he failed to inquire as to whether sevilla had the plea agreement translated to him word for word ask whether defense counsel had translated the plea agreement for sevilla ask whether sevilla was aware that he had the right to summon witnesses living beyond the jurisdiction of puerto rico pursuant to rule ask whether sevilla was aware that he had the right to assist his attorney to select a jury of his peers and to execute peremptory challenges and challenges for cause ask whether sevilla was aware that parole had been abolished in the federal system ask whether sevilla fully understood the parameters of the waiver of appeal provision ask whether defense counsel had explained the application of the guidelines to sevilla case ask whether defense counsel had reviewed discovery with sevilla and whether he had received discovery of the evidence ask whether sevilla had been told that he had a right to be appointed counsel under the criminal justice act if he could not continue to afford to pay a private attorney,if he elected to go to trial.
in the motion,sevilla asked for an opportunity to withdraw his plea,but said he would do so only if the judge first made specific protective findings of fact and conclusions of law,that,among other things,would require the government to offer him the same plea agreement after withdrawal and would give him time to investigate the pitufo murder allegations before resentencing.but at the hearing that followed,sevilla counsel informed the judge that sevilla did not want to reopen the hearing,and instead wanted to file an appeal,as he did later that day.
as a reminder,unlike the february motion which criticized the judge attempt to invoke rule a,the february motion asked the judge to act under rule a.it claimed the judge had erred by considering the pitufo murder at sentencing and requested that the judge set aside the original january judgment and correct the original january sentence.
the judge knew that his failure to warn sevilla that parole was unavailable was not,by itself,a violation of rule.see johnson united states,cir.however,the very purpose of rule is to advise a defendant of the actual consequences of his plea so that he can realistically decide whether to plead guilty.united states rivera maldonado,cir quoting united states santo,cir.and,as the judge explained,his omission regarding parole could have undermined sevilla understanding of the consequences of his plea,even though rule did not expressly require the judge to discuss it.
in the march order,the judge explained that rule a and rule were not the exclusive reasons for setting aside the sentence.rather,the judge claimed for the first time to have acted also under a grant of authority to reconsider and reduce a sentence upon reflection.see united states benz.neither party has made a benz argument on appeal,and therefore we do not address it.
we pause to remind the reader that at the initial colloquy,the judge had drawn sevilla attention to the penalties mentioned in the plea agreement which correctly stated that the maximum penalty for count two was life imprisonment and sevilla told the judge that he understood.
ordinarily,a court will consider whether a waiver of appeal is enforceable before proceeding to the merits of the case.see,united states acosta roman,cir.this is because under ordinary circumstances,a knowing,voluntary waiver of the right to appeal from a sentence,contained in a plea agreement,ought to be enforced a bsent some convincing countervailing argument.united states teeter,cir footnote omitted.however,a court may opt to go directly to the merits of an appeal where a defendant who has entered a guilty plea and agreed to waive his right to appeal seeks to challenge an aspect of the plea which,if successful,would invalidate both the plea itself and the waiver of his right to appeal.see united states chambers,cir quoting united states santiago miranda,cir.
section enables a federal prisoner to move the court that imposed his sentence to vacate,set aside,or correct the sentence based on one of four grounds.we discuss this more fully below.
as a quick recap,the judge post february actions were on february,he issued an order intended to set aside the february amended sentence and the original plea due to rule errors on february,he issued an order denying sevilla recusal and santobello requests and scheduling a new hearing on march,he conducted a supplemental plea colloquy and on march,he resentenced sevilla.
the february order responding,in part,to the february motion,explicitly states sentence vacated under.a,correcting for clear error emanating from the defective plea colloquy.
this risk prompted the supreme court to limit the courts recharacterization powers with respect to pro se litigants who,presumably,are less aware of the consequences of recharacterization than those with counsel in the following way t he court can not recharacterize a pro se litigant motion as the litigant first motion unless the court informs the litigant of its intent to recharacterize,warns the litigant that the recharacterization will subject subsequent motions to the law second or successive restrictions,and provides the litigant with an opportunity to withdraw,or to amend,the,at,emphasis in original.
sevilla argued the district judge lost power to act in his case after he filed his first notice of appeal on february challenging both the february amended sentence and the february order purporting to vacate that sentence though it was not until march that he amended his appeal to include challenges to the original judgment and subsequent orders and judgments.as a general rule,with only limited exceptions,entry of a notice of appeal divests the district judge of jurisdiction to adjudicate any matters related to an appeal.united states martin,cir internal quotation marks and brackets omitted quoting united states distasio,cir.this rule applies with equal force to sentencing.distasio,at.thus,sevilla says,his notice of appeal suspended the judge power to modify his sentence,and all the judge later actions were null and void.sevilla does not explain how his february notice of appeal could have divested the judge of jurisdiction for the february order.but because we find the judge lacked authority pursuant to rule a for his post february actions anyway,we need not spin our wheels trying to pin down sevilla argument on this point.
judge torruella says sevilla had no reasonable opportunity to discover and raise the rule error during the initial sentencing hearing or prior to the sentence imposition because the life term on count two was not imposed in writing until january,the day after the sentencing hearing.however,this overlooks sevilla failure to object at the plea colloquy on august,when the error occurred or anytime thereafter before the sentence was imposed.though sevilla did eventually raise rule issues before the district court and move to withdraw his plea,it was not until his february,motion after sentence had been imposed and after the district judge had sua sponte recognized and attempted to correct the rule error though he lacked power to do so under rule.and when the judge asked sevilla at the hearing on that motion if indeed he wanted to reopen the hearing,sevilla counsel responded that while sevilla wanted to stand by all his arguments in the february motion,he did not want to reopen the hearing,and instead wanted to file an appeal,as he did later that day.accordingly,were sevilla rule claims not waived before us,they would at least be forfeited.
to demonstrate plain error,sevilla would need to show that a rule error occurred the error was plain the error affected the defendant substantial rights and the error seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.ortiz garcia,at brackets omitted quoting rivera maldonado,at.to satisfy the third prong,sevilla must demonstrate there is a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.id.at quoting dominguez benitez,at.assuming the judge plainly erred by failing to advise sevilla that count two carried the possibility of a life sentence,see.b h,sevilla nevertheless can not satisfy the third prong of the plain error test.to succeed,sevilla would have to demonstrate that,if the judge had informed him of count two maximum penalty,there is a reasonable probability he would not have pleaded guilty.but the plea agreement sevilla signed explicitly stated the correct maximum penalty,and he assured the judge during the colloquy that he understood the maximum penalties listed in that agreement.ortiz garcia,at,finding a reasonable probability that defendant would not have entered guilty plea but for rule error where plea agreement did not include maximum penalty and court did not mention maximum penalty at hearing.so sevilla can not meet the third prong,and the judge failure to warn sevilla of count two maximum penalty was not plain for the other alleged rule violation the judge failure to warn sevilla he was ineligible for parole rule does not require a judge to inform a defendant of his parole ineligibility.see johnson united states,cir.thus,this omission was not error plain or otherwise.
we held and still hold that the judge did not abuse his discretion by considering the pitufo murder information at sevilla first sentencing hearing because the judge is authorized by statute to consider this type of relevant evidence about sevilla background,character,conduct,history,and characteristics.see a.because sevilla failed to argue any other problem with the sentence,the sentence would ordinarily stand.
sevilla petition for panel and en banc review the petition,for easy reading,with the support of an amicus curiae,argues that our prior opinion clashed with greenlaw united states.given our result here,we need not and so do not decide whether sevilla and his amicus are correct.
contrary to what sevilla says in his petition,the judge has never confessed error or said that consideration of the pitufo murder was improper.and as we hold,the judge proper consideration of that murder does not,standing alone,demonstrate bias warranting the judge disqualification.so sevilla argument that the judge abused his discretion by refusing to disqualify himself,to the extent it relies on the judge consideration of this information,fails.see united states snyder,cir explaining that we apply an abuse of discretion standard when a trial judge refuses to recuse himself.because the judge also properly took into account the pitufo murder impact on the community during sentencing,see united states politano,cir explaining that the sentencing judge can consider the characteristics of the community in which a defendant conduct arose and the conduct impact on the community,the judge likewise did not abuse his discretion by refusing to disqualify himself on that all this we see no reason for us to direct that a different judge handle the remand.ordinarily,district judges are free to keep or to reassign remanded cases in accordance with local rules and practice.united states bryant,cir see also.declaring that c ases remanded for resentencing shall be assigned to the judge who imposed the vacated sentence,unless otherwise ordered by the court of appeals.ultimately we believe the original judge can sentence sevilla fairly if he opts to keep the case,and so we do not agree with judge torruella that a remand to the original judge would be an exercise in futilit
