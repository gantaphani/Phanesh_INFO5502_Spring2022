background 
the following facts are drawn from uncontradicted testimony during mcintosh jury trial on count one.on march,agents from the immigration and customs enforcement ice and the state department,including ryan boyd,ed carey,kevin barry,mark mancini,joseph quigley,robert fitzsimmons,reilly dundon,and ryan elliott,went to mcintosh brooklyn home to execute an arrest warrant for mcintosh.the agents were in plain clothes,but most were wearing badges on lanyards around their necks identifying them as federal officers.when mcintosh exited his building shortly before,the agents approached him,shouting police and gary.mcintosh then climbed into his volvo,which had darkly tinted windows and was parallel parked on his street,locking the doors behind him.the agents,seeking to arrest mcintosh,surrounded his car,pounding on its windows with their hands and loudly identifying themselves as law enforcement.the officers shouted police.open the door,and police,police,get your hands in the air.the officers attempted to open the car door,but mcintosh kept the doors locked,turned on the engine,and began to drive the car forward and backward,striking the vehicles parked in front of and behind his own.
ice agent fitzsimmons moved to the front of the vehicle where he displayed his badge through the windshield.mcintosh then removed his hands from the steering wheel and reached below.in reaction,agent fitzsimmons drew his pistol,pointed it at mcintosh,and yelled,get your h ands back on to the steering wheel where i c an see them.mcintosh returned his hands to the steering wheel,after which agent fitzsimmons returned his pistol to its holster.
all the while,the agents were yelling police,and police,federal agents,open the door.agent boyd then drew his weapon,identified himself as a police officer,and commanded mcintosh to stop the vehicle.because he could not see mcintosh hands through the tinted window,state department agent elliott shattered the window with his baton.while maintaining direct eye contact with mcintosh,agent elliott identified himself as a law enforcement officer and asked mcintosh to stop the car.subsequently,mcintosh began smashing as hard as he could into the government vehicle which was located in front of him and the vehicle behind him.the car wheels were screeching and the car was sliding.mcintosh drove with such force that he was able to push the government vehicle forward at least one or two feet.
ice agent quigley took out a sledgehammer that he had planned to use to enter mcintosh apartment for the search,and he struck the window.the sledgehammer made only a small hole in the window,and while agent quigley attempted to retrieve the sledgehammer from the window,mcintosh had enough time to maneuver his vehicle into a position from which he could exit the parking spot.agent boyd,with his weapon still drawn,was standing near the driver side headlight when mcintosh drove the vehicle directly at him.believing mcintosh was about to hit agent boyd,agent fitzsimmons pulled agent boyd out of the way and yelled,he coming out,let him go.mcintosh then drove away.agents effected mcintosh arrest later that evening after tracking his cellular phone to determine his whereabouts.
jury charge 
during the jury charge conference,the government asked the district court to remove language from the proposed jury instructions that would have required the jury unanimously to agree as to which means of commission set forth in a had been shown beyond a reasonable doubt,to require that the jurors unanimously agree regarding whether mcintosh had forcibly assaulted,resisted,opposed,impeded,intimidated,or interfered with agent boyd while he was engaging in or on account of the performance of official duties.the district court agreed to the modification,over defense counsel objection.
subsequently,the district court charged the jury,in pertinent part,as follows 
the first element the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that gary mcintosh forcibly assaulted,resisted,opposed,impeded,intimidated or interfered with agent ryan boyd.
it is not necessary for the government to prove the defendant committed each of these acts.rather,it is sufficient if the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did any one of these acts that is,forcibly assaulted,resisted,opposed,impeded,intimidated or interfered with agent ryan boyd.the word forcibly is the adjective that goes with each of these.you do not have to agree unanimously about which act the defendant did but you must unanimously agree that the defendant did at least one of those acts.
the district court then defined each of the means of commission set forth in section a.
after about two hours of deliberation,the jury acquitted mcintosh of using a deadly or dangerous weapon to forcibly assault,resist,oppose,impede,intimidate,or interfere with agent boyd,but found mcintosh guilty of the lesser included misdemeanor offense of committing one of those acts without using a deadly or dangerous weapon.
the district court ultimately sentenced mcintosh,as previously noted,to months imprisonment on counts one and three,and to months imprisonment on count two,all to run concurrently.mcintosh subsequently filed this timely appeal.on july,mcintosh completed his federal sentence on all three of his counts of conviction.
discussion 
jury instruction on count one 
section a provides,in relevant part 
whoever forcibly assaults,resists,opposes,impedes,intimidates,or interferes with any federal officer while engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties shall,where the acts in violation of this section constitute only simple assault,be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year,or both.
a.mcintosh principal claim on appeal is that the district court erred in declining to instruct the jury that it must unanimously agree as to the specific means by which he violated section a,as proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
to secure reversal based on a flawed jury instruction,a defendant must demonstrate both error and ensuing prejudice.united states quinones,cir.although we review de novo a claim of error in jury instructions,we will reverse only where the charge,viewed as a whole,either failed to inform the jury adequately of the law or misled the jury about the correct legal rule.united states.white,cir internal quotation marks omitted.section a makes it a crime to forcibly assault,resist,oppose,impede,intimidate,or interfere with a federal officer engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties.a.mcintosh contends that each of these acts is a separate crime and,consequently,that a jury must unanimously agree on a single act in
