this case concerns a defendant appeal of his convictions and sentence for participating in a complex,dollar investment fraud.finding no error,we affirm in all respects.
the appellant is evripides georgiadis,a greek national.on june,he was named in an indictment by a federal grand jury in massachusetts.
the indictment charged georgiadis and three others john condo,michael zanetti,and frank barecich with creating a fictional private equity fund,known variously as bbda global investment fund or dac global,and making false promises about that fund to defraud unwitting developers into making deposits totaling nearly million into bank accounts controlled by the defendants from february through august.the indictment set forth fourteen counts of wire fraud in violation of and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of.a superseding indictment,dated september,added a sixteenth count for conspiracy to commit money laundering 
the following may,croatian law enforcement authorities arrested georgiadis at a border crossing in croatia.in june of that year,the united states sought his extradition for trial on the charges set forth in the superseding indictment,and in december of that year croatia ministry of justice authorized his extradition.
prior to trial,georgiadis moved for dismissal of the conspiracy to commit money laundering count on the ground that his extradition did not authorize his trial on that count.the district court denied the motion.
over the course of march and april of,georgiadis three entered guilty pleas.georgiadis did not.his trial began on april.
at the close of the government case,three of the wire fraud counts were dismissed on the government motion.as a result,only thirteen total counts including the conspiracy to commit money laundering count went to the jury.
on may,the jury returned guilty verdicts on all thirteen counts.the district court then sentenced georgiadis to months of imprisonment.
georgiadis raises a number of challenges here some relate only to his conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering.others relate to each of his convictions.he also challenges his sentence.we consider his arguments in this order,and we reject each of them.
georgiadis makes two separate challenges to his conviction on count,which charged him with conspiracy to commit money laundering the first challenge concerns his extradition.the second challenge concerns venue.
georgiadis challenge implicates the principle of specialty,or,as it is also known,the doctrine of specialty.united states tse,cir united states saccoccia,cir.that doctrine generally requires that an extradited defendant be tried for the crimes on which extradition has been granted,and none other.saccoccia,at because the doctrine of specialty is concerned with comity rather than the rights of the defendant,it exists only to the extent that the surrendering country wishes.tse,at.for that reason,i n general,we do not believe that there can be a violation of the principle of specialty where the requesting nation prosecutes the returned fugitive for the exact crimes on which the surrendering nation granted extradition.saccoccia,at.
here,the decision of the croatian ministry of justice the decision clearly authorized georgiadis extradition on all counts charged in the indictment,including count.dkt,ex.indeed,the decision specifically states that georgiadis can be extradited based on the probable cause that he has committed one criminal act of conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of h.
nevertheless,georgiadis contends that croatia did not actually intend to extradite georgiadis on count.to support this surprising contention,he points to the statement in the decision that expressly purports to extradite georgiadis p ursuant to the provisions of a treaty between the united states and what was then servia treaty georgiadis argues that the decision nowhere states that conspiracy to commit money laundering is an offense covered by that treaty.and georgiadis further contends that the treaty does not,in fact,cover that offense.georgiadis also appears to argue that the decision misidentified count as a reference to a computer fraud crime.thus,georgiadis concludes,the decision is best read to authorize georgiadis extradition for only those crimes that are covered by the treaty or,a t best,to reflect confusion about the substance of count.
but georgiadis contention that croatia did not actually authorize his extradition for count is not one that croatia itself advances.nor is it one that can be reconciled with the plain language of the decision that croatia issued to authorize georgiadis extradition.the references in the translated decision to computer fraud seem clearly to track the wire fraud counts against georgiadis,and the justification section of the decision separately refers to money laundering on multiple occasions.thus,the decision does not reveal the confusion that georgiadis claims it reflects,and it simply can not be read to limit georgiadis extradition such that it does not cover count.
georgiadis does also appear to argue that even if croatia intended to extradite him on count,the treaty barred croatia from doing so because the treaty does not cover the crime of conspiracy to commit money laundering.he relies on united states rauscher,which states at one point that a defendant extradited pursuant to a treaty can only be tried for one of the offenses described in that treaty.id.at.
but we have previously made clear that rauscher applies to situations where an american court tries the fugitive for a crime other than the one for which extradition was granted.autry wiley,cir see rauscher,at explaining that an extradited defendant has a right to be tried only for the offense with which he is charged in the extradition proceedings,and for which he was delivered up.and,as we have explained,croatia made clear in its decision that it extradited georgiadis for trial on the conspiracy to commit money laundering count for which he was tried.
to the extent georgiadis argues that we may independently determine that croatia lacked the authority to effect the extradition that croatia plainly authorized in its decision p ursuant to the provisions of the treaty,we rejected an equivalent argument in autry.in doing so,we relied on the supreme court decision in ker illinois.we explained in autry that the court in ker held that,subject to limited exceptions not applicable here,neither the method by which an accused is brought before a criminal court,nor the legality of his forcible seizure or arrest nor his subsequent forcible and illegal transportation and confinement are material to the question of the jurisdiction of a criminal court before whom he is present.autry,at.thus,this aspect of georgiadis challenge also can not succeed.id.explaining that the defendant could not challenge his conviction on the ground that the treaty did not authorize canada extradition of him because i f he falls within the treaty scope,his apprehension and return were entirely proper.if he falls without the treaty scope,the ker rule makes his jurisdictional claim groundless.
we now turn to georgiadis other ground for challenging his conviction on count that he was denied his right under the constitution and the federal rules of criminal procedure to be tried in a venue wherein the crime was committed.const.amend.vi see const.art.iii,cl.in pressing this contention,georgiadis agrees,as he must,that if he or any of his took an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy to commit money laundering in massachusetts,then venue in the district of massachusetts was proper.blue br.see i a prosecution for an attempt or conspiracy offense under this section or section may be brought in any district where an act in furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place.whitfield united states,d explaining that i functions as a confirmation of the longstanding rule that venue is proper in any district in which an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was committed,even where an overt act is not a required element of the conspiracy offense.but georgiadis contends venue was not proper because there was no basis for finding that such an overt act was taken.we disagree.
where a venue determination has been made by a jury,as happened here,w e will uphold the verdict if a rational juror could have found proper venue by a preponderance of the evidence.united states josleyn,cir.in applying that standard,a ll credibility issues are to be resolved,and every reasonable inference drawn,in the light most favorable to the verdict.id.
we have specifically held that,because the central objective of a conspiracy to commit money laundering is to conceal or disguise,an action taken by a conspirator to facilitate the concealment aim of the money laundering transactions is an overt act in furtherance of such a conspiracy.united states upton,cir finding that failing to file a tax return was an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy to commit money laundering.and the supreme court,in the context of a case involving mail fraud,has identified one type of act that facilitates the concealment of a crime to be a lulling communication a communication designed to lull the victims into a false sense of security,postpone their ultimate complaint to the authorities,and therefore make the apprehension of the defendants less likely.united states lane,d see also united states rutigliano,cir holding that mailings made to prevent the discovery of mail fraud are an overt act in furtherance of a conspiracy to commit mail fraud united states perry,cir same.thus,if the evidence in this case supports a jury reasonable finding that georgiadis or any of his made a lulling communication with respect to the money laundering in or into massachusetts,then venue in the district of massachusetts was proper.see united states gonzalez,cir upholding venue in the target district because a conspirator conducted communications with someone located in the target district naranjo,cir upholding venue in the target district based on numerous phone calls made by a conspirator to a in that district united states cordero,cir finding it highly likely that calls placed by a in the target district to conspirators outside the target district supported venue in the target district but ultimately deciding the issue on waiver.
we conclude that the evidence does provide sufficient support for that conclusion.specifically,the jury could reasonably have found that a series of sent in by one of georgiadis michael zanetti to a company constituted lulling communications aimed at concealing the money laundering.the evidence showed the following regarding those communications.
in february,the broker valence financial group worked with dac global,a corporation that had been created by georgiadis and his,on a funding arrangement for one of valence clients.dac global agreed to provide that client,green investment group,with funding for a building project,and green deposited into a dac global account.months went by,and green received no funding from dac global.as a result,valence contacted zanetti,who was acting as a dac global representative,and attempted to recover the deposit.
the evidence further showed that zanetti then sent a series of to valence.initially,zanetti promised that the issues with the deposit were in the process of being overcome and that he would soon be able to provide a more detailed explanation for the delay.a green representative then sent an to zanetti,copying valence,that read we are completely out of patience with you and your promises of performance.if we do not hear from you and get satisfactory answers within hours,we will contact the department of justice and begin to pursue any and all means of redress available to us,against you and your enterprises.zanetti responded the next morning with an to both green and valence.that read from what i understand,you are going to be receiving a letter from the fund appointed reps detailing everything.before you ask i do know who they are,but i was told you would be contacted shortly.
the entire aim of the money laundering scheme was to conceal,and the jury specifically found that the scheme lasted until september.in light of that,the jury could reasonably have found that zanetti sent these specifically to delay the date valence or green went to the authorities,as green had stated they would do.thus,the jury could reasonably have found that these were designed to lull valence and green into a false sense of security,postpone their ultimate complaint to the authorities,and therefore make the apprehension of the defendants less likely.see lane,at.and because zanetti lulling communications were made to a company based in massachusetts,they suffice to support venue in the district of massachusetts for count 
we therefore reject georgiadis challenge to his conviction on count we now turn to his remaining challenges,which target his convictions generally.
georgiadis claims that the district court made four separate errors at trial that each independently requires us to vacate all of his convictions.we do not agree.
the first of these challenges relies on batson kentucky,d,which prohibits purposeful discrimination in the use of a peremptory challenge against a member of a protected class.id.at united states girouard,cir.georgiadis argues,as he did below,that the government engaged in impermissible purposeful discrimination by using one of its peremptory challenges to strike a juror named paunovic and he contends that she spoke with a noticeable accent,and was apparently.
the government argues that georgiadis batson claim fails because georgiadis did not establish that paunovic was a member of a protected class.girouard,at see gray brady,cir part of a defendant burden in making out a prima facie case of a batson violation is to show that the strike was used on a juror who is a member of a cognizable group that has been or is currently subjected to discriminatory treatment.internal quotation marks omitted.but there is a separate flaw with georgiadis batson claim georgiadis failed to show that the prosecutor struck paunovic because she was or because she spoke with an accent.
when georgiadis objected to the prosecutor use of a peremptory challenge on paunovic,the district court asked the prosecutor for his reason for striking her.after the prosecutor gave his reason,the district court gave georgiadis the opportunity to make further argument.a colloquy followed.the district court then ruled that the prosecutor had stated neutral reasons that have not been rebutted sufficiently by the defendant.we see no basis on this record for concluding that the district court clearly erred in so finding.see united states charlton,cir.
in the colloquy with the district court,the prosecutor made clear that he was not exercising a peremptory challenge because the juror was or because she spoke with an accent.he explained instead that he was concerned that the juror might be unduly sympathetic to georgiadis potential argument that some of his criminal activity resulted from georgiadis lack of understanding of english.he based that concern on the juror report,during individual voir dire,that her father once had trouble with law enforcement due to his own struggles with english.
the additional support that georgiadis offers for his batson claim is minimal.he contends that the prosecution struck the lone juror it was able to strike who appear ed to be from th e same part of the world as georgiadis.he emphasizes that the prosecution did not take its first opportunity to strike a different juror who reported having a bad experience with law enforcement.he also points out that paunovic expressly professed her ability to be impartial.such a showing is far too weak to demonstrate that the district court clearly erred in refusing to find that the juror was struck by reason of purposeful discrimination.see batson,at.
georgiadis second claim of trial error is that the district court improperly admitted the testimony of fbi special agent ian smythe,which testimony georgiadis contends was so harmful that his convictions must be set aside.we review a district court decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion.united states rodríguez berrios,cir.
smythe testimony was directed at comparing two sets of items paper printouts of associated with two google accounts that the government contended were owned and used by georgiadis and electronic versions of on a hard drive that was recovered from an office used by georgiadis and his.smythe testified that,based on his review,dozens of which he proceeded to list from the hard drive matched,were exactly like,or were the same as corresponding reflected by the google printouts.
the precise nature of georgiadis challenge to the admission of this testimony is far from clear the main thrust of georgiadis argument appears to be that the prosecutor bolster ed smythe testimony about the provenance of the printouts by eliciting certain testimony that gave smythe the credibility of an expert without having produced the proper expert report or expert discovery.georgiadis also appears to argue that it was unfair for smythe to be allowed to testify to his observations of a hard drive that was not itself produced as evidence.he compares that procedure to call ing a fingerprint examiner,but refus ing to produce one of the two prints being compared.and,finally,georgiadis stresses that smythe himself admitted on that the procedure to which he testified was forensically unsound.
we need not parse the exact contours of georgiadis argument in order to locate what he has not the specific federal rule of evidence that he contends was violated.and that is because any error the district court may have been committed in admitting smythe testimony was harmless 
there was substantial evidence of georgiadis guilt that did not depend on the conclusion that georgiadis actually sent and received any of the in question.the evidence at trial provided ample support for a jury to conclude that georgiadis met with developers and represented himself both as a partner of condo his and as the european representative of the fund that was supposedly going to provide financing for those developers.the evidence also provided support for a jury reasonably finding that georgiadis was one of three on more than one of the bank accounts that received deposits from developers.and the jury could reasonably infer that money from those accounts was later transferred directly to georgiadis personal accounts.
moreover,wholly apart from smythe testimony,there was a great deal of evidence tying georgiadis to the contained in the google printouts.the printouts included,among other things,personal sent to georgiadis girlfriend and an concerning the shipping of a car he owned.the latter included as an attachment a copy of georgiadis greek passport and a notarized statement signed by georgiadis.the government also introduced customer profiles for both of the disputed accounts,at least one of which listed the contact name for one account as evripides georgiadis.that same customer profile also listed an address in greece to which multiple wire transfers addressed to georgiadis were sent during the conspiracy.and that customer profile also listed two credit cards owned by evripides georgiadis as associated with the account as well as a third owned by dac global energies llc.finally,according to the evidence at trial,the customer profiles for both accounts each listed the same phone number,suggesting that they were owned by the same person.
thus,even if we were to assume that the district court erred in admitting smythe testimony,it is highly probable that the error did not affect the verdict,see united states delgado marrero,cir.we therefore reject georgiadis challenge to the admission of smythe testimony.
georgiadis third claim of trial error is that the district court erroneously denied his motion for a mistrial based on a concededly late disclosure by the prosecution of certain materials.blue br.our review is for abuse of discretion.united states freeman,cir.
the materials included certain communications from four of the prosecution gregory dicker,greg petrini,kenneth davlin,and gina champion cain to the prosecution coordinator,jessica pooler.the materials also included the prosecutor notes from his meeting with dicker.the communications arguably showed that the four witnesses all had a financial or personal stake in obtaining a conviction of georgiadis.and the prosecutor notes arguably conflicted with dicker trial testimony.
district of massachusetts local rule b requires prosecutors to disclose,among other things,a any information that tends to cast doubt on the credibility or accuracy of any witness that the government anticipates calling and b any inconsistent statement,or a description of such a statement,made orally or in writing by any witness whom the government anticipates calling at least days prior to trial.loc.b.nonetheless,the prosecution disclosed the relevant communications and the relevant portion of the prosecutor notes only after all four of the affected witnesses had testified.
in response,the district court afforded georgiadis the customary remedy for this type of violation the opportunity to the affected witnesses after he had had an opportunity to consider the materials.see united states mathur,cir.the district court also expressly stated that it would afford georgiadis the maximum amount of leeway in his with th e affected witnesses.finally,the district court indicated that it would give a cautionary instruction to the jury indicating that the affected witnesses were being because the government had inadvertently failed to disclose certain information and thus that the of witnesses could not be held against georgiadis 
given these corrective measures,it is hard to see how the district court abused its discretion.georgiadis does argue that he could have made more effective use of the materials if he had had access to them prior to the start of trial.he contends that the delay preceding the rendered them ineffective.he further contends that the government late disclosure of the impeachment materials which primarily related to the financial interest and potential bias prevented him from using those materials in his opening statement.
but,in reviewing a district court denial of a motion for a mistrial for an abuse of discretion,we must be mindful that the trial court has a superior point of vantage,and that it is only rarely and in extremely compelling circumstances that an appellate panel,informed by a cold record,will venture to reverse a trial judge decision.freeman,at internal quotation marks omitted.and the district court stated that the of those witnesses was more powerful,not less powerful because the government witnesses had to be specifically recalled.georgiadis also had the opportunity to highlight the financial interests and potential biases of the in his opening statement,and he actually did so in his original of those witnesses.
thus,georgiadis has not shown the kind of extremely compelling circumstances that would require reversal of the district court decision to deny the motion for a new trial.see united states tashjian,cir upholding a district court denial of a mistrial motion where the materials would have added little,if anything,to the effective already conducted and the defendants were given the opportunity to recall witnesses.the wealth of evidence against georgiadis,which we have already detailed,only bolsters our confidence in that conclusion.
georgiadis final claim of trial error,which he also raised below,is that the district court gave an erroneous instruction on reasonable doubt.we review preserved claims of instructional error under a standard we consider de novo whether an instruction embodied an error of law,but we review for abuse of discretion whether the instructions adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.united states symonevich,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
in charging the jury,the district court instructed if you view the evidence in the case as reasonably permitting either of two conclusions one that the defendant is guilty as charged,the other that the defendant is not guilty you will find the defendant not guilty.georgiadis argues that such an charge is improper
