this is an appeal by the united states from judgments,which were entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,convicting the defendants brian williams and samuel shuler on their pleas of guilty to conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute crack cocaine.the appeal challenges the sentences imposed on the defendants by judges mcmahon and brieant.judge mcmahon sentenced williams principally to a period of incarceration of months,and judge brieant sentenced shuler principally to a period of incarceration of months.while the range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines is now to months,at the time the sentence was imposed it was to months.the manner in which the significantly lower sentences were justified provides the basis for the appeal.
background 
brian williams and samuel shuler were engaged in the business of selling crack cocaine in the city of yonkers,new york.the two were arrested on september,after making a sale to one of their patrons who approached the vehicle from which they engaged in the transaction.shortly after they drove away from the scene,their car was stopped by two yonkers police department officers.shuler attempted to flee,but was apprehended and then searched.one of the officers recovered from shuler pants pocket two bags containing crack cocaine and a scale with cocaine residue on it.the officers then searched the car and recovered from the front seat a box of clear plastic sandwich bags,including one that contained crack cocaine.williams and shuler were then arrested.a subsequent search resulted in recovery of approximately in cash from williams and in cash from shuler,as well as clear plastic bags containing crack cocaine from each of williams shoes,and from the front area of williams pants.the substances contained in the two bags recovered from shuler pockets,the front seat of the car,and the bags recovered from williams shoes tested positive for crack cocaine and weighed grams in total.the residue found on the scale recovered from shuler pocket tested positive for cocaine.
after their arrest,williams and shuler were charged in yonkers city court with criminal possession of a controlled substance in excess of grams.nine days later,they were both charged in a federal complaint with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute grams or more of crack cocaine.this was ultimately the charge to which they both pled guilty and for which,after a number of adjustments that we pass over,the sentencing guidelines called for a sentence of to months.while they both pled guilty to the same offense,they were charged in separate informations,they pled guilty at different times,and the cases were assigned for sentencing to different judges in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.williams was sentenced by judge mcmahon,shuler by judge brieant.
we focus our discussion principally on the sentencing proceeding of williams,who was sentenced first,because the sentence imposed upon him provided the predicate for the sentence imposed on shuler.judge mcmahon declined to consider a sentence within the range prescribed in the sentencing guidelines because of her views,which were repeatedly expressed at the sentencing proceeding,that the sentence she imposed should be comparable to the sentence williams would have received had his case not been turned over to federal prosecutors.
the principal point of reference for determining the sentence williams would have received had the case been prosecuted in westchester county was not the sentencing scheme prescribed by the new york penal law.when the offense was committed,it was a class felony,penal law,punishable by a minimum sentence of not less than three years nor more than eight years four months,penal law a ii.section was amended shortly after the arrest of williams to increase the drug quantity associated with a class felony to ounces or grams.this change,in effect,reduced the offense with which williams had been charged to a class b felony punishable by a maximum sentence of years and a minimum sentence of not less than one year nor more than of the maximum term imposed,penal law b,b.this sentencing range reflected the judgment of the new york state legislature that a sentencing judge should be afforded a wide degree of discretion in fixing an appropriate sentence.indeed,the sentencing range prescribed by the sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine could have fit within the sentence prescribed for a class b felony.
because the penal law did not provide a sufficient basis for the argument that a downward departure was necessary to avoid a disparity between the sentencing guidelines and the new york sentencing scheme,williams relied on the plea bargaining policy of the westchester county district of the independently elected district attorneys in new york who are vested with the discretion to set their prosecutorial and plea bargaining policies.see baez hennessy,cir it is well established in new york that the district attorney,and the district attorney alone,should decide when and in what manner to prosecute a suspected offender.
specifically,based on his discussions with the district attorney office,and on his own experience,williams attorney advised the district judge that,notwithstanding the sentence prescribed for class b felonies in new york,
the plea policy in this matter would have been that this defendant would very likely have been offered,considering his lack of prior criminal history,a class c felony,which,on a plea conference and as a first time offender,his sentence would have been a minimum of one year and a maximum of five and a half years.
indeed,williams attorney continued,as a class c,offender in a drug case,he would actually have been eligible for a six month split sentence.
after the forgoing presentation by williams attorney,the district judge and the assistant united states attorney engaged in the following colloquy,before she even addressed other relevant sentencing factors 
massey well,your honor,here the defendant is subject to federal law.he pled in federal court.
the court everybody subject to federal law,massey.it just a random event.whether you get pulled into federal court or not tends to depend where you get arrested.your office knows perfectly well how i feel about these cases.
massey your honor,we have the dual system and 
the court indeed we do.
massey the defendant is not being treated differently than any other federal defendant.
the court well,i not going to treat him differently than any other new york defendant.okay that how i going to treat him.
massey okay.
the court my personal matter of policy.a case that obviously a state drug case where there no crack cocaine distinction,i do have to worry about that baloney,where i have,in effect,a first time offender.where there no logical reason why this is here and not next door.
notwithstanding her rejection of the sentencing guidelines at the threshold of the proceedings,the district judge proceeded to follow the usual format of a sentencing proceeding.she calculated the appropriate range,and she referred to factors set out in a.even while engaging in this process,however,she made repeated reference to her view that the sentencing guidelines were excessive because the nature and circumstances of the offense are not peculiarly federal.in concluding her analysis of the appropriate sentence,she stated 
i have taken the guidelines into account.as i say,i believe they are excessive,and i have taken into account the need to avoid unwarranted disparities among defendants with similar records who have committed similar offenses and,in this regard,unwarranted in my mind is unwarranted in the neighborhood.and unwarranted in the neighborhood is unwarranted in this part of the world where these crimes are routinely dealt with in the state courts under a different guideline system that,because it does not incorporate a distinction as a a significantly lesser penalty for a first offender for this sort of sentence.so,as far as i am concerned,i am dealing with this situation in a way that eliminates unwarranted disparities,that is,between wil
