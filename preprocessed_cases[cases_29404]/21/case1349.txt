evidence at trial 
rowe led a drug organization that distributed crack cocaine in the bronx from until his arrest in mid.during this time rowe engaged in conflict over territory with ilar chester,a rival drug dealer.the conflict escalated,pitting rowe and chester in a gun battle in december.rowe shot chester in the leg and left the scene.the police discovered the wounded chester with a firearm and a cocaine supply.chester was imprisoned until february.
the conflict resumed upon chester release.on may,rowe summoned cashine jordan and asked jordan whether he was ready.shortly thereafter,rowe gave jordan a handgun and instructions for its use.rowe,jordan,anthony battle,and ramel shepherd drove in a car and spotted chester sitting with another man named robert mason.rowe said to jordan there they go right there.rowe exited the car,which then dropped jordan and shepherd near where chester was sitting.jordan shot chester in the chest and tried to fire additional shots,but the gun jammed.chester collapsed and died.
after responding at the scene,the police received consent from the father of rowe girlfriend rosemary varona to search varona bedroom.this search revealed ammunition that matched a shell casing found at the scene.the police arrested rowe for chester murder two days later,on june.
while in prison after his arrest,rowe made telephone calls,which were recorded by the institution.in these calls,rowe attempted to dissuade others from speaking with law enforcement and made damaging admissions.
proceedings 
under a superseding indictment,rowe was charged with conspiracy to possess and distribute or more grams of crack cocaine,in violation of,a,b a,and possession and use of a firearm in the course of a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c a iii and c causing a death by use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,in violation of j and murder committed in the course of the drug conspiracy in violation of e a,and possession of ammunition by a convicted felon,in violation of g.
because successive juries failed to reach verdicts on some of the counts,three trials were required before verdicts were rendered on all of the counts.in the first trial,before judge mckenna,rowe was found guilty of conspiracy to distribute more than grams of crack cocaine under and possession of ammunition by a felon under g.the jury failed to reach verdicts on the other counts.rowe was sentenced principally to months imprisonment on the drug conspiracy count and months,concurrent,on the count charging possession of ammunition.in the second trial,the jury failed to agree on any of the open counts.in the third trial,which was held before judge jones,the jury found rowe guilty on all three of the remaining counts.
rowe filed a motion to vacate the conviction on the grounds that the district court improperly excluded portions of recorded jailhouse conversations,which portions he contended were needed for completeness.in a second motion,he claimed that the evidence of his intent to commit murder was inadequate,and that he suffered ineffective assistance of counsel.all of the motions were denied as without merit the second motion was also denied as untimely.
judge jones sentenced rowe to months for the j offense of causing death by use of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime.this count was merged with the lesser included offense of the use of a firearm in connection with drug trafficking crime.rowe also was sentenced to months for the e a offense of murder in course of drug conspiracy.the court provided that the sentences would be concurrent with one another and with the remainder of the sentence imposed after the first trial.
discussion 
sufficiency of evidence for the murder conviction 
rowe contends the evidence in the third trial was insufficient to support a murder conviction.we may overturn the conviction only if no rational trier of fact could have found that the government established the required elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.rowe argues that the government failed to meet this standard because jordan,who shot and killed chester,testified that rowe never explicitly instructed that he kill chester.
the district court correctly rejected this claim.on a claim of insufficiency of the evidence,the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the government.united states hassan,cir.the evidence was sufficient to support the finding that rowe instructed jordan to kill chester,even if rowe gave the instruction by inference rather than explicit words.the evidence showed that rowe praised jordan for other killings he had done,supplied him with the weapon,showed him how to release the safety on the weapon,asked if he was ready,and drove with him to find chester and pointed him out.jordan exited the car and shot and killed chester.a jury could reasonably conclude that rowe had inferentially instructed jordan to kill chester.
ii.introduction of jailhouse telephone conversations 
rowe claims judge jones erred in the third trial by rejecting his offer of portions of his jailhouse telephone conversations beyond those introduced by the government.rowe argues that these excluded portions were necessary for completeness.we review judge jones decision to exclude these portions of the tapes for abuse of discretion.caruolo john crane,cir.
the hearsay rule barred rowe from introducing his own prior statements.nonetheless,when the government introduced portions of rowe statements as admissions of an adverse party.d a,rowe could then introduce other portions needed for a full understanding of the portions introduced by the government.an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.see also united states castro,cir under the completeness doctrine,the omitted portion of a statement must be placed in evidence if necessary to explain the admitted portion,to place the admitted portion in context,to avoid misleading the jury,or to ensure fair and impartial understanding of the admitted portion.
rowe argues that the district court improperly rejected his offer of a portion of exhibit,a conversation between himself and his girlfriend kathy ortega.in the portion introduced by the government,rowe told ortega to tell battle,who had retained the murder weapon after the killing,to keep it tight,meaning keep quiet.rowe sought to introduce a further portion of the conversations in which he told ortega to tell battle i not mad at him.the district court excluded the evidence.we see no reason why this statement by rowe would have assisted the jury in a complete and proper understanding of the incriminating portions of the conversation offered by the government in which rowe instructed battle not to talk.the court was within its discretion to exclude this hearsay.
rowe also contends that the court improperly excluded a portion of exhibit,a tape recording of rowe telephone conversation from jail with battle mother.in the portion of the tape offered by the government,rowe became agitated and said he really need ed to talk to battle when told by battle mother that battle had been arrested in a car with a gun.the relevance of the government evidence depended on the fact that jordan had testified that battle had kept the murder weapon after chester murder.according to the government,the c
