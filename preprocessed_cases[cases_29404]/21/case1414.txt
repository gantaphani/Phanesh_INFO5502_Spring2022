this appeal primarily concerns the rarely litigated issue of the appropriate sentencing guideline,under the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines for violations of e,which punishes,among other things,unauthorized possession and willful retention of various documents relating to national defense.the issue arises on an appeal by noureddine malki from the may,judgment of conviction of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york edward korman,district judge after pleading guilty to seven offenses charged in two separate indictments.the district court imposed an aggregate sentence of months.on appeal,malki principally challenges the determination of the applicable guideline for the section e offenses,contending that section of the guidelines,rather than section,should have been used for the initial calculation.we agree,and therefore remand for resentencing.
background 
the offenses.the defendant arrived illegally in the united states in and obtained political asylum in,using a false identity and a fabricated story of persecution.he was granted permanent resident status in and in was naturalized as a united states citizen under the name almaliki nour,having provided false information of his name,birth date,and national origin.in malki was hired as an interpreter for the contracting company,titan,and was assigned to provide translation services for military intelligence personnel in the airborne division of the united states army in iraq.he was stationed at al taqqadam air base tq,which is located in al anbar province in an area west of baghdad in the sunni triangle.in obtaining security clearance for his position,malki again provided false information about his background.he gained access to classified information in his position at titan but was not permitted to possess classified information and was advised that he could only view such information after receiving specific authorization on a need to know basis.on a second tour in iraq in,malki again provided translation services to united states army intelligence personnel.
at the end of his second tour,malki was questioned by agents for the fbi and the department of defense to determine whether he should continue to have access to classified material.he reiterated the false information he had previously provided on other occasions regarding his fictitious name,national origin,and family background.at this time,malki also gave consent to search his apartment in brooklyn,new york,where the fbi recovered classified material from the airborne division at tq,three documents and a fourth document contained on a.
upon returning to new york,he was interviewed by fbi agents and admitted that he had assumed a false identity in order to obtain political asylum and later united states citizenship and that he was in fact a moroccan national named noureddine malki.malki was arrested in october.
the charges.malki pled guilty to three offenses charged in an initial indictment two counts of making material false representations to the executive branch of the united states government,in violation of a,and one count of falsely procuring american citizenship,in violation of a.he also pled guilty to four counts of a second indictment charging that having unauthorized possession of a document relating to the national defense,he knowingly and willfully retained the document and failed to deliver it to the officer and employee of the united states entitled to receive it,in violation of e.each of these four counts concerns a different document.these offenses were based on the classified documents recovered at malki apartment.
sentencing.malki amended presentence report psr combined sentencing recommendations for the offenses in both indictments.for the false statement counts in the first indictment,malki base offense level was,and the psr recommended a enhancement for obstruction of justice.for the third count of falsely procuring united states citizenship,malki base offense level was with a enhancement for fraudulently obtaining an american passport and a enhancement for obstruction of justice.malki adjusted offense level for the three offenses charged in the first indictment was,pursuant to applicable grouping rules,see 
with respect to the four violations of section e,the psr used section of the guidelines,entitled gathering national defense information.section provides a base offense level of for secret information,such as the documents in malki possession.the psr recommended a enhancement for abuse of trust,see id,and another enhancement for obstruction of justice,see id,and denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see id,resulting in an adjusted offense level of.the four counts for violating section e,which were grouped with each other,could not be grouped with the three counts of the first indictment,but because level,applicable to the first indictment counts,was more than levels less serious than level,applicable to the second indictment counts,the total adjusted offense level remained for all seven counts.see c.
malki objected to the probation department use of section to calculate his sentencing range for the section e offenses,contending that this guideline applies only to the offense of gathering national defense information,emphasis added.in an addendum to the psr,the probation department responded that use of section was proper since there was evidence that malki had actively gathered the classified information even though he pleaded only to unauthorized retention of such information.at sentencing,the district court concluded that the psr recommended adjusted offense level calculated pursuant to section was appropriate and accepted all aspects of the psr except the recommended enhancement for abuse of trust.with a total adjusted offense level of,malki guidelines sentencing range was to months.endeavoring to impose an aggregate sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines sentencing range,judge korman imposed concurrent sentences of months for the counts in the first indictment and concurrent sentences of months for the counts in the second indictment,with the sentences for the second indictment counts to run consecutively to those for the first indictment the aggregate sentence was thus months.
judge korman initially explained the sentence as follows 
well,let me start off with i think the guideline range as applied to this defendant is a reasonable one that reflects almost all of the factors set out in section a,both in terms of the seriousness of the offense and the need to deter others which are of particular importance.
he then elaborated 
let me tell you the reason for my hesitancy here.i intend to impose a sentence within what i believe is the guideline range and which,i believe,is a reasonable one.and anything less would be inappropriate given the finding that he was gathering this material.
what troubles me here is there is a certain element of bizarreness about this case.i not percent sure whether we dealing with a spy or someone who has other problems.and so it causes me to have some hesitation about the sentence.and it really is for that reason that i am going to give a sentence at the bottom end of the guideline range.it could be that he something more than someone who was acting bizarrely or has other problems but i am just do have that degree of certainty.if i did,i would go above the guideline range.
discussion 
malki makes four arguments on appeal.first,he contends that the district court erred in using section in calculating his sentencing range for the e counts.second,he argues that the court erred in imposing a enhancement for obstruction of justice.third,he argues that he should not have been denied credit for acceptance of responsibility.finally,he contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court did not sufficiently consider sentences imposed on similarly situated defendants and the need to eliminate unwarranted sentencing disparities pursuant to a.
