mozzelle brown appeals from a november,judgment of conviction entered by the united states district court for the district of connecticut hall,following brown plea of guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.the district court found that brown criminal history subjected him to an enhanced sentence under the armed career criminal act acca,e,and sentenced him principally to months imprisonment,the minimum sentence provided by that statute.on appeal,brown challenges two of the conclusions reached by the district court in determining that brown had three prior felony convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses,thus triggering the acca mandatory minimum.first,he claims that the district court improperly counted two of his prior drug convictions as separate acca predicate offenses.second,he contends that the district court erred by treating his prior conviction for assaulting two corrections officers in violation of connecticut general statutes cgs a as a violent felony within the meaning of the acca.we hold that the district court committed no error in either of these determinations and thus affirm the judgment of the district court.
the facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed and few.on july,brown was arrested on a sealed criminal complaint after he sold a confidential informant a handgun and a of cocaine base.shortly thereafter,a grand jury returned a indictment,and approximately one year later,brown pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to the first count of that indictment,which charged him with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.
the plea agreement indicated that brown and the government disagreed about whether brown prior convictions subjected him to the acca mandatory minimum sentence,and this issue remained contested at sentencing.as set forth in brown presentence report and the transcripts of his plea colloquies,brown prior convictions included the following 
first,on august,brown pleaded guilty to a handwritten information charging him with two counts of assault on a peace officer in violation of cgs.gov t app.the prosecutor proffered that the factual basis for this plea was that on december,brown kicked and punched two corrections officers at the radgowski correctional center in montville,connecticut,when these prison guards tried to break up a fight in which brown had been involved.brown admitted to assault ing the guards,id.at,and the court accepted his plea.brown was sentenced to two concurrent terms of seven years imprisonment.
we pause briefly to observe that the handwritten information references to,which were repeated by the clerk during the plea hearing,identify a nonexistent subsection of cgs,and thus appear to have been a scrivener error.as the district court concluded and the parties agree,the offense to which brown intended to plead guilty was set forth in subsection a of cgs,which,at the time of brown conviction,proscribed assault of an employee of the department of correction.
second,on october,brown pleaded guilty to sale of in violation of cgs a.in support of this guilty plea,the prosecutor recited that brown was arrested on may,for a motor vehicle violation,and when brown was taken into police custody,a dog alerted the police to rocks of crack cocaine concealed in brown pants.brown admitted to that conduct in his plea allocution,and the court accepted his plea.
third,on march,brown pleaded guilty to another violation of cgs a as well as to a charge of criminal possession of a pistol.as the factual basis for these offenses,the prosecutor recited that on november,the norwich police department had obtained a search warrant for brown apartment and was conducting surveillance when brown was seen fleeing in a motor vehicle.the police pursued and apprehended brown.the police also executed the warrant at brown apartment,and there found crack cocaine,other drugs,a firearm,and ammunition.the prosecutor and the court both noted that these offenses took place while brown was awaiting sentencing for the prior a violation.brown admitted to this conduct,and the court accepted his plea.on june,brown was sentenced on the charges arising from both the may and november arrests to concurrent terms of ten years imprisonment,with execution suspended with three years left to serve,and three years probation.
we turn now to brown challenges to the district court finding that these prior convictions justified an enhanced sentence pursuant to the acca,which requires that persons who are convicted of violating g and who ha ve three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,or both,committed on occasions different from one another be sentenced to at least fifteen years imprisonment.e.we review de novo questions of law relating to a district court application of the acca,but apply clear error review to a district court factual findings regarding the nature of a prior offense.see united states rosa,cir united states houman,cir per curiam.
brown first argument is that the district court erred by failing to treat his two prior drug convictions as a single acca predicate offense,though he does not contest that the convictions otherwise fit the definition of serious drug offense s under the acca,see e a.this argument is addressed to the acca requirement that two offenses must be committed on occasions different from one another in order to be counted as separate acca predicate convictions.id.e.we have previously held that two convictions arise from conduct committed on different occasions if they do not stem from the same criminal episode.united states daye,cir alteration in original quoting united states rideout,cir internal quotation marks omitted.considerations relevant to this determination include whether the victims of the two crimes were different,whether the crimes were committed at different locations,and whether the crimes were separated by the passage of time.id.in united states rideout,we concluded that two convictions were properly treated as separate for purposes of the acca when these convictions were for offenses committed against different victims separated by at least twenty to thirty minutes and twelve to thirteen miles.at.here,while brown was sentenced for the two drug offenses on the same day,the conduct underlying these offenses was separated by several months,involved distinct arrests,and took place at different locations.we thus readily affirm the district court conclusion that these two offenses were committed on occasions different from one another and therefore were properly counted as two separate convictions 
brown also challenges the district court treatment of his conviction for assaulting corrections officers in violation of cgs a as a violent felony under the acca.we review de novo the district court conclusion that a prior offense is a violent felony.daye,at.
the acca defines the term violent felony to mean 
any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that 
i has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or 
ii is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
e b.the government does not contend that brown conviction falls under the first subsection of this definition,but rather argues that the conviction qualifies under the final,residual clause of the second subsection in that it otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
in considering whether a particular offense qualifies as a violent felony under the acca residual clause,we employ a categorical approach.united states johnson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this inquiry is framed in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion,begay united states,but we do not requir e that every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a vi
