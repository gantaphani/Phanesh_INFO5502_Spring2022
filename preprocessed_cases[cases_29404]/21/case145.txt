jonathan milán rodríguez milán challenges his two,concurrent month prison sentences for his convictions on one count of conspiring to distribute cocaine and one count of possessing a firearm while being an unlawful user of a controlled substance.we affirm the sentence for the drug conspiracy count,but we vacate the sentence for the firearm count because it exceeds the statutory maximum penalty for that count.
the initial indictment in this case charged milán with one count of conspiring with other defendants to possess with intent to distribute a variety of controlled substances in a number of puerto rico locations,including near an elementary school,in violation of a,and.that count of the indictment specifically noted that some of the defendants would refer to milán as the owner of the heroin.milán was also charged,in a separate count of the indictment,with one count of conspiring with a large subset of the other defendants to possess firearms in furtherance of a crime,in violation of c,o.
authorities arrested milán on august,after puerto rico police officers responded to a tip about drug trafficking activities and gunshots near a residence in puerto nuevo,puerto rico.officers saw milán near the residence and saw him carrying a firearm.they then entered the residence after receiving written consent from the homeowner and found marijuana,cocaine,a loaded firearm,and extra ammunition.milán later confessed that he was the sole owner of the items found at the residence.he was then charged,in a separate indictment,with possessing a firearm while being an unlawful user of a controlled substance,in violation of g and a.
on october,milán and the government signed a plea agreement.under the agreement,milán pleaded guilty to the drug conspiracy count charged in the first indictment and the firearm count charged in the second indictment.he did not plead guilty to the firearm count charged in the first indictment 
in the plea agreement,milán admitted that,from at least through,he conspired with the other charged defendants to possess with intent to distribute heroin,cocaine,cocaine base,and marijuana within feet of a school in puerto rico.milán also acknowledged in the plea agreement that he acted as a manager and owner of one of the heroin brands sold by the organization.milán further admitted that he possessed firearms to protect the drug trafficking activities.
the plea agreement also contained a stipulation as to drug weight.milán admitted that he conspired to possess with intent to distribute at least five but less than fifteen kilograms of cocaine.milán did not admit,however,to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute any specific amount of the other drugs that he admitted were involved in the conspiracy.and so the calculation of the base offense level and thus the recommended sentencing range under the united states sentencing guidelines in the plea agreement was based on only the amount of cocaine to which milán admitted conspiring to possess with intent to distribute.
the plea agreement also contained a provision.we thus begin by addressing whether that provision bars us from considering the merits of milán challenges 
the government,quite understandably,does not argue that the appeal waiver bars milán from appealing his sentence on the firearm count.the provision in the plea agreement reads the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waives his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case,provided that the defendant is sentenced in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the sentence recommendation provisions of this plea agreement.the sentence recommendation provision for the firearm count reads t he parties agree to recommend that the defendant be sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment within the applicable guideline range,at a total offense level of.the sentence that the district court imposed on the firearm count was months of imprisonment and thus well above the guideline range of months that applies to a defendant with an offense level of who,like milán,has a criminal history category of 
the government does argue,however,that the appeal waiver bars consideration of milán challenges to the sentence on the drug conspiracy conviction.milán does not counter that the district court failure to impose a sentence on the firearm conviction in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plea agreement makes the appeal waiver as a whole a dead letter.see united states almonte nuñez,cir considering an appeal waiver with similar language and determining that because the district court did not sentence the defendant in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plea agreement with respect to two of three counts,the clause d id not pretermit appellate review.milán instead makes the more limited argument that the district court did not sentence him in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in the sentence recommendation provision for the drug conspiracy count.we agree with milán on this point.
the sentence recommendation provision for the drug conspiracy count reads t he parties agree to recommend to the court that the defendant be sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment at the lower end of the applicable guideline range,at a total offense level of.that is,to months if milán criminal history category is.the government emphasizes that milán did receive the exact sentence mentioned in the sentence recommendation provision months.
but after milán signed the plea agreement and before he was sentenced,the sentencing guidelines changed.the change reduced the total offense level for the drug conspiracy count from to and thereby reduced the guidelines range that applied to milan from to months of imprisonment to to months of imprisonment.united states sentencing commission,guideline manual,sentencing table.the change thus exposed a latent ambiguity in the appeal waiver.was a sentence in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plea agreement one for a term of imprisonment of months,which was at the lower end of the old but guidelines range,or one for a term of imprisonment of months,which was at the lower end of the new and guideline range because our precedent is clear that any ambiguities should be resolved in favor of allowing the appeal to proceed,united states fernández cabrera,cir,the appeal waiver does not bar us from considering milán challenges to his sentence for the drug conspiracy conviction 
milán contends that the month sentence he received on the drug conspiracy conviction was both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.it is not clear from the record that milán raised below the challenges that he now raises,but the government does not ask us to review only for plain error.we thus review the reasonableness of milán sentence for the drug conspiracy conviction for abuse of discretion.see united states perretta,cir united states encarnación ruiz,cir.
milán argues that the district court committed procedural error in two ways.he contends first that the district court failed to give due consideration to the sentencing factors set out at a.he also contends that the district court emphasized factors that should not have been considered at all.those improper factors,according to milán,were the judge false perception that milán was attempting to conceal milán criminal history and the judge personal frustration with what the judge perceived to be the leniency of the puerto rico criminal justice system.
we first reject milán argument that the district court failed to consider the a factors.the district court was not required to dissect every such factor one by one,in some sort of rote incantation,when explicating its sentencing decision.united states rivera clemente,cir quoting united states turbides leonardo,cir.the district court made express its consideration of the nature and circumstances of the offense and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense.see a.our review of the record satisfies us that the district court gave due consideration to the a factors in imposing a sentence at the top of the applicable guidel
