after pleading guilty to a robbery in which he brandished a firearm,charles reed,iii reed,received a prison sentence.reed now appeals this sentence,arguing that the district court erred in concluding that his prior convictions subjected him to a mandatory minimum sentence under the armed career criminal act acca,e,and also triggered a career offender sentencing enhancement under the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines.because the district court properly applied the career offender enhancement,and because reed has shown no plain error in the district court conclusion that the acca applied,we affirm.
background 
on december,reed and his roommates,ryan forrest forrest and walter heathcote heathcote,decided to commit a robbery.the trio first discussed and discarded the idea of robbing a gas station.they then visited a walmart store with the unrealized aim of stealing a television.reed,high on heroin,next suggested that they rob a family dollar store in biddeford,maine.after heathcote drove the trio to the store,reed who was armed with a hunting rifle went into the store with forrest.the two approached the cashier and demanded money.recognizing reed as a regular customer,the cashier initially thought the robbery was a joke,but reed disabused the cashier of that impression by asking him if he wanted to find out whether reed rifle was real.
the cashier told reed and forrest that he could not open the store safe without the store manager.forrest found the manager and the manager pregnant fianc√©e in a nearby aisle and brought them to the cashier.the manager input his code into the safe,but he informed reed and forrest that the safe would not open for two minutes due to a security feature.becoming anxious,reed and forrest left without waiting for the safe to open,pausing only long enough to take the store cordless phone,the cell phone of a bystander,and multiple cartons of cigarettes,as well as from the open cash register.
not surprisingly,police shortly thereafter arrested reed.he pled guilty to a federal information charging him with one count each of robbery,a brandishing of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,id.c a ii and possession of a firearm by a felon subject to the acca mandatory minimum sentence the acca count,id.g,e.a presentence investigation report psr prepared by the probation office grouped the robbery count together with the acca count,see c,and assigned the grouped counts a base offense level of that base offense level was overridden,however,by the probation office determination that reed prior convictions rendered him subject to the guidelines career offender enhancement.see id.as a result of the enhancement,reed base offense level was set at,and his criminal history category was set at vi.see id.b.the psr then granted reed a reduction for his acceptance of responsibility,see id.a b,b,resulting in a total offense level of on the grouped counts.the combination of reed total offense level and criminal history category produced a recommended guidelines sentencing range of months for the grouped counts.
the remaining,ungrouped count brandishing of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence carried an mandatory minimum sentence to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed on the grouped counts.see c a ii,c d ii.adding this mandatory minimum to both ends of the grouped counts recommended sentencing range of months,see c a,the psr ultimately produced a total guidelines sentencing range of months.
reed argued that neither the career offender guidelines enhancement nor the acca applied to him.the district court disagreed on both points,approving the psr determinations in relevant part.nonetheless,the district court accepted the government recommendation that it apply a downward departure from the range recommended in the psr and instead use a range of months as a jumping off point for reed sentence.from this baseline,the government recommended a downwardly variant or sentence between and months.for his part,reed recommended a sentence of months.the district court agreed that a downward variance was appropriate and imposed a sentence specifically observing that this was the right sentence for the crime that was committed and that it would have impose d the same sentence under the sentencing factors laid out in a even had it not found reed to be a career offender under the guidelines.reed now appeals his sentence 
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
where a defendant has preserved a claim that his past convictions are insufficient to trigger the acca mandatory minimum or the guidelines career offender enhancement,we review the claim de novo.see united states hart,cir.united states santos,cir.we uphold the district court resolution of any subsidiary factual disputes,however,unless clearly erroneous.see santos,at.finally,even where an error in sentencing occurs,we may nevertheless affirm the sentence if the government demonstrates that the district court would have imposed the same sentence even without the error.united states tavares,cir.quoting williams united states,also united states,error in calculating guidelines sentencing range may be harmless on review when the record shows that the district court thought the sentence it chose was appropriate irrespective of the guidelines range.
career offender enhancement 
the guidelines provide that 
a defendant is a career offender if the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense and the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.
a.reed does not dispute that the first two factors apply in this case he argues only that he lacks the requisite two prior felony convictions.
the basis for reed argument rests in the guidelines stipulation that,in order to constitute two prior felony convictions,the sentences for the convictions in question must be counted separately under certain guidelines provisions.id.c.to determine whether the sentences are so counted,the guidelines further provide 
prior sentences always are counted separately if the sentences were imposed for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest,the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense.if there is no intervening arrest,prior sentences are counted separately unless a the sentences resulted from offenses contained in the same charging instrument or b the sentences were imposed on the same day.treat any prior sentence covered by a or b as a single sentence.
id.a.relying on condition b,reed argues that the three predicate felony convictions upon which the district court relied two convictions in state court for drug trafficking offenses committed in july and september and one conviction in state court for a previous bank robbery committed in november should have been counted as only a single conviction because reed pled guilty to all three offenses on the same date pursuant to a comprehensive plea agreement that consolidated all three offenses and that resulted in what reed characterizes as a de facto single sentence imposed on the day of the plea 
this entire argument concerning condition b is beside the point.condition b plainly applies only i f there is no intervening arrest between predicate offenses.id.in reed case,it is undisputed that there was such an arrest.reed committed his first predicate offense on july.he was arrested for this offense on september,and it was only after this arrest that he committed his second predicate offense,on september.below,reed initially objected to the september,arrest date,arguing that he had not been arrested for the first drug offense until october,over a month after he had committed the second drug offense.when questioned by the district court at a presentencing conference,however,defense counsel affirmatively stated,i think i withdraw my objection to the september,arrest date.and even now on appeal,reed brief accepts september,as the date of arrest for the first predicate felony.
the district court therefore committed no error in finding that reed had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense,id.a,and that,as a result,he was subject to the career offender enhancement under the guidelines.
mandatory minimum under the acca 
reed separately challenges the district court determination that the acca mandatory minimum applied in his case under the acca,a felon in possession of a firearm is subject to the mandatory minimum if he has three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,or both,committed on occasions different from one another.e.here,too,it is undisputed that reed has previously been convicted in maine state court for a drug trafficking offense committed in july a drug trafficking offense committed in september and a previous bank robbery committed in november.
reed points out,however,as he did in the district court,that his three predicate convictions,relating to offenses that occurred within a single span,were consolidated as a result of a comprehensive july plea agreement in state court.therefore,he reasons,he does not have three predicate convictions for the purposes of the acca,but has instead only one.but each conviction was registered in a separate judgment,and this circuit has already rejected the idea that the consolidation of convictions for the purposes of sentencing suffices to merge those convictions into a single acca predicate.see united states riddle,cir.per curiam.reed makes no persuasive argument that the temporal proximity of his offenses establishes that they were not committed on occasions different from one another.e.indeed,reed as much as concedes that this string of offenses can not be characterized as a single spree.united states gillies,cir.convictions for robberies of two different drug stores were treated separately,even where the robberies were committed on consecutive days and garnered concurrent sentences.and although reed attempts to argue that his single cluster of prior felony offenses does not represent the sort of career of criminal conduct congress sought to address through the acca,this broadly purposivist argument,too,has previously been rejected in this circuit.see riddle,at.the district court,in other words,did not err in rejecting the acca arguments that reed advanced below.
on appeal,reed lodges an alternative attack against the application of the acca.despite making no such argument below,reed now suggests that his predicate convictions were not for violent felon ies or serious drug offense s.e.because he raises this argument for the first time on appeal,we review it under the standard.see united states madsen,cir.under this standard,reed must demonstrate an obvious error that affected his substantial rights and that seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.quoting united states duarte,cir.
reed concedes that his two prior drug trafficking convictions,although pertaining to relatively small drug quantities,carried maximum sentences of at least ten years and so we conclude that they were serious drug offense s as that term is defined by the acca.see e a ii.reed is left,then,with the argument that his prior robbery conviction was not a violent felony under the acca.id.e.
the acca defines violent felony in relevant part as 
a ny crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,that 
i has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or 
ii is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another 
id.e b.in johnson united states,the supreme court invalidated as unconstitutionally vague the clause in subsection ii permitting a crime that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another to serve as an acca predicate,see id.at.were the district court to have relied on this clause in holding that reed robbery conviction was a conviction for a violent felony,it would have committed obvious error.see henderson united states,w hether a legal question was settled or unsettled at the time of trial,it is enough that an error be plain at the time of appellate consideration quoting johnson united states.
however,the district court never suggested that it was relying on the invalidated portion of subsection ii.nor does reed claim that it did.so reed argument hinges on demonstrating that his robbery offense fails to qualify as a violent felony under subsection i,the force clause,which encompasses crimes that ha ve as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.e b i.reed,though,offers no argument at all,even on appeal,that maine robbery offense does not so qualify.indeed,even after the government brief proffered only a possibility that maine robbery statute describes an offense that qualifies as a violent felony under the force clause,reed offered no rebuttal.he has therefore not carried his burden of showing that an obvious error has occurred.see united states jimenez,cir.burden of showing plain error rests with appellant.
we do observe that even if reed had successfully shown clear error,his request for a remand likely would have failed,as he has also barely ventured to make any showing that any error in applying the acca would likely have affected his substantial rights.after all,we have already determined that the district court correctly applied the entirely separate career offender enhancement,which resulted in a guidelines sentencing range of months well above acca mandatory minimum.despite this stratospher ic range,the district court applied a substantial downward departure and,on top of that,a further downward variance,ultimately arriving at a sentence.reed makes no argument that the district court would have varied downward still further had the acca not applied 
he would have been to support such an argument.the district court had before it reed request for a sentence and the government statement that it was comfortable with a sentence.nevertheless,the district court found these suggested sentences inadequate in the face of reed very serious offense,which opened the door to the risk to a lot of people,and the fact that reed behavior with the gun set him apart from his codefendants.accordingly,the district court found that a sentence was the right sentence for the crime that was committed,for the person who reed is and what he bring s to the court.although we may in some cases find that the improper application of a mandatory minimum is presumptively prejudicial even in the absence of any direct indication that the district court relied on that minimum in fashioning a sentence,this is not such a case.the district court proper calculation of a guidelines range well above the statutory minimum,along with its considered application of the statutory sentencing factors and its determination that reed sentence was correct in light of those factors,satisfy us that even if it were error to apply the acca mandatory minimum,that error would likely have had no impact on reed ultimate sentence.united states teague,cir.erroneous application of career offender enhancement was harmless where district court sentenced defendant within the range that would have resulted had enhancement not been applied and where district court carefully explained the reasons for the sentence,reflecting appropriate statutory considerations,id.at.
iii.conclusion 
finding no error in the district court application of the guidelines career offender enhancement,and finding no plain error resulting from the district court application of the acca mandatory minimum,we affirm reed sentence.
because reed pled guilty,we draw the relevant facts from the sentencing hearing and the unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report.seeunited states,cir.
reed was initially prosecuted by state authorities,but defense counsel represented that maine has since dismissed its charges i
