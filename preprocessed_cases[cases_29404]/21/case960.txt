scott barbour appeals his conviction of one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute and distribution of at least grams of cocaine in violation of,a,b b,and one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute and distribution of at least fifty kilograms of marijuana in violation of,a,b c.on appeal,barbour raises four arguments sentencing factor manipulation,prosecutorial misconduct,improper jury instruction on drug quantities,and errors in interpreting and applying sentencing guidelines.we affirm.
barbour was convicted in texas in for wire fraud arising from a telemarketing scheme and was sentenced to eighteen months imprisonment.after he served that term,his supervised release was revoked in,and he went back to prison until.he was again put on supervised release and required to live at a halfway house in maine.in late october of,while barbour was still on supervised release,he moved from maine to texas,which violated the terms of his supervised release.an arrest warrant was issued two days later,but it was not served on barbour until october.in the intervening period,he had established residence and a fictitious identity jon kugler in houston,texas and had begun shipping marijuana to barry may,who sold it to maine drug dealers.barbour and his family left houston in the late summer of.
following his arrest in october,barbour was sentenced to an additional twelve months imprisonment.on the final day of his imprisonment,in october,barbour and may were arrested and indicted for conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine and marijuana from january,through october.a jury found barbour guilty of both counts,and the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment.
the issues raised by barbour do not require that we deal extensively with the trial record concerning the details of the conspiracy.
barbour argues that the government delay in executing on an arrest warrant and delay in bringing conspiracy charges constituted impermissible sentencing factor manipulation.he argues that agent baril and the assistant united states attorney knew in early that barbour was in houston using the alias jon kugler,but they took no serious action to execute on the november warrant until september when agents raided the house that he had been living in.barbour argues that baril was motivated by improper personal animus in delaying the arrest and charges to increase barbour potential sentence.barbour attempts to show baril personal animus toward him through baril testimony that he was waiting for the right moment to arrest barbour.barbour argues that baril waited to arrest barbour for no legitimate reason,but only to frustrate barbour and increase his sentence.
it is the defendant burden to show sentencing factor manipulation by a preponderance of the evidence.united states gibbens,cir.we review the district court determination of whether manipulation occurred for clear error.id.at.a district court determination is clearly erroneous when,although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states newton,cir quoting reich newspapers of new england,cir.
sentencing factor manipulation occurs where law enforcement agents venture outside the scope of legitimate investigation and engage in extraordinary misconduct that improperly enlarges the scope or scale of the crime.united states egemonye,cir.a manipulation claim can be established by showing that the agents overpowered the free will of the defendant and caused him to commit a more serious offense than he was predisposed to commit.united states connell,cir.
a typical sentencing factor manipulation claim involves undercover agents participating in criminal activity with the defendant and waiting to make an arrest for the sole purpose of increasing the defendant sentence by encouraging the commission of a crime that the defendant was not predisposed to commit.see,egemonye,at gibbens,at.this is not such a case because there was no pressure to commit a more serious crime,no agent involvement in barbour crimes,and there was a legitimate reason to delay barbour arrest.
analysis of a sentencing factor manipulation claim focuses primarily though not exclusively on the conduct and motives of the government.gibbens,at.the government has broad latitude in investigating crime and can lengthen an investigation to explore the size,techniques and participants involved in a criminal operation.egemonye,at.
the district court rejected barbour claim of sentencing factor manipulation because agents did not encourage barbour or lead him into new criminal conduct,and because it found there was a legitimate reason to delay barbour arrest.the district court described barbour as the leader of an extremely large,drug conspiracy.the government identified at least eighteen participants,most of whom communicated using false names and code words.the participants frequently switched cell phones and land lines.the method of drug transportation evolved from tackle boxes to pvc pipes to volkswagen vehicles to commercial shrink wrap packaging.barbour avoided police by moving from maine to texas,to new hampshire,and to florida,where he was arrested.during the year before barbour arrest,agent baril identified five additional participants in the conspiracy and obtained additional telephone and shipping records.the agents in this case kept up with the constantly changing size,techniques,and participants of the conspiracy.this is exactly the type of investigative work egemonye considered within the legitimate scope of government agents authority.at.
the record reveals no improper conduct on the part of the agents during that investigation.there is no indication that agents pressured or coerced barbour to achieve a new level of crime.id.no undercover agent bought drugs from,or sold drugs to,barbour.agents had no contact with barbour until his arrest.
the record reflects no improper law enforcement motive.we have said that racial hostility or personal animus would be an improper motive.id.at.even if baril comment about waiting for the right moment could be interpreted as personal animus,as barbour argues,it is also amenable to an innocent interpretation.baril said he was waiting to be sure he had sufficient evidence for a conviction.he was also waiting to identify more of the conspirators and gather evidence against them.a district court choice between two or more reasonable interpretations of the evidence can not be called clearly erroneous.gibbens,at.the district court did not err in rejecting barbour claim of sentencing factor manipulation.
barbour argues that the district court did not properly instruct the jury on the government burden to prove the drug quantities from the indictment,as required by apprendi new jersey,d.the district court instructed the jury that it must find elements beyond a reasonable doubt,but did not characterize the drug quantity determination as an element.barbour argues this error denied his fifth and sixth amendment rights to a jury verdict on the drug quantities.
the district court included the drug quantities in the verdict form.the verdict form asked,did the cocaine conspiracy involve,in total,at least grams of cocaine the jury checked the yes box.the verdict form asked,did the marijuana conspiracy involve,in total,listing several quantities,with instructions to check only one.the jury put a checkmark next to at least kilograms of marijuana.the jury instructions stated that if the jury found barbour guilty,it must determine the drug quantities involved,and stated seventeen times that the government burden of proof was beyond a reasonable doubt.
barbour raises this apprendi argument for the first time on appeal he did not object to the jury instructions at trial or at sentencing.he asks that we excuse his failure to object because the case that established that apprendi errors may be raised at sentencing was decided after barbour sentencing.united states,cir,cert.denied,d.because confusion existed,in we assumed that the defendants preserved their objections if they objected either before the jury instructions were given or at sentencing.id.at.barbour did neither,so even if we made the same assumption for him,we would still review for plain error.id.at.
under the plain error standard,we reverse only if a clear and obvious error occurred.united states,cir quoting united states duarte,cir,cert.denied,d.that error also must affect the defendant substantial rights and must seriously impair the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.
any fact,other than a prior conviction,that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.apprendi,at.in,we applied the apprendi rule to drug quantity determinations.at.
barbour interprets united states goodine,cir,cert.denied,d,as requiring elements to be found beyond a reasonable doubt,but allowing sentencing factors to be found by a preponderance of the evidence.in goodine,the jury found certain drug quantities,but the judge considered additional quantities in sentencing the defendant.id.at.we applied a preponderance of the evidence standard to the quantities found by the judge and called them sentencing factors rather than elements.id.at.goodine held that apprendi was not violated when the sentence imposed exceeded the guideline range for the indicted amount but did not exceed the maximum statutory penalty for the drug quantities found by the jury.
where a fact finding,other than a prior conviction,increases the statutory maximum,under apprendi and harris united states,d,the fact must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.the supreme court explained that if,because of the existence of a particular fact,the penalty is to be increased beyond the statutory maximum,that fact must be found by the jury regardless of whether it is a sentencing factor or an element.harris,at.
the maximum sentence for convictions in which no particular quantity was proved is twenty years for cocaine and five years for marijuana.b c,d.the district court sentenced barbour to months,or years,which exceeds the twenty and statutory maximums in the absence of a quantity determination.under harris and apprendi,before barbour could be sentenced beyond the statutory maximums based on quantity,the drug quantity must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.the question in this case is whether,on the instructions given,the jury would have understood that it had to find the drug quantities beyond a reasonable doubt.
we held that the jury had not been instructed that it must find drug quantities beyond a reasonable doubt in united states and united states.in,the judge read the quantities listed in the indictment to the jury once and elsewhere stated that the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the indicted conspiracy existed.at.we held that instructions did not forge the necessary link between the concept of drug quantity and the standard.in united states,the court provided a copy of the indictment,which listed the drug quantities,to the jury,but the jury was asked to find only whether there was the conspiracy as indicted,not whether the drug amounts in the indictment were correct.at.the result was that the jury only found that the charged conspiracy existed but did not determine the drug quantities.id.
here,in contrast,the jury was given three choices of drug all or nothing,but a multiple choice.the jury was asked to specify drug type and quantity,and it did so.it is not tenable to compare this case to or,in each of which the jury was not permitted to specify amount and was not alerted to the need to consider the amount in its own right.here,the district court included the drug quantities in the verdict form.the jury was instructed that if it found barbour guilty,it would also have to answer one or more questions concerning the quantity of the substance involved which may affect the potential sentence.the jury instructions contained seventeen references to the government burden of proof.the jury was clearly instructed that the defendant guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,and the drug quantity questions that immediately followed connected that burden of proof to the drug quantity determination.the instructions in this case contain a more precise finding of drug quantity and contain a closer link between the burden of proof and the jury quantity determination than the instructions in either or.the district court did not commit plain error when it instructed the jury on the government burden of proof and included the drug quantities involved on the verdict form.
barbour argues that the assistant united states attorney pervasive misconduct during the trial and the sentencing undermined the accuracy of the process and resulted in a fundamentally unfair conviction and sentence.only three of barbour allegations of misconduct by the assistant attorney warrant discussion whether the attorney tampered with the proffer statements whether the attorney improperly bolstered the government credibility and whether the attorney made improper remarks on barbour failure to testify during closing.
we review barbour claims of prosecutorial misconduct for plain error because he failed to object at trial.united states roberts,cir.
first,barbour claims that the assistant attorney changed facts in baril proffer reports,which rendered them inaccurate and unreliable,and then used the reports during his impeachment of barry may.the proffer reports were investigative reports prepared by agents of the maine drug enforcement agency after interviews with cooperating witnesses.barbour brief argues that by reviewing and revising proffer reports,the attorney rendered them unreliable and then injected the contents of the reports before the jury without defense counsel being made aware of the tampering.
barbour only support for claiming the assistant attorney changed facts is that some of the facts in the reports differed from baril recollection or from another witness recollection.if the proffer reports do not coincide perfectly with the witnesses memories,that inconsistency does not establish that the attorney changed facts in baril proffer report.baril said during the sentencing hearing that,during an interview,he routinely tries to take notes verbatim and he types them into a report as soon as possible.a copy of that report is sent to the prosecutor,any agents who attended the interview,the witness,and the defense attorney to be reviewed for accuracy.after the report is written and signed,any corrections are made in a supplemental report.barbour received a copy of baril handwritten notes from the interviews.the record does not establish plain error because barbour has not shown that the assistant attorney tampered with any of the proffer reports.
second,barbour contends that the assistant attorney improperly bolstered the government credibility during the trial.the attorney periodically questioned witnesses about what they told us or the agents in their proffer sessions.barbour argues that by identifying himself with the agents,the attorney improperly borrowed the prestige of those agents.barbour argues that the attorney repeatedly mentioned that the witnesses told a different story to government agents to imply that because the agents worked for the government,their recollection was more likely to be the truth than the witnesses recollection.we are persuaded by the government explanation that the attorney used those words as context,to explain to the court and the witnesses to which interviews he was referring.an assistant attorney of a witness with an inconsistent statement would be of doubtful value if he were not permitted to delineate between conversations by giving the witness more context.may participated in several proffers and at one point during the trial,for clarification,had to ask the attorney,is this the proffer i did with you there is no indication that the attorney was attempting to bolster the government credibility with those references.
the assistant attorney also said,so i guess the agents got that wrong when confronting may with an inconsistent statement.even if the isolated question indir
