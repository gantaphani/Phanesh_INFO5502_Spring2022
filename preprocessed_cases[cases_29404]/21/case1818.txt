samuel ward,a certified public accountant and principal of the accounting firm ward,and daniel drucker,a former employee of ward firm,appeal their convictions and respective sentences imposed by the united states district court for the southern district of new york kevin thomas duffy,judge after a jury found them guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and securities fraud.ward and drucker appeal on many grounds,all but one of which we find to be without merit.we write primarily to clarify the application of two sections of the united states sentencing guidelines or the guidelines b which prescribes a downward adjustment for certain conspiracy convictions and,which prescribes a upward adjustment i f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust,or used a special skill,in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.we hold that the district court erred by declining to apply a downward adjustment under b,but properly increased the defendants base offense level by two pursuant to.we therefore affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand for the district court to resentence the defendants with the benefit of this adjustment.
background 
jeffrey pokross,an investment banker,james downing,owner of the privately held corporation,searchhispanic,and several others conspired to perpetrate a pump and dump scheme.pump and dump,according to the government,denotes a manipulation scheme in which the schemers first artificially inflate,or pump,the price of a stock by bribing stock promoters to sell it,and then dump the stock once the price becomes sufficiently high.appellee br.at.
to accomplish this scheme,the conspirators intended,as a first step,to merge searchhispanic into the publicly traded shell corporation gtrade networks,gtrade,an offshore company controlled by unindicted coconspirator andy mann.gtrade had previously been listed on the bulletin board exchange otcbb,but had been removed from the otcbb register because of its failure to comply with an antifraud rule promulgated by the national association of securities dealers.
to restore gtrade to the otcbb register following the merger between searchhispanic and preliminary step toward the execution of the conspirators needed unqualified audit reports for each company.because truly independent auditors would be highly unlikely to furnish such opinions,the conspirators needed the help of compliant accountants in order to carry out the scheme successfully.the conspirators identified ward as the principal accountant upon whom they could rely to produce the unqualified reports.according to evidence admitted at trial pursuant to.b,ward had in furnished false financial statements in connection with a similar scheme the jackpot scheme.see appellee br.at.to ensure that the reports on gtrade and searchhispanic appeared independent,ward recruited his employee drucker to produce one of the reports on separate letterhead.the conspirators reasoned that if ward issued the purportedly unqualified audit reports for both premerger and investors would likely become suspicious.
unbeknownst to the other conspirators,pokross had been arrested previously for offenses of a similar nature,and on december,had agreed as part of a plea agreement with respect to those offenses to cooperate with the government as an informant.with his help,the government installed an audio eavesdropping device in pokross office,and over a period of several months,recorded conversations among the conspirators that illuminated the nature and scope of the conspiracy.on may,the conspirators,including the two accountants,met in pokross offices,where they discussed the scheme and the roles to be played by ward and drucker.on june,the government arrested ward,drucker,and downing.downing subsequently pled guilty to a conspiracy charge.on january,following a trial,a jury convicted ward and drucker of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud in violation of.
on july,the district court sentenced ward to months imprisonment.the court rejected ward argument that he qualified for a reduction to his base offense level under b because the conspiracy did not go very far.drucker also requested a downward adjustment under b.he further contended that because he never in fact used his special skill,accounting,to facilitate the offense of conviction,the district court should not impose the upward adjustment prescribed by.the court rejected both arguments,and on september,sentenced drucker to months incarceration.
both defendants appeal,challenging their convictions and sentences on multiple grounds.they contend,inter alia,that the district court erred by refusing to apply b and by applying.
discussion 
sufficiency of the evidence 
both defendants argue that the evidence did not suffice to support their convictions insofar as it failed to establish their awareness of the conspiracy object to commit wire fraud and securities fraud.drucker alone maintains that the evidence also failed to establish that he ever agreed to issue false audit reports.he avers that he believe d in good faith that his and ward opinions would be rendered independently.appellant drucker br.at.finally,both ward and drucker argue that the district court erred by admitting evidence pursuant to.b of ward involvement in a previous operation.the district court admitted this evidence solely against ward,for the purpose of showing his knowledge or intent.

b.the elements of conspiracy 
to prove the crime of conspiracy,the government must establish 
that the defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit an offense that the defendant knowingly participated in the conspiracy with the specific intent to commit the offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy and that during the existence of the conspiracy,at least one of the overt acts set forth in the indictment was committed by one or more of the members of the conspiracy 
united states salameh,cir,cert.denied,d.the conspiratorial agreement need not be formal or express.united states amato,cir.the government may prove its existence by circumstantial evidence,desimone,at,provided such evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt the defendants knowledge of the essential nature of the plan and their connections with it,blumenthal united states.the government need not prove that the defendants knew the details of the conspiratorial scheme or the identities of all of the conspirators.id.
applying the foregoing standards,we have no difficulty concluding that the evidence sufficed to support the defendants convictions.ward concedes that he agreed with others to violate accounting standards in the preparation of the gtrade and search hispanic audited financial statements.appellant ward br.at.he argues,however,that no evidence established his knowledge of the specific scheme for which he was convicted.id.at.but as noted,the government was not required to establish ward knowledge of the details of that scheme it sufficed that the evidence showed that he understood its essential nature.see blumenthal,at.the government introduced evidence specifically designed to refute ward contention that he lacked this understanding,in particular,that ward actively participated in the substantially similar jackpot scheme.the government also introduced direct and circumstantial evidence of ward knowledge,including transcripts of his conversations with coconspirators about the conspiracy,and conversations among other conspirators in which they referred expressly to ward role in the scheme.we therefore have no doubt that a rational juror could have concluded that ward understood the essential nature of the plan.id.at.that is all the law requires.see united states benjamin,cir.friendly,finding an accountant awareness of the part of the securities fraud scheme that involved the sale of unregistered shares to be immaterial to his liability because his acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were essential steps in a single scheme to dupe and part of an integrated financial fraud,cert.denied,d.
drucker,whom ward recruited into the conspiracy at a later stage,plainly played a more attenuated role in the scheme.but we can not say that no rational juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt that drucker,too,understood its essential nature.see jackson,at.pursuant to the hearsay exception codified at.d e,which allows one coconspirator statement to be offered against another for the truth of the matter asserted,the government properly introduced ward statement that drucker was to create one of the false audit reports on separate letterhead.this statement provided circumstantial evidence of drucker knowledge of the essential nature of the conspiracy.drucker was also present at the may,meeting at which the conspirators discussed the scheme in some detail and contacted unindicted coconspirator andy mann to talk about the role of his offshore corporation gtrade.based on this evidence,a rational juror could conclude that drucker understood the essential nature of the scheme.the evidence therefore was sufficient.
we also find unpersuasive drucker contention that he never in fact agreed to issue a false unqualified audit report.drucker argues that his oral agreement with pokross to make the audit report appear to be independent rather than commingl ed with the audit report prepared by ward reflected his bona fide belief that their opinions would be rendered independently.appellant drucker br.at.while that exculpatory account may be plausible,plausibility is not the standard a rational juror could conclude otherwise.see abelis,at friedman,at.
ii.the rule b evidence 
ward and drucker next argue that the district court erroneously admitted evidence pursuant to.b of ward previous participation in a similar scheme.
standard of review 
we review the district court evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.joiner,d accord united states ramirez,cir.
rule b of the federal rules of evidence proscribes the use of evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts committed by the defendant to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.prior evidence is admissible,however,to prove,inter alia,knowledge,intent,and absence of mistake.id.in huddleston united states,d,the supreme court articulated a test to guide judicial discretion under rule b.prior evidence must be offered for a proper purpose,relevant,and substantially more probative than prejudicial.in addition,at the defendant request,the district court should give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction.id.at.see also ramirez,at discussing the huddleston test.
ward concentrates his challenge on the third huddleston requirement that the evidence be more probative than prejudicial under.drucker,by contrast,argues that although the district court admitted the challenged evidence against ward alone and issued a limiting instruction that the jury not consider it as to drucker,he nonetheless suffered spillover prejudice so severe that it warranted a severance.we disagree with both arguments.
ward contended at trial that he neither knew about nor intended to facilitate any securities or wire fraud by producing false audit reports.ward own defense strategy therefore made evidence of his previous participation in a substantially similar scheme highly probative.that ward previously prepared false audit reports to facilitate a securities fraud scheme tends strongly to belie his assertion that he did not understand the nature of the scheme for which he was being prosecuted.it further explains why the conspirators trusted ward to prepare the false audit reports for gtrade and searchhispanic.of course,notwithstanding the district court admonition,the jury may have drawn an impermissible propensity inference against ward.see.b.but the district court retains broad discretion to balance the evidence potential prejudice to the defendant against its probative value.united states mcdermott,cir.for this reason,when we review the district court judgment regarding the admissibility of a particular piece of evidence under,we generally maximiz e its probative value and minimiz e its prejudicial effect.id.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.applying this standard of review,we see no basis for concluding that the district court abused its discretion by admitting limited evidence of the jackpot scheme against ward alone,for the purpose of showing his knowledge,intent or absence of mistake.
drucker concedes that the district court issued an appropriate limiting instruction directing the jury not to consider the jackpot scheme evidence against him.he argues,however,that his employment relationship with ward made spillover prejudice inevitable and that the severity of this prejudice entitled him to a severance.appellant drucker br.at.in general,a defendant seeking to overturn the denial of a severance motion must show that he was so severely prejudiced by the joinder as to have been denied a fair trial,not that he might have had a better chance for acquittal at a separate trial.united states torres,cir.quoting united states burke,cir,cert.denied,d.drucker cites some evidence that the prosecution referred to the jackpot scheme without distinguishing between ward and ward company ward,for which drucker worked,thereby potentially exacerbating the prejudice to drucker.but he asserts only in a conclusory fashion that the court limiting instruction failed to ameliorate potential prejudice.absent evidence to the contrary,we must presume that juries understand and abide by a district court limiting instructions.zafiro united states,d emphasizing that prejudice can be cured with proper instructions,and juries are presumed to follow their instructions internal quotation marks omitted see,united states rosa,cir affirming the denial of a severance where several defendants contended that they suffered spillover prejudice from evidence introduced against their codefendants,cert.denied,d.absent some basis to find that drucker suffered severe prejudice,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to grant him a severance.
iii.sentencing challenges 
we review a sentencing court findings of fact for clear error and its legal determinations de novo,giving due deference to its application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts.united states berg,cir.
b directs a sentencing court to adjust a defendant base offense level for conspiracy downward by three levels 
unless the defendant or a completed all the acts the conspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful completion of the substantive offense or the circumstances demonstrate that the conspirators were about to complete all such acts but for apprehension or interruption by some similar event beyond their control.
the district court concluded that neither ward nor drucker merited this adjustment.the government urges us to affirm because,in its view,b does not apply if the conspirators had completed the acts that constituted the elements of at least one of the substantive offenses,appellee br.at emphasis in original,and ward and drucker had,by may,the date of their meeting with the other conspirators in pokross office,committed the substantive offense of mail fraud,id.at.
the government seeks support for its reading of b in united states carrington,cir,cert.denied,d.there,the first circuit,citing its prior decision in united states egemonye,cir,said that b can be read in two ways as offering a reduction for potential versus completed harm,or as applying only where the defendant has not completed the actions necessary to the substantive offense.carrington,at.the first circuit embraced the latter position,finding it more consistent with the general philosophy of the guidelines.id.quoting egemonye,at see also egemonye,at effectively,gives the defendant a discount if he is some distance from completing the substantive crime.accord united states sung,cir whether applies depends on how close the defendant came to completing the crimes.
the government,citing carrington,maintains that even though it interrupted the scheme well before ward,drucker,and their coconspirators completed all the acts the conspirators believed necessary for the successful completion of that scheme,ward and drucker nonetheless should not receive the b downward adjustment.the government reasons that by the time of their arrest,ward and drucker already had completed the acts that constituted the elements of at least one of the substantive offenses,wire fraud or securities fraud,appellee br.at emphasis in original,and does not apply to completed substantive offenses,carrington,at citing egemonye,at.
the government asserts that the elements of most fraud offenses consist of devis ing or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,mail fraud id.wire fraud id.bank fraud,and a de minimis jurisdictional element,such as the use of interstate or international wire systems in furtherance of the scheme.see appellee br.at.in particular,the government contends that the elements of wire fraud are the existence of a scheme to defraud persons of money or property and the use of interstate or international wires in furtherance of the scheme.id.citing.ward and drucker committed wire fraud because b y may,at the latest,they had knowingly joined a scheme to defraud people of money through the sale of stock and used international telephone lines to further the scheme by calling andy mann.id.at.by similar reasoning,the government contends that ward and drucker committed securities fraud b y may,they employed a scheme and artifice to defraud in connection with the purchase and sale of a security and used an instrumentality of interstate,the telephone conversation with furtherance of that scheme.id.at.therefore,the government concludes,the adjustment does not apply where,as it maintains here,the defendants completed the substantive offense.b.we find the government position,and its reliance on carrington to support this position,unpersuasive 
first,we think that the government use of the phrase the substantive offense begs the question what is the substantive offense during the life of a conspiracy,defendants may commit any number of offenses ancillary to that or those which constitute the object or objects of the conspiracy,but for which the government elects not to prosecute.we do not agree with the government that the substantive offense,as used in b,refers to all of these offenses because they are substantive,however ancillary they may be to the overall object of the conspiracy for which the defendants were indicted.the guidelines expressly state that for the purposes of,s ubstantive offense means the offense that the defendant was convicted of soliciting,attempting,or conspiring to commit.cmt.emphasis added.the government did not prosecute drucker and ward for conspiring to commit some act of wire or securities fraud it prosecuted them for conspiring to commit specific acts of fraud in furtherance of a particular scheme,namely,the operation detailed in the indictment.t he substantive offense refers to the frauds constituting the object of the conspiracy charged in the indictment and of which the defendants were convicted 
second,b provides a reduction to a defendant convicted of conspiracy unless the defendant or a coconspirator completed all the acts the conspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful completion of the substantive offense.emphasis added.technical completion of all the elements of a substantive offense,regardless of how far the substantive offense or offenses underlying the conspiracy have progressed in time and substance,can not,we think,be equated with all the acts the conspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful completion of the substantive offense,as defined by the object of the conspiracy charged in the indictment and proved to the jury.some defendants could commit all the acts required to incur liability for an ancillary substantive offense without completing all the acts the conspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful completion of the substantive offense.
here,as the government contends,drucker and ward may have completed the technical elements of a substantive offense of wire fraud or securities fraud,because the elements of wire fraud are the existence of a scheme to defraud persons of money or property and the use of interstate or international wires in furtherance of the scheme.appellee br.at.but neither ward nor,for that matter,their coconspirators completed all the acts the conspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful completion of the substantive offense that formed the object of the conspiracy for which the government chose to prosecute acts they believed necessary successfully to perpetrate the scheme charged in the indictment and proved to the jury 
this analysis does not depend on how far along ward and drucker were in playing their individual roles in the conspiracy.even had they completed their roles,prepared final false audit reports,we doubt they would have been disqualified from receiving the b adjustment.the relevant question is whether the conspiracy ripen ed into a substantially completed offense or c a me close enough to fruition,united states amato,cir,cert.denied,d accord united states,cir holding that applies unless the remaining steps to be taken in the commission of a crime are so insubstantial that the commission of the substantive offense is inevitable,barring an unforeseen occurrence,not whether the defendants individual acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were substantially complete.section b does not refer to the acts of each individual defendant,at in evaluating whether all the acts necessary for completion of the offense have occurred or are about to have occurred,the court must look at the actions of all the conspirators collectively,rather than at those of a particular defendant individually.it is possible that the elements of one or more substantive crimes will be completed by a defendant long before the conspirators have completed all the acts the conspirators believed necessary on their part for the successful completion of the substantive offense.b 
finally,we note that were a defendant ineligible for a b adjustment because of his or her completion of the elements of a substantive fraud offense,b would in practice be rendered largely nugatory for a not insignificant category of federal conspiracy crimes.where a criminal statute defines the elements of fraud as devising or intending to devise a scheme to defraud and fulfilling a de minimis jurisdictional element,such as use of interstate wires,those elements may well be completed at an early stage in the conspiracy.in such cases,even if the defendant took only trivial acts in furtherance of the,even if the defendant subsequently decided to withdraw from the or she would be ineligible for the b reduction.
we conclude that the district court erred by declining to apply b to ward and drucker sentences.neither ward nor drucker nor a completed all the acts the conspira
