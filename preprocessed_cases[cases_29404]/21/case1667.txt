background 
defendant offense conduct 
valdez was convicted for participating in a scheme in which he defrauded telephone carrier at t out of well over in long distance telephone services between may and his arrest in april.an acquaintance,guillermo,taught him how to defraud at t by calling at t to retrieve calling card numbers,pin numbers,and passwords for names randomly taken from the phonebook.access to the numbers obtained allowed defendant to place and sell thousands of domestic and international telephone calls.
over several years,an investigator from at t network fraud management department used the company database to discover that an individual,later identified as valdez,placed numerous illegal telephone calls from pay phones near a bus terminal in the washington heights area of new york city.the investigator further learned that this individual tested the validity of calling card accounts he had acquired by calling an unsubscribed telephone number in florida and another one in mexico.the investigator reported that the florida test number had been called times and the mexico number had been called nearly times.from these records,the company estimated its loss from fraudulent calls initiated by valdez at.
on several occasions between december and january the investigator placed a recording device,pursuant to federal law,on the suspected pay phones.during the recorded calls,valdez typically opened numerous accounts during a single call.he succeeded in this ruse by offering false explanations for his actions including posing as a building owner attempting to obtain numbers on behalf of his tenants.a review of the tapes also revealed that defendant sometimes requested special access to certain countries as a means of overcoming at t default prohibition on calling card calls to those countries due to numerous incidents of fraud associated with such calls.
in december at t investigator notified the secret service of valdez criminal activity.during the next few months,secret service agents observed defendant placing calls on a pay phone on many occasions.the agents determined that these calls were for the purpose of opening at t calling card accounts.on some occasions valdez was observed holding pieces of paper with numerous names and addresses on them.during one of the surveillances,defendant placed a call on a pay phone while motioning to another individual who then approached the phone and handed cash to valdez.
on april,secret service agents arrested defendant and interviewed him.defendant told the agents that he had obtained calling cards in other people names and had sold calls to people on the street using those numbers.during a search of his apartment,agents found hundreds of pieces of paper containing names,addresses,calling card numbers,pin numbers,and passwords.from this evidence and the company database,at t estimated that valdez had fraudulently obtained and possessed over calling card numbers.
contentions of the parties 
the primary issue on this appeal is the district court refusal to adjust defendant sentence downward on the grounds of significantly reduced mental capacity pursuant to.in his initial sentencing submission,valdez argued that his diminished capacity made him unable to fully understand the wrongfulness of his actions,and to control the incident behavior.to support this contention,defendant pointed to his iq score of,his documented learning difficulties,and his dependency on others.he noted his family history of psychiatric problems and his own symptoms of mental illness.indeed,since he was a child,psychiatrists have been concerned with his behavior.in a psychiatric evaluation conducted in,for example,a school psychiatrist diagnosed valdez,then years old,with brain damage and a severe emotional disturbance.defendant was subsequently placed in special education classes and eventually dropped out of school.
valdez treating psychiatric intern diagnosed him with panic disorder or agoraphobia,meaning that he fears places where escape may be difficult.defendant also had two sessions with a psychiatrist,berrill,in conjunction with the present criminal proceeding.the doctor was of the opinion that valdez also displays signs of a generalized anxiety disorder,which is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry for an extended period of time.berrill evaluation additionally concluded that valdez had marked dependency needs which led him to be overly compliant.additionally,although the iq tests administered by berrill indicated that valdez was functioning in a mildly impaired range with a full scale iq of,the doctor observed that defendant performance on this battery of tests was probably not an accurate representation of his abilities because valdez did not appear to have done his best on the tests.
defendant further contended his diminished mental capacity was causally linked to his commission of the crime,thus making a downward departure appropriate.he pointed to berrill conclusion that he was incapable of developing the fraud that led to his indictment.defendant insists that guillermo taught him how to defraud the telephone company that he only sold cards to two men and that he was told the scheme was necessary to make money and as a means to call his son.
the government opposed valdez downward departure request,while acknowledging his mental problems.the government contended defendant failed to satisfy his burden of proof because he did not meet the definition of significantly reduced mental capacity contained in the commentary to.it pointed to evidence contradicting defendant contention that he had difficulty understanding the wrongfulness of his actions.the government also contested the causal link alleged to exist between valdez deficiencies and the crime he committed.specifically,it cited evidence that valdez acted independently and was extensively involved in the fraud scheme.
district court sentencing 
on june,the parties appeared at a sentencing conference before judge duffy,where valdez counsel reiterated the above arguments.judge duffy stated that while defendant might not have understood the consequences of his wrongful actions,he knew that his actions were wrong.valdez counsel clarified that valdez only argued that his sense of wrong was limited,not that it was wholly absent.the district court judge interjected that if valdez did not wholly understand wrongfulness,then valdez would have an entirely different basis,apparently referring to an insanity defense that valdez could have raised in such case.the district judge repeated his previous comment that valdez knew what he was doing was wrong.
the district court disputed defendant characterization of the facts,suggesting defendant initiated the illegal activity on his own after learning it from guillermo.in october defense counsel submitted a second letter to the district court asserting that guillermo role was active,regular,and sustained.valdez stated he paid guillermo per week for guillermo help in reading names to defendant from the phone book,and that defendant was easily manipulated by guillermo b
