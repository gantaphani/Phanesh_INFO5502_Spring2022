we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states decologero,cir.in,the federal bureau of investigation fbi informed the dea that one of its confidential informants fbi ci was approached by,who was looking to acquire a boat for the purpose of transporting cocaine from other caribbean islands into puerto rico.the dea began its investigation of activities in january of.on january,the fbi ci met with to discuss his request for a boat.agent gonzález supervised the photographic surveillance of this meeting.
on february,agent gonzález posed as a drug trafficker and met with the fbi ci and aboard a boat owned by the dea that is used to conduct undercover drug transactions.agent gonzález gave a tour of the boat,showing him the hidden compartments,which were of particular interest to.initially indicated that he wanted to purchase the boat,but agent gonzález informed him that this was not possible.then stated that several different acquaintances had cocaine contacts in antigua and maarten,and that he was interested in using the boat,and agent gonzález services,to smuggle cocaine into puerto rico and deliver it to these acquaintances.agent gonzález and also discussed the price of the cocaine and the costs of transporting it.through subsequent investigation,agent gonzález discovered that adalberto coriano had cocaine contacts in maarten,and that coriano and efraín santana,an acquaintance of coriano,were two of the intended recipients for the cocaine 
in a phone conversation on february,told agent gonzález that he had finished a meeting with some individuals and asked if agent gonzález would show them the boat if necessary.did not identify these individuals,and agent gonzález never confirmed their identities.agent gonzález declined to show the undercover boat.in another phone conversation on february,told agent gonzález that some individuals had two cocaine loads available,for and kilograms each,but that he had not discussed fees with them.following this conversation,agent gonzález,the fbi ci,and another undercover dea agent met at a restaurant.at this meeting,explained that he met with other unidentified individuals the previous day and they offered him two loads of cocaine,consisting of and kilograms,to be picked up in antigua,using agent gonzález undercover boat,which would be escorted by police or military officials up to miles out to sea.
on february,told agent gonzález that he was going to meet with unidentified individuals to discuss their february meeting.at a february,meeting,again told agent gonzález of the other cocaine loads,consisting of and kilograms,that were still available in antigua.agent gonzález stated that he would like a fee of twelve to fifteen percent,depending upon the size of the cocaine load.told agent gonzález that he would negotiate for twenty percent,so that he could make some money.they also discussed the possibility that the owner of the drugs might accompany agent gonzález on his boat from antigua to puerto rico and instructions for loading the cocaine from the boat into a vehicle for delivery in puerto rico.
during a meeting on february,told agent gonzález that he was going to meet with some unidentified individuals in a few days to continue negotiations regarding the cocaine loads from antigua.at a february meeting,told agent gonzález that one of the cocaine loads he had been working on was no longer available because it had been picked up by someone else,but that other loads were still available.agent gonzález testified that he was unsure which loads was referring to in this conversation.then accepted from agent gonzález to travel to antigua to confirm that there was cocaine available for transport to puerto rico.however,never went to antigua and did not repay the money.later that same day,met with some unidentified individuals to continue discussions.
on march,told agent gonzález that he met with two individuals about transporting cocaine using agent gonzález boat,but they were not interested because they wanted to buy,not rent,a boat to transport the drugs.also said that he was currently in discussions with another unnamed individual.agent gonzález later discovered that the individual was santana.agent gonzález and met again on march.during the meeting,made a phone call to someone,later identified as santana,and asked him to tell an unnamed individual,later identified as coriano,that he was meeting with the owners of the boat,and to ask whether coriano was still interested in the drug transaction.concluded the call,and santana called back some time later.after finishing his conversation with santana,informed agent gonzález that santana and coriano were still interested in obtaining transportation for cocaine loads but that they could not agree on the fee he and agent gonzález would take for transporting the cocaine.demanded a fee of twenty percent and santana would only offer sixteen percent,which would not accept.stated,however,that he would meet with santana later that day.when agent gonzález asked to be included in this meeting,declined because he was afraid of being excluded from a transaction.
on march,told agent gonzález in a phone conversation that santana and coriano were still interested in working with them.on march,and agent gonzález met to discuss meeting with santana on march.told agent gonzález that other unidentified individuals were arrested and that his negotiations with them regarding drug loads had therefore terminated.stated his concern about the arrests and suggested that they should delay their drug transaction for awhile but that they would resume negotiations later.the drug transaction never occurred.
in august of,agent gonzález,as an undercover agent,met with coriano,the fbi ci,and another individual to discuss the shipment of cocaine from maarten into puerto rico.coriano had approached the fbi ci looking for transportation for cocaine.in october of,santana spoke with the fbi ci and told him that his discussions with fell through because they could not agree on the fee.in speaking with santana,had apparently blamed the fbi ci for requiring a higher fee the fbi ci corrected santana and told him that was the one demanding the higher fee.
procedural history 
on august,an indictment was returned against,santana,and coriano for conspiracy to import with intent to distribute,and to possess with intent to distribute,five or more kilograms of cocaine,from approximately november,through approximately march,see,and.at his arraignment,pled not guilty to the charges against him.
trial began on june.at the close of evidence,moved for acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure,based on his claim that the evidence did not establish that there was an agreement to import or possess cocaine with anyone other than agent gonzález and the fbi ci the court denied the motion.then testified and rested on june.after the jury charge was given,renewed his rule motion,which the court again denied.the jury found guilty on both counts of conspiracy.
at sentencing,requested a sentence below the applicable guideline range.the court responded,the government may be very much inclined to accept such an argument if,for example,you waive your right to appeal.at the court urging,defense counsel spoke to about a waiver,but declined.was sentenced to months in prison,which was below the applicable guideline range.
sufficiency of the evidence 
argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his drug conspiracy convictions because there was no evidence produced at trial that he reached an agreement to import or possess cocaine with anyone other than a government agent.we review sufficiency of the evidence claim de novo,considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states,cir.we will not overturn a guilty verdict unless,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,no reasonable jury could have rendered it.united states,cir.further,we will not assess the credibility of witnesses,as that is a role reserved for the jury.united states nishnianidze,cir.
to establish that the defendant is guilty of participating in a narcotics conspiracy,the government must prove,beyond a reasonable doubt,that an agreement existed to commit the underlying substantive offense,and that the defendant elected to join the agreement,intending that the underlying offense be committed,at quoting united states,cir.the essence of the crime is the conspirators agreement to act in concert to import,possess,and distribute illegal drugs.united states cruz,cir see united states rodriguez,cir.the agreement must exist between two or more persons,and as a matter of law,there can be no conspiracy between a defendant and a government agent.united states castellini,cir united states giry,cir.
an agreement between coconspirators may be proven by circumstantial evidence,and it may be tacit,at united states portela,cir united states concemi,cir a n agreement may be inferred from a development and collocation of circumstances.internal quotation marks omitted.a conspiratorial agreement,therefore,need not be express so long as its existence can plausibly be inferred from the defendants words and actions concemi,at.further,the conspiracy need not succeed for the conviction to stand,at.
the indictment in this case charged an agreement among,santana,coriano,and other known and unknown individuals to import,possess,and distribute cocaine the evidence presented by the government to support the conspiracy charges consisted of the testimony of agent gonzález,audio recordings of conversations between agent gonzález and,and an audio recording of a conversation between and santana which agent gonzález overheard because a conspiracy can not exist between a government agent and an individual,these conversations are not direct evidence of the charged conspiracy.the conversations may,however,constitute circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy among,santana,and coriano if they show that these individuals agreed to work together to import and possess,with an intent to distribute,five or more kilograms of cocaine in violation of united states law.see,at united states elledge,cir.
agent gonzález testified that was involved in discussions with numerous unidentified individuals regarding cocaine loads in antigua,and that several discussions fell through for a variety of reasons.he also testified that had discussions with individuals he later identified as santana and coriano,who had cocaine contacts in maarten and antigua.at the march,meeting,agent gonzález overheard side of a phone conversation had with an individual later identified as santana,in which he told santana that he was with the people who had the boat,and asked if coriano was still interested.santana called back and he confirmed that coriano was still interested.however,they could not agree on the fee which and agent gonzález would collect because insisted upon a twenty percent fee.
following this meeting,stated that santana and coriano were still interested,but that he wanted to wait because some individuals had recently been arrested on drug charges.agent gonzález had no further conversations with.in august of,coriano met with agent gonzález and the fbi ci regarding the transportation of cocaine loads into puerto rico.in october of,the fbi ci met with santana,who told the fbi ci that the discussions with fell through because they could not agree on the fee.
this is a close case.while there is evidence of numerous discussions between and several unidentified individuals regarding available cocaine loads as well as evidence of desire to effectuate a cocaine deal,there is a lack of sufficient evidence showing that he actually reached an agreement to act in concert with santana and coriano.cruz,at.contrary to the government assertion,the evidence often does not indicate which individuals is referring to in his discussions with agent gonzález the government argues that there is evidence that,santana,and coriano agreed on the specific amount of cocaine and the specifics regarding the and transportation of the cocaine by boat.agent gonzález testimony regarding his conversations with,however,establishes that an agreement existed only between and agent gonzález.although agent gonzález testified that,santana,and coriano had generally agreed,he did not testify as to what they agreed on,and in the same statement,agent gonzález recalls that they santana and coriano were still seeking transportation for the drug shipments,which indicates that they had not reached an agreement with.
the government also cites to,and argues that a completed transaction is not necessary in proving the existence of a conspiracy.in,three of the defendants appealed from their drug conspiracy convictions and argued that the evidence was insufficient to support the existence of a conspiracy because many of the drug importation plans never came to fruition and their negotiations failed to produce a complete meeting of the minds on issues such as the exact location for the handover of the drugs at sea or the division of the proceeds.at.noting that a conspiracy conviction does not require that the conspiracy succeed,nor that the underlying act even be attempted,we held that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that an agreement existed among the defendants to work together to buy and sell illegal narcotics.id.the evidence in showed that the defendants had agreed to import several loads of cocaine from columbia and heroin from maarten.their agreement was evidenced by their plans to procure a boat,navigational charts,and radios,and by the designation of boat captains,coordinators,security monitors,and drug distributors.an undercover agent also met with two coconspirators on several occasions,at which they agreed to work together to import kilograms of cocaine from colombia,although the transaction ultimately fell through for numerous reasons.there was also evidence that a few of the coco
