in light of a congressional amendment to the sentencing guidelines in,this case requires us to consider for the first time the scope of the government discretion in deciding whether to file a motion for an additional decrease in the defendant base offense level for acceptance of responsibility.
leo beatty pleaded guilty to four counts of distribution of cocaine base,after he sold drugs to an undercover agent working for the drug enforcement administration dea.although he entered a timely guilty plea,he contested at the change of plea hearing the weights of the drugs involved and the characterization of the substance as crack cocaine,admitting only that it was cocaine base.initially,he also appeared to of the prior drug felonies included in the government submission pursuant to.
at sentencing,the district court awarded beatty a reduction in his base offense level under the sentencing guidelines pursuant to a for acceptance of responsibility.however,the court did not award the reduction under b because the government did not file a motion recommending such a reduction.beatty claims that because he entered a timely guilty plea and because the government did not engage in any trial preparation,the government did not have any legitimate rationale for withholding the motion for a reduction.beatty also claims that his sentence of months,the of the guideline range that applied in his case,is unreasonable.for the reasons set forth below,we reject both claims and affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.
on four occasions in february and march,beatty sold cocaine base to an undercover dea agent.on a fifth occasion in may,the undercover agent arranged another transaction with beatty and agents arrested him before the transaction was completed.beatty was subsequently indicted by a federal grand jury for one count of distribution of cocaine base,in violation of a,and three counts of distribution of more than grams of cocaine base,in violation of a,b b iii on august,the government filed an information pursuant to,notifying beatty that the enhanced penalties under b would apply due to prior felony drug convictions in and.after lengthy negotiations with the government,beatty pleaded guilty,without a plea agreement,to all four counts on may.
during the plea colloquy,beatty objected to the government summary of the factual basis for each of the charges,stating that he was not admitting either to weight or to the substance being crack.he stated that he would only admit to the substance being cocaine base.the court determined,provisionally,that the weight and identity of the substance as crack were relevant only to sentencing.as such,the court allowed the plea to proceed and reserved those issues for resolution during the sentencing hearing.the court stated that if the government,upon reconsideration,moved to vacate the plea on the ground that the defendant had not sufficiently admitted to the factual basis for the charges,the court would revisit the issue.
later in the plea colloquy,the court addressed the prior convictions set forth in the information.first,beatty agreed that he was the same person who had been convicted on august,of cocaine trafficking and on august,of conspiracy to traffic cocaine.beatty then denied that he was the same person who was convicted in of conspiracy to traffic cocaine.after conferring with his attorney,beatty next objected to the treatment of the two convictions as separate convictions.the following exchange ensued 
court all right.i guess answer to that is effect this is going to have on your sentence,that is 
beatty no,it because 
court one pleading or two is going to be up to your lawyer to argue and for me ultimately to decide.
beatty the only 
court i trying to figure out now do you admit that you were convicted on these two different occasions of this offense 
beatty yes,your honor.
court all right.and then you deny that you were convicted on the offense,right 
beatty oh,yes,your honor.that was conspiracy,correct 
beatty yes,your honor.
following this exchange,the court informed beatty that any formal challenge to the convictions identified in the filing would have to be made prior to sentencing.
in its initial presentence report psr,the probation office found that beatty was responsible for grams of cocaine base which would result in a base offense level bol of.see c.this calculation was superceded,however,by beatty career offender status under the guidelines.see id.b.based on a statutory maximum sentence of years beatty bol was thus.see id.the psr then deducted two levels from the bol for acceptance of responsibility under a,producing a total offense level tol of.the probation office noted that the government had advised that it would not file a motion for a further reduction under b because of beatty refusal to accept responsibility for distributing the crack form of cocaine base in amounts exceeding five grams.based on a tol of and beatty career offender criminal history category of vi,the psr calculated beatty guideline sentencing range gsr to be months.
beatty objected to all references to crack cocaine in the psr and objected to the calculation of his sentence with reference to the guidelines applicable to cocaine base,a substance defined by the sentencing guidelines to include only crack cocaine.see c cmt.d beatty also objected to the government refusal to move for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,noting that he had entered a timely guilty plea and that the government had not engaged in trial preparation.beatty did not contest the conviction in any written submission.
the government objected to the probation officer conclusion that beatty was entitled to any adjustment for acceptance of responsibility because,in its view,beatty had frivolously contested that the drugs at issue were crack,the drug weight,and the conviction described in the information.in its sentencing memorandum,the government further contended that,because beatty had falsely denied the conviction while under oath,a increase for obstruction of justice,pursuant to,was warranted.the government calculated the applicable gsr at months.
prior to the sentencing hearing,the government invested significant time and resources in gathering evidence to establish the drug type and weight and the authenticity of beatty conviction.the government prepared transcripts of the phone calls between the undercover agent and beatty,which provided some evidence that the substance he sold was crack because beatty had described his technique for cooking the drugs.the government also worked with the undercover agent to prepare a detailed affidavit recounting the details of the transactions to show that the substance involved was crack cocaine.the undercover agent was also prepared to testify orally at the sentencing hearing.the government also had the drugs analyzed by a forensic chemist who prepared a report concluding that,based on their appearance,the drugs were crack cocaine and setting forth the drug weights.the government further expended resources to confirm that beatty was the person named in the conviction,including arranging for a fingerprint expert to be available to testify at the sentencing hearing.
at the sentencing hearing,the court reviewed the written evidence presented by the government and heard arguments from both parties as to drug type and weight the court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the substance at issue was,in fact,crack cocaine,a form of cocaine base and that the drug weights involved as to counts,and,which were grams,grams and grams,respectively,all exceed grams.turning to the conviction,the government stated that just prior to the hearing beatty had informed the government that he was retracting his challenge to the conviction beatty counsel stated that beatty apparent denial of the conviction at the plea colloquy was due to confusion.the court had asked a series of questions calling for an affirmative answer and then asked an additional question calling for a negative answer.counsel contended that beatty was simply confused by the exchange and had not intended to deny the conviction.further,counsel argued that the denial was immaterial because beatty had admitted to the convictions and only one prior drug conviction is required to invoke the enhanced penalty provisions of b c the court then found that the conviction belonged to beatty.
the court next turned to the acceptance of responsibility reduction under.the court stated that it would grant beatty the reduction under a,but it would not award the third level pursuant to b because there was no government motion.the court explained 
it seems to me that the government certainly can take the position that it not going to move the third level under b if the defendant requires it to be put to a lot of trouble by contesting facts that ought not genuinely to be in dispute that is to say,i not finding that the defendant frivolously contested these issues,and,therefore,am awarding the second level,but i also understand that the government in good faith could take a contrary view having required its agents and experts and so forth to come to court and be put to a considerable amount of trouble.
i guess what i saying is i do find a due process violation by the part of the government if it taking the position that the defendant did falsely deny these facts,and i going to leave it there.
the court then calculated beatty gsr at months.the government recommended a sentence of months.the court heard from beatty counsel,who advocated for a sentence due to beatty age and military service,and from beatty,who spoke of his struggles to succeed in the face of racism.the court concluded that these considerations were outweighed by other factors under a,including the seriousness of the offense and beatty repeated convictions for the same crime.accordingly,the court imposed a guideline sentence of months.the instant appeal ensued.
this case presents an issue of first impression in this circuit regarding the effect of a congressional amendment to the federal sentencing guidelines governing reductions for acceptance of responsibility.see prosecutorial remedies and tools against the exploitation of children today act of protect act,stat.b.under the prior version of b,a defendant who had received a reduction for general acceptance of responsibility under a and whose offense level was or greater,was entitled to receive an additional reduction if he had timely notif ied authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty,thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently.we held that this guideline provision did not confer any discretion on the sentencing judge to deny the extra reduction so long as the subsection stated requirements were satisfied.united states talladino,cir.we further held that a defendant decision to contest matters solely related to sentencing would not disqualify him from the b reduction.see united states cunningham,cir characterizing forfeitures as elements of the sentence,rather than a part of the criminal offense itself and holding that the district court erred in relying on the defendant refusal to accept forfeiture allegations to deny him the b decrease.however,in congress amended the text of b to read 
if the defendant qualifies for a decrease under subsection a,the offense level determined prior to the operation of subsection a is level or greater,and upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty,thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently,decrease the offense level by additional level.
emphasis added.
every other circuit that has considered this revised provision has characterized the amendment as making the award of a b reduction contingent on the government decision to file a motion requesting the reduction.see united states drennon,cir united states newson,cir,cert.denied,d united states,cir united states gunn,cir unpublished,cert.denied,d united states chase,cir united states sloley,cir,cert.denied,d united states,cir united states,cir united states wattree,cir united states smith,cir.we join them in holding that the revised provision gives the government to its discretion under the substantial assistance provision of the guidelines,see wade united states,d describing prosecutorial discretion under to determine whether to file a such a motion.under this standard,a defendant who challenges the prosecutor refusal to file a motion under the revised b must show that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive or was not rationally related to any legitimate government end,at quoting wade,at,at t he defendant must present objective evidence of an improper motive on the part of the government.
both the government and beatty agree that the language in is analogous to the revised text of b and that the standard adopted in wade should be extended to the review of the government decision to withhold a motion under b.section provides that u pon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense,the court may depart from the guidelines.both provisions condition adjustment on the government decision to file a motion.the supreme court has explained that serves as a limit on the sentencing court authority to adjust the guideline calculation.wade,at.on the other hand,the provision confers on the prosecutor nearly unfettered discretion to determine whether to move for the adjustment,based on a rational assessment of the cost and benefit that would flow from moving.id.at.thus,the court held that gives the government a power,not a duty,to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.id.at.put differently,the court explained that although a showing of assistance is a necessary condition for relief under,it is not a sufficient one.id.at.
following wade,we have held that f or the most part,the government has unbridled discretion in deciding whether to file such a motion.united states sandoval,cir.the government discretion is constrained in only two situations 
the first involves cases in which the government failure to move for a substantial assistance departure is based on some constitutionally impermissible factor say,race or religion,or is not rationally related to some legitimate government end.the second involves cases in which the government explicitly undertakes to make,or to consider making,such a motion.
id.at quoting wade,at.internal citation omitted.beatty agrees that this standard now applies to our review of the government discretion under the revised acceptance of responsibility provision.he attempts to meet this standard by asserting that the only legitimate government end that the government may consider in exercising its discretion under b is the avoidance of trial preparation.thus,he contends that the government decision to withhold the motion in his case,where no trial preparation took place,was not rationally related to a legitimate government end.relying on our case law,he argues that t he touchstone of b is trial preparation,not sentencing issues.in effect,he claims that entering a timely guilty plea so as to permit the government to avoid preparing for trial is both a necessary and a sufficient condition for receiving the reduction.
this highly circumscribed definition of legitimate government end is wholly inconsistent with the plain language of the revised provision,which,like its analogue in,creates a power,not a duty to move for a reduction.if the government were required to move for the reduction when the defendant enters a timely plea,thereby saving the government the expense of trial preparation,the amended language requiring that the government file a motion would be a nullity.such a holding would effectively reinstate the version of by rendering entitlement to the motion automatic if the defendant received the reduction under a and entered a timely plea.
beatty avers that this is the appr
