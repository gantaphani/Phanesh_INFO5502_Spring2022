defendant norman hsu was indicted on several counts each of mail fraud,in violation of wire fraud,in violation of and campaign finance fraud,in violation of and d a.on may,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york victor marrero,hsu pled guilty to the mail and wire fraud counts,all of which relate to a ponzi scheme that defrauded victims of tens of millions of dollars from at least until.he was then convicted after trial by jury of the campaign finance fraud counts.the district court sentenced hsu to a guidelines sentence of months in prison for both the ponzi scheme and campaign finance crimes.
on appeal,hsu challenges his guilty plea,conviction,and sentence.first,he argues that two of the ten counts to which he pled guilty were barred by the statute of limitations.second,he challenges,for the first time on appeal,the admission of certain testimony regarding his ponzi scheme and other criminal activity at his trial for violating campaign finance laws.third,with respect to his sentence,hsu argues that the district court miscalculated the loss attributable to his ponzi scheme failed to consider or appropriately weigh mitigating factors regarding,inter alia,his remorse and mental health and violated his sixth amendment rights by failing to appoint new counsel for sentencing.
we affirm the district court in all respects,and hold that hsu waived any statute of limitations challenge to the indictment by pleading guilty the district court admission of the ponzi scheme evidence was not plain error the district court did not err by calculating the intended loss amount under the guidelines to include the loss of putative profits that victims reinvested in hsu ponzi scheme the district court did not abuse its discretion when weighing the factors relevant to hsu sentence and under the circumstances of this case,the appointment of a new attorney for sentencing was not required.
background 
in view of the defendant convictions,we summarize the facts in the light most favorable to the government.united states riggi,cir.
in or before,hsu devised a scheme whereby he invited investment in two entities that he purported to lead as managing director components and next components the companies.hsu told investors that the companies were engaged in the lucrative and business of providing financing to small,retail companies.in fact,there was no such business,as there were no such companies hsu had invented them as the seemingly legitimate front for what turned out to be a ponzi scheme.
hsu scheme was a variation on the familiar fraud.see cunningham brown.describing the remarkable criminal financial career of charles ponzi.in a typical ponzi scheme,the schemer will use the investments of new and existing customers to fund withdrawals of principal and supposed profit made by other customers.in re bernard madoff inv.sec.llc,cir madoff.hsu variation was to provide investors with checks issued by one of the companies in the amount of the investor principal plus a guaranteed return on that investment,usually,on an annualized basis,of.sometimes investors would immediately cash the checks when they became due.frequently,though,they would roll over their investment,thereby reinvesting the original principal plus accumulated gains in anticipation of further returns that would accrue during the next cycle.
in,hsu fraudulent activities expanded to the world of campaign finance,specifically in his connection to campaigns for candidates for the presidency and both houses of the congress.hsu became a bundler on behalf of several prominent candidates.a bundler is a donor who has given the maximum legal amount to a preferred candidate and convinces friends to do likewise,channeling the bundle of donations to the candidate campaign.hsu was a legitimate bundler in some instances,but in others he committed fraud by recruiting straw donors,or individuals recruited to donate to campaigns only to be reimbursed by hsu after the fact.
hsu investment and campaign schemes overlapped.he used political connections created by his campaign fundraising to create an appearance of legitimacy useful in recruiting victims to his investment scam,and used the illusions of successful investments to recruit his investors as campaign donors.six of the ten government witnesses testified that they both invested in hsu various deals and made donations to various candidates at hsu behest,and that hsu subsequently reimbursed them for their donations.
hsu various schemes ended when he was arrested in september on an outstanding california warrant for absconding after pleading nolo contendere to charges in connection with an earlier,unrelated criminal scheme after his arrest was widely reported in the press,his investors rushed to cash the last postdated checks they had received,most of which were returned for insufficient funds.when the panic surrounding hsu arrest made it impossible to attract new capital infusions from current or future investors,the scheme collapsed.see madoff,at see also eberhard marcu,cir describing typical ponzi scheme where earlier investors are paid from the investments of more recent investors until the scheme ceases to attract new investors and the pyramid collapses.the ensuing investigation revealed the extent of hsu scheme,including his various campaign finance frauds.the checks held by hsu victims totaled more than million the net losses to the investors as a class amounted to more than million.
ii.district court proceedings 
on december,hsu was indicted on fourteen counts.counts one through five charged instances of mail fraud in connection with the ponzi scheme,including one transaction that occurred in.counts six through ten charged wire fraud crimes in connection to the same scheme,including one count associated with the same transaction.counts eleven through fourteen charged various violations of campaign finance laws.
on the eve of trial,hsu pled guilty to the ponzi scheme counts,without a plea agreement.immediately following the allocution,the government asked the court to allow testimony from hsu ponzi scheme victims at the trial of the remaining campaign finance fraud charges.initially,the district court expressed some concern regarding this request,stating its inclination to say that if you have more than a couple of witnesses,it may be excessive.if all you are trying to bring in is federal rule of evidence b evidence from victims,then more than a handful would not be necessary.hsu counsel agreed that it is appropriate for evidence to come in as to the ponzi scheme as it relates to why contributions were made and why contributions were made in a particular manner,but stated that he would object to witnesses testifying that there was a ponzi scheme going on and people were involved in it if it has no bearing on the issue of the political contributions.the government clarified that it would call four such witnesses.the government argued that this testimony was relevant to show motive,because the straw donations were orchestrated by the defendant so that people would invest in the ponzi scheme.in other words,hsu used his campaign activities to entice investors to participate in his scheme.hsu did not object to the testimony,either during the pretrial discussion or subsequently at trial.the court agreed conceptually that the government proposed testimony would be admissible,but specifically warned against the risk of creating undue prejudice by calling the proverbial little old ladies who would testify in tears regarding their losses.
four of the ten witnesses who testified at trial yau cheng,martin waters,steven kwon,and nicole chorvat were victims but not political contributors.in addition to testimony regarding the nature of the ponzi scheme,these witnesses also mentioned aspects of hsu lavish lifestyle and explained how they learned of hsu california conviction.
the testimony of those witnesses revealed a weakness in the government theory of a connection between the ponzi scheme and hsu political activity,in that three of the four witnesses cheng,waters,and kwon had invested in hsu scheme before they knew of his involvement in politics.although hsu attorney never objected to the inclusion of this testimony,the district court sua sponte expressed concern that each witness had 
given pretty much the same story concerning their investment into the p onzi scheme,their making a contribution at hsu request.but each of them has indicated that he did not ask them to reimburse them,in fact.so,so far,this is all background.my concern is that if this is all you going to continue to bring in,it going to be cumulative,and if you do start connecting the dots between that and violations of the campaign laws,i do see where this is going.
after the government explained that the next witness,chorvat,would testify that hsu political connections served to cement her trust in hsu,the district court allowed the testimony,but instructed the government that it would have to make an extraordinary case for more such testimony.after chorvat testimony,the jury heard no other ponzivictim witnesses.
the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all four counts of campaign finance fraud.soon after the verdict,hsu began writing letters to the court expressing dissatisfaction with his retained trial counsel.his causes for dissatisfaction included woefully inadequate filings including failed motions for the appointment of a receiver who would calculate the extent of the losses and general ineffective representation at trial that stemmed from counsel overall defense strategy.in his letters,hsu requested the appointment of new counsel for proceedings.the district court denied those requests.
iii.sentencing 
prior to sentencing,hsu expressed remorse,outlined his contributions to society,and argued that his history of depression all militated against a harsh sentence.he also argued that the proper estimate of loss was the amount of restitution that hsu owed his victims,or the aggregated losses of the losing investors.
the government disagreed in all respects,arguing that hsu conduct could not be mitigated either by his previous or ongoing good deeds or his recently diagnosed depression.the government also argued that the losses associated with hsu scheme were between million and million.the government arrived at this figure by adding the total amounts reflected on the faces of all outstanding checks held by hsu investors,then subtracting from that total the return that the final round of checks promised to pay.
the district court agreed for the most part with the government.the court found that hsu pleas for leniency were not uncommon in criminal contexts where defendants lead a double life of outward rectitude while simultaneously engaging in criminal activity.the district court also dismissed hsu claims that his recently diagnosed depression warranted a downward departure in sentencing,rejecting as incredible the argument that hsu depression caused his crimes.with respect to the loss calculation,the district court credited the government theory of loss,finding that the very method by which hsu was able to perpetuate his fraudulent scheme depended on his ability to inflate the perceived earnings year after year,as part of a malicious effort to maintain their confidence and lure other victims.finding a guidelines range of months,the district court sentenced hsu to months on each of the ten mail and wire fraud counts,to run concurrently with each other,and months on each of the four of the campaign finance counts,to run concurrently to each other but consecutive to the mail and wire fraud counts.the entire sentence of months was made to run concurrently with his previous california sentence of months.
discussion 
on appeal,hsu challenges his guilty plea to the ponzi scheme,his conviction after jury trial for his violations of campaign finance laws,and his sentence for both.
guilty plea statute of limitations 
in a supplemental pro se brief not endorsed by his appellate counsel,hsu contests his conviction on counts one and six,the charges relating to the transaction,arguing that the statute of limitations had run on those counts and that he therefore could not plead guilty to them however,i t is well settled that a defendant plea of guilty admits all of the elements of a formal criminal charge,and,in the absence of a reservation of issues for appeal,waives all challenges to the prosecution except those going to the court jurisdiction.hayle united states,cir internal citation omitted.it is also well established that the running of the limitations period does not defeat jurisdiction.united states walsh,cir.thus,assuming arguendo that,at the time of the indictment,the limitations period had run on two of the counts,hsu plea of guilty waived the defense.
ii.trial evidentiary arguments 
hsu also challenges the admission at trial of evidence relating to his ponzi scheme and california convictions.because hsu did not raise this objection before the trial court,we review it for plain error.see united states edwards,cir.this standard gives us discretion to correct an error not raised at trial only where the appellant demonstrates that there is an error the error is clear or obvious,rather than subject to reasonable dispute the error affected the appellant substantial rights,which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings and the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states marcus,d internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.
hsu argument fails to satisfy this standard.the admission of the challenged evidence,if error at all,was certainly not plain error affecting hsu substantial right s.e.
under federal rule of evidence b,evidence of a defendant crime s,wrong s,or other act s is not admissible to prove a person character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.in other words,evidence that a defendant committed crimes beyond those presented to the jury is not admissible to show that the defendant is a bad person who is therefore likely to be guilty of the crimes charged.
but the rule does not flatly prohibit the admission of such evidence.to the contrary,the rule expressly allows the receipt of evidence of other crimes for a variety of other purposes.see.b making such evidence admissible for another purpose,such as proving motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,absence of mistake,or lack of accident.we have previously adopted the inclusionary rule that other crimes evidence is admissible for any purpose for which it is relevant,except to support the prohibited inferences of bad character or propensity to commit crimes.see,united states laflam,cir.moreover,we have emphasized that evidence of criminal behavior may be admissible as direct evidence of the crime charged if it arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,if it is inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,or if it is necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.united states carboni,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
here,the government offered a legitimate rationale for the relevance of the evidence of hsu ponzi scheme at the trial of the campaign finance fraud charges.the government argued that the evidence was admissible because hsu schemes were connected the evidence could be read by a jury as suggesting that hsu used his ponzi investors as a source of campaign contributions,and used the connections to politicians to burnish his reputation for respectability so as to recruit and reassure potential investors.while not every witness who testified about how her investment was directly linked to the campaign finance scheme,several of them expressly noted these connections.
there is thus no question that the evidence was relevant.mere relevance,however,is not sufficient to guarantee admissibility of evidence of a defendant other bad acts or indeed,of any evidence.even relevant evidence may be excluded,subject to the discretion of the district court,when its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice,which is particularly important in connection with evidence of oth
