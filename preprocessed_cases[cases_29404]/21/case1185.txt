background 
defendant thomas cramer was charged in a indictment with three counts of sex trafficking of a minor,in violation of a and b,and two counts of sex trafficking of a minor,in violation of a,a,and b.
at the plea hearing,cramer entered a guilty plea as to the first four counts.there were four minor girls victims,respectively involved in the conduct that provided the basis for the guilty pleas to counts.cramer admitted to recruiting and enticing these girls to engage in commercial sex acts.
on february,at the sentencing hearing,the parties agreed to certain modifications of the calculation in the presentence investigation report psr,but maintained their disagreement as to other issues.the district court adopted,inter alia,a enhancement under guidelines section b on each count for use of a computer in the commission of a sex offense.the district court calculated a guidelines range of months to life in prison,based on an offense level of and a criminal history category of vi.
after considering the submissions,each of the relevant sentencing factors,and the parties statements at sentencing,the district court imposed a concurrent sentence of months imprisonment on each of the four counts.this appeal followed the timely march,filing of a notice of appeal.
discussion 
on appeal,cramer challenges the district court sentence as procedurally unreasonable.he contends that the district court erred in applying a enhancement under guidelines section b to each count of conviction for use of a computer in the commission of a sex offense.
when reviewing a sentence for reasonableness,we apply a deferential standard.united states conca,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a district court commits procedural error where it fails to calculate or improperly calculates the sentencing guidelines range,treats the sentencing guidelines as mandatory,fails to consider the a factors,selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or fails adequately to explain the chosen sentence.united states robinson,cir.however,w here we identify procedural error in a sentence,but the record indicates clearly that the district court would have imposed the same sentence in any event,the error may be deemed harmless,avoiding the need to vacate the sentence and to remand the case for resentencing.united states jass,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
this court reviews a district court application of the guidelines de novo,while factual determinations underlying a district court guidelines calculation are reviewed for clear error.conca,at.while a district court must make findings with sufficient clarity to permit meaningful appellate review,united states skys,cir,this obligation may be satisfied by explicitly adopt ing the factual findings set forth in a defendant presentence report,united states malki,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a finding of fact is clearly erroneous only if,after reviewing all of the evidence,this court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson city of bessemer city,d internal quotation marks omitted.
section b of the guidelines provides 
if the offense involved the use of a computer or an interactive computer service to a persuade,induce,entice,coerce,or facilitate the travel of,the minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct or b entice,encourage,offer,or solicit a person to engage in prohibited sexual conduct with the minor,increase by levels.
for ease of reference,we label guidelines section b a as the subsection,or subsection b a,and guidelines section b b as the solicitation subsection,or subsection b b.
application note to guidelines section refers to subsection b and states that this subsection is intended to apply only to the use of a computer or an interactive computer service to communicate directly with a minor or with a person who exercises custody,care,or supervisory control of the minor,application note.further,the note offers an example of conduct that falls outside the scope of subsection b the use of a computer to obtain airline tickets for the minor from an airline internet site.id.but the application note does not acknowledge or differentiate between the and solicitation subsections.
when calculating cramer guidelines offense level,the district court applied a enhancement under subsection b a for victims and and under subsection b b for victims and.cramer challenges both sets of enhancements.cramer challenges the application of subsection b a for three reasons that,as to victim,the district court clearly erred in finding that he contacted the victim online,when he claims that he instead had a personal relationship with her that,as to victim,even accepting that he first contacted her online,his conduct did not meet the guidelines standard as a matter of law because he did not actually entice her to engage in prohibited sexual conduct by computer and that,as to victim,his conduct did not meet the guidelines standard as a matter of law because he did not actually entice her to engage in prohibited sexual conduct by computer,did not know that she was underage until after he ceased computer communications,and did not use a computer,as is required for purposes of this subsection,when he exchanged text messages with her.as for subsection b b,cramer contends that,as to both victims and,application note to guidelines section precludes application of the enhancement because he communicated only with potential customers,and not directly with a minor or with a person who exercises custody,care,or supervisory control of the minor.id,application note.we consider his arguments in turn.

count challenge to factual findings 
cramer first argues that the district court erred in finding that cramer met victim on the fact that served as the basis for the enhancement on this count.we find that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the district court finding.to the extent that cramer disputes that he did not communicate with victim by computer,his statements at his plea colloquy contradict this assertion,as do interviews with others during the psr investigation.the district court factual findings were therefore not clearly erroneous.
count challenge to legal sufficiency of facts underlying enhancement 
next,cramer argues that the evidence that he began communicating with victim by computer does not suffice to justify the enhancement under subsection b a.the legal issue at the heart of this dispute is whether the enhancement under guidelines section b a can apply to a defendant who begins communicating by computer with a minor,but entices that minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct only through other modes of communication.the question is one of first impression in this circuit.
