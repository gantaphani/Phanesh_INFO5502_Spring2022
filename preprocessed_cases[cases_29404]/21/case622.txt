the issue the parties have framed on this appeal is whether,where the district court adjusts a prior sentence to account for cooperation by the defendant,the adjustment may reflect factors other than that cooperation.we sustain the district court disposition of this case but on a narrower ground,deferring until necessary the larger may arise only rarely and implicates a difficult and delicate issue of statutory construction.
the defendant,jonathan poland,was eighteen years and three months old when he and his old cousin who was just shy of his eighteenth birthday made and detonated two pipe bombs during the spring of.poland was indicted and convicted of unlawfully possessing an unregistered destructive device,d,f,and use of an explosive to maliciously damage or destroy property used in interstate commerce,i.
the explosion caused little damage but was close to a truck stop office and fuel of various kinds and so was no minor prank.poland was sentenced to months imprisonment,the three months over and above the mandatory minimum sentence of months being added because he committed perjury during a suppression hearing.poland appealed,but later withdrew the appeal and cooperated with the government.
the cooperation led to successful government proceedings against poland cousin but,the matter having begun with a juvenile charge,the cousin received a sentence of only three months.after poland cooperated,the government moved to reduce poland sentence to months.b.poland sought a sentence below months,arguing that all of the ordinary statutory factors could be considered afresh,see a,and stressing the much longer sentence he received compared to his cousin.
at a hearing on the motion,the district judge asked the parties to address the impact of new language in rule b.under precedents construing former versions,sentencing courts may consider only the extent of the cooperation given in calculating the reduced sentence.the district court noted that both the rule new language and an advisory committee note suggested that on any of the factors identified in a could now be considered.the pertinent language of the respective changes appears below.
in the end,the district court held that to so read the new rule would work a substantive change and violate the rules enabling act,a.united states poland,d.to avoid this outcome,the district court followed precedent under the old rule and held that the new rule b limit s the judge,as before the amendment,to consider only substantial assistance factors in support of the amount of a reduction,notwithstanding the amendment and the advisory committee note.id.at.
the government recommendation did not bind the district court,which concluded that a reduction to months properly accounted for the cooperation provided by poland.however,the court said that were it free to consider factors other than particular the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,a it would reduce poland sentence to months.id.at.
poland now appeals,arguing that under the current rule b,the judge was free once the motion was made to consider factors other than cooperation in reducing the sentence.we have jurisdiction over the appeal,united states mcandrews,cir and,as the issue is whether the district court misinterpreted governing law,review is de novo and our authority to provide it is clear despite a circuit split that might matter if the issue were not purely legal 
the merits of the legal issue,to which we now turn,require a precise understanding of how rule b evolved.before the sentencing guidelines,rule b permitted a sentencing judge to reduce a sentence,more or less without condition,within days of the sentence or disposition of any appeal.this open ended approach was substantially altered by the sentencing reform act of,title ii,stat.the reform act,which adopted a framework for sentencing guidelines that aimed at restricting the discretion of judges in initial sentencing.
consonantly,the reform act limited the judge authority to alter a final sentence,confining it to three categories,c,of which only one directly concerns us.it reads 
the court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except that 
in any case 
b the court may modify an imposed term of imprisonment to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure 
the reform act also rewrote rule b to provide 
the court,on motion of the government,may within one year after the imposition of a sentence,lower a sentence to reflect a defendant subsequent,substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense,in accordance with the guidelines and policy statements issued by the sentencing commission 
reform act of,b emphasis added.
before the reform act became effective in,congress again added provisions to both and to rule,which furnished the district court authority,in both initial sentencing and,to impose sentences below prescribed statutory minimums based on a government substantial assistance motion,abuse act of,title i,stat.but we defer discussion of those changes.
given the underscored language of rule b as amended by the reform act to reflect a defendant subsequent,substantial assistance other circuit courts unsurprisingly concluded that only the defendant substantial assistance could be considered in granting or measuring a rule b reduction,united states,cir.this circuit and other circuits similarly construed parallel language in the statute that permits a sentence below a statutory minimum to reflect substantial assistance,united states ahlers,cir.
in,in the rules to improve clarity,the advisory committee proposed a stylistic change to rule b,excising the language that required that a reduced sentence reflect a defendant substantial assistance.advisory committee note,amendments.instead,the text provided only that reducing the sentence accord with the sentencing commission guidelines and policy statements.
in fact,neither before nor after has the commission adopted guidelines or policy statements directed to reductions based on substantial assistance.there has been from the outset a general guideline provision,not using reflect language,for guideline departures based on substantial assistance,seemingly directed to original sentencing.this circuit,and other courts,read this guideline as implicitly incorporating such a requirement.united states chestna,cir,cert.denied,d.
despite the elision,the few circuits to address the issue continued to read rule b as limiting reductions to factors,united states dobson,wl at cir,unpublished united states lindsay,cir unpublished,cert.denied,d.precedent is limited because many circuits limit a defendant ability to appeal decisions on rule b motions,haskins,at.
the next step in the chronology was the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,making the guidelines advisory rather than mandatory to save them from constitutional invalidity.thereafter,apparently believing that booker required this change,the advisory committee recommended deletion of rule b then existing requirement that a sentence reduction accord with the sentencing commission guidelines and policy statements,and the deletion was adopted through the rules process effective december.
rule b now reads in relevant part,and so read when the district court considered the government motion in this case,as follows 
upon the government motion made within one year of sentencing,the court may reduce a sentence if the defendant,after sentencing,provided substantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.
if this language alone were considered,poland might well plausibly argue that a court could,in granting a substantial assistance motion,consider other factors and not just substantial assistance in setting the new sentence.
this is so even though the language changes that produced the present rule resulted from two apparent mistakes.the first is the advisory committee belief that deleting the limiting reflect language from rule b in was mere clarification t
