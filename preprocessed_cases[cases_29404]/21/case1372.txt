defendants appellants antonio and herman quinones appeal from judgments of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york block,entered on october and november,following a jury trial,convicting herman quinones herman of distribution of controlled substances,and convicting antonio quinones antonio of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute controlled substances,distribution of controlled substances,and money laundering conspiracy.this appeal calls upon us to decide whether any error in giving a conscious avoidance jury instruction was prejudicial to the defendants and thus warranted a new trial,and under united states santos,the government must prove that the laundered funds at issue in this case were the profits,rather than merely the gross revenues,of antonio prescription drug sales enterprise as set forth below,we hold that any error in instructing the jury on a conscious avoidance theory was not prejudicial to the defendants because there was overwhelming evidence presented at trial that the defendants knew or reasonably should have known that the doctors and pharmacists upon whom they relied were acting in bad faith.we further hold that santos,as applied to the sale of contraband,permits a conviction for money laundering conspiracy even absent proof that the laundered funds were profits,and accordingly affirm antonio conviction on this count.for the reasons stated herein and in the accompanying summary order,the judgments of the district court are affirmed.
background 
the facts of this case are largely undisputed.the evidence at trial showed that antonio entered the internet pharmacy business in,when he purchased prescriptions travel,a pharmacy that filled prescriptions for an internet pharmacy known as rx networks.vincent chhabra,an internet pharmacy entrepreneur,owned rx networks.antonio later hired steven mahana,a website developer,to copy chhabra website design and the system that chhabra used to manage medication orders.
antonio operation worked as follows an internet user who searched for a prescription medication would be directed by a search engine to antonio website.once at the website,the customer would select his drug and provide payment information and delivery instructions.the customer would also fill out a brief medical questionnaire,which asked the customer for his name,gender,weight,allergies,current medications,reason for requesting the medication,and known medical conditions.the questionnaire was the same regardless of whether a drug required a prescription.the customer order then would be transmitted to a doctor module,whereby the questionnaire would be reviewed by a doctor who would approve or disapprove the order.antonio selected the doctors who reviewed the questionnaires and approved orders made on his websites.the doctors,who were paid per questionnaire reviewed,often reviewed over a hundred applications per day.once a doctor approved an order,it would be transmitted to a licensed physical pharmacy controlled by antonio that filled the prescription.antonio pharmacies typically filled one thousand orders per day and shipped the ordered medications to customers by federal express.
antonio system permitted no interaction whatsoever between a doctor and a customer.in fact,mahana placed a disclaimer on his invoices to antonio stating that the system did not provide a sufficient basis to establish a relationship between a doctor and a patient in order to prescribe medication.moreover,the system provided few safeguards against substance abuse.for example,some customers were able to obtain excessive amounts of medications by placing orders to the same address using different names.others were able to receive drugs even though they did not provide all of the information required by the questionnaire.
mahana,who built to thirty websites for antonio,referred to antonio network of websites as the administrative a piece of software that is designed to control all aspects of the website or multiple websites.gov t app.through the,antonio controlled,among other things,the approval of prescription medication orders even without the involvement of physicians.as administrator of the system,he had access to detailed reports about operation of his websites and the manner in which prescriptions were filled.antonio used the also to charge a filling fee for each prescription,a referral fee for access to doctors,and a per accepted order fee for each order received by an affiliate of his network.antonio son,herman,filled orders for his father websites and ran his father internet pharmacy customer service call center.eventually,herman obtained his own website.com,which was connected to the.
moreover,antonio used corporations,owned by relatives and friends,to buy medicine from wholesalers,receive payments from affiliated websites,and manage the customer service call center for his internet pharmacies.he used a company known as my rainbow marketing my rainbow,which was nominally owned by his,susana mendez,to buy medicine from wholesale pharmaceutical distributors and to bill websites for medications that antonio supplied and the filling fees that he charged.defense counsel conceded in summation that my rainbow was in fact controlled by antonio.in addition,thundergames,a corporation owned by antonio friend,was the legal entity that ran the customer call center for antonio websites.
in november,chhabra was arrested and charged with illegal distribution of controlled substances.immediately following chhabra arrest,antonio stopped using prescriptions travel to fill orders for his websites and took steps to liquidate its assets.he began using a new filling pharmacy,innovative remedies,which was located in florida.in the following months,however,antonio learned that a proposed change in florida law would require contact between a physician and patient,so he moved his filling pharmacy to queens.antonio continued to move his operations to new locations as law enforcement raided or shuttered his filling pharmacies.in all,antonio used approximately a dozen different pharmacies to fill prescription orders.
in december,antonio and herman were indicted on three counts conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute schedule iii and iv controlled substances without valid prescriptions through the internet in violation of a and,distribution of schedule iii and iv controlled substances in violation of a,and money laundering conspiracy in violation of a a i,a b i,and h.at the close of the government case,the defendants moved pursuant to rule to dismiss the third count based upon the supreme court holding in united states santos.the district court denied that motion.over defense counsel objection,the court instructed the jury on a conscious avoidance theory in connection with the knowledge requirement of the unlawful distribution of controlled substances counts the jury found antonio guilty on all counts.it found herman guilty of distribution of controlled substances.the district court sentenced antonio and herman principally to terms of imprisonment of and eighteen months,respectively.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,the defendants argue that they are entitled to a new trial on the ground that the district court improperly instructed the jury on a conscious avoidance theory.antonio argues also that his conviction of money laundering conspiracy must be reversed on the ground that the government was required to prove the laundered funds at issue in this case were the profits,rather than merely the gross revenues,of his prescription drug sales enterprise.
conscious avoidance 
we turn first to the defendants argument that the conscious avoidance charge was improper.a conscious avoidance instruction permits a jury to find that a defendant had culpable knowledge of a fact when the evidence shows that the defendant intentionally avoided confirming the fact.united states ferrarini,f d,cir see also united states gabriel,cir a instruction is appropriate when a defendant claims to lack some specific aspect of knowledge necessary to conviction but where the evidence may be construed as deliberate indifference.internal quotation marks omitted.
our analysis begins with the knowledge requirement of the distribution crime.a doctor may be convicted of unlawful distribution and dispensation of a controlled substance if his activities fall outside the usual course of professional practice.united states moore,see also a providing that a prescription for a controlled substance must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.a lay defendant likewise may be convicted of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance where the defendant relies upon a doctor prescription that he knows or reasonably should have known was invalid.see united states vamos,cir w hile those who assist practitioners in distributing controlled drugs clearly can not be held to the standard of a reasonable practitioner,they are not free to unreasonably rely on the judgment of their employers.thus,to convict the defendants of unlawful distribution of controlled substances,the jury must have found that they knew or reasonably should have known that the doctors and pharmacists were distributing controlled substances outside the usual course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose or,in other words,that these professionals acted in bad faith.id.
at oral argument,the defendants indeed conceded that because they claim to have relied upon the determinations of doctors and pharmacists,they could be convicted if the jury found that they were aware,or reasonably should have been aware,that the doctors and pharmacists were acting in bad faith.see vamos,at.the district court therefore correctly charged the jury that you must find the defendant not guilty unless the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the doctors and pharmacists were not acting in good faith.gov t app.emphasis added.
on appeal,the defendants argue that they are entitled to a new trial because there was an insufficient factual predicate for a conscious avoidance instruction and,in any event,the instruction was improperly worded.even if their contentions have merit,however,the salient question is whether any error would have been prejudicial to the defendants.see,united states aina marshall,cir.any error in giving a conscious avoidance instruction is harmless where there is overwhelming evidence that the defendants possessed the requisite knowledge.see id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the defendants rejoin that error is harmless only if the government has adduced overwhelming evidence of the defendants actual knowledge that the doctors and pharmacists were not acting in good faith,as indicated by united states kaiser,cir vacating conviction where there is a reasonable probability that the jury convicted kaiser on a conscious avoidance theory and that the jury would not have done so but for the instructional error.this case,however,is easily distinguishable from kaiser,where a conscious avoidance charge was erroneously presented as a basis upon which the jury could find knowledge of the existence of a fact where the defendant lack of actual belief in the existence of that fact would require acquittal,even if that belief were unreasonable.id.at.here,by contrast,the government requested and obtained a conscious avoidance charge as an alternative means of proving what defendant s knew or reasonably should have known.gov t app.emphasis added.unlike in kaiser,the defendants actual but unreasonable belief in the existence of a fact here,the doctors and pharmacists good faith could not absolve the defendants of culpability.at stating that actual belief would absolve kaiser of culpability,even if that actual belief were unreasonable or negligent.in other words,even if the jury found that the defendants actually believed that the doctors and pharmacists were acting in good faith,it still would convict if it found that their belief was unreasonable.
accordingly,the fundamental question here is whether the government adduced overwhelming evidence that the defendants knew or reasonably should have known that the doctors and pharmacists on whom they relied were acting in bad faith.upon our review of the record,we find overwhelming evidence that the defendants possessed the requisite knowledge in this case.
first of all,there is no dispute that the defendants were aware that their online pharmacy permitted no interaction whatsoever between a customer and a doctor.in fact,mahana placed a disclaimer on his invoices to antonio stating that the system did not provide a sufficient basis to establish a relationship between a doctor and a patient in order to prescribe medication.antonio,who controlled and monitored all aspects of his business through the,selected the doctors who reviewed customers questionnaires and approved orders made on his websites.the doctors,who were paid per questionnaire reviewed,often reviewed over a hundred applications per day,and antonio pharmacies typically filled one thousand orders per day.a pharmacist at one of antonio filling pharmacies testified that she was able to review only about of the one thousand orders that were filled daily and that she was the only pharmacist on duty 
moreover,antonio discussed with jack tomas,the owner of innovative remedies,a change in florida law prohibiting florida doctors from writing prescriptions without consultations with their patients.only days after the florida law was passed,antonio moved his filling pharmacy to queens.in the next three years,antonio moved his operations to more than ten different locations as law enforcement raided or shuttered his filling pharmacies.when law enforcement shut down one of antonio pharmacies in maryland,for example,an employee was directed to shred paper relating to its orders.gov t app.two weeks later,antonio abandoned the pharmacy for a new location after firing much of its staff.on another occasion,antonio instructed tomas to use an unlicensed location,the basement of a cent store known as the cave,as a temporary pharmacy after a local inspector visited one of antonio pharmacies.at trial,antonio testified that he instructed one of his pharmacists to lie to the authorities about how his operation was being conducted.
in,the government subpoenaed antonio for documents relating to the approximately orders he had filled for vincent chhabra website through prescription travel.when chhabra was arrested later that year for unlawful distribution of controlled substance medications,antonio emailed mahana a link to the news story.following chhabra arrest,antonio stopped using prescriptions travel to fill orders for his websites and took steps to liquidate its assets.at trial,antonio conceded that he used the same questionnaire and sold the same medications as chhabra.
between and,government agents advised certain people working for antonio that internet pharmacies like the defendants were illegal,and that information was relayed to antonio.in december,for example,tomas informed antonio that dea agents had provided him a notice stating that the online sale of prescription drugs was illegal.gov t app.in january,dea agents informed donald cooper,one of antonio associates,that it was illegal to sell controlled substances through an internet pharmacy.cooper relayed that information to antonio,who replied that i f anybody would get into trouble,it would be the pharmacists and the doctors.id.at.
several months later,in may,dea agents visited thundergames,which ran the call center for antonio websites,and advised two of antonio employees that internet pharmacies were illegal because they lacked a legitimate relationship.one of those employees,arianne pelegrin,relayed this information to antonio,who responded that there was nothing to worry about.id.at.antonio,however,thereafter moved thundergames accounting department to an office at a car dealership.a short time later,herman began running the customer service operation for his own pharmacy from the car dealership office space.
in these circumstances,we conclude that the government has adduced overwhelming evidence that the defendants knew or reasonably should have known that the doctors and pharmacists upon whom they purportedly relied were acting in bad faith.any actual belief to the contrary would have been unreasonable.thus,any error in giving a conscious avoidance instruction was not prejudicial to the defendants.
ii.the money laundering conviction 
we turn next to antonio challenge of his money laundering conviction.the federal money laundering statute makes it a crime to conduct a financial transaction knowing that the property involved in the transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity when the transaction in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity sua.a.under the promotional prong of this statute,id.a a i,the government must prove that the defendant engaged in a financial transaction involving sua proceeds with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity.under the concealment prong of the statute,id.a b i,the government must prove that the transaction is designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,the location,the source,the ownership,or the control of the proceeds of sua.the government asserts that it proved antonio culpability under both the promotion and concealment prongs.antonio responds that the evidence underlying his conviction is insufficient under united states santos,because the government proved only that the laundered funds were the gross revenues,rather than the profits,of an enterprise engaged in unlawful drug trafficking.we review his challenge de novo.see,united states mazza alaluf,cir.
in santos,the defendant,efrian santos,was convicted of running an illegal gambling business in violation of and of promotional money laundering and money laundering conspiracy in violation of a a i and h.santos ran an illegal lottery at bars and restaurants by employing runners,who took bets from gamblers and kept a percentage of each bet as a commission,and collectors,who received bets from the runners and relayed them to santos.the money laundering transaction at issue was santos use of the bets to pay the runners and collectors as well as the winners of the lottery.u.at.
in a fractured decision,the supreme court affirmed the seventh circuit reversal of santos money laundering conviction.a plurality justices scalia,souter,thomas,and ginsburg concluded that the term proceeds in the money laundering statute means profits,not gross receipts.id.at.it reasoned that,f rom the face of the statute,there is no more reason to think that proceeds means receipts than there is to think that proceeds means profits,and from there,applied the rule of lenity to conclude that the tie must go to the defendant.id.at.the plurality expressed concern that if the definition of proceeds were not limited to profits,a money laundering charge would merge with the crime of running an illegal gambling business.see id.at if proceeds meant receipts,nearly every violation of the statute would also be a violation of the money laundering statute,because paying a winning bettor is a transaction involving receipts that the defendant intends to promote the carrying on of the lottery.it noted that under this reading,prosecutors would acquire the discretion to charge the greater offense instead of or in addition to the lesser lottery offense in nearly every case involving an illegal lottery.id.at.for these reasons,the plurality concluded that proceeds must mean profits,regardless of the sua at issue.
justice stevens provided the fifth vote in favor of the supreme court judgment affirming the seventh circuit vacatur of santos conviction.in his opinion concurring in the judgment,justice stevens took the position that the definition of proceeds might depend upon the particular sua underlying the money laundering charge at issue.id.at stevens,concurring in the judgment.he emphasized the lack of legislative history indicating that congress intended the term proceeds to mean gross receipts in the context of gambling offenses.id.at.he also expressed concern about the merger problem identified by the plurality.see id.at allowing the government to treat the mere payment of the expense of operating an illegal gambling business as a separate offense is in practical effect tantamount to double jeopardy,which is particularly unfair in this case because the penalties for money laundering are substantially more severe than those for the underlying offense of operating a gambling business.he nevertheless concluded that legislative history evinces congress intent that the money laundering statute apply to transactions involving the gross revenues,not just the profits,of certain other suas.id.at in other applications of the statute not involving such a perverse result,i would presume that the dissent reflects the intent of the enacting congress.for example,he reasoned,congress intended the term proceeds to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales thus,i can not agree with the plurality that the rule of lenity must apply for these types of unlawful activities.id.at.
in his dissent,justice alito,who was joined by chief justice roberts and justices kennedy and breyer,stated he would have held that the term proceeds means gross receipts in all circumstances.id.at alito,dissenting.the dissent noted in particular that five justices agree with the position that the term proceeds include s gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized crime syndicates involving such sales.id.at alito,dissenting alteration in original.
the scope of the supreme court holding in santos is a question of first impression in this circuit.where,as in santos,a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,our task is to discern that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds.see marks united states,internal quotation mark omitted.
in reconciling the plurality opinion with justice stevens concurrence,certain of our sister circuits have limited santos to its facts,holding that proceeds means profits only where the predicate sua proceeds were derived from a gambling operation.see,united states demarest,cir concluding that santos narrow holding applied only where the sua is gambling and therefore did not apply to defendant who laundered funds received from illegal drug trafficking,cert.denied.other circuits have held that the government is not required to prove that the laundered funds were profits where the predicate offense is a drug offense.see,united states webster,cir we read santos as holding that where,as,here,a money laundering count is based on transfers among of money from the sale of drugs,proceeds includes all receipts from such sales.united states spencer,cir other circuits hold and this court agrees that santos does not apply in the drug context.others have indicated that santos may apply more broadly.see,garland roy,cir construing proceeds as profits where the conviction raises a merger problem or legislative history affirmatively supports interpreting proceeds to mean profits united states kratt,cir holding that proceeds means profits only when the predicate offense creates a merger problem that leads to a radical increase in the statutory maximum sentence and only when nothing in the legislative history suggests that congress intended such increase,cert.denied.
antonio argues that his conviction must be reversed under santos on the theory that it raises a merger problem.antonio is correct that the desire to avoid a merger problem united five justices in holding that santos payments did not constitute money laundering.but he overlooks justice stevens statement that the legislative history of makes it clear that congress intended the term proceeds to include gross revenues from the sale of contraband and the operation of organized criminal syndicates involving such sales and justice stevens disagreement with the plurality position that the rule of lenity must apply to the definition of proceeds for these types of unlawful activities.see santos,at stevens,j,concurring in the judgment.as the plurality acknowledged,justice stevens concurrence determines the scope of the court holding.id.at since his vote is necessary to our judgment,and since his opinion rests upon a narrower ground,the court holding is limited accordingly.justice alito dissent likewise recognized the agreement among five justices that the term proceeds includes gross revenues from the sale of contraband.id.at alito,dissenting.accordingly,we hold that proceeds under is not limited to profits at least where,as here,the predicate offense involves the sale of contraband 
antonio rejoins that the controlled substances he distributed were not contraband because they were sold pursuant to prescriptions from physicians.def.reply br.this is incorrect.as antonio concedes,controlled substance medications become contraband if and when they are dispensed outside the usual course of professional practice.id.the jury indeed found and the record supports that antonio had unlawfully distributed schedule iii and iv controlled substances outside the course of professional practice and without a legitimate medical purpose.in any event,antonio has not identified any case holding that the government must prove that the laundered funds were profits where the underlying offense involves unlawful distribution of a controlled substance.antonio argument therefore is unavailing.
finally,antonio does not dispute that the evidence of money laundering is sufficient under a definition of proceeds that includes gross receipts,nor could he,given the ample record evidence of transfers of such funds with the intent to promote his illegal businesses therefore,his argument that the evidence underlying his money laundering conspiracy conviction is insufficient under santos is without merit.
conclusion 
we have considered all of the defendants arguments and find them to be without merit.we hold that any error in giving a conscious avoidance jury instruction was not prejudicial to the defendants because there was overwhelming evidence that they knew or should have known that the doctors and pharmacists upon whom they relied were acting in bad faith.we further hold that united states santos,as applied to the sale of contraband,permits a conviction for money laundering conspiracy even absent proof that the laundered funds were profits.for the reasons stated herein and in the accompanying summary order,the judgments of the district court are affirmed.
with today decision the majority blurs the once distinct and enforced parameters of our conscious avoidance jurisprudence.the quinoneses raised two issues regarding the conscious avoidance jury instruction on appeal whether it should have been included in the jury charge at all and whether its language violated our precedent,including,most recently,united states kaiser,cir because it did not account for their actual beliefs.while i agree that because the quinoneses asserted the lack of some specific aspect of knowledge required for conviction,and the appropriate factual predicate for the charge exist ed,united states ferrarini,cir,cert.denied,the instruction was properly before the jury,i disagree with the majority conclusion that the error found in the instruction language was harmless.because it is my opinion that the conscious avoidance instruction was fundamentally flawed and that the error was plain and prejudicial,i respectfully dissent and would vacate the judgment against the quinoneses and grant them a new trial.indeed,i suggest that kaiser allows for no alternative.i concur in the majority opinion in all other respects 
doctrine of conscious avoidance 
the doctrine of conscious avoidance stands for the principle that a person who deliberately shuts his eyes to an obvious means of knowledge has sufficient mens rea for an offense based on such words as permitting,allowing,suffering and knowingly.edwards,ll.j,the criminal degrees of knowledge,mod.in our circuit,a conscious avoidance charge must communicate two points that a jury may infer knowledge of the existence of a particular fact if the defendant is aware of a high probability of its existence,unless the defendant actually believes that it does not exist.kaiser,at internal quotation omitted.while other circuits rarely have authorized the use of the instruction,see,united states alvarado,cir,cert.denied,we have authorized it somewhat more readily,united states rodriguez,cir.
since adopting the conscious avoidance doctrine from english common law,american courts have balanced its application with a concern for defendants actual beliefs.in spurr united states,the supreme court first tacitly acknowledged the doctrine legitimacy,but also recognized the improper usage of the conscious avoidance instruction deprived the defendant of his defense of honest belief.spurr,at.later,this concern for defendants actual beliefs was incorporated into the model penal code directive on conscious avoidance when knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense,such knowledge is established if a person is aware of a high probability of its existence,unless he actually believes that it does not exist.model penal code.the supreme court expressed its approval of this formulation in leary united states,and we require substantially similar language for a proper conscious avoidance jury instruction in our circuit.see,united states feroz,per curiam.district courts and prosecutors have been on notice for over three decades that the actual belief language must be incorporated into every conscious avoidance charge.feroz,at see also united states sicignano,cir per curiam.
the actual belief prong is critical to ensure a proper conscious avoidance jury instruction.the risk of the language exclusion is dire because f ailure to include that proviso improperly permits the jury to convict a defendant who honestly believed that he was not engaging in illegal activity.sicignano,at.moreover,as the proviso goes to what a defendant believes,and not what he knows or should know,the belief held by the defendant need not be reasonable in order for it to defeat a conscious avoidance theory of actual knowledge.see united states catano alzate,cir per curiam t he doctrine of conscious avoidance does not permit a finding of guilty knowledge if the defendant actually did not believe that he or she was involved in the transportation of drugs,however irrational that belief may have been.in cases like this one,where a defendant relies on his lack of knowledge of a crucial fact as a central element of his defense,the actual belief language is particularly appropriate.united states.morales,cir citing united states bright,cir.
ii.the error in the conscious avoidance jury instruction was not harmless 
standard of review 
because the quinoneses did not specifically object to the language of the conscious avoidance jury instruction,we review for plain error.d.under this standard,the quinoneses must demonstrate that any error is clear or obvious,rather than subject to reasonable dispute affected their substantial rights,that there is a reasonable probability that the error affected the outcome of the trial and seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.kaiser,at quoting united states marcus,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.
b.the conscious avoidance charge was fundamentally flawed 
the conscious avoidance instruction in this case,much like the one we found deficient in kaiser,contained nothing to suggest that actual belief would absolve the quinoneses of culpability.kaiser,at.the district court charged the jury 
in determining what the defendant knew or reasonably should have known,you may consider whether the defendant deliberately closed his eyes to what otherwise would have been obvious.this does not mean that the defendant acted carelessly,negligently or even foolishly.one may not,however,avoid criminal liability by wilfully and intentionally remaining ignorant of a fact material and important to his or her conduct.thus,even if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant wa
