john curran appeals from a final judgment and sentence entered in united states district court for the district of rhode island following his conviction after a jury trial on multiple counts of wire fraud and money laundering.curran does not challenge his conviction but rather the court sentence,claiming his prison term was excessive because the district court incorrectly calculated the dollar value of the loss caused by curran fraud and the number of the fraud victims.curran also challenges the court restitution order.we affirm the district court judgment.
background 
curran held himself out falsely as a medical doctor although his only training in the healing arts was in naturopathy,a system of treatment relying on natural remedies.the wire fraud and money laundering charged in the indictment rested upon his posing as a doctor so as to entice patients into his office where he conducted expensive diagnostic tests he was not licensed to perform and frightened patients into purchasing dubious,overpriced treatments.two counts were dismissed at trial,and the jury convicted curran on the remaining counts after eight days of testimony and the admission of several hundred exhibits.the district court sentenced curran to months in prison,in the middle of the guideline range,stating that curran was a menace who took advantage of the patients worst fears and preyed on them for reasons of greed as he undertook a scam of the worst kind.in calculating curran base sentence,the court included substantial enhancements based upon the dollar value of the losses suffered by the victims of his fraud and their number,using as the measure of loss the fees his clients had paid him.the court also ordered curran to pay restitution of these fees,totaling.this appeal followed.
curran,a high school graduate who had previously run a carpet cleaning business,became a practitioner of naturopathy in.he had trained under a practicing naturopath for two years and completed a program at a college of naturopathic medicine in arkansas.he maintained an office first in cranston,rhode island and then in nearby providence.although he had never attended medical school and did not have a license to practice medicine,he held himself out to clients as being a medical doctor as well as a naturopath.rhode island law prohibited curran from holding himself out as a licensed physician and from diagnosing disease or treating it.
at his office,which gave the illusion that it belonged to a medical professional,curran wore a lab coat with a name tag reading,john curran,in the printed materials he passed out to clients,including business cards,prescription pads,and pamphlets,curran referred to himself as an,physician,doctor,and a medical school graduate.just as he had not earned an,he had also not earned a.the sign on curran office door read,curran office.the nameplate on his desk said,john curran,nd,md,board certified naturopath.diplomas and certificates bearing his name were framed on the walls,including one from an unaccredited medical school curran had never attended,and one referring to the purported.in a written statement describing the mission of his office,he said,get them in the door looking like a huxster sic.curran claimed he had cured people of,inter alia,cancer,liver failure,hepatitis c,paralysis and infertility.staff were instructed to tell prospective clients that the office had an eighty percent success rate.
when new clients came to see him,curran would perform a preliminary consultation in which he explained his services.curran and his staff would ask what he called open ended diagnostic sounding questions to emphasize the allegedly medical nature of the discussion.curran would then charge for a assessment,which consisted of measuring the client body heat using a thermal imaging device,hooking each one up to a biomeridian stress assessment device which curran claimed evaluated the client internal organs but which is not approved for diagnosing disease,and finally,testing the client blood by using a microscope attached to a computer.state and federal authorities had warned curran that he was not allowed to perform such blood tests because he lacked the proper credentials,and curran had promised in writing to stop using the procedure.he did not do so.curran testified at trial that while before the warning he had performed a hour live blood analysis,after the warning he switched to performing a shorter,live blood demonstration he felt he was permitted to conduct.he conceded that he had not confirmed such authorization with the rhode island department of health.
there was testimony by former patients that,after doing the tests,curran told them that they were in very ill health.he said to them that they had blood abnormalities including live parasites,parasites,worms,holes,big eggs,cells,red crystals,dying cells,dormit cells,severely reduced blood cells,no white blood cells.he also purported to diagnose deficient body functions or immune systems,fungus on the liver,defective lungs and kidneys,or organs in distress.on occasion he indicated the existence or possibility of the existence of a illness like cancer.one doctor testified that curran records of the results of some of these tests were gibberish.a doctor testified at trial that while parasites can on rare occasions be found in the blood,such cases are extremely unusual.
there was evidence indicating that curran technique included scaring his clients,telling one young woman that at the rate she was going,she would live until,and telling another woman that her immune system was completely shot and that within a couple of months she could be dead.having scared the clients,curran offered expensive treatments to them,telling them,you ca put a price on health.curran offered green drink,which he claimed was a nutritional supplement he had invented,containing a synergistic blend of all natural compounds that support and promote the body overall ability to fight and prevent diseases.though curran sold this item in buckets priced at,and,it was a commercially produced liquid that usually sold for only a small portion of curran.
another one of curran proposed cures was specially energized water,which he said had the same synergistic healing properties as the water in lourdes,france.the water was actually distilled water curran ran through a blender.he also sold therapies named hydrotherapy massage,spectracolor spa,hyperbaric chamber,ionic cleaner,massage capsule,and personal sauna.
though curran began his practice as early as,the government evidence at trial emphasized the years,during which period curran treated clients.in each case,curran performed at least one live blood exam,which in turn led to the diagnosis of one of the invented ailments listed supra.each client bought one or more of curran treatments for a cost in some instances of more than.in those two years,curran made million in income doing this kind of evaluation and treatment of his clients.urged by one of his former naturopathy teachers not to pretend to be a medical doctor,curran responded,some people will think i a medical doctor,some people wo.i do care what they think as long as they give me money.he continued,i tired of being broke.i want to make as much money as medical doctors.
as part of his ongoing fraud,curran made interstate wire transmissions,including a fax to a company which printed one of curran misleading pamphlets an email about the purchase of one of his diplomas a faxed sales agreement to buy a biomeridian machine a faxed application for a line of credit in the name of a parent of one of his clients and related credit card and credit line transactions involving client payments.
in his defense,curran testified to believing in all of the methods and products he used and denied any intent to mislead clients about his credentials.he admitted to telling clients you ca put a price on your health but also claimed that he regularly told clients that he was a naturopath who had later earned honorary and academic only degrees.at sentencing,curran counsel submitted letters from of curran former clients saying they were happy with curran work had not been victims of fraud.
in his appellate brief,curran states that he does not challenge his conviction but appeals based upon multiple errors related to his sentence.
discussion 
amount of loss 
curran complains that the district court calculation of the amount of loss for use in determining his guideline sentence was excessive.the court million loss calculation resulted in a increase in curran offense level.ussg b i curran contends the loss calculation was based on insufficient evidence,as only a relatively few clients actually testified and the court did not distinguish between services purchased by clients who were taken in by curran fraudulent scheme and those,such as the who wrote letters expressing satisfaction,who were happy to receive curran legitimate alternative therapies and may have sought him out solely as a naturopath.we find little merit in these contentions.
the government bears the burden of proving a victim losses by a preponderance of the evidence.united states acosta,cir.in calculating loss amounts under the guidelines,a district court evaluates losses stemming from the conduct of conviction and any relevant conduct.united states,cir.determination of actual loss need not be precise t he court need only make a reasonable estimate of the range of loss,given the available information.united states brandon,cir quoting ussg cmt.alteration in original.a court may base a loss estimate on factors including t he approximate number of victims multiplied by the average loss to each victim and on m ore general factors,such as the scope and duration of the offense and revenues generated by similar operations.ussg,cmt.c iii and iv.t he district court may rely on the presentence report,affidavits,documentary exhibits,and submissions of counsel.united states ranney,cir.
we review the district court interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error,at.as curran acknowledges,a defendant dissatisfied with the sentencing court quantification of the amount of loss in a particular case must go a long way to demonstrate that the finding is clearly erroneous.united states rostoff,cir.
district court ruling 
the presentence report psr recommended the same loss amount that the district court subsequently adopted.this was based upon evidence received at the trial,including a summary chart of curran office records and exhibits demonstrating the prices paid by clients for curran services.exhibit,the summary chart based on records from curran office,was admitted without objection at trial and indicated that between,curran examined almost clients.in almost every case,curran conducted a live blood exam which he found to reveal a frightening condition like parasites or red crystals.more than of the clients were found to have parasites in their blood,a diagnosis the court found to be incredible given the unrebutted expert testimony that parasites in the blood are an extremely rare condition,as well,it may be presumed,as the evidence indicating curran lack of medical training and qualifications to make such diagnoses and much other evidence of fraud.the summary chart demonstrated that most patients purchased at least one of the following products,green drink,or silver water.three other trial exhibits,based on the records seized from curran office,showed exact dollar amounts spent by clients in,a figure which totaled and which the district court rounded to million for purposes of discussion at sentencing.the total did not include the payments made by patients treated prior to.
as said,the district court followed the recommendation of the psr in concluding that the amount of loss from curran scheme totaled about million and,in any event,was clearly in excess of million.that latter assessment resulted in a increase in his offense level.ussg b i.curran argues that the amount of loss to his victims was in fact no more than.he arrives at this number by counting only the amount of money listed in claims for restitution filed by of his victims.but the fact that not all the victims sought restitution is not determinative for purposes of calculating the amount of loss the court was entitled to conclude from the totality of the evidence,including the comprehensive exhibits mentioned above,that the practices and patterns of conduct described by certain witnesses were followed generally as to curran clients,and that all were subjected to fraudulent practices regardless of whether they actively sought restitution.
at sentencing,following a discussion regarding the psr loss calculation,the district court made the following ruling 
first and foremost,the defendant held himself out as having a medical degree.he wore it on his jacket.he had it up on the wall 
and finally,and more precisely with respect to the loss figure here,as it was presented at trial as part of the proof,the defendant subjected over people to this live blood analysis and in all of them,as i understood the evidence as it was presented in summary fashion,every single one of those people was told that there was some abnormality with their blood,which,as government counsel says,crausman says is a statistical impossibility.
and so it is clearly part and parcel of the scam perpetrated by the defendant in bringing people into his office and then telling them that they were very sick people who needed his services.
we then have the loss figure of million.as i say,it is a number from the actual number that appears in the report but it is clearly in excess of million,which is the threshold for the adjustment pursuant to b.
application note c only requires the court to make a reasonable estimate.and here,as i say,the threshold figure for the increase is one million.clearly,the evidence that was produced at trial was far in excess of that number,and so i find that the probation officer properly included the adjustment for a loss amount in excess of million.
curran argument 
curran insists the loss amount is inflated as it includes payments from clients who were not victims of the fraudulent scheme but instead enjoyed the benefits of the legitimate naturopathic services curran rendered.he argues that the government needed to submit even more individualized evidence than it did for each victim related to the live blood testing results in order to prove that the victim payments to curran for the test and prescribed remedies were actual losses to the victim caused by his fraud.we are not persuaded.there was ample evidence from which to conclude that curran falsely held himself out to his clients to be a medical doctor,and that the clients listed in the summary chart were improperly given blood tests and received medically frivolous remedies designed for curran financial benefit rather than his clients that a few clients later relayed their satisfaction with this fraudulent treatment through defense counsel is immaterial in light of the clear evidence of professional impropriety and fraud,affecting all his clients,that permeated curran practice.
curran complains that the guidelines offer little direction in how to determine who were actual victims for purposes of assessing the loss total.victim is defined in the application notes to in part as any person who sustained any part of the actual loss determined under subsection b.actual loss is defined as the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.ussg,comment a i.pointing to language in the guidelines establishing a causation requirement in assessment of loss,ussg app.c,amend,curran argues that a causal link was not shown between the fraud and the victims payments.that amendment states that 
the amendment defines actual loss as the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense.the amendment incorporates this causation standard that,at a minimum,requires factual causation often called but for causation and provides a rule for legal causation,guidance to the courts regarding how to draw the line as to what losses should be included and excluded from the loss determination.significantly,the application of this causation standard in the great variety of factual contexts in w
