this sentencing appeal primarily concerns the reasonableness of a downward departure from a sentencing guidelines calculation and the reasonableness of the resulting sentence.the government appeals from the november,judgment by the district court for the district of connecticut alfred covello,district judge resentencing the defendant,john canova,after a remand from this court,to one year probation and a fine.the government contends that the district court downward departure was unreasonable and that we should remand with instructions to impose a sentence of not less than months.we agree that a remand for resentencing is required,but decline to specify a minimum sentence.
background 
the facts are set out in detail in the opinion on the prior appeal.see united states canova,cir.we repeat only those pertinent to the issues on this appeal,as recounted at at.
canova conduct.at all relevant times,canova was for operations at raytel cardiac services,raytel.raytel performed transtelephonic pacemaker monitoring for medicare patients.transtelephonic monitoring involves a remote technician testing the operation of a pacemaker by having the patient use a device to transmit telephonic signals that can be converted into an electrocardiogram ecg report for review by a cardiologist.
the medicare coverage issues manual required monitoring of pacemakers over the course of three phases and recording the results of each phase on magnetic tape raytel was required to produce magnetic tape records of all three phases to receive medicare compensation.however,after computerized testing was introduced in,some raytel technicians began to record an abbreviated strip of magnetic tape for the last phase or to omit it altogether.canova knew of this practice,and the performance quotas he imposed contributed to it.sometime in,canova suggested to a subordinate that the medicare manual could be construed not to require production of a strip for the last phase if the telephonic signals were recorded in audio format.his subordinate called medicare,and the persons with whom he spoke could not answer his questions about the manual.
at some point,medicare connecticut carrier received an anonymous complaint that raytel was not complying with medicare requirements.in,the carrier informed raytel that it refused to pay,or was seeking reimbursement for having paid,medicare claims for noncompliant monitoring.in response,canova falsely wrote that raytel had complied with all relevant regulations and was producing strips for all three phases.
after receiving canova letter,medicare decided to conduct an audit of raytel connecticut facility.the day before the visit,canova instructed his managers to tell the auditors that raytel had complied with the medicare manual even though he knew this was false.following the audit,canova falsely asserted in a letter that raytel standard operating procedure was to obtain the full seconds of ecg.id.at alteration in original.he also represented that raytel would send the auditors certain records they had requested.
in march,when raytel had failed to produce the requested records,medicare gave raytel thirty days in which to correct deficiencies in its archive system and to certify that all data in its records complied with the medicare requirements.canova instructed his managers to clean up the requested records to make it look as if they had been printed directly from the computer archives,although the cleaned up records were never transmitted to medicare.see id.at.even after learning that the requested records were noncompliant,canova reported to medicare that the company had established a new archive system populated with tests starting with december,and that he was certifying raytel compliance with medicare regulations for tests conducted after that date.id.at omission in original.
the conviction.after indictment and a jury trial,canova was convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states by making false statements to medicare agents in violation of and to obstruct a medicare audit in violation of,see two counts of making false statements in violation of and one count of obstructing a federal audit by directing his employees to make false representations to auditors,see id.
the first sentencing.applying the sentencing guidelines the probation department recommended in its presentence report psr a total offense level of.starting with a base offense level of under section a,which governed fraud offenses,the psr added a enhancement for a million loss,see b n a enhancement for more than minimal planning,see id.b a a enhancement for canova leadership role,see id.c and a enhancement for obstruction of justice based on canova trial testimony,see id.the total offense level of and a criminal history category chc of i yielded a guidelines sentencing range of to months.
at the sentencing hearing,the district judge concluded that the evidence did not support a loss calculation of million.the judge found that raytel noncompliance did not cause medicare any harm at all.finding no monetary loss,the judge calculated the guidelines range using an alternative method.relying on section,governing offenses,he started with a base offense level of.he then applied a enhancement for canova leadership role.however,he rejected the government request for a enhancement for obstruction of justice,observing that he could not conclude that canova perjured himself with the specific intent to obstruct justice.
from the adjusted offense level of the district judge granted canova a downward departure based on his extraordinary record of civil and public service,which included service in the marine corps,courageous service as a volunteer firefighter,and several good samaritan acts.the final offense level of,combined with a chc of i,yielded a guidelines sentencing range of to months incarceration.the district judge sentenced canova to one year probation and a fine of.
the first appeal.canova unsuccessfully appealed from the denial of his motion for a new trial,but the government,challenging the sentence,was partially successful.the government challenged the district court loss calculation,its denial of an enhancement,and its charitable service downward departure.
we first noted that,after united states booker,d,a district court sentencing decision is reviewed for reasonableness and that a guidelines error that appreciably influences this decision could render the final sentence unreasonable.canova,at,internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.applying this standard,we concluded that it was necessary to remand for resentencing because the district court had erred in declining to make a guidelines loss calculation.
we first distinguished between actual loss and intended loss and focused most of our attention on the district court error in disregarding intended loss see,cmt.we noted that canova had been convicted not only of offenses involving a completed test results known to be also of an offense involving intended false statements to prevent medicare from recouping payments made to raytel for the noncompliant tests.see canova,at.the government was entitled to recoup full payment for all noncompliant tests,see a,and the evidence showed that canova knew of the government right to recoup,thereby providing a basis for inferring that his false statements interfered with the recoupment,see canova,at.because medicare payments to raytel during the period covered by the audit were approximately million and evidence supported the government conservative conclusion that percent of raytel tests were noncompliant,we calculated the intended loss from canova actions to be million.see id.at.we also advised the district judge that he could rely on the intended loss in determining the appropriate loss enhancement for this case,rather than make the more difficult determination of actual loss.see id.at see also,cmt.i f an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined,this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.
we declined to express an opinion on whether it would be appropriate to depart from the guidelines range on the ground that the monetary loss overstated the seriousness of the offense,see,cmt.canova,at.we also concluded that the district court error could very well have affected canova sentence,despite the charitable service downward departure,because of the significant difference between a guidelines sentencing range that included the million loss,to months,and the range,before the departure,that the district court calculated,to months,based on no loss.see id.at.
on the remaining issues on the government,we affirmed the district court denial of an enhancement,see id.at,and the downward departure for canova charitable service,see id.at we also stated that,on remand,the district court could reconsider the extent of the departure in light of the higher guidelines range dictated by proper application of a loss enhancement.id.at.
the resentencing.at the resentencing the district judge began his guidelines recalculation with a base offense level of,see a,and then added a enhancement for a loss of million,see id.b n a enhancement for more than minimal planning,see id.b a and a enhancement for leadership role,see id.c,for an adjusted offense level of.neither party disputes this calculation.
the district judge then granted a downward departure on the ground that the monetary loss overstated the seriousness of the offense and because the previous departure for public service did not fully reflect the court sentencing objectives in light of the newly imposed loss enhancement.as he explained,t he higher guideline range calls for a more extended downward departure for the defendant service to the country and community.as for the loss calculation,the judge commented,i t not that these tests were performed.it the question whether a portion of the last test was not properly concluded.he pointed to evidence suggesting that some medicare officials could not tell whether its policy required all three parts of the test,noting that the court could consider the victim own conduct.he also concluded that it was appropriate to consider raytel restitution in the amount of million.
after applying the downward departure,the court arrived at an offense level of,which,when combined with a chc of i,yielded a guidelines range of to months.the district judge resentenced canova to one year probation and a fine,precisely the same sentence originally imposed.
discussion 
although booker rendered the sentencing guidelines advisory,sentencing courts must still consider the factors contained in a,including the applicable guidelines range and departure authority.see united states selioutsky,cir citing united states crosby,cir.after considering all relevant factors,a court must decide whether to impose a guidelines or a sentence.see id.at citing crosby,at.
before booker,we reviewed downward departures under the de novo standard set forth in e.see united states brady,cir.however,booker excised that provision,and substituted review of sentences for reasonableness.see id.reasonableness review involves consideration of both the length of the sentence substantive reasonableness and the procedures used to arrive at the sentence procedural reasonableness.see united states rattoballi,cir.
with respect to procedural reasonableness,a n error in determining the applicable guideline range or the availability of departure authority would be the type of procedural error that could render a sentence unreasonable under booker.selioutsky,at.accordingly,we review downward departures to determine whether the sentencing court abused or exceeded its discretion.id.at.a sentencing court abuses or exceeds its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding or,even if not resulting from such an error,can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.brady,at quoting zervos verizon,cir.
the government argues that canova sentence is unreasonable both,the downward departure is based on the district court erroneous view that the million loss overstated the seriousness of the offense and that the victim conduct and raytel restitution were mitigating,the extent of the departure is unreasonable and the resulting sentence is unreasonably low.we first consider the three alleged procedural errors.
procedural errors 
whether the loss overstated the harm.the district judge exceeded his discretion in deciding that the million loss overstated the seriousness of canova offense.the commentary to section states in relevant part 
in a few instances,the loss determined under subsection b may overstate the seriousness of the offense.this may occur,for example,where a defendant attempted to negotiate an instrument that was so obviously fraudulent that no one would seriously consider honoring it.in such cases,a downward departure may be warranted.
cmt.the example suggests that this departure typically applies in cases where there is no meaningful chance that the attempted crime would have succeeded to the extent indicated by the stated loss.united states crawford,cir.
at the resentencing hearing,the district judge recognized that the million loss was based on the fact that canova or,more precisely,raytel was liable to medicare for the full cost of tests performed in violation of the medicare specifications.in reasoning that the million loss overstated the seriousness of the offense,he explained,i t not that these tests were performed.it the question whether a portion of the last test was not properly concluded.
the district judge explanation of why the million loss overstates the seriousness of the offense again relates only to the actual harm the effect of raytel noncompliance.the district judge did not take into account this court instruction to consider the intended loss that would have resulted from canova attempts to obstruct medicare audit.regardless of the medical value of raytel tests,the government had the right to recoup million in payments made for noncompliant products,and canova conduct was designed to prevent this recoupment.the district judge did not make any findings to support a conclusion that the intended loss overstated the harm.
moreover,it is questionable whether the departure authority contained in note to section even applies to a case such as this.the note states that instances where the loss overstates the seriousness of the offense will be few,and offers,as an example,a case in which a defendant attempts to negotiate an instrument so obviously fraudulent that no one would consider honoring it,where the intended loss is almost certain not to occur.the pending case differs substantially from that example it can not be said that canova attempts to prevent medicare from learning of raytel noncompliance and obtaining recoupment were certain to fail.
the victim conduct.the district judge stated at the resentencing hearing that the victim conduct was a ground for departure,noting that even medicare could not tell in the language of its own policy that all three parts of the test were required.the judge apparently was referring to the testimony of a raytel employee,steven boecklin,who stated at trial that he called medicare to ask about the manual requirements for the third phase of monitoring and that the persons to whom he spoke did not know what the manual meant see canova,at.
in the circumstances of this case,this factor was not a permissible ground for departure.section of the sentencing guidelines,entitled victim conduct,permits a downward departure i f the victim wrongful conduct contributed significantly to provoking the offense behavior.the response of medicare employees can not be considered to have provoked canova conduct.
raytel restitution.the district judge also supported the downward departure by the fact that raytel had paid million in restitution.he acknowledged that restitution was not ordinarily an appropriate ground for departure but concluded that it was appropriate in this case,citing united states broderson,cir.in broderson,the defendant,acting on behalf of his employer,grumman data systems,had negotiated a contract with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa.see id.at.the truth in negotiations act tina,which governed the negotia
