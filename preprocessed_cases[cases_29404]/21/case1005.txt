in this appeal,josé beltran santos,whose true name is aramis estéban rodríguez,asseverates that the district court erred in calculating his guideline sentencing range gsr by finding him responsible for an excessive quantity of drugs and mischaracterizing his role in the offenses of conviction.discerning no error,we affirm the judgment below.
because this appeal follows a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the colloquy,the presentence investigation report psi report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states,cir united states dietz,cir.
in the fall of,three malefactors moni,mercedes,and guillen attended a series of meetings that culminated in an agreement to purchase kilograms of cocaine.the transaction terms required the purchasers to pay a total of,with a down payment of due at the time of sale and the balance payable over the next five weeks.unbeknownst to them,however,this was a sting operation,and the putative sellers were,in reality,two undercover fbi agents and a cooperating individual ci.
at the final meeting,the undercover agents advised the purchasers that if they planned to use a courier,one of them would have to accompany the courier to a garage in cranston,rhode island where the cocaine would be delivered,while the others would wait at a different location with the down payment.with this arrangement in mind,the three purchasers and the appellant traveled to warwick,rhode island,on december,and met with the ci and one of the agents in the parking lot of a holiday inn.the record reflects that the appellant had been offered or,perhaps,difference is inconsequential for present purposes to act as a courier.mercedes and guillen told the agent,in the appellant presence,that they had brought in cash as an initial payment for the kilograms of cocaine.mercedes,moni,and the money remained at the holiday inn with the ci while the agent led guillen and the appellant to the cranston garage.during the trip,guillen told the appellant that he guillen was being paid between and for his participation in the transaction.
upon their arrival at the garage,the men were greeted by more undercover agents.on a table inside the garage,fifty kilograms of cocaine were arrayed in plain view.one of the agents asked guillen and the appellant if they had come to pick up the kilograms of cocaine.the appellant responded i guess.he and guillen then attempted to open the hide of the car in which they had arrived,but they were unable to do so they proceeded to inspect the cocaine.after acknowledging that it was of good quality,they set about preparing it for transport,sprinkling ground coffee onto each package and then rewrapping each package in cellophane.shortly after this activity parties dispute whether the men were in the process of repackaging the third or fourth agents arrested them.
on december,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of rhode island returned a indictment that charged the appellant and his three confederates with conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine and attempted possession of that quantity of cocaine with intent to distribute.see,a.the appellant initially maintained his innocence.on june,however,he entered a plea of guilty.in connection therewith,he executed a plea agreement,which provided in pertinent part 
the defendant agrees and understands that the substance involved in this case is powder cocaine.and that the quantity at issue exceeds five kilograms 
for its part,the government agreed to recommend that the court impose the lowest available sentence consistent with the gsr as determined by the court and any applicable statute imposing a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment.
on march,the district court convened the disposition hearing.the court found the defendant responsible for the full kilograms of cocaine.because the court held the appellant responsible for so much cocaine,his base offense level ordinarily would have been base offense level for an individual who is responsible for fifteen to fifty kilograms of cocaine.see ussg c.but the court thought the appellant deserving of a mitigating role adjustment,and,thus,was required to cap his base offense level at.see id.a.
from this lowered base offense level,the court granted a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see id,a safety valve reduction,see id.b,and a mitigating role reduction,see id.b coupled with the absence of any previous criminal history,these determinations yielded a gsr of months.see id.ch,pt.a sentencing table.the court thereupon sentenced the appellant to an incarcerative term of months.this appeal followed.
the appellant advances two assignments of error.first,he asserts that the sentencing court erred in finding him responsible for a drug quantity in excess of kilograms of cocaine arguing that he could not foresee that the transaction would involve so large an amount.second,he posits that the court should have classified him as a minimal participant rather than a minor participant.we discuss these issues sequentially.
we begin with drug quantity.a district court factual finding as to the amount of drugs embraced by a conspiracy and reasonably foreseeable by a particular coconspirator will be disturbed on appeal only if it is clearly erroneous.united states may,cir united states garcia,cir.considering the concession made in the plea agreement and the developments preceding the arrest,the district court hardly can be said to have erred in holding the appellant responsible for more than kilograms of cocaine.we explain briefly.
in a drug conspiracy case,a key datum in constructing the defendant sentence is the quantity of narcotics attributable to him for sentencing purposes,a datum initially bounded by the sum of the charged conduct to which the defendant pleads plus his relevant uncharged conduct.united states bradley,cir.drug quantity is to be derived from all acts that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.ussg a.the essential inquiry is not what the defendant knew but what acts were reasonably foreseeable by him.see united states,cir garcia,at.thus,each coconspirator is responsible not only for the drugs he actually handled but also for the full amount of drugs that he could reasonably have anticipated would be within the ambit of the conspiracy.see ussg a b,cmt.see also united states sepulveda,cir.
the appellant argues that the sentencing court erred in its determination because he agreed to act as a courier without any inkling of how much cocaine his principals were buying.this argument lacks force.
in terms of the legal landscape,the appellant challenge must take root in inhospitable soil.four points come readily to mind.first,a sentencing court need only support a determination by a preponderance of the evidence.sepulveda,at.second,such a determination need not be exact,but,rather,may be approximate,as long as the approximation represents a reasoned estimate.united states rodriguez,cir.third,the sentencing court determination can be set aside only if it is clearly erroneous.united states sklar,cir.fourth,if there are two plausible views of the record,the sentencing court choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.united states cruz,cir en banc.
silhouetted against this landscape,the record provides adequate support for a finding that the appellant reasonably could have foreseen that the amount of cocaine involved in the deal would exceed kilograms.after all,the appellant had pleaded guilty to conspiring and attempting to possess in excess of five kilograms of cocaine,and the sentencing expressly found that there was a sound factual basis for the entitled to accept that concession at face value and to draw reasonable inferences from it.see,united states,cir.moreover,the fact that the appellant was going to be paid a minimum of for his relatively brief involvement in picking up and transporting the contraband plainly indicated that this was not a transaction then,too,the appellant was present during a discussion outside the holiday inn at which mercedes and guillen mentioned both the quantity to be purchased kilograms and the size of th
