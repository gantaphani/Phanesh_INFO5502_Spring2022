the armed career criminal act acca,e,imposes a year mandatory minimum sentence on violators who have three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense committed on occasions different from one another.the question presented is whether,in determining whether crimes were committed on occasions different from one another,a court at sentencing is limited to examining only materials approved by the supreme court in taylor united states,and shepard united states.
we hold that,in determining whether crimes were committed on occasions different from one another for purposes of applying the acca,a court is limited to examining only materials approved by the supreme court in taylor and shepard.we also hold that a court may not rely upon a presentence report psr in determining whether crimes were committed on occasions different from one another for purposes of applying the acca,where the relevant facts described in the psr were not derived from sources determined to be consistent with taylor and shepard.
accordingly,we vacate the sentence of the district court and remand for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.
background 
zephaniah dantzler dantzler was convicted,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york nicholas garaufis,judge,upon his plea of guilty,of one count of possession of a firearm as a felon in violation of g.
at dantzler plea colloquy in the district court,the government stated that it would seek to prove at trial that he had been previously convicted of three violent felonies committed on three different occasions,as required by the acca,e,and dantzler expressly waived the right to a jury trial on the issue of his prior felony convictions.appellant app.section e states,in relevant part,that i n the case of a person who violates the substantive provision of this title and has three previous convictions by any court for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,or both,committed on occasions different from one another,such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not less than fifteen years.e.
the psr prepared for sentencing found that,in,at the age of,dantzler had been convicted of three robberies that rendered him an armed career criminal subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of years imprisonment pursuant to the acca.the three predicate convictions described in the psr were as follows a conviction in the new york state supreme court in brooklyn for a robbery committed on february,in brooklyn,at,in which dantzler and a stole a debit card from the victim using a box cutter a conviction in the new york state supreme court in manhattan for a robbery committed on the subway in manhattan on february,together with two,using a box cutter and a bladed knife and a conviction in the new york state supreme court in queens for a robbery also committed on february,on the subway in queens,with two unnamed individuals,using a box cutter and a bladed knife.dantzler was arrested for the february,subway robbery that took place in manhattan on the day it occurred.while under pretrial detention at the correctional facility on rikers island,new york,dantzler was arrested on march,for the february,robbery that took place in queens.while still in custody,he was arrested on august,for the february,robbery that took place in brooklyn.
in a letter addressed to judge garaufis,dated july,counsel for dantzler objected to the psr characterization of the second and third offenses as crimes committed on occasions different from one another,and argued that the two february,robberies represent a single criminal episode.appellant app.emphasis supplied.the letter also provided the following additional information,which was not included in the psr,taken from the new york criminal complaints,which were attached 
in dantzler case,he was arrested on february,at at the manhattan city hall subway station for a robbery that took place on a number subway train about minutes earlier.while he was in pretrial detention for that offense,he was arrested at rikers island on march,for another robbery that also took place on february,at on an eastbound number train in queens although the offenses involved different victims,both robberies were committed by dantzler and the same two codefendants,both robberies took place in the new york city subway system,and both robberies took place approximately an hour and a half apart.as noted in the presentence report,the modus operandi was the same for both robberies.there also does not appear to have been any interruption in the criminal activity the three undertook for the night.
appellant app.the government responded in a letter dated july.both letters relied upon the case of united states rideout,cir.in rideout,we were faced with the same two offenses,which formed two of the three predicates required for consideration as an armed career criminal under the acca,occurred on separate occasions.in that case,we concluded that offenses committed against different victims separated by at least twenty to thirty minutes and twelve to thirteen miles qualify as offenses committed on occasions different from one another.id.at quoting the acca,e.
at the sentencing hearing on july,judge garaufis,an experienced and careful adjudicator,began by noting the materials he reviewed for purposes of sentencing the original psr and two addenda to the psr,the second of which responded to dantzler objections in his july,letter to judge garaufis and its three attachments,one of which included the new york criminal complaints sworn to by attesting police officers for the two february,subway robberies a july,letter of the defense to the probation officer objecting to the psr and attaching the same new york criminal complaints and the government july,response letter with three exhibits attached.dantzler raised no objection to the court consideration of any of these materials.during her statement at sentencing,dantzler counsel reiterated many of the facts contained in dantzler sentencing submission.
agreeing with the government that rideout was on all fours with the facts before it,the district court first held that,pursuant to rideout teaching,dantzler offenses were committed on occasions different from one another such that the acca was triggered.appellant app.the district court then stated that the applicable sentencing guidelines range for dantzler offense was to months,but was subject to the acca statutory minimum of months.the district court then sentenced him,principally,to months imprisonment and years of supervised release.had dantzler not been subject to a guidelines enhancement as an armed career criminal under e,his total offense level would have been,rather than under the acca,see psr,which would have made the applicable sentencing range months imprisonment.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,dantzler argues that,in determining whether crimes were committed on occasions different from one another for purposes of applying the acca,a court is limited to examining only sources approved by the supreme court in shepard united states,namely,the charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of plea colloquy,or analogous materials.because the district court conclusion in this case rested upon sources not allowable under shepard,and,dantzler asserts,without those inappropriate sources there was insufficient proof that his convictions occurred on occasions different from one another,he argues that his sentence should be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing based solely upon sources.
dantzler concedes that he did not raise this claim in the district court,and accordingly,we review for plain error.this standard is met when there is an error the error is clear or obvious,rather than subject to reasonable dispute the error affected the appellant substantial rights,which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings and the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states vilar,cir quoting united states marcus.
dantzler argues that two decisions of the supreme court establish considerable restrictions on the materials that a sentencing court may consider in determining whether three predicate offenses under the acca were committed on occasions different from one another.in taylor united states,the defendant challenged the sentencing court determination that two of his predicate offenses for burglary under missouri law constituted violent felonies for purposes of the acca.taylor argued that he would have committed a violent felony for purposes of the acca only if he had committed generic burglary of a building or dwelling.the missouri statute,however,criminalized a significantly broader range of activity,including the burglarizing of boats,tents,and other.id.at.
the question before the supreme court was whether the sentencing court in applying e must look only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,or whether the court may consider other evidence concerning the defendant prior crimes.id.at.the court rejected an approach that required the sentencing court to engage in an elaborate factfinding process regarding the defendant prior offenses,id.at,and instead held that,in determining whether a prior conviction was for a violent felony under the acca,a sentencing court should look only to the fact of conviction the statutory definition of the prior offense and,in cases where the defendant was convicted by a jury,to the criminal indictment or information,together with the jury instructions.id.at.
in a later case,shepard united states,the supreme court was faced with the question of how to apply taylor when the predicate offenses for sentencing under the acca stemmed from a guilty plea rather than a jury verdict.the predicate offenses at issue there,as in taylor,were for burglary in a state where the burglary statute encompassed both generic and nongeneric burglary,and the sentencing court was required to determine if shepard burglary convictions were violent felon ies under the acca.id.at.in particular,the shepard court addressed whether a sentencing court could look to police reports or complaint applications in determining whether shepard guilty pleas for burglary had been based upon conduct that would constitute generic burglary,in which case they could be properly considered as acca predicate offenses.id.at.
the shepard court first held,as a threshold matter,that guilty pleas may establish acca predicate offenses.id.at.it then concluded that a later court determining the character of an admitted burglary for purposes of sentencing under the acca is generally limited to examining the statutory definition,charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of plea colloquy,and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.id.at.this was based upon the same pragmatic concerns expressed in taylor,namely,a sentencing court need to identify acca predicate offenses while avoid ing subsequent evidentiary enquiries into the factual basis for the earlier conviction.id.at.
justice souter,writing for a plurality of the shepard court also placed the decision within the line of cases preceding shepard that greatly diminished the scope of a court factfinding authority at sentencing.id.at.he noted that the court opinion in taylor anticipated the very rule later imposed for the sake of preserving the sixth amendment right,that any fact other than a prior conviction sufficient to raise the limit of the possible federal sentence must be found by a jury,in the absence of any waiver of rights by the defendant.shepard,at referring to the rule announced by jones united states,and apprendi new jersey,u.the court explicitly excluded from this limitation the fact of a defendant prior conviction,pursuant to its earlier decision in almendarez torres united states.more recently,in alleyne united states,the court held that a ny fact that,by law,increases the penalty for a crime is an element that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.
dantzler primary argument on appeal is that the shepard limitations on sources to be consulted in determining the character of an offense should also apply to district court inquiries into whether crimes were committed on occasions different from one another.we agree.although taylor and shepard involved the question of whether predicate offenses under the acca were violent felonies,the reasoning underlying those decisions applies with equal force to the analysis of whether the offenses were committed on occasions different from one another.e.
first,as a matter of statutory interpretation,there is nothing in the statute construction to suggest that congress intended to limit the violent felony inquiry for predicate offenses,but not to limit a court inquiry with respect to whether offenses were committed on occasions different from one another.nor is there any indication by the court in shepard that its conclusion was informed by a unique characteristic of the violent felony analysis that would not apply to the parallel on occasions different from one another inquiry.
furthermore,the majority in shepard reiterated its commitment,first expressed in taylor,to respect congress adoption of a categorical criterion that avoids subsequent evidentiary enquiries into the factual basis for the earlier conviction.at.the court in taylor explicitly determined that,in enacting the acca,congress had not meant to adopt an approach that would require the sentencing court to engage in an elaborate factfinding process regarding the defendant prior offenses.at.indeed,the shepard court was apparently concerned about the prospect of a sentencing court making any factual finding not necessarily implied by the prior conviction irrespective of how clearly the factual finding was established.united states rosa,f d,cir.the shepard court explicitly rejected the government desire for a wider evidentiary cast that would include police reports and documents submitted to lower courts even prior to charges.at.
the same concerns expressed by the court in shepard with regard to violent felonies are implicated when the inquiry concerns the separateness of the predicate crimes.indeed,these concerns are perhaps even more salient here because the facts relied upon in determining whether offenses are committed on different occasions the date,time,victim identity,or location of the offense are rarely elements required for conviction,and hence,might not be included in jury instructions or placed before the court much less admitted by a defendant during a plea colloquy.absent reliance on taylor or sources,such as a charging paper jury instruction,or plea colloquy,a sentencing judge would necessarily have to reconstruct the conduct underlying a conviction,which might require examination of the trial record for each predicate offense,or a similarly broad evidentiary inquiry that taylor and shepard have decidedly foreclosed.see,taylor,at.
additionally,limiting the on occasions different from one another analysis to taylor and shepard materials avoids potential constitutional problems associated with affording broad factfinding powers to a sentencing court in evaluating acca predicate offenses.in shepard,the plurality noted 
t he dispute raises the concern underlying jones and apprendi the sixth and fourteenth amendments guarantee a jury standing between a defendant and the power of the state,and they guarantee a jury finding of any disputed fact essential to increase the ceiling of a potential sentence the rule of reading statutes to avoid serious risks of unconstitutionality therefore counsels us to limit the scope of judicial factfinding on the disputed generic character of a prior plea,just as taylor constrained judicial findings about the generic implication of a jury verdict.
at internal citation omitted.
indeed,our precedent makes clear that a sentencing judge determination of whether acca predicate offenses were committed on occasions different from one another is no different,as a constitutional matter,from determining the fact of those convictions.in united states santiago,the defendant argued that,pursuant to apprendi,any fact relevant to imposition of the acca mandatory minimum namely,convictions for three violent felonies or drug offenses committed on occasions different from one another must be charged in the indictment and found by a jury in order to be considered by a sentencing court,cir.he also tried to distinguish the fact of conviction from the different occasions analysis,arguing that,even if a sentencing judge could permissibly determine the fact of conviction,a jury must decide the different occasions question.we rejected that argument,holding that the separateness of the convictions is not a fact which is different in kind from the types of facts already left to the sentencing judge by almendarez torres and apprendi in short,we read apprendi as leaving to the judge,consistent with due process,the task of finding not only the mere fact of previous convictions but other related issues as well.id.at.
in other words,we held in santiago that the question of the separateness of predicate offenses is intertwined with the fact of conviction,and because a sentencing judge was authorized to find the fact of conviction under almendarez torres and apprendi,he could also find that such convictions were separate.here,we take the logical next step and hold that because,after shepard,the fact that a crime constituted a violent felony may be established only through materials,so too the question of whether the convictions were for three separate offenses may also be answered by looking only to materials.
accordingly,we hold that,in determining whether offenses were committed on occasions different from one another for purposes of sentencing under the acca,a sentencing court is bound by the source limitations established by taylor and shepard 
in so holding,we acknowledge that,for what is likely a relatively small number of cases,such as the one before us,in which the dates of the predicate offenses are not dispositive in determining whether they were committed on occasions different from one another,the sentencing court ability to impose the acca mandatory minimum will depend upon whether the taylor and materials also contain other facts necessary for such a determination.here,where two of the predicate offenses occurred on the same date,the district judge was compelled to look to facts such as the identities of the victims and the times and locations of the,under our clear precedent in rideout are precisely the factors rightly determining whether the crimes occurred on occasions different from one another.in such a case,it is only if these particular facts are included in taylor and materials that a sentencing judge can make the requisite determination.and,as we have held with regard to the determination of whether predicate offenses were violent felonies,if such evidence is not available,then the government has not met its burden of establishing the predicate crimes for the purpose of sentencing under the acca.rosa,f d at.
our acknowledgment echoes the concern animating justice dissent in shepard,in which she noted that a defendant sentence will now depend on whether those states record retention policies happen to preserve the musty written plea agreements and recordings of plea colloquies ancillary to convictions.shepard,at,dissenting alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.but we are bound by the court opinions in taylor and shepard regarding the sources that may be consulted for purposes of sentencing under the acca,even if it is unclear whether,in the narrow array of cases that would require a more factual inquiry,those sources will contain the requisite information 
having established that,in determining whether offenses were committed on occasions different from one another for purposes of sentencing under the acca,a court may only utilize sources consistent with taylor and shepard,we now turn to our consideration of dantzler particular sentence 
there does not appear to be any dispute that the district court relied upon materials that were not of the type specifically condoned by taylor or shepard in making its determination that dantzler two february,subway robbery convictions were committed on occasions different from one another for purposes of the acca.as we held above,this reliance was error.
the error was also plain.the district court underscored its reliance on the psr,which,when discussing dantzler previous offenses,explicitly drew upon c ourt records,parole records,local presentence report s,and arrest report s,psr the district court also clearly relied upon dantzler sentencing submission,which both discussed and attached the new york criminal complaints sworn to by attesting police officers,as did the government submission in response.reference to these materials was not specifically condoned by the court in taylor or shepard,and there is no suggestion that these materials were themselves derived from materials approved by taylor or shepard or that they are analogs of the types of materials approved by taylor or shepard.
our conclusion that the district court reliance on materials not permitted by taylor and shepard was plain error is intentionally a limited one.in so holding,we intimate no view as to the applicability of taylor and shepard to cases in which a sentencing court relied upon a psr that was derived in whole,or in large part,from taylor or materials.for example,another court of appeals has held that a trial judge was entitled to rely upon the psr where it b ore the earmarks of derivation from sources such as the indictments and judgments from his prior convictions.united states thompson,cir 
relatedly,we recognize the possibility that some of the materials provided as part of the parties sentencing submissions or incorporated into the psr,which referenced inter alia certain unidentified court records,may in fact be considered analogous to those approved by taylor and shepard or may be otherwise consistent with taylor and shepard.at present,we are not in a position to decide this issue definitively because neither party has presented this argument on appeal,nor is the record sufficient for us to determine whether the documents were permissible pursuant to taylor and shepard accordingly,we leave this question to the determination in the first instance by the district court on remand,and emphasize that this opinion should not be construed as foreclosing an argument by the government that some of the materials already in the record are in fact consistent with the limitations of taylor and shepard.any such determination must be guided by the supreme court limitation of reference materials to the terms of the charging document,the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant,or some comparable judicial record of this information,shepard,at or,in other words,conclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt,id.at.by contrast,reliance on materials akin to police reports and documents submitted to lower courts even prior to charges has already been explicitly proscribed by the supreme court.id.at.even though we do not reach the question of whether all of the materials relied upon by the district court in this instance were impermissible,there is no doubt that at least some of those materials fall outside the limited set sanctioned by taylor and shepard,and therefore the district court use thereof constitutes plain error.
this error also affected dantzler substantial rights.the district court explicitly derived from these approved materials the facts it used to determine that the two february,robberies were committed on occasions different from one another,for the purposes of the acca.judge garaufis stated at sentencing,i f dantzler had gone from car to car of the train and robbed a bunch of people,all right,that i could consider one incident but he decided to travel on different subway lines at different times the same night and that really the problem is that rideout seems to tie my hands.appellant app.this factual determination in turn triggered the enhancement in dantzler applicable guidelines imprisonment range from months to months,as well as the year month ma
