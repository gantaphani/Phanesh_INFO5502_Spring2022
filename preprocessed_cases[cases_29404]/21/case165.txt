defendant lauren macarthur macarthur entered a straight guilty plea to illegal possession of firearms after having been previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term of more than one year and illegal possession of firearms that he knew or had reasonable cause to believe were stolen.the district court sentenced him to concurrent terms of imprisonment of months for count one and months for count two.
macarthur now challenges the district court calculation of the applicable sentencing ranges under the united states sentencing guidelines or the guidelines,which the district court considered in determining the length of macarthur sentence.he claims that the district court erred three times by treating two prior burglary convictions as crimes of violence so as to raise his base offense level to under a of the guidelines by denying him credit for acceptance of responsibility under and by applying an obstruction of justice enhancement under macarthur also makes several pro se supplemental claims.
for the reasons explained below,we affirm the sentence.
because this appeal follows a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the colloquy,the presentence investigation report psi report,and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.united states cintr√≥n echautegui,cir.
on january,a maine state trooper observed on interstate a moving vehicle displaying a license plate that was obscured by dirt.when the trooper activated his emergency lights,the vehicle which was being driven by macarthur sped away.during the ensuing chase,macarthur drove through red lights and intersections at high rates of speed,passing other vehicles at speeds of up to miles per hour.law enforcement eventually slowed macarthur by deploying a spike strip that punctured one of his tires.macarthur,nevertheless,pressed on,crossing into an oncoming lane of traffic at one point and hitting a bridge guardrail.the trooper eventually stopped macarthur vehicle by ramming it off the road.once the vehicle was stopped,macarthur fled on foot.giving chase,law enforcement caught macarthur and placed him under arrest.
after macarthur arrest,local police retrieved a firearm that had been spotted in a snowbank near the scene of the arrest,plus a second firearm found in a riverbank near where macarthur vehicle with windows opened in the cold winter weather had swerved during the chase.the firearms had been stolen in a burglary shortly before macarthur arrest.each firearm had magazines inserted in them that would hold more than fifteen rounds of ammunition.
macarthur was federally indicted on may,and pled guilty on november.on march,the district court sentenced macarthur to concurrent terms of imprisonment of and months.
between indictment and sentencing for his federal offenses,macarthur found himself in jail on state charges.during that imprisonment,macarthur assaulted a corrections officer.that assault occurred after macarthur refused to comply with an order to return to his cell during a lockdown and obstructed the efforts of a corrections officer who attempted to close macarthur cell door.when the corrections officer grabbed macarthur by the lapels and pushed him back into his cell,macarthur began hitting the corrections officer in the face with a closed fist.records from the penobscot county jail reflect that macarthur had also been involved in numerous other fights while in custody 
ii.discussion 
counting macarthur prior burglary convictions as crimes of violence 
macarthur challenges the district court decision to count two prior convictions as crimes of violence under,thereby raising his base offense level to.the applicable term crime of violence is defined as 
a ny offense under federal or state law,punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,that 
has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,or 
is burglary of a dwelling,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
cmt.a.macarthur was convicted at least twice of burglary under maine law.the question is whether he was convicted of burglary of a dwelling,as is necessary to render burglary a crime of violence under.we begin our answer to this question by looking at the maine statute defining burglary.ann.tit.a.that statute provides that a person is guilty of burglary if 
a.the person enters or surreptitiously remains in a structure knowing that that person is not licensed or privileged to do so,with the intent to commit a crime therein.violation of this paragraph is a class c crime or 
b.the person violates paragraph a and 
the violation is against a structure that is a dwelling place.violation of this subparagraph is a class b crime.
this definition of burglary describes at least two alternative offenses,only one of which includes,as an element of the offense,the entry or unauthorized presence in a dwelling.so if we know only that a person has been convicted in maine of burglary,we do not know whether that person has been convicted of the type of burglary that constitutes a crime of violence under.when confronted with ambiguity such as this arising out of a criminal offense that divides into alternative forms with materially differing elements,our established practice is to try to discern,if possible,which of a statute alternative elements formed the basis of the defendant prior conviction.descamps united states.in making this attempt,we look only to limited materials,often called shepard documents,from the convicting court,such as charging documents,plea agreements,plea colloquies,and jury instructions.united states serrano mercado,cir citing descamps.at.
but here,as in serrano mercado,this analysis is frustrated because the prosecution did not proactively tender any shepard documents,while macarthur,in turn,voiced no objection either to the absence of such documents or to classification of his burglary offenses as crimes of violence.see id.at.mcarthur now belatedly argues that,without proper shepard documents officially confirming the relevant nature of his convictions,the district court erred in finding them to be for crimes of violence.
such an unpreserved argument failed in serrano mercado,and fails here on plain error review.indeed,the record here provides grist for an argument that macarthur has actually waived any argument that he was not convicted of burglarizing two dwellings.see united states jimenez,cir united states turbides leonardo,cir.most notably,while the psr neither appended nor expressly referred to any state court document,and listed the offenses as burglary,it also included a concise and unambiguous description of each offense.in each instance the psr listed the formal offense,the date of conviction,the case number,and an express statement that macarthur was convicted of entering a dwelling or a home,naming in each instance the occupant or owner of the dwelling or home.macarthur and his collectively would know whether macarthur had burglarized an actual no objection,nor even demanded additional proof.rather,they raised other objections to the psr.macarthur thereafter filed two sentencing memoranda,and he appeared at sentencing with counsel.at the hearing,the district court carefully confirmed that macarthur had read the entire psr and that counsel had explained it to him.the following colloquy then took place 
but you do understand that,as i told you quite a little while ago,that there are matters in the report that reflect your criminal history,your background,where you were born and brought up,your schooling,your education,your work history,things of that sort,have you had an opportunity to review your background 
the defendant yes,sir.
the court it also describes in some detail the nature of the here.have you had an opportunity to review the description of the offenses 
the defendant yes,sir.
the court now,you realize,macarthur,that i am going to rely on the contents of the report in determining your sentence.you understand that.
the defendant yes,sir.
the court knowing that the contents of the report may affect your sentence,is
