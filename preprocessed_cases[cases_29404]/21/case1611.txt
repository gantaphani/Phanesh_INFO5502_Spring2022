petitioner giuseppe spina appeals from a final judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut robert chatigny,judge,entered on may,which dismissed his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to.see spina dist.of homeland,wl.may,dist.lexis,at.spina,a citizen of italy and for more than thirty years a lawful permanent resident of the united states,filed a habeas petition challenging a deportation order of the immigration and naturalization service ins which order was based on spina connecticut conviction for manslaughter in connection with the stabbing death of his estranged wife.spina charged the ins with erroneously deeming him ineligible for discretionary relief from deportation pursuant to c of the immigration and nationality act ina,codified at c,on the ground that he had served a term of imprisonment of at least five years.although the district court rejected this argument,spina here pursues two challenges to the calculation of his served time of imprisonment,both of which must succeed for him to secure relief from this court.spina submits that time he spent in detention was not served as part of the term of imprisonment imposed upon conviction and,therefore,can not count toward accrual of c bar and that,pursuant to edwards ins,cir,time he spent in custody also can not count toward accrual of the c bar,at least for the period spina administratively challenged the ins initial erroneous retroactive application to his case of the amendment to c effected by d of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat.
in accordance with the real id act of,a,stat,codified at a,we convert spina appeal to a petition for review by this court of the challenged ins rulings.pursuant to that review,we resolve spina first argument against him on the merits,holding that the time he spent in detention between may,and march,may be calculated together with the time he spent in detention between march,and september,the date of the original immigration judge ij ruling,to support the conclusion that he was then ineligible for c relief because he had served a term of imprisonment of at least five years.c.accordingly,we deny his petition for review on that ground without addressing his second point.
background 
spina connecticut conviction and incarceration for manslaughter 
in,giuseppe spina,then a native of italy,was admitted to the united states as a lawful permanent resident.some years later,on may,spina went to the home of his estranged wife in rocky hill,connecticut,and stabbed her to death with a kitchen knife.arrested at the scene of the crime,spina was initially charged in connecticut state court with one count of murder.because he could not meet the bail set for his release,spina remained in detention through the conclusion of his criminal case.
on february,spina disposed of the murder charge against him by entering a plea of nolo contendere to the lesser crime of manslaughter.see.a.on march,the state court entered a judgment of conviction sentencing spina to a term of incarceration,whereupon he was transferred to the custody of the state penal system.as of the date of conviction,spina had spent slightly less than months in detention.pursuant to state law,on march,prison authorities automatically credited spina with this detention period,thereby reducing by days the time he would have to remain in prison on the imposed sentence.see.a 
spina deportation proceedings 
federal immigration law authorizes the removal from the united states of any alien who has been convicted of an aggravated felony.a a iii.pursuant to this statute,on june,the ins issued spina an order to show cause why he should not be deported in light of his conviction for manslaughter the ensuing deportation proceedings were both lengthy and complex.we summarize them briefly to provide some background to this appeal.
the initial ij ruling 
spina initially appeared before an ij on the order to show cause on july.following two unopposed adjournments,his removal hearing was held on september.at that hearing,spina did not challenge the fact of his manslaughter conviction or its qualification as an aggravated felony instead,he applied for discretionary relief from removal pursuant to ina c.
prior to the enactment of aedpa and the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act iirira,stat.codified in scattered sections of,section c of the ina had granted the attorney general discretionary power to waive the deportation of certain lawful permanent residents,even those convicted of aggravated felonies,provided they had not yet served a term of imprisonment of at least five years on such a felony conviction see,edwards ins,at noting that,for many aliens,c constituted the only possible way of securing relief from deportation ins,cir.by order dated september,the ij ruled that spina was ineligible for c relief in light of aedpa d,which amended c to make discretionary relief from removal unavailable to persons convicted of certain offenses,including aggravated felonies accordingly,the ij ordered spina deported to italy.
proceedings before the bia 
on october,spina appealed his deportation order to the board of immigration appeals bia,challenging the retroactive application of aedpa d to his case.on july,the bia returned spina case to the ij,requesting a decision specifically addressing aedpa retroactive applicability.before the ij acted on the remand,this court resolved the issue,holding in henderson ins,cir,that aedpa d was not intended to apply retroactively to aliens,like spina,whose deportation proceedings commenced before aedpa went into effect on april.see also ins cyr,d holding that,despite aedpa and iirira,c relief remains available for aliens whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who would have been eligible for such relief at the time of their plea under the law then in effect.in light of henderson,on march,the ij reopened spina deportation proceeding for a determination of whether or not c relief should be available to him.in re giuseppe spina,immig.boston.on february,a newly assigned ij concluded that the bia remand order did not,in fact,afford jurisdiction for an ij to reopen spina deportation proceeding accordingly,the ij certified spina case to the bia for it to reconsider his c challenge in light of henderson.
the bia accepted the certification and,relying on henderson,concluded that the original ij had erred in retroactively applying aedpa to spina already pending deportation proceeding to hold him ineligible for c relief.nevertheless,the bia declined to afford spina any relief on appeal because,at the time of its may,hearing,he had now served more than years in prison on an aggravated felony conviction,a circumstance that disqualified him from c relief even before the enactment of aedpa.in re giuseppe spina,bia may.spina subsequently filed a motion to reopen,which was also denied by the bia.in re giuseppe spina,bia.
spina habeas corpus petition 
spina challenged the bia decision by petitioning the district court for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to.in that petition,spina did not dispute that c relief was,in fact,unavailable to an alien who had served five years in prison for an aggravated felony.rather,he argued that the bia erred as a matter of law in dismissing his appeal because,at the time the ins order to show cause was issued in,he had not yet served five years imprisonment.the district court rejected this argument,holding that the relevant date for calculating the bar was may,when the bia affirmed the immigration judge decision at that time,spina had served more than five years in prison.spina dist.of homeland,wl,dist.lexis,at.spina timely appealed.
d.the decision in edwards ins 
on december,after spina appeal had been filed but before argument,this court issued its ruling in edwards ins.edwards held that,in cases in which an alien accrued more than five years imprisonment subsequent to an ins denial of c relief on the erroneous ground that aedpa amendment or iirira repeal of that statute applied retroactively,the alien was entitled to nunc pro tunc relief because agency error would otherwise result in an alien being deprived of the opportunity to seek c relief.id.at in light of edwards,spina has retailored his habeas challenge,arguing on appeal that he too is entitled to nunc pro tunc relief under c.in advancing this argument,spina confronts two hurdles,both of which he must clear to succeed on this appeal.
first,spina case is distinguishable from edwards in that,on september,when the ij initially denied spina c relief on the erroneous assumption that it was barred by aedpa d,spina had already spent more than five years in custody nearly months in detention and just over months in postconviction imprisonment.as edwards observed,agency error would not result in an alien being deprived of the opportunity to seek deportation relief where the alien would have independently been barred at the time of the error from applying for the form of relief at issue.id.at emphasis in original.edwards,however,specifically left open the question whether time accrued in pretrial detention should be counted in calculating whether the c five year bar applies.id.at.spina urges us to rule that it does not.
were spina to persuade us on this he does not for reasons discussed further in this would then face a second hurdle in pursuing nunc pro tunc relief.unlike the edwards petitioners,spina had already spent five years in imprisonment when the bia rejected his administrative appeal on may.edwards express ed no views on whether an award of nunc pro tunc relief would be similarly warranted where the alien accrued more than five years imprisonment during the pendency of administrative appeals.id.at.accordingly,spina urges us to hold that nunc pro tunc relief is available even in such circumstances.
spina deportation to italy 
on april,while spina appeal was pending and he was still serving his connecticut manslaughter sentence,he moved in this court for a stay of removal pending appeal,which motion,being unopposed,was granted on may.soon thereafter,spina apparently changed his mind and moved to lift the stay so that,upon his release from state prison,he could be promptly deported to italy rather than detained further by federal immigration authorities.in so moving,spina emphasized that any deportation would still be involuntary,that he was not waiving his appellate rights,and that any lifting of the stay should be without prejudice to the rights he asserts in this litigation.on july,with the government consent,this court granted spina motion.accordingly,soon after spina august,release from connecticut state prison,federal immigration authorities deported him to italy.
ii.discussion 
jurisdictional issues 
before reaching the merits of spina petition,we are obliged to consider the jurisdictional effect of two events occurring during its pendency the enactment of the real id act of and spina deportation to italy.see travelers ins.carpenter,cir w here jurisdiction is questionable we are obliged to examine the question sua sponte.
the real id act 
on may,congress enacted the real id act,which,among other things,eliminates habeas corpus jurisdiction over final orders of deportation,exclusion,and removal,and provides that a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of such orders,a,stat,codified at a.in gittens menifee,this court ruled that appeals involving habeas corpus petitions pending before this court on the effective date of the real id act are properly converted to petitions for review and retained by this court,cir alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.because spina appeal,filed on june,was plainly pending before this court on may,we convert his habeas corpus petition into a petition for review and proceed to address its merits.see id.at holding that we may resolve newly converted petitions without remand to the district court.
in doing so,we are mindful that the real id act states that judicial review of an order of removal is available only where another court has not decided the validity of the order,unless the reviewing court finds that the petition presents grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceeding or that the remedy provided by the prior proceeding was inadequate or ineffective to test the validity of the order.id.at quoting d.we have not previously had occasion to consider the applicability of this language to a district court merits ruling that is the subject of the habeas appeal that we convert to a petition for review.this issue was not squarely presented in gittens menifee because the habeas petition in that case came before this court only for the purposes of gatekeeping review under the aedpa,without any disputed merits ruling by the district court.id.at.in this case,however,the district court rejected spina habeas petition on its merits.
like the third circuit,we here conclude that congress clear intent in enacting the real id act,to have all challenges to removal orders heard in a single forum,the courts of appeals,is best effected by treating a district court merits decision on a converted habeas petition as,and by proceeding ourselves to address the merits of the challenged removal order.bonhometre gonzales,cir in view of the atypical procedural posture of this case and the effect of the real id act,we will consider the district court opinion to be,and will address the procedural due process claims raised by the petitioner in his opening brief to the district court as if they were raised in a petition for review before us in the first instance.accordingly,because,consistent with congress intent,we now review the bia decision,not the district court denial of habeas relief,we conclude that d does not deprive us of jurisdiction.gonzales,cir noting that conversion of habeas petition pending on appeal to a petition for review changes the decision we review,and we now review the bia decision,not the district court orders.
spina deportation to italy 
nor does spina deportation to italy affect our constitutional or statutory subject matter jurisdiction.as to the former,swaby ashcroft holds that an alien seeking c relief presents a live case or controversy even where the alien has been deported if he still faces a statutory bar to reentry,cir.an alien such as spina,convicted of an aggravated felony,generally faces a lifetime reentry bar,id.at see a a,a a,unless he receives relief from removal such as was afforded by c.thus,because a remand by this court to the ins for fresh consideration of spina c application would afford him at least a chance of reentering the united states,that chance is sufficient to give him the personal stake in this litigation necessary to allay any constitutional jurisdictional concerns.swaby ashcroft,at internal quotation marks omitted.
as for our statutory jurisdiction,although c had provided that an order of deportation shall not be reviewed by any court if the alien has departed from the united states after issuance of the order,that provision was repealed effective april.see iirira,stat.no statute currently in force makes the alien presence in the united states a jurisdictional prerequisite for our consideration of questions of law raised upon a petition for review.a d see moore ashcroft,cir under the former provisions of the ina judicial review was statutorily barred for aliens who had been deported from the united states or who voluntarily departed pending review of the removal order noticeably absent from the iirira permanent rules,however,is any similar language removing federal review jurisdiction in the event an alien departs or is removed.tapia garcia ins,cir stating that deportation no longer forecloses judicial review.spina petition falls within a d because he contends that the ins erred as a matter of law in the means it used to determine that he was ineligible for c relief.
accordingly,despite the enactment of the real id act and spina deportation,we maintain subject matter jurisdiction in this case.
spina claim for nunc pro tunc relief 
spina had already served five years imprisonment for manslaughter at the time the ij initially denied him c relief 
spina argument for nunc pro tunc relief depends,in the first instance,on his ability to demonstrate that,at the time of the ij legally erroneous september,ruling,he was,in fact,eligible for c relief.see edwards ins,at holding that alien whose c application was initially denied on a legally erroneous ground is not entitled to nunc pro tunc remedy if he was actually ineligible for c relief on the date of the ij erroneous ruling.as spina concedes,by its terms,c makes an alien ineligible for its discretionary relief if he has served a term of at least five years imprisonment for a felony conviction.spina submits that this bar does not apply in this case because,as of september,he had served only months in custody.he insists that the additional months he spent in detention are not properly considered part of his term of imprisonment in calculating the applicability of the c bar to his case.we disagree.
connecticut law does not control our determination of whether spina had served five years of his term of imprisonment for manslaughter under ina c 
preliminarily,we observe that neither c nor the definitional section of the ina,see c,expressly states whether detention constitutes part of the term of imprisonment served for a felony conviction in arguing that his preconviction detention does not constitute time served on his term of imprisonment,spina relies on connecticut law,specifically,connecticut general statute a,which,he submits,draws a clear distinction between the time a defendant spends in confinement and the time he begins serving a term of imprisonment 
any person who is confined to a community correctional center or a correctional institution for an offense committed on or after july,because such person is unable to obtain bail or is denied bail shall,if subsequently imprisoned,earn a reduction of such person sentence equal to the number of days which such person spent in such facility from the time such person was placed in presentence confinement to the time such person began serving the term of imprisonment imposed.
a emphasis added.
spina argument rests on a flawed assumption that connecticut law controls the application of c to his case.in fact,the principle is well established that,unless congress plainly manifests an intent to incorporate diverse state laws into a federal statute,the meaning of a federal statute should not be dependent on state law.united states turley,d emphasis added accord dickerson new banner,d noting presumption that when congress enacts a statute,it does not intend to make its application dependent on state law internal quotation marks omitted.
applying this principle in taylor united states,d,a case in which a sentencing enhancement depended on whether a defendant had previously been convicted of a specified violent felony,to wit,burglary,e b ii,the supreme court ruled that application of the e enhancement did not depend on the particular definition of burglary adopted by the state of conviction,but on a uniform definition of burglary to be derived by federal courts from the generally accepted contemporary meaning of the term.taylor united states,at.see also williams taylor,d we give the words of a statute their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended them to bear some different import.internal quotation marks omitted.our court has followed suit.in sui ins,we cited taylor in stating that congress did not intend to allow the ina definition of attempt to vary solely according to the labels applied by the jurisdiction in which an alien was charged,cir.indeed,we have specifically observed that t he immigration laws contain no provision indicat ing that they are to be interpreted in accordance with state law.united states campbell,cir holding that whether person has been convicted of an aggravated felony within the language of b is necessarily a question of federal,not state,law,despite the fact that the predicate offense and its punishment are defined by the law of the state internal quotation marks omitted.
accordingly,we need not here decide whether we agree with spina construction of connecticut general statute a because that state law does not,in any event,control our construction of ina c united states ramirez,cir the fact that new york nominally distinguishes between probation and conditional discharge is of limited relevance to defining the meaning of the term probation as used in c a of the federal sentencing guidelines.rather,we look beyond the language of any individual state law to identify the generally accepted contemporary understanding of whether credited detention is appropriately viewed as part of the time served on a term of imprisonment.taylor united states,at.
time spent in detention that is credited against a term of imprisonment is commonly understood to be part of the time served for the felony crime 
applying that principle to this case,we note that the federal government,fifty states,and the district of columbia provide by statute,rule,or court decision that time spent by a defendant in detention is to be treated as a credit or reduction of the term of imprisonment imposed upon conviction this unanimity is strong evidence of a common understanding that,after judgment,any credited detention effectively becomes time served on the imposed term of imprisonment.see,taylor united states,at.construing burglary,as used in federal statute,in the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most states perrin united states,d observing that bribery,as used in federal statute,has contemporary meaning adopted i n states and in federal legislation.indeed,when courts sentence defendants in detention to time served,it is generally understood that the custody thereby becomes the term of imprisonment imposed by the judgment.see united states,cir holding that time served sentence constituted sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days where defendant had served days in detention united states atkinson,cir holding that,where court suspended prison term except for days detention,that time became served sentence for purposes of calculating sentencing guidelines rodriguez united states,d,a judge sentence of time served necessarily incorporates the time a defendant was imprisoned prior to trial,unless specifically stated otherwise.
in urging a different conclusion,spina argues that some states,notably kansas,specifically provide for the commencement of a sentence to be to allow for time spent in detention.see.stat.ann.in connecticut and most other jurisdictions,however,a sentence dates from the judgment of conviction.in such circumstances,spina submits,detention should not be viewed as time served on a term of imprisonment not yet imposed.indeed,he notes that a prisoner can earn sentence credits or reductions for reasons unrelated to time spent in custody,for example,good behavior.spina arguments are unconvincing.
a credit for good behavior allows a defendant to avoid incarceration altogether for the period in question a credit or reduction for detention,however,recognizes that a defendant has already spent the specified period of time in jail.connecticut itself acknowledges this distinction.as we have already noted,supra at,connecticut supreme court has observed that a good behavior credit serves to reduce the time a prisoner must serve pursuant to a sentence,whereas a credit for detention permit s the prisoner,in effect,to commence serving his sentence from the time he was compelled to remain in custody.holmquist manson,discussing connecticut good time,or good behavior,statute.in sum,whether a jurisdiction,like kansas,treats custody as a basis for expressly the start of a defendant prison term,or whether,like connecticut,it applies a credit or reduction to a prison term that dates from conviction,the end result is the same every day the defendant spent in custody is treated as a day served on the term of imprisonment.see taylor united states,at.looking to substance of state law,not labels,in discerning contemporary meaning of words used in federal statute.
accordingly,we conclude that when,as in this case,a defendant is credited with time served in detention,thereby reducing on a basis the remaining time he will have to serve on his term of imprisonment,that detention is plainly understood to be part of the term of imprisonment served for the felony crime of conviction,regardless of whether the result is to make the defendant eligible for earlier release from confinement or ineligible for discretionary relief pursuant to ina c.
spina argument for treating detention as a served part of the term of imprisonment only at the conclusion of that term 
spina argues that,even if detention is treated as time served on a term of imprisonment,fairness dictates that such time should accrue for purposes of ina c only at the end,not the beginning,of a defendant sentence.otherwise,he submits,there could be an unfair distinction in the c eligibility of aliens convicted of the same crime and sentenced on the same date to identical terms of imprisonment if one of the aliens had served time in detention and the other had not.specifically,the alien who had served detention would become ineligible for c relief sooner than the alien who had not.the argument is unconvincing.
preliminarily,we observe that the unfairness alleged by spina must be viewed in context.if prompt crediting of detention accelerates an alien ineligibility for c relief,it also accelerates his eligibility for certain programs and for release itself.we do not understand spina to be urging delayed accrual of detention time for these beneficial purposes.nor does he point us to any authority to support the assignment of different accrual times for detention depending on the benefit to the defendant.
even if spina could present a more compelling claim of unfairness,however,his delayed accrual argument would fail for a more fundamental reason it is at odds with the common understanding of the language of c.that statute renders an alien ineligible for discretionary relief if he has served at least five years of the term of imprisonment imposed for an aggravated felony conviction.the plain meaning of served as used in connection with a period of incarceration is to have put in a specified amount of time.webster third new int l dictionary ed.see william rudkin testamentary trust comm r,cir.we give the words of a statute their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning,absent an indication congress intended them to bear some different import.quoting williams taylor,at.plainly,spina had put in days of custody by march,the date he was sentenced.indeed,connecticut credited this time against his term of imprisonment on march,in short,within days of judgment moreover,spina points us to no jurisdiction that does not credit a defendant with detention soon after judgment.thus,it would defy common sense to conclude that spina had not,in fact,served his time until more than a decade later.united states,cir holding,in context of sentencing guidelines,that time served sentence reflects a specific term of amount of time actually served on the date of pronouncement emphasis added.
spina nevertheless asserts that the rule of lenity and the doctrine of constitutional avoidance support his delayed accrual argument.these doctrines have no application where,as in this case,traditional rules of construction permit us to conclude that there is no ambiguity in the statute.see muscarello united states,d the rule of lenity applies only if,after seizing everything from which aid can be derived,we can make no more than a guess as to what congress intended.internal quotation marks omitted clark martinez,d the canon of constitutional avoidance comes into play only when,after the application of ordinary textual analysis,the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction.the language of c plainly contemplates that detention qualifies as time served immediately upon crediting or reduction.in this case,consistent with common practice,that crediting or reduction occurred soon after judgment.thus,the statute does not contemplate delaying accrual to the end of spina sentence.
section c does not violate due process or equal protection 
spina submits that,if ina c is construed to include credited detention as time served on a term of imprisonment,the statute is unconstitutional because it subjects detainees to punishment without the procedural safeguards of trial or the knowing waiver of these safeguards in connection with a guilty plea in violation of due process,and impermissibly discriminates among alien defendants based on their financial ability to post bail in violation of equal protection.see,amend.v.we disagree.
due process 
spina cites bell wolfish,d,to support his claim that if pretrial detention counts toward the five years referenced in c,he is thereby subjected to punishment in violation of due process.appellant br.at.in fact,the due process concern identified in bell wolfish related to punishment imposed on pretrial detainees without the procedural safeguards of trial.at.that concern is not applicable here.the ineligibility bar for discretionary relief established in c applies only to persons who have actually been convicted of felony crimes,not to persons who are simply pretrial detainees.
in any event,spina does that the alleged reduction in his window of c eligibility was established for the purpose of punishment,a factor critical to bell analysis.id.at.a court must decide whether the disability is imposed for the purpose of punishment or whether it is but an incident of some other legitimate government purpose.here,any reduction is incidental to c goal to bring more uniformity to the treatment of alien defendants whose criminal conduct is sufficiently serious that they actually serve five years imprisonment,without regard to whether that service or judgment.see generally giusto ins,cir observing that c bar was part of an effort to broaden the list of serious crimes,which preclude certain benefits under the ina,and further noting that release on parole prior to serving five years may well indicate circumstances suggesting that although convicted of a felony defined as aggravated,the alien should receive relatively lenient treatment internal quotation marks omitted quoting conf,at,reprinted in.
equal protection 
as for spina equal protection challenge,we observe that c eligibility bar draws no irrational,much less invidious or suspect,distinctions among the persons to whom it applies.to the contrary,the statute applies to any aggravated felon who has served at least five years of his term of imprisonment.this classification rationally relates to the aforementioned congressional purpose to bar serious criminals from c relief.see giusto ins,at see also fiallo bell,d holding that congress classifications among aliens will be upheld against an equal protection challenge if there is a facially legitimate and bona fide reason for the classifications quoting kleindienst mandel,d skelly ins,cir upholding legislative scheme deporting certain aliens but not others against equal protection challenge if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it internal quotations omitted.thus,we need not consider whether congress might have employed more precise language or other classifications better to achieve its goal.see mourning family publ ns,d holding that under rational basis review,i t is not a function of the courts to speculate as to whether the statute is unwise or whether the evils sought to be remedied could better have been regulated in some other manner.
spina nevertheless insists that c discriminates against indigent aliens because only those who can not afford to post bail have their time in detention treated as part of their served term of imprisonment,thereby subjecting them to c ineligibility sooner than comparably culpable aliens who can afford bail.we are not persuaded.because c is facially neutral,spina must show more than a disparate impact on indigents to establish a denial of equal protection he must demonstrate discriminatory purpose.see harris mcrae,d w hen a facially neutral statute is challenged on equal protection grounds,challenger must prove that congress selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of,
