in this criminal appeal,the defendant challenges both her conviction on the ground of instructional error and her sentence on the ground of a error.after a thorough review of the record and the applicable law,we affirm the defendant conviction but vacate her sentence.the tale follows.
we begin with the denouement.in april of,a federal grand jury charged altagracia with attempted transport and concealment of illegal aliens,see a,and trafficking in false identification documents,see a.these charges stemmed from her involvement with rafael cintrón,a defrocked police officer who became a government informant after pleading guilty to an charge.
the pertinent facts are as follows.the defendant first met cintrón in.while she piously protests that they did not pool their efforts to transport illegal aliens until january of,cintrón says that they collogued together from the start.we need not resolve this conflict for present purposes,it suffices that,by all accounts,the joint enterprise was velivolant no later than january of.an event that is crucial to this appeal occurred at that time cintrón reassured the defendant that,notwithstanding his earlier arrest of which she had recently become aware,she would not be brought to book for the criminal activities that the two of them were planning to undertake.
this brings us to the offense conduct.between january and april of,cintrón and the defendant arranged the transport of four illegal aliens.the defendant was the principal contact for the aliens.with the assistance of a man named domingo,she gathered information about them,collected payments from them,and obtained false identification documents for them.she then transferred the money,the papers,and the aliens to cintrón with directions about which airline tickets should be purchased.
according to the plan,cintrón was to purchase the tickets and escort the aliens through san juan major international airport,bypassing the usual security checkpoints.cintrón,however,was cooperating with the authorities,and the defendant activities led only to her arrest.an indictment followed.
pretrial proceedings were unremarkable.cintrón was the government star witness at the trial.at the close of the evidence,the defendant renewed her earlier request for an entrapment instruction,claiming that cintrón assurances had induced her to participate in the criminal venture.the district court refused to instruct on entrapment,and the jury found the defendant guilty on all counts.
the district court continued the case for sentencing and ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report psi report.the court convened the disposition hearing on april.in making its guideline computations,the court adopted a recommendation put forth in the psi report and applied a enhancement based on the defendant role in the offenses of conviction.see ussg c.the adjusted offense level,when combined with the defendant criminal history category,yielded a guideline sentencing range of months.the court proceeded to impose a sentence at the top of the range months.this timely appeal ensued.
the defendant claim of instructional error is easily dispatched.she argues that she was entitled to a jury instruction on entrapment because that was her main theory of defense and the record contained adequate evidence to support it.we do not agree.
it is often said that a criminal defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on her theory of the case.but that aphorism is not a universal truth to warrant a jury instruction on a specific theory of defense,the evidence adduced at trial,taken in the light most flattering to the accused,must plausibly support the theory.see united states gamache,cir united states rodriguez,cir.
where,as here,a criminal defendant seasonably requests an instruction on a particular theory of the case and the trial court flatly refuses to submit that theory to the jury,our review is plenary.see united states nishnianidze,cir rodriguez,at.this strain of appellate review does not permit differential factfinding but,rather,turns upon an inquiry into the sufficiency of the evidence in the case.rodriguez,at.the burden is on the defendant,as the proponent of the theory,to identify evidence adduced during the trial that suffices to satisfy this standard.see id.at.
we have had occasion to apply this framework to efforts to deploy an entrapment defense.when that defense is in issue,the test of evidentiary sufficiency has two facets.see united states capelton,cir.to warrant an instruction on entrapment,the evidence must be sufficient to support both a finding that the government wrongfully induced the unlawful conduct and a finding that the defendant lacked a predisposition to engage in that conduct.see,united states gifford,cir rodriguez,at.the defendant can not pass this binary test.
here,the claim of inducement rests exclusively on the january conversation between cintrón and the defendant.as the defendant envisions it,cintrón lured her into committing the crime by assuring her that nothing could happen to her because he was a police officer.appellant br.at.in our view,however,this solitary piece of evidence leaves the defendant well short of the finish line.
we repeatedly have held that the simple solicitation of a criminal act or the mere provision of an opportunity to engage in one does not meet the threshold requirement for a finding of wrongful inducement.see,capelton,at gifford,at.empty promises that a crime,once committed,will produce no adverse repercussions fall into the same category.telling a person that she will not be caught does not lead her to believe that the conduct is lawful or that she will be in jeopardy if she refuses to go along it is,rather,simply a way of making the opportunity to commit the crime more attractive.such promises,therefore,are not the stuff of which inducement can be fashioned.see united states evans,cir stating that inducement will lie only when the government offers the sorts of promises that would blind the ordinary person to his legal duties united states davis,cir explaining that law enforcement officers are not precluded from utilizing artifice and stealth to apprehend criminals,provided that they merely afford opportunities or facilities for the commission of the offense by one predisposed or ready to commit it.inducement requires something akin to excessive pressure,threats,or the exploitation of an unfair advantage.see united states luisi,cir united states gendron,cir breyer.
in this instance,the defendant version of her conversation with cintrón is uncontradicted.taking what was said at face value,a finding of inducement simply will not lie.on that basis alone,the district court unwillingness to instruct on entrapment was entirely appropriate 
we turn next to the defendant claim of sentencing error.the supreme court landmark decision in united states booker,d,rendered the federal sentencing guidelines advisory.this does not mean,however,that the guidelines are irrelevant in the world.to the contrary,they remain the starting point for most federal sentencing determinations.see united states pelletier,cir united states,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.when an error in the calculation of a defendant guideline range affects or arguably affects the sentence imposed,that error will require resentencing.see united states gobbi,cir united states antonakopoulos,cir.
we review a sentencing court findings of fact for clear error.see united states,cir united states dixon,cir.we afford de novo review,however,to questions of law involved in sentencing determinations.see united states pho,cir.a question about whether the evidence is sufficient to support a particular guideline determination is a question of law and,therefore,engenders de novo review.see dixon,at united states,cir.
in the case at hand,the defendant makes a objection to one part of the lower court sentencing algorithm.this objection takes dead aim at the court embrace of a upward adjustment for role in the offense recommended in the psi report.the operative guideline provision applies to a defendant who is shown by a preponderance of the evidence to be an organizer,leader,
