the issues in this case surround the sentencing of scott fink for conspiracy to distribute cocaine under supp.fink participation in the crime was revealed when the government wiretapped a phone beginning may.the wiretaps evidenced fink involvement from that date until july,when fink was arrested for violating probation in an unrelated case.on december,a federal grand jury returned a indictment charging fink and five others with violation of fink pleaded guilty without a plea agreement before judge rya zobel on may.at fink december,sentencing hearing,the district court ruled that fink was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum under b b supp,but that he was not eligible for career offender treatment under the united states sentencing guidelines ussg.the district court sentenced fink to ten years in prison and ten years of supervised release.
fink appeals his sentence.he argues that b b is unconstitutional and that,alternatively,the facts of his case render it inapplicable to him.the government cross appeals the sentence,alleging error in the district court refusal to treat fink as a career offender under the ussg.we reject fink arguments that the statutory minimum in b b does not apply.we are persuaded,however,by the government position that it should have been granted a continuance on fink career offender status and,therefore,vacate fink sentence and remand this case for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
background 
fink presentence report psr,which was first issued on august,and later updated on november,stated that fink should be held accountable at sentencing for grams of cocaine.it also catalogued his multiple prior convictions for breaking and entering,larceny,car theft,assault and battery with a dangerous weapon,assault and battery with intent to murder,and abuse prevention order violations,resisting arrest,possession of cocaine,possession of marijuana,and probation violations.
a.the first contested psr recommendation 
the psr recommended that fink be treated as a career offender under chapter of the sentencing guidelines,an approach that would result in a higher advisory guideline sentencing range gsr for fink.section a of the sentencing guidelines sets forth preconditions that must be present if a defendant is to be considered a career offender.a.one of these preconditions requires that the defendant have at least two prior felony convictions for either a or a offense.a.in its discussion of fink career offender status,the psr specifically identified three prior convictions from fink criminal record that could serve as career offender predicates.the first was a bristol county conviction for assault and battery with intent to murder,and the other two were december fall river convictions for resisting arrest and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon the december convictions.
on december,fink notified the district court that the two december convictions could not be career offender predicates because a state court since vacated those convictions.
some additional background is required to understand the complicated facts surrounding this aspect of the parties sentencing dispute.fink pleaded guilty to assault and battery in fall river district court in massachusetts on february,the february conviction,and was sentenced to suspended jail time and probation for that offense on april.later that year,fink was charged with four more crimes in fall river district court,including resisting arrest,assault and battery with a dangerous weapon,violating a order,and violating an order.these four charges were combined,or for disposition purposes.fink pleaded guilty to them all at once,and was sentenced to serve two and years in prison in satisfaction of all the charges the four convictions.
all five february conviction and the four in fink psr in a section on his general criminal history.as already noted,two of these convictions also made a second appearance in the psr section on fink career offender status,where they were specifically flagged,along with the bristol county conviction,as predicates.
after pleading guilty in the present case,fink moved to withdraw his state court guilty pleas in the four state convictions that raised the specter of career offender status for the present violation,claiming that he had been the victim of a plea colloquy.the state court judge who originally accepted fink guilty pleas in the four convictions in had since retired,so the motion was assigned to fall river district judge gilbert nadeau.judge nadeau granted fink motion in a december,order.significantly,the order was captioned only with the four convictions case numbers.judge nadeau order observed that at the same time fink had pleaded guilty to the four convictions,he had also admitted that they constituted a violation of his probation in the february case.judge nadeau stated that he granted fink motion to withdraw his guilty pleas in the four cases because none of their files contained the tender of plea or admission waiver of rights form that was standard practice in the fall river district court.finally,judge nadeau order observed that fink february conviction file did contain the important plea colloquy form.
fink then pointed out to the district court in the instant prosecution that only one of the convictions specifically flagged in the psr as a qualifying career offender bristol county on his record,and that his record,accordingly,lacked the two convictions that would be necessary to designate him a career offender.one day later,on december,the district court convened a sentencing hearing for fink,and the government responded to the vacated convictions by noting that the february conviction listed in fink psr criminal history qualified as a crime of violence that the district court could weigh in its deliberations.given the developments in the parties career offender arguments,the district court prudently decided to postpone fink sentencing hearing until later in the month.
on december,the government filed a pleading titled memorandum regarding scott fink criminal history,arguing that the february conviction qualified as a crime of violence predicate under of the sentencing guidelines.the government appended the case complaint,criminal docket sheet,and tender of plea for the district court consideration.
the district court convened another sentencing hearing for fink on december.at the hearing,fink argued that the february docket sheet contained an entry dated december,reading d motion to withdraw guilty nadeau.fink argued that the february conviction had,according to its own docket,been vacated and could not,as the government alleged,serve as a career offender predicate.
the government responded that the docket entry had nothing to do with the continuing force of the february conviction.in the government view,the docket entry reflected judge nadeau observation that the vacatur of fink convictions could have implications for his february case insofar as those convictions constituted parole violations for the february conviction.the government pointed out that this docket entry came only one day after judge nadeau order of vacation.the government also asserted that fink never moved to have his guilty plea withdrawn in the february case and offered a copy of the state court criminal file to sustain its point.
fink did not deny that he had never moved to withdraw his guilty plea in the february case.instead,he urged that the words motion to withdraw guilty appearing on the february case docket be taken at face value without any reference to any of the other information submitted to the court by the government.the district court concluded that this approach was mandated by the supreme court in shepard united states,d.
the district court refused to consider the offered copy of the state court criminal file and accepted fink argument that shepard prohibited it from considering evidence outside of the docket entry plain language to interpret its meaning.the government requested a continuance so that it could obtain direct clarification from the massachusetts state court whether the february conviction remained in force,which the district court denied.working only from the docket entry plain language,the district court found the february conviction had been vacated,and refused to qualify it as a career offender predicate.
b.the second contested psr recommendation 
the psr also recommended that the district court sentence fink to a statutory mandatory minimum of ten years to a maximum of life,pursuant to b b,the statute governing the sentencing of fink conviction under.while b standard mandatory minimum is five years,this figure doubles when a defendant has a prior felony drug offense the psr identified fink as having committed a prior felony drug offense in,when he was convicted of cocaine possession in rhode island 
fink did not contest the existence of the conviction,but argued that the underlying conduct had been in furtherance of,and therefore could not be considered as having occurred prior to,the drug conspiracy for which he was about to be sentenced.fink reminded the court that congress intent in passing b b sentence enhancement was to prevent criminal recidivism and argued that he was not a recidivist he argued,in essence,that the district court could not truthfully say that he had gone back to selling drugs for the simple reason that he had never stopped.fink also argued that the district court could not constitutionally invoke the conviction to enhance his drug conspiracy sentence because the cocaine possession offense would not be a felony and trigger the statute if it had occurred in massachusetts instead of rhode island.according to fink,allowing such geographic mischance to inflict a greater sentence upon him than upon a defendant would violate his constitutional right to equal protection.
the district court rejected fink arguments,and ruled that the conviction constituted a prior felony drug offense for the purposes of the b b sentencing enhancement.
c.the district court calculation of fink sentence 
having determined that the february conviction could not be treated as a prior conviction that would serve as a career offender predicate,the district court determined fink gsr using base calculations.the district court concluded that fink total offense level was and his criminal history category was iv,yielding a gsr of seventy to months.having also ruled that the cocaine possession conviction was a prior felony drug offense for the purposes of enhancing fink sentence under b b,the statutory mandatory minimum of ten years governed and the district court sentenced fink to ten years in prison and ten years of supervised release.
fink appeals the district court ruling regarding b b,and also,for the first time on appeal,challenges the order that he serve ten years of supervised release.the government cross appeals the district court ruling on fink career offender status.
discussiona.section b b sentence.incorrect standard of proof challenge 
fink argues that the district court improperly failed to hold the government to its burden of proving that the conviction was distinct from his violation under the reasonable doubt standard.he claims that the government was obligated to indict and put the question to a jury,which he alleges is required by apprendi new jersey,d.he also avers that the government had to convince the district court of the conviction distinctness beyond a reasonable doubt in an evidentiary hearing,which he alleges is required by supp.
it is clear that fink apprendi argument has no merit.in united states coplin,this court ruled that the supreme court decision in united states,d,made clear that a sentence enhancement may be grounded on prior criminal convictions not proven to a jury,cir.fink argument that the government failed to prove the conviction distinctness to the district court beyond a reasonable doubt in a evidentiary hearing is similarly unavailing.the multitude of fragmented sentencing hearings held in this case by a learned and patient district judge who carefully looked at all angles to formulate a reasonable sentence fully complied with the evidentiary hearing requirement.to argue that the sentencing hearings were not evidentiary hearings disregards what happens daily in federal district courts throughout the nation,where district judges hold hearings in the sentencing context to find facts and decide the applicable law.here,we are satisfied that such required hearing took place,irrespective of the label placed to describe it.
equal protection challenge 
fink appeals the district court use of the cocaine possession conviction to increase his sentence,alleging that this ruling violated his right to equal protection under the fifth amendment of the united states constitution.fink complains that b b imposes a much higher jail term upon him for having been convicted and punished in rhode state that considers possession of an eight ball of cocaine to be a felony therefore triggering sentence enhancement than it would upon a criminal defendant arrested in state that does not designate possession of that quantity of cocaine as a felony.it is,therefore,fink position that this aspect of federal sentencing law has worked to arbitrarily discriminate against him simply because he had the misfortune to earn his criminal history in rhode island and not massachusetts.
fink argues that the b b enhancement is subject to a strict scrutiny analysis under his equal protection challenge because the statute implicates his physical liberty.we disagree.this court has subjected a similar sentence enhancement armed career criminal act acca e to review in united states bregnard,cir.section e,which governs sentencing in the context of select firearms possession offenses,outlines a sentence enhancement for convicted persons who bear a history of three previous convictions for violent felonies,serious drug offenses,or a combination thereof.e.as applied,e,like b b,also achieves some disparate results among criminal defendants depending on the states in which they accrued their criminal histories.
in bregnard,a defendant argued that he was denied equal protection of the law when e was used to enhance his sentence due to crimes on his record that qualified as enhancement predicates according to criminal definitions in the state in which they occurred,but that did not qualify as such in all states.bregnard,at.we found that t he mere fact that application of the e enhancement is ultimately predicated on the definition of crimes that may vary from state to state is insufficient to conclude that e violates the equal protection of the law.id.we concluded that i t was entirely rational for congress to structure the statute as it did,and we dismissed the equal protection challenge,as we do here.id.quoting united states houston,cir.
recidivism challenge 
fink also argues that the district court erred when it treated the conviction as a prior felony drug offense for the purposes of imposing a b b sentence enhancement against him.according to fink,the cocaine possession that gave rise to that conviction was conduct in furtherance of,and therefore indistinct from,the cocaine distribution conspiracy that is presently at issue.fink claims that enhancing his sentence for the conspiracy under b b therefore ignores the statute aim of curbing criminal recidivism.according to fink,he is not a recidivist.fink contends that his cocaine possession and conspiracy conviction are both part and parcel of one epic crime that he has remained unwaveringly dedicated to over the course of many years.we apply a clear error standard to the factual determinations of the district court,at.
fink claim that the offense underlying his conviction was in furtherance of conduct that later also gave rise to his violation is an argument that this court has heard,and rejected,on similar facts before.in united states,a defendant convicted of a drug conspiracy charge appealed the district court enhancement of the sentence by reference to b b and two prior felony drug convictions on the defendant record.cir.we repudiated the defendant argument that the two prior felony drug offenses could not serve to enhance the sentence because they were part and parcel of the drug conspiracy,observing that the prior felony drug o
