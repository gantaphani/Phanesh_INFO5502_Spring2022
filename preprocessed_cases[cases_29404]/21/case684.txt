on december,katherine mckenzie pled guilty to distributing five or more grams of cocaine base.the district court sentenced mckenzie to months imprisonment.mckenzie now appeals her sentence,claiming that the district court incorrectly assigned two points to her criminal history category chc score,thus rendering her ineligible for relief under f,and that it improperly credited computerized docket reports showing her past convictions.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
in april,mckenzie and two others sold grams of crack cocaine to an undercover drug enforcement administration agent.mckenzie was arrested and charged with distributing five grams or more of cocaine base and aiding and abetting such conduct,in violation of a and.the statutory mandatory minimum for violations of a involving more than five grams of crack is sixty months imprisonment.b b.a sentence below sixty months can,however,be imposed if the defendant satisfies various enumerated requirements for relief under f.one such requirement is that the defendant criminal history score be zero or one,yielding a chc of 
mckenzie pled guilty as charged,and the district court accepted the guilty plea.the district court adopted the recommended guidelines offense level of nineteen set forth in the probation office report psr.to arrive at that offense level,the court began with a base level of for the charged offense,c reduced the offense level by three for acceptance of responsibility,id.a b and further reduced the offense level by four to reflect mckenzie minimal role in the charged offense,id.a.
the psr also recommended a chc of ii due to mckenzie prior maine state convictions an october conviction of misdemeanor assault for slapping a bar employee in the face and a june conviction of misdemeanor theft for shoplifting sleeping pills and baby diapers from a supermarket.the proof proffered for these two convictions was the maine state court electronic docket record,which was attested to by a maine court official as authentic.
an offense level of nineteen combined with a chc of ii yielded an advisory guideline sentencing range gsr of to months.the psr recommended,however,that the gsr be amended to sixty months,in accordance with the statutory minimum for mckenzie conviction under b b.
at sentencing,mckenzie objected to several aspects of the psr,including the calculation of her chc and criminal history score and her consequent lack of eligibility.specifically,mckenzie took issue with the use of electronic docket records to prove her two prior maine convictions.mckenzie also focused particular attention on the shoplifting conviction and argued that it should not have counted for criminal history purposes.the government maintained that a chc of ii was appropriate,and that the shoplifting conviction had to factor into mckenzie criminal history score because in united states spaulding,cir,we held that the potential for physical confrontation made it impossible to conclude that shoplifting was similar to certain offenses excluded from chc calculations under c.id.at.
the district court found the facts as set forth in the psr,ruled that the psr properly calculated the two maine convictions,and accepted the computerized docket reports as sufficient proof of the convictions.the court also held that it was bound to count the shoplifting conviction in mckenzie chc because of our holding in spaulding.the court did,however,grant the government motion under for substantial assistance,which recommended that mckenzie receive a downward departure from the statutory minimum.the court went much further and gave mckenzie a downward departure,resulting in a month sentence.the court reasons for this departure centered on mckenzie tragic childhood and vulnerable psychological condition,threats made to her in jail over the prospect that she might testify against others,and the fact that she was pregnant and had a small child.
on appeal,mckenzie challenges her sentence on two grounds.first,she argues that the district court applied an incorrect test to evaluate whether her prior maine shoplifting conviction should have been considered for purposes of calculating her chc.second,she argues that the district court erred in accepting computerized docket reports as adequate proof of her prior maine state convictions.as we now explain,neither challenge has merit.

prior maine shoplifting conviction 
where a defendant is convicted of an offense involving five or more grams of crack cocaine,she must be given a mandatory minimum sentence of five years,even if her gsr is lower.b b see also united states rodr√≠guez,cir.even where the mandatory minimum applies,however,a sentencing court can apply a lower sentence under the provisions of f if the defendant meets five enumerated criteria.only one of those criteria is at issue here whether the district court properly found mckenzie chc to be ii.if so,she is ineligible for relief.see f.
section c of the sentencing guidelines governs the types of prior convictions that may be considered for purposes of calculating a defendant criminal history score.all felony offenses are counted.misdemeanors are counted as well,with an important exception crucial to mckenzie appeal if the prior conviction is for one of a listed number of misdemeanor offenses,or an offense similar to a listed offense,it is not counted as long as the sentence served was not a term of probation of at least one year,or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days.id.c.
at sentencing,the district court determined that the psr properly factored mckenzie june shoplifting into her chc score.the court agreed with the government argument that spaulding controlled the issue.mckenzie now urges us to reverse spaulding and remand her case to the district court,substituting for the similar to standard a common sense approach.as the basis for her request,mckenzie points to amendments to the sentencing guidelines promulgated by the united states sentencing commission commission,made effective on november.particularly,mckenzie relies on the addition of application note a to the guidelines commentary,which in pertinent part reads 
in determining whether an unlisted offense is similar to an offense listed in c,the court should use a common sense approach that includes consideration of relevant factors such as i a comparison of punishments imposed for the listed and unlisted offenses ii the perceived seriousness of the offense as indicated by the level of punishment iii the elements of the offense iv the level of culpability involved and v the degree to which the commission of the offense indicates a likelihood of recurring criminal conduct.
we reject mckenzie call to depart from spaulding.our cases are clear that panels are bound by prior panel decisions absent extraordinary circumstances.see united states duval,cir citing united states allen,cir united states allen,cir w e remain bound to prior panel decisions in the absence of supervening authority sufficient to warrant disregard of established precedent.quoting united states wogan,cir.
the relevant facts in spaulding are markedly similar to those in this case.there,we rejected the defendant claim that his prior conviction for shoplifting approximately worth of goods should be excluded from his criminal history score because it was similar to an insufficient funds check conviction,an offense listed in c,and therefore exempt from being counted in a defendant chc.spaulding,at.doing so,we explained 
s hoplifting poses a markedly greater risk to the public.passing a bad check poses little risk of physical confrontation,because the perpetrator is not present when the victim realizes that he has been victimized.shoplifting,on the other hand,creates the very real risk of physical confrontation between the perpetrator and the victim.a store employee or customer may confront the perpetrator in an attempt to thwart the crime.the risk of confrontation precludes a conclusion that shoplifti
