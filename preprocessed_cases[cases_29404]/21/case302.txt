indicted on identity fraud and wire fraud charges for stealing his older brother identity to obtain five fraudulent mortgages,augustus okoye okoye entered into a plea agreement containing an appeal waiver.pursuant to the agreement,okoye was sentenced to months of imprisonment and ordered to pay in restitution to the two defrauded mortgage companies,first nlc financial services first nlc and taylor,bean and whittaker mortgage taylor bean.on appeal,okoye takes issue with the restitution component of his sentence and argues that his appeal waiver does not extend to it.after carefully reviewing the record and the applicable law,we find that the waiver unambiguously encompassed restitution and thus dismiss okoye appeal.
background 
in the fall of,okoye was facing foreclosure on his home at brush hill road,milton,ma.unable to come up with the needed to stop the proceedings,okoye stole his brother identity to obtain a mortgage loan from first nlc okoye used this loan to pay off the outstanding balance on the mortgage and pocketed the remaining proceeds from the loan,which amounted to.apparently emboldened by his success at first nlc,okoye repeated essentially the same scheme at taylor bean,where he fraudulently obtained four additional mortgage loans totaling to purchase two condos in mattapan,ma.
okoye made no payments on any of the mortgages,and his brother immediately noticed the negative impact on his personal credit rating.the fraudulent scheme came to light soon thereafter,with an affidavit authored by okoye detailing every aspect of his misdeeds.not surprisingly,the affidavit found its way to the federal authorities,and okoye prosecution ensued.
on january,after negotiations with the government,okoye agreed to plead guilty to three counts of wire fraud in violation of,and one count of identity fraud in violation of a.in exchange,the government agreed not to charge him with aggravated identity theft.a written plea agreement memorialized all the terms of the parties bargain.
as relevant here,section of the plea agreement outlined the lists of penalties to which okoye acknowledged being exposed,including up to twenty years of imprisonment,and r estitution of up to the amount of the loss.section,in turn,established the sentencing recommendations that the parties agreed the government would make.it set forth three different scenarios,each stating in no uncertain terms that r estitution in the amount of the loss would be an integral part of any sentencing recommendation.restitution was again mentioned in section of the agreement,where okoye agreed that he would protect his assets until the fine,forfeiture and restitution ordered by the court at sentencing we re satisfied in full.
section of the agreement embodied the provision at issue here.it made plain that 
okoye agrees that he will not file a direct appeal nor collaterally challenge any prison sentence of months or less.okoye also agrees that,if the attorney files a motion for downward departure and the court does,in fact,depart downward on that basis,okoye will not file a direct appeal nor collaterally challenge any sentence imposed.
emphasis supplied.
at a march,hearing,the district court judge spoke candidly with okoye to make sure that he understood his plea agreement.the court specifically commented on the sections regarding the parties sentencing recommendations and the appeal waiver.among other things,the court noted that appeal waivers are generally enforceable so long as there exists consideration for the defendant,and that okoye waiver presented no exception,given that the government agreed to forgo aggravated identity theft charges and recommend a reduced term of imprisonment.
the court convened a sentencing hearing on august.after listening to the parties sentencing recommendations,it granted the government motion for a downward departure and sentenced okoye to months imprisonment.pursuant to the plea agreement,the court also ordered okoye to pay in restitution to first nlc and to taylor bean.
okoye immediately objected to first nlc restitution award.he argued in open court that first nlc could not properly receive restitution as it had been dissolved and no had come forward.okoye maintained that there was thus no certainty as to either the amount owed or the identity of the party to be made whole.the court attempted to assuage these concerns by entering a conditional restitution order and giving the government days to establish that first nlc was in fact a victim.
on august,one day after his sentencing hearing,okoye lodged this appeal,which was perfected after the district court entered a final order of restitution in favor of morgan stanley capital holdings,llc as first nlc.
ii.discussion 
okoye advances a number of substantive challenges to the restitution order.the threshold inquiry,however,is whether okoye appeal falls within the scope of the provision contained in his plea agreement in making this determination,we interpret the parties agreement under basic contract principles,united states ríos hernández,cir citing united states acosta román,cir,and construe any ambiguities in the waiver provision in favor of allowing the appeal to proceed.united states fernández cabrera,cir.mindful of this rule of construction,okoye urges us to find that the provision in his plea agreement is ambiguous insofar as it applies to restitution awards.according to okoye,such ambiguity stems from the use of the word prison as a qualifier to the word sentence in some sections of the waiver but not in others.in other words,okoye pins all his hopes on the proposition that the waiver is ambiguous as to whether the import of the word sentence is limited to prison sentence even where not explicitly indicated.we wholeheartedly disagree.
our analysis is anchored in a tenet of contractual exegesis in interpreting contractual language,we consider the contract as a whole.its meaning can not be delineated by isolating words and interpreting them as though they stood alone.farmers ins.exchange rnk,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also united states alegría,cir p lea agreements,like contracts generally,should be construed where possible to give effect to every term and phrase.smart gillent.long term disability plan,cir accepted canons of construction forbid the balkanization of contracts for interpretive purposes.here,a holistic reading of the plea agreement unequivocally negates okoye proposition.in fact,the plea agreement in at least three different sections unambiguously established that okoye sentence would include restitution in the amount of the loss.accordingly,at this late hour,okoye can not be heard to say that he was uncertain as to whether the term any sentence as used in the provision encompassed restitution.he must now live with the consequences of his bargain.see united states donath,cir when enforcing the appellate waiver,we stress that both sides are obligated to live by the bargain they made.
in any event,we would reach the same result even under okoye atomistic reading of the provision.okoye makes much of the way in which the provision is structured.specifically,he directs our attention to the fact that the word prison qualifies the word sentence at the beginning of the provision.in okoye view,t hat limited sense of the word sentence carries forward and attaches by implication to the phrase any sentence in the next statement.okoye submissions on appeal,however,provide us with absolutely no guidance as to how or why we should get around the hoary maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius,which instructs that when certain matters are mentioned in a contract,other similar matters not mentioned were intended to be excluded.institut pasteur cambridge biotech,cir.put differently,okoye provides us with nothing to conclude that the parties did not mean to exclude the qualifier prison when referring to any sentence in the closing clause of the provision.our independent analysis of the record has revealed no reason so to conclude.
to complicate matters further for okoye,his proposed construction of the phrase any sentence is at odds with our precedent.see,united states acosta,cir it
