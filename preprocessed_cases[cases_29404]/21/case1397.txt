on appeal,chad marks argues,inter alia,that the district court erred by refusing to hear his ineffective assistance of counsel claim,raised after his conviction but before sentencing,until after he had been sentenced.for the reasons stated below,we agree.
background 
we recount only such facts as are necessary to explain our decision.marks appeals from a judgment of conviction of the united states district court for the western district of new york larimer,entered following a jury trial.marks was found guilty of five counts of various charges,and two counts of possessing a specific firearm in furtherance of two of the charged drug trafficking crimes in violation of c.the district court sentenced marks principally to concurrent terms of imprisonment on each drug trafficking conviction,a term on the first c conviction,and a term on the second.marks was thus sentenced to an aggregate years of imprisonment.judgment was entered on march.
between february and january,the parties engaged in plea negotiations.in late january,the assistant united states attorney ausa originally assigned to the case,john kelly,was transferred to washington,upon learning of his planned transfer,ausa kelly informed marks counsel,donald thompson,on at least two occasions that,once a new prosecutor assumed responsibility for the case,any future plea offers would likely be more onerous to marks.subsequent to ausa kelly transfer,ausa everardo rodriguez assumed responsibility for the case.
in or around may,as discussed below,marks asserts he was unaware of this until after his rodriguez offered attorney thompson a plea bargain to dispose of marks case the plea offer.the principal component of that deal required marks to serve a term of imprisonment ausa rodriguez advised attorney thompson that marks faced significant sentencing exposure if he did not plead guilty and that the exposure would increase if marks were convicted of two potential firearms charges that could be brought under c.
according to marks,he was unaware of the government plea offer,and therefore did not enter a guilty plea in september,therefore,as ausa rodriguez had suggested would happen,the grand jury returned a superseding indictment against marks,adding the two c of a specific firearm in furtherance of two of the drug trafficking crimes alleged in the superseding indictment.marks was arraigned on that superseding indictment a few days later.
trial was scheduled to begin on june,though for reasons not clear from the record,trial commenced on june.on june,marks filed a motion seeking an order requesting permission to enter a plea of guilty pursuant to the terms of a plea agreement made to him during plea negotiations with ausa kelly prior to january and directing the government to make a.motion.see footnote,supra.the following day,the court met with the parties and stated that it was not inclined to grant marks motion but would defer consideration until after trial.two weeks later,the jury returned guilty verdicts against marks on all counts.
in november,marks counsel renewed the motion made before trial requesting permission to enter a plea of guilty pursuant to the terms of a plea offer from ausa kelly and directing the government to file a motion the renewed motion.in his affidavit in opposition to the renewed motion,ausa rodriguez attested,inter alia,that prior to presenting the c charges to the grand jury,he had extended to attorney thompson the plea offer.according to marks,it was at this point that he first learned of the plea offer that rodriguez had discussed with attorney thompson.
in january,judge larimer sent a letter to the parties in which he stated 
an issue that needs to be addressed is whether we need a factual hearing to resolve the renewed m otion.there are certainly matters of record that will assist the c ourt in deciding the motion,but some of the matters set forth in both the defense papers and the g overnment papers relate to conversations among rodriguez,thompson,and marks.former ausa john kelly was also referenced 
i believe it may be necessary to have a hearing 
letter from david larimer,to everardo rodriguez,assistant attorney,usao,and donald thompson,reproduced in appendix a to argument brief of.in the letter,the district court also referred to several letters written by marks,pro se.i t appears that marks is now claiming ineffective assistance of counsel.id.it is not clear from the record to which letters the court is referring.a letter from attorney thompson,dated december,suggests that the court may have referred to marks letters to magistrate judge payson concerning the status of his representation letter from donald thompson,to david larimer,reproduced in appendix a to argument brief of.
in february,at a hearing to address marks renewed motion,marks filed a pro se petition for habeas relief pursuant to u.alleging ineffective assistance of counsel based on attorney thompson failure to tell him of the plea offer that ausa rodriguez had made the petition.the court did not hear argument on the renewed motion that day because it first needed to determine whether,in light of a letter it had received from marks in late january,a hearing was necessary to address marks ineffective assistance claims.the court indicated that it was inclined to consider on submission the renewed motion,which was fully briefed,before addressing whether marks required new counsel.in response,attorney thompson noted that 
marks allegations relating to ineffective assistance revolve largely around either this renewed m otion or the subject matter to which the motion relates,counsel conduct during plea negotiations.so to the extent that the c ourt addresses the motion,that might complicate things or raise another issue,if the ineffective attorney,if you will,is still involved at the time the c ourt is ruling on the.marks the basis for the ineffectiveness.
hearing tr.the district court acknowledged the relationship between the pending renewed motion and marks ineffective assistance claim,saying marks letter does relate,in part,to the motion that pending before me id.the court later asked attorney thompson whether you have a conflict at this point that would preclude you from representing marks.id.thompson replied,i think i do i t appears that given the allegations i may be a witness and as a consequence,would not appropriately be able to continue as an advocate.id.
in march,the court denied both marks petition and his renewed motion seeking enforcement of an earlier plea offer that was discussed with ausa kelly.with respect to the petition,the court noted that it was an improper attempt to raise arguments that should be presented by way of a motion under following sentencing.marks claim should be brought,if at all,by way of a motion under,after marks is sentenced,not before.later that month,marks filed pro se an interlocutory notice of appeal challenging the denial of his petition.
in april,having been unsuccessful in advancing his ineffective assistance claim in colloquy before the district court,marks requested new counsel for sentencing.the court granted this request and relieved attorney thompson of representing marks.marks then immediately moved pro se for reconsideration of the petition.later that month,the district court denied that motion for reconsideration.in may,the court appointed new counsel.marks new counsel took no further action to renew yet again marks motion for reconsideration of the petition.
meanwhile,in august,this court dismissed marks interlocutory appeal without prejudice to appellant raising his claims in his direct criminal appeal after sentencing or in a subsequent motion.on the record before us at the time,we determined nostra sponte,that appellant appeal lacks an arguable basis in law or fact,because the district court acted within its discretion in concluding that the challenge was better addressed on a motion pursuant to.
on march,the court sentenced marks to years imprisonment.this appeal followed.
subsequent to oral argument,we ordered briefing on two matters.the first was clarification of the timing of marks motion for reconsideration of his pro se petition challenging attorney thompson effectiveness and seeking permission to enter a plea of guilty pursuant to the terms of the plea offer from ausa rodriguez.the second was whether the district court erred when it refused to address marks ineffective assistance claim prior to imposing sentence.
discussion 
marks,both through counsel and pro se,presents a number of arguments on appeal.we address three of those arguments here.
marks motion seeking to force the government to move for a downward departure 
first,marks argues that the district court erroneously denied his motions seeking to force the government to move for a downward departure.this claim is based on marks belief that the government should be required to allow him to plead guilty pursuant to the terms of an unspecified plea offer previously made to him during plea negotiations with ausa kelly.while there is evidence that a variety of possible dispositions were discussed between attorney thompson and ausa kelly before january,when ausa kelly left for washington,on the record presented we see no evidence of an agreement.the district court finding to that effect is not clearly erroneous.consequently,there is no basis to enforce the terms of any particular plea offer that may have been discussed during that time.because marks did not have a cooperation agreement with the government,we review his claim only to determine whether the government refusal to file a motion for a downward departure was based on an unconstitutional motive.see wade united states,d.the district court properly found that marks motions seeking to force the government to recommend a downward departure were meritless because no plea agreement requiring such a motion was ever entered and marks alleged no unconstitutional motive for the government declining to recommend a downward departure.
marks mandatory minimum sentence under williams 
the second argument we address is marks claim that the district court erred by sentencing him to a consecutive mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment on count for use of a firearm in furtherance of the charged in count,pursuant to which marks was subject to a greater minimum sentence than five years.see c a.here,the district court determined that marks mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment on his c conviction must run consecutively to his sentence on his narcotics conviction under u.a,even though the latter conviction carried a mandatory minimum of ten years imprisonment.see b a.this ruling,though not objected to below,was plain error requiring a remand for resentencing see united states williams,cir.we therefore vacate the sentence imposed on count and remand for resentencing.in resentencing marks,the district court of course retains discretionary authority to impose a consecutive sentence consistent with its responsibility under.see united states whitley,cir.
ineffective assistance claim raised prior to imposition of sentence 
we turn now to whether the district court should have considered and decided,prior to imposing sentence,marks motion asserting ineffective assistance of trial counsel based on counsel failure to convey the government plea offer 
law of the case 
as an initial matter,we are not precluded from revisiting our august decision denying marks interlocutory appeal without prejudice to apellant raising his claims in his direct criminal appeal after sentencing or in a subsequent motion.as has been noted,on the record presented at that time,we determined nostra sponte,that appellant appeal lacks an arguable basis in law or fact,because the district court acted within its discretion in concluding that the challenge was better addressed on a motion pursuant to.
the law of the case doctrine does not rigidly bind a court to its former decisions,but is only addressed to its good sense.johnson holder,cir quoting higgins cal.prune apricot grower,cir.t he law of the case doctrine does not deprive an appellate court of discretion to reconsider its own prior rulings,even when the ruling constituted a final decision in a previous appeal.rezzonico h r block,cir.while informing the court discretion,law of the case does not limit the tribunal power.id.quoting arizona california,d.moreover,law of the case is even less binding in the context of interlocutory orders.see also sussman crawford,cir.
upon our review of the record as augmented by briefing,we conclude for the reasons discussed below,and contrary to our august mandate,that the district court abused its discretion by requiring marks ineffective assistance claim to be brought in a motion pursuant to.
ineffective assistance claim raised prior to imposition of sentence 
the district court oral and written statements addressing marks ineffective assistance claim indicate that the court considered sentencing a prerequisite to reviewing that claim.the government argues unconvincingly that given the supreme court and this court general aversion to deciding ineffective assistance claims on direct review,the district court refusal to entertain marks motion before he was sentenced can not be deemed an abuse of discretion.we disagree.
the legal standards applicable to marks ineffective assistance claim are.a defendant sixth amendment right to counsel is violated when he receives ineffective assistance.to prove such ineffective assistance,a defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different.pham united states,cir quoting strickland washington,d.
a defendant suffers a sixth amendment injury where his attorney fails to convey a plea offer because d efense counsel have a constitutional duty to give their clients professional advice on the crucial decision of whether to accept a plea offer from the government.id.as such,counsel failure to convey a plea offer falls below an objective standard of reasonableness and thus satisfies strickland first prong.see id.at t here is no dispute that failure to convey a plea offer is unreasonable performance.citing cullen united states,cir t here can be no doubt that counsel must always communicate to the defendant the terms of any plea bargain offered.with respect to strickland second prong,a defendant statements that he would have accepted a plea offer in combination with some objective evidence,such as a significant sentencing disparity,is sufficient to support a prejudice finding.id.at.
when ineffective assistance of counsel is first raised in a court of appeals on direct review of a conviction,it is often preferable for the court to decline to consider the claim,awaiting its presentation in a collateral proceeding.see,united states hasan,cir.as the supreme court has noted,collateral review typically provides a far better opportunity for an evaluation of an claim than direct review,because a factual record focused on the defendant claim can be developed in the district court,including by tak ing testimony from witnesses for the defendant and the prosecution and from the counsel alleged to have rendered the deficient performance.united states oladimeji,cir quoting massaro united states,d.when such a claim is raised on direct appeal we may choose to 
decline to hear the claim,permitting the appellant to raise the issue as part of a subsequent petition remand the claim to the district court for necessary or decide the claim on the record before us.
hasan,at internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.
we are perplexed by the assertion that a trial court must invoke an appellate court rubric and require a defendant to use his one motion to raise an ineffective assistance claim,particularly when the district court is in a position to take evidence,if required,and to decide the issue.as a matter of first impression,we hold that when a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is first raised in the district court prior to the judgment of conviction,the district court may,and at times should,consider the claim at that point in the proceeding we are mindful that district courts face competing consid
