after pleading guilty to one count of possession of child pornography,appellant nelson vélez luciano vélez luciano received a sentence of ten years in prison followed by fifteen years of supervised release.the terms of his supervised release included multiple conditions,some of which he challenges in this appeal.because vélez luciano plea agreement included an applicable waiver of appeal provision,a heightened standard of review applies.with one exception,vélez luciano can not satisfy this standard for the challenged conditions.we thus vacate that one condition,affirm the rest,and remand the case to the district court for resentencing,limited solely to the vacated condition.
background 
because this appeal follows a conviction via guilty plea,we draw the facts from the plea colloquy and sentencing materials.united states whitlow,cir.in july,vélez luciano began working for dorado,puerto rico as a music teacher and the director of the municipal band.in early,nereida jiménez,the mother of a female student of vélez luciano referred to as jrj,complained to police that vélez luciano had requested that jrj send him nude photos of herself,and had sexually abused jrj.vélez luciano had been living with jimenez and jrj for approximately seven months at that point,and on march,jimenez obtained an order of protection and eviction against vélez luciano.
law enforcement investigated the allegations and discovered that vélez luciano began providing special treatment to jrj at least as far back as january,and began having sexual contact with her including intercourse in may,when she was fifteen.vélez luciano had sex with jrj multiple times since,including during jrj lunch periods.around this time,jrj began,at vélez luciano request,taking photos of herself and sending them to him.jrj estimated that she sent approximately sixty photos,ranging from partially nude to fully nude,to vélez luciano.investigators found three images of jrj,all focused on her genitals,on vélez luciano computer.additionally,vélez luciano had sexually explicit conversations,via both text messaging and facebook messaging,with jrj.he also directed jrj to view pornographic websites so that she could learn what vélez luciano wanted to do with her,but the record indicates that she did not look at the web sites.
the investigation further revealed that vélez luciano abused a second female,a referred to as vmch.in,when she was eleven,vélez luciano recruited vmch,who has a mental age three years behind her actual age,into the band.he began sexually abusing her in,when she was fourteen.these encounters took place in the music band room.additionally,vélez luciano encouraged vmch to view a pornographic website containing animated cartoons engaging in sexual conduct with each other,and she did so.vélez luciano wanted vmch to learn from the cartoons so that she would do with him what the cartoon characters did with each other.finally,vélez luciano engaged in a threesome with both vmch and jrj in the music band room,providing them each with baton twirler outfits and directing them on what to do,culminating in sexual relations.
prior proceedings 
on april,a grand jury in the district of puerto rico indicted vélez luciano on two counts of producing child pornography,in violation of a,and one count of possession of child pornography,in violation of a b.on may,pursuant to an agreement with the government,he pled guilty to the possession count the government subsequently dismissed the two production counts.the deal recommended a term of imprisonment,and contained no other agreements or recommendations regarding the sentence.it said nothing about the duration or conditions of vélez luciano supervised release,but did recite the statutory maximum period of supervised release.it also contained a waiver of appeal provision,which read the defendant hereby acknowledges that should the court sentence him or her to the specific sentence,or sentencing range,the defendant agrees to waive and permanently surrender his or her right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.
at a change of plea hearing before a magistrate judge that same day,the magistrate judge reviewed the parameters of the agreement including the conduct alleged,the rights waived pursuant to the agreement,and the recommended sentence with vélez luciano.the magistrate judge specifically informed vélez luciano that he faced a term of at least five years of supervised release following his incarceration.at another part of the colloquy,the magistrate judge focused specifically on making sure that vélez luciano understood the appellate waiver upon completing the required change of plea colloquy,the magistrate judge found that vélez luciano was competent to plead guilty,that velez luciano was aware of the nature of the charged conduct and the impact of pleading guilty,and that the plea was knowing and voluntary.he issued a report and recommendation that the district court accept vélez luciano plea,and the district court did so on june.
on june,the probation office issued its presentence investigation report psr.among other content,the psr recommended that the district court impose special conditions of supervised release applicable to sex offenders.it did not provide any specific reasoning supporting these recommendations.vélez luciano did not object to any of these conditions in his sentencing memorandum.
vélez luciano sentencing hearing occurred the next day.after handling preliminary matters,the district court imposed the term of imprisonment recommended by the plea agreement.the district court,without explanation,also sentenced vélez luciano to fifteen years of supervised release,with several conditions attached.these conditions included both the thirteen standard conditions of supervised release and the special conditions of supervision that the psr recommended.vélez luciano did not object to any of these conditions at the sentencing hearing.
c.this appeal 
vélez luciano raises two general issues on appeal.first,he argues that the waiver of appeal provision in his plea agreement does not cover an appellate challenge to his supervised release conditions.next,he challenges,broadly speaking,four categories of these conditions sexual offender treatment internet access contact with minor children and access to pornography.after oral argument,the government informed us via a federal rule of appellate procedure j letter rule j letter that it would not seek to impose a particular type of treatment,penile plethysmograph ppg testing on vélez luciano.
because the applicability of vélez luciano waiver of appeal provision impacts our analysis of the challenged conditions,we address that issue first.we then proceed seriatim through the challenged conditions.
ii.scope of vélez luciano waiver of appeal 
vélez luciano argues that,because he agreed to waive only a challenge to his prison term and not to the conditions of his supervised release his waiver does not cover this appeal.he does not argue,nor could he,that the district court failed to comply with the waiver condition precedent it handed down the same prison sentence the agreement recommended.rather,he asserts that the conditions of supervised release stand apart from the sentence to which he agreed to waive his appellate rights.
this claim fails.we have repeatedly ha d no trouble concluding that the word sentence in a plea agreement waiver encompasse d every component of the sentence,including the term of supervised release and its attendant conditions,thus bringing the instant action within the waiver reach.united states santiago,cir accord united states del valle cruz,cir we have frequently stated that conditions and terms of supervised release are part of a defendant sentence.united states rojas,cir b ecause defendant appeal of the supervised release conditions is an appeal of the judgment and sentence in his case,this appeal falls within the scope of the waiver.internal citation omitted see united states brown,cir a supervised release term is an integral part of a sentence,separate from and in addition to immurement.see also a the court may include as a part of the sentence a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment emphasis added.per these holdings,this appeal falls within the scope of vélez luciano waiver.
iii.enforceability of vélez luciano waiver 
having determined that this appeal falls within the scope of vélez luciano waiver,we must next determine the waiver enforceability.santiago,at.the general rule is that when knowing and voluntary,an appellate waiver is generally enforceable,absent an indication that the waiver would work a miscarriage of justice.id.citing,inter alia,united states teeter,cir.to successfully invoke the miscarriage of justice exception,a error will not suffice,rather there must be,at a bare minimum,an increment of error more glaring than routine reversible error.del valle cruz,at quoting santiago,at.the exception requires analysis,but is applied stringently.see teeter,at.finally,we note that,even absent an explanation for a sentence from the district court,we can often infer the reasoning from the record.united states perazza mercado,cir.
we first turn to whether vélez luciano waived knowingly and voluntarily.vélez luciano asserts that,because his sentence only mentioned a prison term and forfeiture,and not supervised release,he did not knowingly waive his right to appeal the supervised release conditions.both the record and our past decisions undermine this argument.
in united states ruiz,the supreme court instructed that the law ordinarily considers a waiver knowing,intelligent,and sufficiently aware if the defendant fully understands the nature of the right and how it would likely apply in general in the circumstances even though the defendant may not know the specific detailed consequences of invoking it,d.and we have relied on ruiz to hold as inconsequential a plea agreement failure to enumerate the conditions of supervised release the defendant faced.united states rodríguez santana,app x,cir unpublished.
vélez luciano circumstances nestle into this space.although not specifically part of the recommended sentence,the plea agreement which vélez luciano signed and initialed noted that supervised release of at least five years was part of the maximum sentence for possession of child pornography.further,the magistrate judge at vélez luciano change of plea hearing specifically informed him that s upervised release is a term of supervision he would have to serve after he was released from prison,and vélez luciano acknowledged understanding this.vélez luciano recognition of the prospect of supervised release,even without awareness of the specific conditions the district court intended to impose,suffices to make his waiver knowing and voluntary.having established this element of the teeter test,we now examine the individual categories of special conditions to determine if enforcement of any of them constitutes a miscarriage of justice.
internet restrictions conditions,and 
we begin with conditions,and,which preclude vélez luciano internet access without a probation officer prior approval.because the internet played a role in vélezluciano offense conduct,he can not demonstrate the requisite miscarriage of justice necessary to overcome his appellate waiver.
we have recognized the propriety of robust internet restrictions where the defendant used the internet in the underlying offense the defendant had a history of improperly using the internet to engage in illegal conduct or particular and identifiable characteristics of the defendant suggested that such a restriction was warranted.united states stergios,cir quoting perazza mercado,at.
vélez luciano meets these criteria.the record shows that he exchanged sexually explicit facebook messages with jrj and vmch suggested pornographic sites for them to view convinced vmch to actually view the pornographic site groomed vmch behavior with the suggested website and possessed sexually explicit pictures of jrj on his computer.this is not the case of a defendant who has no history of impermissible internet use and for whom the internet was not an instrumentality of the offense of conviction.perazza mercado,at vacating a categorical ban on home internet usage when the offense conduct,carried out wholly without use of the internet,involved sexually abusing a minor child in the defendant care.given these facts,vélez luciano can not demonstrate a miscarriage of justice in the district court imposition of the internet restrictions 
pornography ban condition 
we likewise affirm condition,which effectively imposes a complete ban on pornography.because both vélez luciano and the government rely on perazza mercado in crafting their arguments,we begin our analysis there.perazza mercado presented the question of whether a ban on pornographic material as a condition of supervised release for an individual convicted of sexual contact with a minor constitutes plain error when there is no evidence that possession of such material has any relationship to the offense of conviction and there is no evidence in the record that the defendant previously possessed such materials.at emphasis added.we held that it did.id.at.we particularly emphasized that lack of suggestion in the psr or at sentencing that perazza mercado had abused or even possessed pornography in the past,much less that it contributed to his offense or would be likely to do so in the future.id 
that factual dynamic is not present here.the record reveals that vélez luciano suggested that jrj view pornography so that she could perform the sexually explicit conduct vélez luciano desired.additionally,he encouraged vmch to view a pornographic website of animated cartoons as a way of communicating to vmch what he wanted to do with her and jrj,and vmch did so.undoubtedly,vélez luciano had seen these sites before recommending them to his victims.these facts indicate that vélez luciano used pornography to further conduct related to his offense.moreover,he also possessed sexually explicit photos of jrj which she created at his direction.this shows that his possession of pornography was reasonably related to the nature and circumstances of the offense and to his history and characteristics,which in turn demonstrates the condition requisite grounding in the present record.united states ramos,cir.
because pornography played a material role in vélez luciano conduct,the ban reasonably relates to the nature and circumstances of his offense the record supports this deprivation of liberty as a means of preventing vélez luciano from using a key tool of his abuse.accordingly,vélez luciano has not demonstrated the requisite miscarriage of justice sufficient to overcome his waiver 
minor children restrictions conditions,and 
vélez luciano next challenges conditions,and,which effectively require prior approval from a probation officer before interacting with,or even going near,children under the age of eighteen.he claims these conditions are overbroad,without basis in the record,and unreasonably restrictive of his ability to earn a livelihood.
in his brief,vélez luciano offered multiple arguments generally opposing the minor children restriction,and each of them are unavailing.first,he incorrectly argues that conditions are occupational restrictions,subject to the standard these conditions,except for part of condition,do not bar him from any particular occupation at all they simply pertain to his association with minors.further,while condition,and part of condition,do limit his occupational options,the record supports the district court imposition of these conditions.vélez luciano met both jrj and vmch through his professional oversight of the band at school,and used this access to gain influence over and abuse them,including while at school.this meets the reasonably direct relationship prong of the occupational restriction test.and given the temporal proximity between vélez luciano sexual misconduct and sentencing,the high recidivism rate for sex offenders,santiago,at,and vélez luciano recklessness in abusing someone with whom he lived jrj,the record offers enough support for the reasonabl e necess ity to protect the public pro
