james glover challenges his conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm,g,claiming that comments made by the prosecutor during the closing argument at his trial were improper.he also challenges his sentence in two respects the classification of his prior conviction for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon as a crime of violence under a and the overall reasonableness of his sentence.
factual background 
in september,boston police officers joseph marrero and manual blas approached glover while they were patrolling a housing development.the officers testified that they asked glover his name and whether he lived in the development.in response,he first reached toward his back pocket,then brought his hands forward before he took off running from the officers.they chased him,with officer marrero being the closest in pursuit.marrero testified that he saw glover remove a tan object from the right side of his waist area and hold the object in his right hand.glover then turned a corner,and marrero lost sight of him for several seconds.when they caught up to and arrested glover,the officers found a small amount of marijuana in his pocket,but no weapons and no tan object.
shortly thereafter,a caliber handgun with an ivory handle was recovered from along the path of the chase.the gun was lying in plain view near the corner where marrero testified that he had lost sight of glover.glover was charged with possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony,in violation of g.
at trial,the government argued that glover had the gun on his person when he fled from the officers,and discarded it while he was briefly out of their sight.glover,for his part,argued that someone else had placed the gun on the ground where it was recovered,possibly as a community gun a gun that a group of people share and store in a public but concealed location.glover introduced testimony that a number of community guns had been recovered by the boston police department in that same area.glover also argued that he would not have been likely to reach for or discard a firearm with his right hand,as he is he introduced handwriting evidence to this effect at trial.
defense counsel objected to several comments in the government closing argument,to be described in detail later,but the district court overruled those objections.the jury convicted glover of possessing a firearm after having been convicted of a felony.
glover objected to the presentence report psr prepared for his sentencing.he disputed the classification of his prior conviction for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon abdw as a crime of violence under a.glover also requested either a b downward departure based on his criminal history,or a variance based on the sentencing factors set out in a.glover argued specifically that his criminal history points under the guidelines overstated his actual criminal history,and in light of this,that he should receive a sentence.more specifically,he argued that he was already effectively serving incarceration time for the instant offense because the offense was also a violation of supervised release conditions imposed on an earlier charge.he argued that the time served on the supervised release violation should count toward his current sentence.he also claimed that a amendment to the guidelines relating to cocaine base crack cocaine offenses should result in a reduction of his sentence for the instant offense.glover also stressed that he had a positive future,because he had achieved steady employment prior to committing the offense.
the district court accepted the psr classification of the abdw conviction,stating,b ased on the charging document itself,i could determine that this is a crime of violence.the court also found,however,that a variance from the guidelines range of months was warranted,and sentenced glover to months imprisonment,followed by three years of supervised release.this appeal followed.
ii.closing argument 
glover argues that his conviction should be set aside because the prosecutor made improper comments in closing argument at trial.we analyze de novo whether the comments were improper.united states balsam,cir.if we determine that the comments were improper and the objection was preserved,we review for harmless error under chapman california,d.united states wihbey,cir.absent an objection below,however,our review is for plain error only.id.
glover argues that four specific comments in the government closing argument were improper.we set forth the comments in the order in which they were delivered.
after briefly summarizing the evidence,the prosecutor stated comment one 
so i guess the questions become,well,straightforward does it make sense or turn the question the other way is there anything that does make sense.well,i submit to you that if you look at it carefully,it makes perfect sense.if you look at it carefully,there nothing that does make sense.
emphasis added.
the second comment comment two followed a recounting of officer marrero testimony that he had seen a tan object in glover hand.the prosecutor asked,is there any reason to doubt that testimony 
the third comment comment three concerned evidence that the defendant wrote with his left hand.
clearly,okay,the defendant writes with his left hand.he may prefer to do some things.we do know what those other things are.officer blas,for example,he writes but he shoots.
emphasis added.
the final comment comment four concerned the government theory that glover had dropped the firearm on the ground where it was recovered.
you saw the area,saw the photographs of the undisturbed firearm the firearm was out in the open,it was not hidden.what other explanation can there be there was some testimony about community guns,but all that testimony about community guns,about guns stashed somewhere,is that the guns were hidden.you would put a loaded firearm in the open by a stairwell in the middle of a development.it does make any sense.
emphasis added.
immediately after the government closed,defense counsel objected to comments three and four,maintaining that these two comments impermissibly shifted the burden of proof.he argued that the comments called for the defendant to prove that he did other activities,or to prove that the gun did not belong to him.the district court overruled both objections.
on appeal,glover argues that these statements,either individually or in combination,shifted the burden of proof and also constituted impermissible comments on his failure to testify,in violation of the fifth amendment guarantee against glover also argues for the first time that comments one and two were improper for the same reasons.
the closing argument is an especially delicate point in the trial process,and we scrutinize comments that may either shift the burden of proof or are comments on a defendant failure to testify.see united states taylor,cir.
as to comments that shift the burden,we stated in united states,cir that a prosecutor may cross the line into impermissibility by arguing to the jury that the defendant is obligated to present evidence of his innocence.the case of united states skandier,cir is illustrative.there,the prosecutor stated in closing argument,now,at this time the defense counsel will address you then i will have a chance to speak with you one more time and see if he can explain the story that would be any different with regard to the responsibility of the defendant in this case.id.at emphasis added.we held this comment to have impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant.also,at statement that defense counsel can call this witness,just like the united states,impermissibly shifted the burden of proof.
when assessing whether a prosecutor comments violate the fifth amendment guarantee against,we ask whether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.wilkerson,at quoting wihbey,at.in united states cox,cir,we held a prosecutor repeated statements in closing argument,asking how does defendant explain certain evidence,to be impermissible and a severe violation of the griffin rule.id.at discussing griffin california,d see also wihbey,at prosecutor statement that,if defense counsel can stand up and explain away that conversation to you,then you should acquit defendant,was impermissible comment on defendant failure to testify united states roberts,cir statement that the defendant has the same responsibility as the government and that is to present a compelling case,held impermissible.
the government does,however,have reasonable latitude to operate within a closing argument.where the defendant has presented a defense,as glover did here,the government is permitted to discuss competing inferences from the evidence on the record.in united states henderson,cir,the defendant had attempted to impeach the credibility of a government witness by showing that the witness was under the influence of drugs during an alleged drug transaction.the prosecutor stated,and do the tapes prove to you how absurd the defendant claims are that the witness was too high to have accurately perceived the events do the tapes,in fact,prove the opposite id.we held these comments to be permissible discussions of competing inferences.the government is also permitted to comment on the plausibility of the defendant theory.see united states glantz,cir reversing district court grant of new trial where prosecutor commented on failure of defendants to introduce specific documentary evidence because,in context,prosecutor was commenting on plausibility of defense theory.when commenting on the plausibility of a defense theory,the government focus must be on the evidence itself and what the evidence shows or does not show,rather than on the defendant and what he or she has shown or failed to show.see wilkerson,at comment that there was no real evidence and pretty much nothing to support defendant version of events held permissible as directed at evidence see also united states akinola,cir statement in drug conspiracy case that certain actions undertaken by defendant were unexplained by anything other than knowledge of the heroin in the car held permissible as directed at evidence.
even if we conclude that prosecutorial comments are improper,reversible error will be found only if the comments were both inappropriate and harmful.united states,cir.when determining whether comments are harmful,we consider the totality of the circumstances,including the severity of the misconduct,the prosecutor purpose in making the statement,whether the statement was willful or inadvertent,the weight of the evidence supporting the verdict,jury instructions,and curative instructions.see balsam,at,at.
a specific curative instruction can mitigate the damage of an improper comment,wihbey,at,and the content of the jury instructions can remedy the effects of problematic language employed in the closing argument,wilkerson,at.here,the court delivered jury instructions explaining the reasonable doubt standard and the defendant right to decline to testify 
for ease of exposition,we commence with comment four and place it in context.the government alleged that glover had possessed the firearm.glover asserted that the gun was not his and could have been a community gun.in context,asking what other explanation can there be was an attempt by the prosecutor to refute glover preferred interpretation of the evidence.the prosecutor comments would not be viewed by a jury as suggesting that glover himself should have taken the stand to provide an explanation,or that glover was required to prove the gun was not his.the prosecutor was appealing to the jurors common sense in asking them to credit the government explanation instead of the defendant.see akinola,at.comment four was not improper.
comment three presents a closer question,but ultimately we conclude that it,too,was not an improper comment on glover failure to testify and did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof.glover argues that comment three,we do know what those other things are,highlighted for the jury glover failure to testify,and suggested that he had the burden to present additional evidence regarding his.glover had offered the handwriting evidence in support of his defense theory that he would not have used his right hand to toss aside a gun,as the government alleged.the prosecutor statement was part of his argument that the handwriting evidence offered only weak support for the defense theory.the jury would not naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify,or take it as an attempt to shift the burden of proof.wilkerson,at see also akinola,at.
there was no plain error in the remaining comments.glover argues that comment one suggestion to turn the question the other way,and ask if there is a reason that the prosecution theory does make sense,together with comments two whether there was a reason to doubt marrero testimony that he saw a tan object and three that it is unknown what things,other than writing,glover preferred to do with his left hand,suggested to the jury that the question was not what the government has proven but rather,what the defendant has disproved.that interpretation stretches the import of the comments too far.the prosecutor was merely,and permissibly,commenting on the relative plausibility of glover and the government competing explanations.these comments can not be said to have shifted the burden of proof,keeping in mind the frequency with which the jury was instructed as to the meaning of reasonable doubt.
in sum,the prosecutor statements were not improper,and therefore we uphold glover conviction.
iii.sentencing 
crime of violence 
glover argues that the trial court improperly classified his massachusetts conviction for abdw.laws ch,b,as a crime of violence under a.we disagree.
the sentencing guidelines define crime of violence as 
a ny offense punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,that 
has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,or 
is burglary of a dwelling,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
a emphasis added the residual clause of section a,defining crime of violence as an offense that involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,is at issue here 
we take a categorical approach to classifications of prior convictions.see taylor united states,d see also james united states,d.this approach,depending on the offense underlying the prior conviction,has either one or two steps.united states almenas,cir.
the first step requires a comparison of the legislature definition of the relevant offense with the guideline definition of a crime of violence.id.when making the comparison,we examine the statutory definition of the offense,ignoring the particular facts underlying the conviction.united states meader,cir see also united states giggey,cir.if we determine that a violation of the statute in question necessarily involves each and every element of a violent crime then we need not look beyond the statutory definition of the offense.williams,at.if,on the other hand,the statute text is broad enough to criminalize both violent and conduct,we must take a second step to determine if the defendant engaged in the crime violent variety.united states winter,cir.at this step,we may examine documents such as charging papers or jury instructions in order to flesh out a predicate offense inquiry.almenas,at.
additionally,after the supreme court decision in begay united states,d,to qualify as a crime of violence under the residual clause,the offense at issue must also i pose a degree of risk that is similar to the degree of risk posed by the enumerated,arson,burglary,extortion,and offenses involving the use of ii be similar in kind to those offenses.almenas,at see also united states herrick,cir.an offense will be similar in kind to the enumerated offenses if it typically involve s purposeful,violent,and aggressive conduct.begay.at citation omitted williams,at citation omitted.
here,we agree with the district court
