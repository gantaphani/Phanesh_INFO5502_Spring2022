defendant terry van mead mead appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of vermont sessions,sentencing him to months imprisonment following his guilty plea to one count of failing to register as a sex offender in violation of the sex offender registration and notification act,a,and one count of possession of stolen firearms pursuant to j,a.on appeal,mead argues that the district court erred in calculating his sentence under the united states sentencing guidelines guidelines or.specifically,mead contends that the district court incorrectly applied the enhancement in,which sets a base offense level of for defendants who have committed certain firearms offenses after sustaining at least two felony convictions of a crime of violence,as that term is defined in.mead asserts that,contrary to the district court ruling,his conviction for statutory rape under new york penal law was not a crime of violence.because we conclude that the conduct prohibited by.is not categorically a crime of violence under,we vacate the judgment and remand for resentencing.
background 
the facts on appeal are not in dispute.in,mead was convicted of violating,which provides that a person is guilty of criminal sexual act in the third degree when b eing years old or more,he or she engages in oral sexual conduct or anal sexual conduct with a person less than seventeen years old.mead,then thirty years old,had engaged in repeated sexual encounters with a girl.the conviction required mead to register as a sex offender both prior to his release from prison and upon moving to another state,and to notify authorities if his address changed,conditions with which mead initially complied.however,in june,mead was arrested in vermont for assaulting his former girlfriend and sentenced to another term of imprisonment.upon his release from prison in august,mead continued to reside in vermont without notifying new york authorities of his change of address or registering as a sex offender in vermont.
following multiple additional confrontations with authorities,mead was again arrested in vermont in october for the instant offense conduct.at the time of his arrest,mead was driving a stolen car carrying numerous firearms,hunting gear,a gaming system,and games,all of which had been reported stolen from two vermont homes earlier that day.one of those firearms was found fully loaded and jammed between the front driver and passenger seats with the barrel down and handle up.in addition,officers found in mead wallet cash and a check made out to mead that investigators traced to a local sporting goods store that had purchased ten firearms from mead that day.those firearms had also been reported stolen from the same two homes.
in august,a federal grand jury indicted mead for failing to register as a sex offender,possessing stolen firearms,and possessing firearms as a felon.mead pled guilty to the first two counts,and the government dismissed the third.following mead plea,a probation officer submitted a presentence report psr to the district court recommending a sentencing range of to months,based on a final offense level of and a criminal history category of vi.pertinently,in calculating mead final offense level,the psr asserted that two of mead prior convictions including a conviction for attempted burglary in new york and the conviction for statutory rape were for crimes of violence under,as defined by.accordingly,the psr stated that mead base offense level was,which,after the application of firearms enhancements and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,resulted in a final offense level of.
mead objected to the psr characterization of his statutory rape conviction as a conviction for a crime of violence under and following argument,the district court rejected mead objection and adopted the psr recommendation.in so ruling,the district court largely relied on united states daye,cir,in which this court held that violation of a vermont law prohibiting sexual contact with a minor aged fifteen or younger constituted a violent felony under the armed career criminal act acca,e b.see united states mead,cr wks,wl,at,discussing united states daye,at.noting the identical phrasing of the residual clauses of and the acca,the district court first determined that the provisions should be read coextensively.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the district court then compared and the vermont law and,finding that they reached similar conduct,read daye to require a finding that violation of constituted a crime of violence under and.id.at.in light of its ruling,the district court set mead base offense level at resulting in an advisory sentencing range of to months and sentenced mead to months imprisonment,to be served in two consecutive month terms.mead appealed.
discussion 
mead argues on appeal that violation of does not constitute a crime of violence under,and that the district court finding to the contrary resulted in the application of an inflated base offense level.we review de novo a district court determination as to whether a prior offense was a crime of violence under the guidelines.see united states savage,cir.
section requires that defendants who have committed certain firearms offenses receive a base offense level of if the defendant committed any part of the firearms offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.a.section defines crime of violence by reference to a,which states 
the term crime of violence means any offense under federal or state law,punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,that 
has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,or 
is burglary of a dwelling,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
section a is referred to as the physical force clause.the first half of a contains the exemplar crimes,and the second half the residual clause.
prohibits a person aged or older from engaging in oral or anal sexual conduct with a minor aged sixteen or younger.because the law lacks a physical force element,it can not be deemed a crime of violence under a physical force clause.similarly,because the law does not concern any of the exemplar crimes,it can not be deemed a crime of violence under a list of exemplar crimes.instead,violation of may be deemed a crime of violence only under a residual clause,which reaches crimes that otherwise involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
in interpreting the reach of a residual clause,we employ a categorical approach,with an eye to case law interpreting an identical clause in the acca that defines violent felony.see united states gray,cir looking to acca precedent to interpret due to the provisions identical operative language taylor united states,requiring categorical approach to interpreting acca.the categorical approach requires a court to consider an offense in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.begay united states,citing taylor,at.under this approach,every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute need not necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony,or,as it were,a crime of violence.james united states.instead,the proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense,in the ordinary case,presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.id.
in applying the categorical approach,the supreme court has distinguished between offenses that have a stringent mens rea requirement,demanding that a defendant act knowingly,intentionally,or the like as to the core element or elements of the offense,and those offenses commonly characterized as sounding in strict liability,negligence,or recklessness.see sykes united states.for the former,an offense must pose a risk similar in degree to its closest analog among the exemplar crimes to qualify as a violent felony under the residual clause.id.at deeming vehicular flight to be a violent felony because it poses a risk similar to that of burglary or arson.by contrast,a strict liability,negligence,or recklessness offense must be similar in kind and pose a risk similar in degree to qualify as a violent felony under the residual clause.begay,at see sykes.at limiting begay to strict liability,negligence,and recklessness offenses.that is,to be deemed a violent felony,an offense lacking a stringent mens rea requirement must not only involve conduct presenting a serious potential risk of physical injury to another but must also be roughly similar to the exemplar crimes by typically consisting of purposeful,violent,and aggressive conduct such that commission of the offense makes it more likely that an offender,later possessing a gun,will use that gun deliberately to harm a victim.begay,at,holding that driving under the influence is not a violent felony because the offense conduct is not purposeful,violent,and aggressive 
against essentially this landscape,we held that violation of a vermont law that imposed strict liability for sexual contact with any minor under the age of sixteen constituted a violent felony under the acca daye,at discussing.stat.ann.since amended.first,we found that sexual contact with a child the crime contemplated by vermont law posed a serious potential risk of injury to another.id.at.in so ruling,we cited multiple circuit court opinions detailing the risk of injury to young victims of sexual crimes,id.at quoting,inter alia,united states cadieux,cir c rimes involving indecent sexual contact with a child typically occur in close quarters,and are generally perpetrated by an adult upon a victim who is not only smaller,weaker,and less experienced,but is also generally susceptible to acceding to the coercive power of adult authority figures.emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted,while distinguishing opinions that noted the reduced risk to older teens on the ground that vermont statute applie d only to children and young teens,defined in the law as those under sixteen.see id.at citing united states sawyers,cir and united states thomas,cir,which discussed the reduced risk sexual contact posed to as compared to young children.we also noted that sexual contact with minors who are deemed legally unable to consent for reasons of physical or emotional immaturity inherently involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course of committing the offense.id.at internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted.
we next concluded that violation of the vermont law required purposeful,violent,and aggressive conduct.we deemed the violation to be purposeful in the ordinary case on the ground that engaging in sexual contact with a child aged fifteen or younger necessitated deliberate and affirmative conduct,and we deemed such conduct violent and aggressive on the ground that it create d a substantial likelihood of forceful,violent,and aggressive behavior because a child has essentially no ability to deter an adult from using force to coerce the child into a sexual act.id.at.this likely use of force assured us that,a t a minimum,a typical instance of this crime will involve conduct that is at least as intentionally aggressive and violent as a typical instance of burglary.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,we distinguished a tenth circuit opinion that came to a contrary result on the ground that,inter alia,the law at issue there criminalized conduct involving substantially older victims.id.at discussing united states dennis,cir holding that violation of law criminalizing indecent liberties with a person under the age of eighteen was not a violent felony.
like the vermont law at issue in daye,imposes strict liability with regard to the age of the victim,and is therefore subject to begay requirement that the prohibited conduct be similar in kind and in degree of risk to exemplar crimes in order to be deemed a crime of violence.see people newton,holding that a violation of is a strict liability offense.but unlike the vermont law in daye,focus is not on all children from infancy to age fifteen,but principally on those minors who are fifteen and pertinently sixteen years old under new york statutory scheme,oral or anal sexual conduct with a child under the age of eleven or under the age of thirteen,if the perpetrator is eighteen or older constitutes the most serious grade of new york criminal sexual act offense involving children,and is a class b felony.id.such contact with a child under the age of fifteen provided the perpetrator is at least eighteen is a class d felony,a less serious grade.id.finally,section,the provision at issue here,extends to minors who are fifteen and sixteen provided the perpetrator is at least,and bears the lowest grade of criminal liability,constituting a class e felony.id.thus,while offenders who engage in sexual contact with children and with young teens may also be charged pursuant to,this provision,in the context of the larger statutory scheme,focuses on fifteen and minors,as sexual conduct involving younger victims can be charged as one of the offenses.
it is understandable that the district court viewed our decision in daye as controlling.but we deem the differences between the vermont provision at issue in daye and the provision before us now to be material for purposes of and.as an initial matter,courts considering the intersection of statutory rape laws and the acca or have routinely noted the difficulty presented by the categorical approach in this context.statutory rape laws frequently encompass a wide range of behavior,potentially criminalizing some conduct in respect to which the offender need not have had any criminal intent at all,begay,at,but also reaching conduct such as sexual contact with a toddler that is almost invariably purposeful,violent,and aggressive.it is therefore difficult to determine what kind of conduct and degree of risk is present in the ordinary case,because it is difficult to determine what constitutes an ordinary case under such statutes.see james,at noting that proper inquiry focuses on the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense,in the ordinary case.accordingly,courts deciding whether violation of a statutory rape law is categorically violent have often looked,inter alia,to the age of the protected minors to assess the typical character of the prohibited conduct,reasoning that laws penalizing sexual contact with young children will in the ordinary case present a risk of injury,whereas laws criminalizing such conduct with older,more mature minors may not.compare,sawyers,at holding that violation of tennessee statutory rape law,covering victims aged thirteen to seventeen,did not present a categorical risk of physical injury because,inter alia,more mature victims that is,older teens were included in the statute,with united states howard,cir holding violation of prohibition on sexual contact with a child of a tender age younger than fourteen years to be a violent felony but citing cases in which conviction for sexual abuse under statutes involving victims aged at least fourteen did not qualify.
as the fourth circuit recently recognized in united states rangel castaneda,cir,the age of consent is central to the conception of statutory rape in every jurisdiction,but that age is not everywhere the same.indeed,in interpreting,which governs sentencing enhancements in illegal reentry cases,that court observed that the disagreement among states as to the age at which a minor is legally capable of consenting to sexual relations engenders dramatically different crimes from one jurisdiction to the next.id.in other words,conduct that is perfectly legal for some people could subject many others in neighboring states to years upon years in federal prison.id.surveying state and federal statutes,however,the court found that a robust majority of american jurisdictions the federal government,states,and the district of columbia ha ve set the general age of consent precisely at sixteen years old.id.at.the model penal code and black law dictionary sim
