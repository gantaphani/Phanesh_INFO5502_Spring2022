luis was indicted,tried,and convicted on a single count of conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of.he then sought to dismiss,on double jeopardy grounds,a second indictment charging him with another count of conspiracy under and four substantive counts of possession with intent to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of a and b a,and aiding and abetting others in those offenses in violation of.after the government dismissed the second conspiracy count,the court denied fornia motion to dismiss the second indictment.fornia then pled guilty to each of the four remaining substantive offense counts,expressly reserving his right to appeal those convictions on double jeopardy grounds.fornia was sentenced in separate hearings to consecutive terms of months imprisonment for the conspiracy conviction and months imprisonment for the four substantive counts to run concurrently to each other,for a total term of imprisonment of approximately years.fornia appeals his convictions and sentences.
with respect to his conspiracy conviction,fornia argues that the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained in violation of his fourth amendment right to protection against unreasonable searches and seizures and his fifth amendment right to protection against his counsel rendered constitutionally defective representation at his suppression hearing in violation of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel and the government violated his fifth amendment right to indictment by a grand jury by constructively amending the indictment after its presentment to the grand jury.with respect to his pleas to the substantive offenses,fornia argues that the prosecution was barred by the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment because the government failed to exercise due diligence either by seeking a superseding indictment to the initial conspiracy charge or by promptly joining both cases for prosecution fornia also assigns numerous errors to his sentences,including the claim that the court imposed mandatory sentence enhancements in each case based solely on judicial,thereby increasing the maximum sentence otherwise authorized by or admitted facts in violation of united states booker,d.
after careful consideration of each of fornia claims,tested against the record on appeal,we affirm fornia convictions.because we are not convinced that a lower sentence would not have been imposed under a,guidelines regime,united states,wl at,cir,we vacate all of the sentences and remand both cases for resentencing.
background 
we recount the facts,consistent with record support,in the light most favorable to the jury guilty verdict on the conspiracy charge,united states,cir,and as found by the district court after a suppression hearing,united states ngai man lee,cir.we reserve further details for our analysis of fornia individual claims.
on the afternoon of september,drug enforcement administration dea task force agents conducting visual surveillance of suspected drug conspirators outside a furniture store witnessed several people entering and exiting the store with small boxes and bags that the agents had reason to believe contained illegal drugs or drug proceeds later that day,two suspects left the store carrying a large bag,which they placed in the trunk of a car.agents followed the two men as they drove the car from the furniture store to a bakery,where they met a third man unknown to the agents,who was later identified as fornia.the agents observed the men transferring the contents of the car trunk to the trunk of fornia car,and began following fornia as he drove away from the bakery alone.
at around pm,agents instructed a member of the task force who was a local police officer in uniform to pull fornia over under the pretense of investigating a report of a car stolen from a nearby shopping center whose description matched fornia car.after identifying fornia through his driver license and car registration,the officer obtained fornia consent to search the car,including a garbage bag in the trunk,which contained several smaller bags and a shoe box,all filled with large amounts of cash.once the officer saw the cash,he handcuffed fornia and frisked him,finding no weapon while fornia was handcuffed,the officer signaled for assistance from two local police officers who were not part of the task force but who happened to be patrolling the area.fornia remained handcuffed until another task force member arrived on the scene,pretending to be another police officer in charge of security at the shopping center parking lot,and ordered the handcuffs removed.
the newly arrived agent informed fornia that the money would have to be turned over either to the tax authorities,who would take the cash,deduct a portion,and return the remainder to fornia by check,or,in the alternative,to the dea.fornia stated several times that he would prefer to turn the money over to the tax authorities,observing that their procedure resembled money laundering.instead,the officers awaited the arrival of dea agents,all of whom were members of the task force investigating the suspected drug conspiracy.when the dea agents arrived,they told fornia that he was not under arrest for carrying a large quantity of cash.the agents questioned fornia about his recent whereabouts and asked where he was going with the large amount of cash.fornia did not mention that he had been at the bakery,but replied that he had bought coffee at the shopping center and that he was bringing the money to his house to be stored.the agents then seized the money and asked fornia to go to the dea office for further questioning.fornia agreed and drove his own car to the dea office,where he answered additional questions.fornia was then given a receipt for the cash and left the dea office.
on april,a federal grand jury returned a sealed indictment charging named individuals,including fornia,and unknown with a solitary count of conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of during a time period beginning not later than the summer of and continuing through the date of the indictment.the indictment assigned each named individual a number and described his or her alleged role within the conspiracy.fornia,was included among as transporters of drug s or money.the indictment also alleged overt acts,among others,committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.fornia name appeared only once in the list of overt acts,in paragraph,which alleged that o n september,fernando and osvaldo delivered to luis approximately two hundred thousand and nine hundred dollars of drug proceeds emphasis omitted.
the indictment was unsealed on may,and fornia was arrested on a warrant that day.he was later released on bail.on december,fornia moved to suppress the evidence,including his statements,obtained as a result of the september,stop and search of his car and his subsequent interview at the dea office.after an evidentiary hearing before judge casellas on february,the motion was denied by march,each of fornia in had pled guilty.
on august,a federal grand jury returned a sealed indictment charging named individuals,including fornia and one other person who had also been indicted in and others unknown,with conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of during a time period beginning on or about the end part of and continuing through the date of the indictment.as in,all of the conduct alleged against fornia in took place no earlier than the summer of.identified fornia as,owner of drugs.the indictment also charged fornia with four additional counts alleging substantive offenses in violation of a and b a,and aiding and abetting others in those offenses in violation of.the substantive offenses were also alleged as overt acts and committed in furtherance of the conspiracy charged in count one.
specifically,count two alleged that fornia,indicted and,and an unindicted possessed with intent to distribute approximately kilograms of cocaine o n or about the end part of.count three alleged that fornia,the same indicted,and an unindicted possessed with intent to distribute the same quantity of cocaine o n or about the beginning of.count four alleged that fornia,indicted,and an unindicted possessed with intent to distribute approximately kilograms of cocaine o n or about august,and count five alleged that fornia and an unindicted possessed with intent to distribute approximately kilograms of cocaine o n or about october.additional overt acts alleged in furtherance of the conspiracy included three instances of payments,including an expanded version of paragraph of alleging that o n september,osvaldo villegas rivera and an unindicted delivered to luis approximately of drug proceeds,money related to over t acts and herein emphasis omitted.the money was also related to the facts alleged in support of the substantive offense charged in count three.fornia was arrested on the second set of charges on august,and held without bail.
on april,more than eight months later and during the week when fornia jury trial in was scheduled to begin before judge carter who was sitting by designation,the government moved at a status conference,over fornia objection,to consolidate and for trial and sentencing judge carter denied the motion,stating we are going to try this case.in a written motion filed the next day upon the court instruction,the government explained its reasons for seeking joinder and for seeking a second indictment instead of a superseding indictment in 
the counts contained in both indictment s could have been joined in the same indictment since they are of the same or similar character pursuant to fed.crim a.however,since by august,the date on which the second indictment was returned,all the codefendants with the exception of codefendant luis in had already pled guilty,the government elected to file a separate indictment against fourteen additional codefendants in lieu of supersed ing the indictment in.
fornia trial in began two days later,on april,and continued for five days.the government first witness was a member of the dea task force who described the events depicted on a surveillance videotape,including the arrival and departure of suspected at the furniture store on september,the two rendezvous with fornia at the bakery,and the subsequent discovery of the bags of cash in fornia trunk by investigators during the stop and search of his car.
the government then called an indicted,fernando,who had pled guilty in,as a cooperating witness.torres testified that sometime in late,fornia asked him if he had any contacts at the airport who could assist in shipping cocaine to new york.according to torres,he and two other then met with fornia to arrange a test shipment of kilograms of cocaine to new york torres testified that when the test shipment,which also involved a fifth individual who worked at the local airport,proved successful,the same group of four arranged a second shipment of more than kilograms of cocaine to new york the second shipment,however,never arrived at its destination,according to torres,because the airport worker had been killed and the cocaine lost.torres testified that the four had gone to the airport several times to try to find the killer.
during torres testimony,fornia counsel objected several times on hearsay grounds to torres reports of statements made by other alleged.after one such objection,the court took judicial notice of the indictment in,which was pending before judge.because the events torres described were alleged only in,and the to whom torres referred were indicted only in,the court asked the government whether it could show that the were also participants in the conspiracy charged in for purposes of admitting their hearsay statements.the court then asked why have you indicted in two separate indictments,alleging in the indictment all of these transactions in case number,and now you are proving those acts and transactions in a separate case,this one bearing number.i do understand what you are trying to do.the government responded that at the time and were indicted,they were separate conspirac ies.the court warned,you ca convict the same defendant two times for the same conspiracy.the court then permitted the government to proceed with its direct examination of torres,advising the government that it would not admit hearsay until you tell me that you can connect those to this conspiracy and not just to the other one in.
torres next testified that on september,he had collected money from several people in order to pay fornia for about kilograms of cocaine torres had purchased from him at a price of per kilogram.torres testified that the cash seized from fornia later that same day represented partial payment for the drugs after successful resale torres also identified a paper bag and a shoe box that had been used to hold the cash,and identified his handwriting on the containers recording the amount of cash held in each.torres went on to state that on september,fornia had informed him that the cash had been seized by the dea the previous day,but that fornia planned to recover the cash through a suppression motion or by characterizing the money as proceeds from his legal motorcycle business.torres then described new installment payment procedures fornia devised for receiving future payments in order to avoid the possibility of any additional seizures of large amounts of cash.finally,torres described one additional incident that took place after september,in which fornia supplied him with about kilograms of cocaine 
after the government rested its case,fornia moved for an acquittal.his counsel stated that 
because this case involved a conspiratorial time period that would overlap with,it appears that the evidence that has been brought here is partially from and because of that,i do know how we can decide whether this particular conspiracy has been set forth with all of the elements.
the court asked the government how,in the event fornia was convicted in,he would prove in the other court that he has already been convicted of the same conduct that he is charged with in in response,the government continued to assert that the conspiracy alleged in was different from the one for which fornia was being tried in.eventually,however,the government represented that it would request dismissal of the conspiracy count against fornia in.
on april,the jury found fornia guilty of conspiracy and found that the quantity of cocaine involved in the offense exceeded five kilograms.on april,fornia moved for a new trial alleging that the government failure to provide required pretrial disclosure materially prejudiced his right to a fair trial and that by falsely indicting and prosecuting fornia for two conspiracies when it knew there was only one,the government deprived him of a fair trial.on june,fornia also moved in to confirm consolidation of his cases on the ground that,inter alia,they involved the same alleged conspiracy.the government opposed fornia motion to confirm consolidation of the cases,arguing that consolidation had already been denied no substantial public interest would be promoted by consolidation a t this stage of the proceedings and fornia was estopped from seeking consolidation or had waived the claim because he had opposed the government earlier motion,filed on the eve of trial,to consolidate the cases.on june,judge carter denied both fornia motion for a new trial and his motion to confirm consolidation of the cases,noting that any double jeopardy concerns could adequately be addressed by judge in.
on july,fornia filed a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.as promised,the government dismissed the conspiracy count against fornia in on july.fornia then moved in for a change of plea at the hearing on july,judge denied fornia motion to dismiss.fornia then pled guilty to the four remaining counts charging him with substantive drug offenses.although fornia did not enter into a plea agreement with the government,he expressly reserved the right to appeal his conviction in on double jeopardy grounds,citing menna new york,d per curiam guilty plea does not automatically waive double jeopardy claim.
on october,judge carter recused himself from sentencing,and the case was reassigned to judge.fornia moved in to consolidate both cases for sentencing on october,but judge denied the motion.on the morning of december,judge sentenced fornia in to months imprisonment.that afternoon,in a separate sentencing hearing,the court sentenced fornia in to months imprisonment to run concurrently as to the four substantive counts,but consecutive to the sentence in.fornia timely appealed his convictions and his sentences.
ii.conspiracy conviction 
suppression of.validity of consent to search 
we construe fornia fourth amendment claim,which he raises in a pro se brief,as a renewal of his challenge to the voluntariness of his consent to the search of the bag in his car trunk.see united states weidul,cir consent to a warrantless search must be voluntary to be valid.fornia alleges that his consent was invalid because it was coerced by the police officer drawing of his gun after fornia opened the car trunk,requiring suppression of the bags of cash contained within the larger bag in the trunk.typically,whether consent is voluntary turns on questions of fact,determinable from the totality of the circumstances.for that reason,a finding of voluntary consent other than one based on an erroneous legal standard is reviewable only for clear error,and the trial court credibility determinations ordinarily must be respected.united states romain,cir citations omitted.
during the suppression hearing,officer alverio,the police officer who initially stopped fornia,testified that after fornia consented to a search of the car and opened the trunk to reveal a large bag,he asked fornia if he would mind opening the bag.when fornia began to open the bag,officer alverio testified that he drew his gun in a defensive position out of fornia visual range and pointing at the it was too dark for him to be able to see whether the trunk contained any weapons.the district court determined that officer alverio provided credible undisputed testimony that fornia voluntarily agreed to allow him to search the vehicle and to examine the trunk.the court specifically found that the officer kept the gun out of fornia view and at his side,and placed it back in his holster when fornia stepped away from the trunk,all of which were confirmed by the surveillance video played during the hearing.the court further found that the video shows fornia willingly reach ing in to the open trunk of the vehicle and open ing the bags containing the money.
because the evidence presented at the suppression hearing fairly supports the district court factual findings,united states laine,cir,the district court committed no clear error in determining that fornia consent to the search of the car trunk was valid.based on those findings,the court properly denied fornia motion to suppress the evidence obtained during the stop.
miranda claim 
fornia argues that the statements he made during his entire encounter with the task force agents,including those made at the dea office,should have been suppressed because he was subjected to custodial interrogation without first being advised of his miranda rights,in violation of his fifth amendment right to protection against.see dickerson united states,d failure to give required miranda warnings amounts to fifth amendment violation miranda warnings must be given before a suspect is subjected to custodial interrogation.united states ventura,cir.by contrast,a s a general rule,terry stops do not implicate the requirements of miranda.united states streifel,cir this is so because terry stops,though inherently somewhat coercive,do not usually involve the type of police dominated or compelling atmosphere which necessitates miranda warnings.id.quoting united states bautista,cir.a valid investigatory stop may nevertheless escalate into custody,thereby triggering the need for miranda warnings,where the totality of the circumstances shows that a reasonable person would understand that he was being held to the degree associated with a formal arrest,stansbury california,d per curiam internal quotation marks omitted.relevant factors bearing on whether an investigatory stop has evolved into a de facto arrest include whether the suspect was questioned in familiar or at least neutral surroundings,the number of law enforcement officers present at the scene,the degree of physical restraint placed upon the suspect,and the duration and character of the interrogation.ventura,at internal quotation marks omitted.while we review the court factual findings for clear error,the ultimate conclusion whether a seizure is a de facto arrest qualifies for independent review because it presents a mixed question of law and fact.united states trueber,cir quoting thompson keohane,d.
during the suppression hearing,officer alverio testified that once he saw the large quantity of cash contained in the bags in fornia car trunk,he his weapon and handcuffed and frisked fornia because he was the sole law enforcement officer on the scene,and,in his personal experience,people who may be traveling with large quantities of drug proceeds may also be armed or may travel with armed escorts.officer alverio explained that he did not remove the handcuffs even after the local police officers arrived on the scene to assist him because he did not know the officers.
fornia argues that the totality of the circumstances establishes that the stop of his car,while initially a valid investigatory stop,escalated into a de facto arrest triggering the need for miranda warnings.fornia maintains that the combination of the officer display of a gun,his use of handcuffs and a search,and his explanation that he was investigating a car theft would have led a reasonable person to believe he was effectively under arrest in particular,fornia argues that he was subjected to custodial interrogation because officer alverio questioned him while he was handcuffed.indeed,officer alverio testified during the suppression hearing that he asked fornia where the money in his trunk had come from while fornia was handcuffed,and that fornia responded that the money was from his motorcycle business.while the government did not introduce this particular statement at trial,fornia maintains that the statements he made after the handcuffs were removed in response to questioning by other task force agents should have been suppressed because they were derived from the same miranda violation.see united states byram,cir where the miranda violation is not merely technical,where there is a substantial nexus between the violation and the second statement,and where the second statement is not itself preceded by an adequate miranda warning,suppression of subsequent voluntary statements may be warranted.
the district court concluded that fornia was not subjected to custodial interrogation at any time during the stop and therefore that no miranda violation occurred.the court recognized two arguably coercive facts in support of fornia miranda violation claims officer alverio drawing of his gun and his use of handcuffs.as the court correctly noted,however,neither the use of handcuffs nor the drawing of a weapon necessarily transforms a valid terry stop into a de facto arrest.trueber,at officer drawing of weapon while asking suspected narcotics trafficker to step out of vehicle at night does not transform entire investigatory stop into de facto arrest united states,cir the use of handcuffs in the course of an investigatory stop does not automatically convert the encounter into a de facto arrest.as the court had previously found,officer alverio briefly drew his weapon out of fornia view and for defensive purposes only.similarly,based on officer alverio testimony,the district court found that reasonable safety concerns permeated the officer decision to use handcuffs.
while an officer drawing of his gun and use of handcuffs might in some situations weigh more heavily in favor of a finding that a detention has escalated into a de facto arrest,the district court found that numerous other factors weighed against such a determination in fornia case.specifically,the court observed that the stop took place at the side of a busy public street with a heavy volume of traffic,and that,initially,officer alverio was the only officer on the scene.in addition,the court found that the handcuffs were removed when other surveillance team members arrived,and only remained on fornia for ten or fifteen minutes.finally,the court noted that the interaction between the officers and fornia was not confrontational or bellicose.
these factual findings were not clearly erroneous.based on these findings,the court supportably came to the ultimate conclusion that fornia detention was a valid investigatory stop that did not require miranda warnings.while a reasonable person in fornia situation would certainly have understood that he was under investigation for a crime,the stop,given the facts as found by the district court,lacked the coercive element necessary to convert it into something more draconian,based on the totality of the circumstances.ngai man lee,at.the district court thus properly denied fornia motion to suppress his statements on the ground that they were obtained as a result of a violation of his fifth amendment right to protection against.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
in his pro se brief,fornia claims that he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel at his suppression hearing.under the supreme court decision in strickland washington,d,to establish such a violation,a defendant must show that counsel performed unreasonably and that prejudice resulted therefrom.united states,cir.fornia alleges that his counsel performed deficiently by denying him the opportunity to exercise his constitutional right to testify at his suppression hearing,which resulted in the denial of his motion to suppress evidence 
the record on appeal,however,is devoid of facts relating to fornia interactions with counsel,including whether counsel informed fornia of his right to testify at his suppression hearing,informed him of the constitutional nature of that right,or somehow coerced him into forgoing the exercise of that right.see lema united states,cir discussing considerations for determining whether defense counsel coerced or merely advised client regarding decision whether to testify.because the record is insufficiently developed to permit reasoned consideration of the ineffective assistance claim,united states glenn,cir,fornia may raise such a claim only on collateral attack in a proceeding pursuant to.see united states genao,cir.we therefore dismiss his ineffective assistance of counsel claim without prejudice to the filing of a petition.
constructive variance 
fornia alleges that the government constructively amended the indictment in by introducing evidence of the conspiracy alleged in to prove the conspiracy charged in effect,trying him for an offense other than that alleged in violation of his fifth amendment right to presentment of charges to a grand jury.the government argues that fornia has forfeited his claim of constructive amendment through failure to object to the introduction of evidence on that ground or to seek a continuance or mistrial below.as we have explained,however,after the government rested its case,fornia counsel moved for an acquittal on the ground that the conspiracy the government had attempted to prove in was indistinguishable from that charged in and that the evidence was therefore insufficient to prove the conspiracy charged in.in his motion for a new trial,fornia also argued that he had been prejudiced at trial by the government failure to clarify which of the two charged conspiracies it was attempting to prove in.fornia claim is thus preserved.
the presentment clause of the fifth amendment provides that n o person shall be held to answer for a capital,or otherwise infamous crime,unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury with exceptions not relevant to this case.accordingly,after an indictment has been returned,its charges may not be broadened through amendment except by the grand jury itself.stirone united states,d citing ex parte bain.an indictment has been constructively amended in violation of the presentment clause when the charging terms of the indictment are altered,either literally or in effect,by prosecution or court after the grand jury has last passed upon them.united states fisher,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.such an amendment may occur through the admission of evidence of an offense not charged by the grand jury.united states dunn,cir.
fornia argues specifically that the government tried him for the offense of participating in a conspiracy in which he was an owner of drugs,as charged in,as opposed to the conspiracy charged in,in which he was identified as a transporter of drug s or money and another individual was identified as the only head and owner drug point.however,the statutory offense charged against fornia in,and the offense the government proved at trial,was conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of cocaine in violation of.role in the conspiracy is not an element of that offense.thus,fornia claim does not involve an alleged constructive amendment of to include an offense not charged by the grand jury,dunn,at,but rather an alleged variance from the indictment,which occurs when the charging terms remain unchanged but when the facts proved at trial are different from those alleged in the indictment,fisher,at.
though related,claims of constructive amendment and prejudicial variance differ in at least one important respect.a constructive amendment is considered prejudicial per se and grounds for reversal of a conviction.id.by contrast,v ariance is grounds for reversal only if it affected the defendant substantial rights.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in short,s o long as the statutory violation remains the same,the jury can convict even if the facts found are somewhat different than those long as the difference does not cause unfair prejudice.united states twitty,cir.
fornia argues that the government proof at trial impermissibly varied from the allegations in by establishing that his role in the alleged conspiracy was not that of a transporter of drug s or money in someone else drug distribution operation,but that of an owner of drugs,which fornia sold to torres,who,in turn,sold them to indicted in.indeed,while the government introduced evidence that fornia literally transport ed drug proceeds in the trunk of his car,the government introduced no evidence whatsoever that fornia transport ed the cash in the trunk of his car to or for anyone else.rather,torres testified that it was he who distributed the cocaine he purchased from fornia to the individual identified in the indictment as,head and owner drug point,and other indicted.torres also testified that he then collected cash from other and delivered it to fornia as partial payment for the cocaine fornia had supplied.because the government evidence of fornia role in the conspiracy differed from the role of a transporter of drug s or money in a conspiracy in which another individual was identified as the head and owner drug point,as alleged in the indictment in,there was a variance between the government proof at trial and the charge alleged in the indictment.
nevertheless,fornia fails to establish any prejudice resulting from the variance.the question whether a variance affected a defendant substantial rights is subject to de novo review.united states wihbey,cir.fornia points out that the grand jury that returned the indictment in never had an opportunity to assess the government evidence that he was an owner of drugs,since the government acknowledges that it discovered the facts alleged in only after had already been returned fornia argument misapprehends the nature of the substantial rights protected by the prohibition on prejudicial variance from an indictment,namely,the rights to have sufficient knowledge of the charge against one in order to prepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial,and to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.united states,cir 
the record shows that fornia had ample notice of and ample opportunity to prepare to meet the government evidence before trial.the government need not recite all of its evidence in the indictment,nor is it limited at trial to the overt acts listed in the indictment.united states innamorati,cir.here,however,prior to trial,the government disclosed its intention to introduce evidence in relating to fornia ownership of drugs as alleged in that evidence was relevant to central factual disputes in,for example,whether the money in fornia trunk represented drug proceeds as distinct from legal business proceeds,and whether fornia shared an interest in the sales and distribution activities of others.further,fornia particular role in the conspiracy alleged in was unrelated to his defense theory rather,fornia was well aware that his central defense in needed to be that he was not part of the a transporter of drug proceeds,owner of drugs,or in any other capacity.united states,cir no impermissible variance where defendant was indicted for being a but the evidence proved him a.accordingly,fornia was not misled by the government evidence at trial to defend himself on the wrong grounds.id.fornia was thus able to prepare an effective defense and avoid surprise at trial,at.
finally,the trial court detected the potential for prejudice to fornia ability to avoid a successive prosecution for the same offense based on the government introduction of evidence relating to the charges in evidence of fornia role in that prove the conspiracy charged in.however,as we discuss below in part iii,any such prejudice was cured by the government dismissal of the conspiracy count in.because the variance failed to affect fornia substantial rights,we reject his challenge to his conviction in on the ground of constructive amendment or prejudicial variance.
iii.double jeopardy claim 
fornia appeals the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment in on double jeopardy grounds.the government argues that fornia has waived his double jeopardy claim by objecting to its motion to consolidate the cases for trial,thereby elect ing to have the two offenses tried separately and persuad ing the trial court to honor his election.jeffers united states,d plurality op.while the record is silent on fornia reasons for objecting to the government motion,which was made during a conference three days before fornia trial began in,fornia maintains on appeal that his objection was based solely on his inability to prepare to try both cases on such short notice rather than as an attempt to persuade the trial court of his election to face separate trials.id.the government points out that fornia could have sought a continuance.in denying the government motion,however,judge carter,who was sitting in puerto rico by special designation for a limited period of time,clearly announced his intention to try this case,meaning the indictment.under these circumstances,we treat fornia claim as preserved 
the availability of double jeopardy protection is a constitutional question reviewable de novo.united states lanoue,cir.under the fifth amendment,no person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.among the purposes for double jeopardy protection is the prevention of repeated prosecutions for the same offense,oregon kennedy,d,pursuant to a constitutional policy of finality for the defendant benefit,united states jorn,d plurality op.
fornia double jeopardy claim is narrow in scope.while the double jeopardy clause protects against the danger that,in conspiracy cases,the government might partition a single conspiracy into separate prosecutions by prohibiting successive prosecutions for conspiracies with identical features,united states morris,cir,fornia ultimately faced only one conspiracy prosecution because the second conspiracy count against him was eventually dismissed fornia therefore does not allege that he was prosecuted twice for the same violation of the same statute.
nor does fornia make the futile argument that he could not be successively prosecuted in for substantive drug offenses that were the objects of a drug conspiracy for which fornia had already been prosecuted in.under the traditional test announced in blockburger united states,where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions,the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one,is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.fornia sequential prosecutions under different statutes fully satisfy the blockburger test.in order to establish a violation of,the government need not prove the commission of any overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states shabani,d.conversely,no agreement need be proven to secure a conviction for a substantive drug offense under a.indeed,it has long been established that conspiracy to commit a crime is not the same offense as the substantive crime for double jeopardy purposes,lanoue,at,because the agreement to do the act is distinct from the completed act itself,united states felix,d internal quotation marks omitted adhering to line of cases holding that separate prosecutions for conspiracy and for underlying substantive offenses do not violate the double jeopardy clause.
fornia attempts to reach shelter under the double jeopardy clause by a different route.he points out that the supreme court has suggested that even where a successive prosecution would otherwise be barred under the blockburger test,such a prosecution may nevertheless be permissible under the double jeopardy clause where the additional facts necessary to sustain a subsequent charge ha d not yet occurred or ha d not yet been discovered despite the exercise of due diligence at the time of the first prosecution.brown ohio,d.fornia asks us to fashion a new rule by holding that the double jeopardy clause also prohibits successive prosecutions that would not otherwise be barred under the blockburger test where,in the exercise of due diligence,the government could have brought the prosecutions in the same proceeding.see fed.a permitting joinder of charges against a defendant in the same indictment if the offenses charged are of the same or similar character,or are based on the same act or transaction,or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.
fornia proposed rule is a barely disguised attempt to resurrect the same transaction test for determining when successive prosecutions are barred by the double jeopardy clause.such a test,which would require the government to try together all offenses regardless of the differences in the statutes based on one event,has been consistently rejected by the supreme court.united states dixon,d.instead,the performance of a blockburger analysis completes the judicial task in a successive prosecution case.morris,at.even where,as in fornia cases,prosecutions for different offenses may be suitable for joinder,successive prosecutions are permitted under the double jeopardy clause so long as the offenses pass the blockburger test,with its focus on the statutory elements of each offense.united states,cir.we therefore reject fornia claim that his prosecution in was barred by the double jeopardy clause solely because the government,in the exercise of due diligence,could have brought the charges in a superseding indictment or could have more promptly moved to consolidate and for trial 
iv.sentencing in and 
background 
under and b a,fornia was subject to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of years imprisonment and a maximum term of life imprisonment for each of his convictions,given the jury finding in and his admissions in his guilty pleas in that the quantity of cocaine involved in each offense exceeded kilograms.under the federal sentencing guidelines,fornia sentence in each case was limited to a narrower guidelines sentencing range gsr based on an assessment of his criminal history category and a total offense level calculated by identifying a base offense level corresponding to the crime for which he was convicted,as modified by mandatory adjustments which take into account certain aggravating or mitigating factors.united states austin,cir 
we recount the facts pertinent to fornia sentencing as gleaned from uncontested portions of the presentence investigation report s and the transcript s of the sentencing hearing s.united states cloutier,cir.on the morning of december,the court held a sentencing hearing in.the court calculated fornia base offense level as for a drug offense involving kilograms of cocaine.see a.the court arrived at this figure by dividing the total amount of drug proceeds seized from fornia by the amount torres testified that he paid fornia per kilogram of cocaine,as recommended in the presentence investigation report psr for.the court then found that fornia had been a manager or supervisor but not an organizer or leader and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive within the meaning of b,warranting a upward adjustment to reach a total offense level of.the court declined to impose an enhancement sought by the government for the specific offense characteristic of possession of a firearm.b.the court also declined to impose an acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment because fornia had gone to trial in.see,cmt.adjustment for acceptance of responsibility generally unavailable to defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt.the court then sentenced fornia to the minimum sentence,months imprisonment,within the appropriate gsr for an offender in criminal history category i months,and imposed a fine of and a term of supervised release.
later that afternoon,the court held a separate sentencing hearing in.the court determined that the quantity of drugs involved in all conduct relevant to the charged offenses was the sum total of the amounts involved in the four substantive counts in,or kilograms following the recommendation of the psr in,the court reasoned that of those kilograms were the subject of the sentence in and had already been accounted for by that sentence.accordingly,the court used the remaining quantity,kilograms,to calculate a base offense level of in.the court then found that fornia was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive within the meaning of a,warranting a upward adjustment to reach a total offense level of.the court also found,based on the government representation and the description in the psr prepared in,that two indicted who had pled guilty in had placed fornia in possession of a firearm during a incident.the court accordingly imposed a enhancement for the specific offense characteristic of possession of a firearm during a drug offense,b,reaching a total offense level of.because fornia pled guilty to the four counts in,however,the court imposed a decrease for acceptance of responsibility,b,lowering the total offense level to.finally,based on fornia prior undischarged sentence imposed that morning in,the court awarded three criminal history points to place fornia in criminal history category ii.a.the court then sentenced fornia to the maximum sentence,months imprisonment,within the applicable gsr months,to run concurrently as to the four substantive counts,but consecutive to the sentence of months imprisonment in,for a total term of imprisonment in both cases of just under years the court also imposed a fine of and a term of supervised release to run concurrently with the term of supervised release imposed in.the court declined fornia request for a downward departure on the basis of alleged prosecutorial misconduct.finally,the court determined that no other mitigating fornia deportability nor his allegations of disparity in his sentence as compared with those of his a downward departure.
fornia appeals his sentences on multiple grounds,several of which are interrelated.specifically,fornia argues that the district court imposed mandatory sentence enhancements based solely on judicially found facts,increasing the sentence in each case beyond the maximum authorized by or admitted facts in violation of booker the court erred by failing to use the same drug quantity involved in the conspiracy in,kilograms,to sentence fornia on the four substantive counts in because the cases involved related conduct,see the court imposed a consecutive rather than a concurrent term of imprisonment in,including sentence enhancements based on the same conduct in each case,in violation of fornia fifth amendment rights to due process and protection against double jeopardy the court improperly assigned criminal history points on the basis of fornia sentence for the conspiracy conviction in to increase his sentence in,see the court improperly denied fornia motion to consolidate his cases for sentencing and failed to group the counts in both indictments,see and b c the sentence enhancement in violates the presentment clause of the fifth amendment and the evidence was insufficient to support,by a preponderance of the evidence,the court imposition of enhancements in both and,see,and the specific offense characteristic enhancement for possession of a firearm in,see b.as we discuss below,our disposition of fornia claims of booker error obviates the need to address his other sentencing claims.
booker error 
after briefing was completed and oral argument held in this case,the supreme court decided booker,in which the court precluded,on sixth amendment grounds,a sentencing court from imposing a sentence on the basis of judicially found facts that exceed s the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict,booker.at,but only insofar as the sentence resulted from a mandatory system imposing binding requirements on sentencing judges,united states antonakopoulos,cir.because the mandatory nature of the guidelines raised constitutional concerns,the court eliminated such concerns by striking the statutory provision that renders the sentencing guidelines binding on federal courts,b 
fornia cited apprendi new jersey,d,in his written objections to the draft psr in each of his cases as a ground for objection to the imposition of role enhancements or enhancements for possession of a firearm we therefore treat his claims of booker error as preserved on appeal and subject to review for harmless error.antonakopoulos,at as a result of the supreme court remedial decision,booker error is established whenever a defendant guidelines sentence was imposed under a mandatory guidelines system,whether or not the sentencing court relied on judicial to increase the sentence beyond the maximum authorized by or admitted facts.antonakopoulos,at.under harmless error review of booker claims,in order to avoid a remand for resentencing under advisory guidelines,
the government has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the defendant substantial rights.that is,we must be convinced that a lower sentence would not have been imposed had the guidelines been advisory.this is an extremely difficult,but not impossible,standard to meet.
at,wl,at.where a defendant assails,as a constitutional violation,the imposition of enhancements that bring his sentence above the maximum sentence authorized by jury or admitted virtual prerequisite for the preservation of a claim of booker error factual certainty alone in support of such enhancements would not be sufficient to show beyond a reasonable doubt that the judge,acting under an advisory guidelines system,would have applied the same sentence on the basis of those factors.id.
applying this standard to fornia sentences,we can not conclude with the requisite certainty that the district court would not have imposed lower sentences in each of his cases under a guidelines regime.as our description of fornia multiple claims of guidelines error suggests,the guidelines sentencing here was complex.in response,the court imposed the minimum sentence under the gsr for the conspiracy conviction in,the maximum sentence under the gsr for the convictions on the four substantive offenses in with those sentences being concurrent to each other,and then made the maximum sentence consecutive to the minimum sentence.on its face,this mixture of leniency and stringency is unusual,and the
