joseph castello was convicted in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york wexler,after a jury trial,of failing to file thousands of currency transaction reports ctrs in the course of running his business,in violation of a.forfeiture was mandatory,and the district court fixed the amount at,plus his equity in his house the first order.on appeal,this court affirmed the conviction but vacated the first order and remanded to the district court for further as to whether the forfeiture was unconstitutionally excessive.
on remand,the district court second order fixed the forfeiture amount at zero.this appeal by the united states does not contest or concede the unconstitutionality of the original amount instead,the government argues that some amount of forfeiture is mandated.
we now vacate the second order and remand for the district court to reinstate the first order.
castello business cashed more than million in checks over the period of the indictment january,to november.in violation of a and b,castello failed to file ctrs for thousands of these checks exceeding.checks in amounts exceeding constituted about million of the total.
on march,a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging castello with conspiracy to launder money h failure to file ctrs a unlawfully structuring financial transactions conspiracy to impair,impede,obstruct,and defeat the internal revenue service tax evasion and obstruction of justice.following a jury trial,castello was acquitted of all charges except failure to file ctrs.
forfeiture is mandatory for failure to file ctrs.c a.the government sought forfeiture of which represented four percent of the value of the checks exceeding for which no ctrs were filed representing funds connected with a citibank account held in castello wife name and castello equity in the family home in greenwich,connecticut.castello opposed the government proposed forfeiture on the grounds that the funds sought were not involved in the offense and therefore were not subject to forfeiture,and that in any event the amount of forfeiture was grossly disproportional to the crime in violation of the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment,as that clause had been interpreted in united states bajakajian.
by memorandum and order of september,the district court concluded that the government proposal represents a proper amount subject to forfeiture because it was properly representative of the fees earned by castello for cashing checks in excess of for which no ctrs were filed,and because the specific assets identified are properly traceable to the crime.united states castello,wl,at.separately,the court considered the constitutionality of the forfeiture under bajakajian and held that it was fair,reasonable,and by the evidence of record.accordingly,the forfeiture sought does not violate the eighth amendment.id.at.
the first order,entered september,imposed forfeiture as sought by the government,plus the equity in the house.castello was also sentenced to the statutory maximum of five years imprisonment,three years supervised release,a fine,and a special assessment.
castello appealed his conviction and his sentence.the conviction was affirmed by summary order.see united states castello,app x cir summary order.the forfeiture order was vacated in a separate opinion.see united states varrone,cir varrone rejected castello argument that the forfeiture violated c a,varrone,at it is therefore law of the case that the entire amount deemed forfeitable in the first order is properly forfeitable under the statute.at the same time,varrone vacated the first order and remanded,holding that the findings were insufficient to test constitutionality 
w e lack an adequate factual record to determine whether the forfeiture ordered by the district court constitutes an excessive fine,and we therefore vacate the district court order of forfeiture in the judgment and in its separate forfeiture order and remand to the district court to make factual findings regarding the four factors set forth in united states bajakajian.
varrone,at.
on remand,the district court conducted a bajakajian analysis,held that the first order can not be upheld,united states castello,wl,at may,and issued the second order,which imposed no forfeiture at all.
the united states now appeals the second order.the government does not concede or contest that the original forfeiture amount was unconstitutionally excessive.instead,it argues that forfeiture in some unspecified amount is mandatory.
we review the district court legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error.bajakajian,at united states capoccia,cir.
the court in imposing sentence for any violation of section the statute castello violated shall order the defendant to forfeit all property,real or personal,involved in the offense and any property traceable thereto.c a emphases added.in fixing the amount of forfeiture,the statute thus affords no leeway all property involved in the failure to file ctrs is forfeited as well as all property traceable to that offense.see varrone,at united states elfgeeh,cir.
at the same time,this broad forfeiture provision is limited by the excessive fines clause of the eighth amendment.see bajakajian,at.the touchstone of the constitutional inquiry under the excessive fines clause is the principle of proportionality the amount of the forfeiture must bear some relationship to the gravity of the offense that it is designed to punish.id.at.the rule is that a punitive forfeiture violates the excessive fines clause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant offense.id.the burden rests on the defendant to show the unconstitutionality of the forfeiture.united states jose,cir united states ahmad,cir.
putting c a and bajakajian together the proper amount of forfeiture following a a conviction is the total forfeitable amount required by the statute,discounted by whatever amount is necessary to render the total amount not grossly disproportional to the offense of conviction.four factors,distilled from bajakajian,guide our analysis 
the essence of the crime of the defendant and its relation to other criminal activity,whether the defendant fit s into the class of persons for whom the statute was principally designed,the maximum sentence and fine that could have been imposed,and the nature of the harm caused by the defendant conduct.
varrone,at applying bajakajian internal quotation marks and brackets omitted.to see how these factors work,it is useful to consider the supreme court approach in bajakajian.
customs inspectors,using dogs trained to smell currency,stopped bajakajian as he awaited a plane to italy and advised him that under federal law anyone transporting more than in currency outside the united states must file a report with the federal government.bajakajian,at.bajakajian claimed that he had only and his wife,but their bags contained over in cash.id.at.bajakajian was convicted of willfully failing to report,in violation of,a.bajakajian,at.acting pursuant to a forfeiture statute nearly identical to c a the district court determined that forfeiture of the whole,as mandated by statute,would be grossly disproportionate to the offense in question,and accordingly limited the forfeiture to.bajakajian,at internal quotation marks omitted.
the supreme court affirmed,id.at,and its analysis tracked the four factors listed above.first,the essence of the defendant crime was a reporting violation wholly unrelated to any other illegal activities.the money was the proceeds of legal activity and was to be used to repay a lawful debt.id.at.second,the defendant d id not fit into the class of persons for whom the statute was principally designed he wa s not a money launderer,a drug trafficker,or a tax evader.id.at.third,under the sentencing guidelines,the maximum sentence that could have been imposed was six months,while the maximum fine was.such penalties confirm a minimal level of culpability.id.at citations omitted.and fourth,t he harm that the defendant caused was also minimal and only the government was affected and in a relatively minor way there was no frau
