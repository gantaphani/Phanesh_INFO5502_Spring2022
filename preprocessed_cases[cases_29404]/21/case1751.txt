this appeal again presents us with the question whether a state felony conviction for simple drug possession constitutes an aggravated felony under b,the guideline that identifies specific offense characteristic enhancements for violations of unlawful reentry after deportation.when,in united states,cir,we answered this question in the affirmative,we were reviewing the version of b.today,we reach the same conclusion in construing the november amendment to that guideline.
appellant,the united states of america,appeals from that part of the november,judgment of conviction of the united states district court for the southern district of new york deborah batts,judge that sentenced miguel ramirez to months incarceration and supervised release on his guilty plea to illegal reentry after deportation in violation of.the united states submits that the district court erred in its calculation of ramirez guideline range by refusing to treat his two prior new york state felony convictions for drug possession as aggravated felon ies warranting an enhancement pursuant to b c and,instead,applying the enhancement provided in b d for defendants deported after conviction for any other felony.because we conclude that a felony drug possession conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony under b c,just as it did under the version of the guideline,we vacate ramirez sentence and remand the case for resentencing.we further grant the united states unopposed request to remand for correction of the written judgment to conform with the court oral sentence of a term of supervised release.
background 
ramirez deportation from the united states after new york state convictions for drug possession 
on march,miguel ramirez,a dominican national unlawfully in the united states,was arrested by new york city police officers for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.that same month,on march,ramirez was again arrested after selling cocaine to an undercover detective.ramirez resolved both cases by pleading guilty to two felony counts of simple cocaine possession in the third degree,see penal law mckinney,for which crimes he received concurrent sentences of years imprisonment.paroled on march,into the custody of the immigration and naturalization service,ramirez was deported to the dominican republic on august.
ramirez guilty plea for unlawful reentry into the united states 
on march,approximately eight months after deportation,ramirez reentered the united states without the permission of the attorney general,in violation of a.almost immediately,on march,ramirez was arrested by new york city police for again selling drugs federal authorities were alerted to his presence in the united states and,on september,a grand jury sitting in the southern district of new york returned a indictment charging ramirez with illegal reentry after deportation.see a.on april,after a petit jury had been empanelled,ramirez pleaded guilty to the single charge against him.
ramirez sentencing 
after reviewing ramirez report,as well as various submissions from the parties discussing which of the b enhancements applied in ramirez case,the district court,on september,issued a memorandum and order noticing its intent to apply the enhancement provided in b d for prior felony convictions that do not constitute aggravated felonies.see united states ramirez,wl.
implicitly acknowledging this court holding that felony convictions for simple drug possession qualified as aggravated felon ies under b,see united states,at,the district court questioned the continued applicability of that decision after amendment of the guideline in.prior to amendment,b had provided for only two possible increase if a defendant had been deported after conviction for an aggravated felony,see b a,and a increase if deportation had followed conviction for any other felony,see id.b b.after amendment,however,a prior aggravated felony conviction warrants only an enhancement,see b c,unless it falls within certain specified categories.in the case of prior drug convictions,a enhancement applies for drug trafficking offense s resulting in sentences exceeding thirteen months.id.b a.if a drug trafficking offense results in a sentence of thirteen months or less,a enhancement applies.id.b b.
the problem,in the district court view,was that amended b,like its predecessor,defines aggravated felony by reference to a,see application note,which,in turn,incorporates the definition of drug trafficking crime employed in c,see a b.perceiving no meaningful distinction between a drug trafficking crime and a drug trafficking offense,the district court concluded that continued application of the statutory definition of aggravated felony to the amended guideline would elevate all drug felonies to drug trafficking felonies,thereby defeating the amendment effort to draw distinctions between those drug crimes sufficiently serious to warrant the twelve and enhancements called for by b a b and those meriting the lesser increase provided in b c.united states ramirez,wl,at.
concluding that it could not treat ramirez felony possession convictions as aggravated felon ies for purposes of b c without simultaneously treating them as drug trafficking offense s under b a a result it deemed at odds with the purpose and intent of the district court declined to apply b c to ramirez and,instead,calculated his guidelines with reference to the enhancement provided in b d for any other felony.id.at.
the united states objected to the court conclusion that every aggravated felony under b c was necessarily a drug trafficking offense under b a or b b and urged application of the enhancement.unpersuaded,the district court determined that ramirez total offense level was and that,with a criminal history category of v,his sentencing range was to months.the court sentenced ramirez to the middle of this range,imposing a term of incarceration.
ii.discussion 
a.the appropriate b.standard of review 
the question which guideline enhancement properly applies to ramirez case presents no disputed issues of fact but only a disagreement about the proper interpretation and application of b.we review de novo the district court ruling on this issue.see united states rivers,cir.
section b enhancements before the november amendments 
prior to amendment in november,b a provided that in calculating the guideline range of a defendant convicted for unlawful reentry after deportation,the base offense level of eight should be increased by sixteen i f the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony.construing this provision in both united states polanco,cir and united states,at,this court concluded that it applied to any felony conviction,whether under federal or state law,for conduct proscribed by the controlled substances act,et.
the court explained in,at,that although did not specifically define the term aggravated felony,the guideline application note referenced the definition in a.that statute defines aggravated felony to include any illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as defined in section of title,including a drug trafficking crime as defined in section c of title.a b.it further states that the term aggravated felony applies to an offense described in a whether in violation of federal or state law.id.a.section c of title,in turn,defines drug trafficking crime to include any felony punishable under the controlled substances act et.c.
based upon this analysis,the court concluded that a new york state felony conviction for attempted drug possession constituted an aggravated felony subject to the enhancement then provided in b a 
first,the offense conduct to which defendant pleaded guilty,attempted possession of cocaine in the first degree,is punishable under the controlled substances act as an attempt to commit a violation of a,which makes it a crime to possess knowingly a controlled substance.see a,supp.ii.the second the defendant was convicted of a felony under either state or federal also satisfied.see penal law mckinney attempted criminal possession in the first degree is a class felony.
the united states submits that this logic,applied to ramirez case,re
