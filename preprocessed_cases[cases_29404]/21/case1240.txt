background 
goffer,kimelman,and drimal,along with defendants,conducted a,insider trading network that led the participants to acquire over million in profits.goffer,who worked as a proprietary at the schottenfeld group,llc schottenfeld,spearheaded the conspiracy.
in,drimal traded from the offices of the galleon group galleon,a firm led by raj rajaratnam.kimelman,previously an attorney at a new york law firm,traded for quad capital quad,a proprietary trading firm.in late,kimelman,goffer,and goffer brother emanuel established a new trading firm,incremental capital incremental,though they retained their other positions.in early,kimelman left quad to trade with emanuel,and goffer began trading at galleon.kimelman and goffer spoke often and shared information that led them to trade in the same stocks.in and,kimelman and goffer traded stocks within five days of each other,including stocks that they both traded on the same day.
i.the conspiracy 
in the summer of,arthur cutillo and brian santarlas,attorneys at ropes gray llp,met with jason goldfarb,a workers compensation attorney who had attended law school with cutillo.goldfarb indicated to the ropes gray attorneys that he had a friend who traded stocks and would pay for information about corporate acquisitions.the government showed at trial that goffer was this friend.what followed was a series of tips in which cutillo santarlas would obtain material information and pass it to goldfarb,who,in turn,would pass it to goffer.goffer distributed these tips,which frequently related to impending takeovers,to friends and partners.based on these tips,goffer and his would acquire positions in the targeted companies and profit from the takeover effect on the share price.
goffer network used prepaid cellular telephones to avoid detection these phones used by the attorneys and the traders were destroyed after each successful tip.see,tr,gov t ex.throughout the relevant time period,goffer spoke with coconspirators,especially kimelman,guardedly when on the phone.for instance,he described the chang tip as a good thing but nothing i going to talk about on the telephone.gov t ex.goffer often asked kimelman to meet in person or in the street when conveying sensitive information.they also discussed countermeasures and ways to avoid detection,suspecting that trades in companies immediately prior to their acquisition could raise regulatory eyebrows.goffer relied on kimelman to provide him with insights into the meaning of legal documents associated with the acquisitions,including revised merger agreements,settlement agreements,signature pages,and limited guarantees,inter alia.
ii.the tip 
the first tip presented at trial related to bain capital bid to acquire.when cutillo and santarlas learned about the progress of the deal for example,by finding documents entitled closing agenda or signature papers on ropes gray document management system or on a communal printer they reported this progress to goldfarb,who passed it on to goffer.goffer shared information relating to the takeover bid with some of his coconspirators.goffer frequently convened a group of traders typically including emanuel,kimelman,and david plate,another schottenfeld trader at a bar where the group would discuss the progress of the takeover bid and any new information that goffer had received regarding the plans.
on august,goffer,drimal,emanuel,and plate began acquiring stock based on the material nonpublic information that goffer received from goldfarb.gov t ex.that evening,goffer had a minute phone conversation with kimelman the next day,kimelman purchased shares of stock.that week,forbidden from purchasing more stock by quad risk management team,kimelman sent an otherwise wordless email to goffer into which he had pasted an instant message conversation with quad risk management expert.
goffer also provided details about the acquisition and the sources of his information to drimal drimal passed both on to david slaine,a cooperating witness.drimal explained that the information came from an attorney from ropeson who risked his whole career and maybe going to jail by sharing these tips.gov t ex.
on september,goffer told plate and other coconspirators that the acquisition of would happen the next day.goffer had learned that the signature papers were prepared and he confirmed with kimelman,who verified,based on his background as an attorney,that signature papers were what they sounded like they were something that took place at the end of a deal.tr.kimelman was either present or was consulted over the phone.bain announced its acquisition of the next day the all profited goffer told plate that he needed to pay his source,and identified those who were contributing including drimal the paid santarlas,cutillo,and goldfarb each.
iii.other tips 
in november,santarlas overheard other ropes gray associates discussing a client upcoming acquisition of axcan.santarlas,who did not work on mergers and acquisitions,accessed at least four documents on the ropes gray document management system relating to the acquisition he and cutillo shared the tip with goldfarb.goldfarb passed the attorneys information to goffer,who disseminated it at a minimum to drimal and slaine.drimal shared the information with michael cardillo,a galleon trader,though he again attributed the tip to ropeson attorneys.tr.drimal and plate purchased axcan stock and benefitted from the axcan acquisition announced on november,drimal gained.goffer did not trade axcan because it was a small,stock and he did not want to attract regulatory attention.tr.
in february,santarlas learned about a possible takeover of chang china bistro,from a colleague he conveyed this information to goldfarb,who shared it with goffer.tr,gov t ex.a few days later goffer called kimelman to seek his advice,but noted that it was nothing i going to talk about on the telephone.gov t ex.kimelman agreed to come into manhattan to figure out our plan of attack.id.goffer,emanuel,and kimelman decided to purchase chang stock as part of an acquisition of a broad restaurant portfolio to disguise their use of the inside information.tr.goffer instructed the group that everything got to be printed out to help them go about justifying a trade.gov t ex.no chang acquisition was announced in.
in march,cutillo and santarlas observed that deal documents for bain capital acquisition of clear channel communications,clear channel were laid out in a closing room at the law firm,apparently ready for execution,and reported that closing was imminent.unbeknownst to these tippers,neither of whom worked on the deal,the clear channel acquisition was staged so that the lenders could be sued for specific performance.when the deal did not close as anticipated,goffer,kimelman,and drimal all suffered losses on their clear channel investments.
in may,there was more clear channel activity at the ropes gray offices.cutillo passed the information to goldfarb,who told goffer.tr,gov t ex.goffer summoned kimelman for an urgent meeting immediately afterwards,he called another trader and told him to purchase clear channel call options for everybody.gov t ex.over the next two business days,clear channel publicly announced that it was in settlement talks with the lenders and that an amended merger agreement had been reached.the market reacted favorably to this news and goffer earned over million in profits in his galleon account trading on this tip.
schottenfeld trader gautham shankar provided several tips to goffer,including acquisitions of kronos,and hilton hotels hilton.tr.goffer,kimelman,drimal,and emanuel benefitted from trading on this inside information.profits from these illegal trades were included in calculating the loss amount for sentencing purposes,but the trades were not charged at trial.
iv.recruitment of david slaine 
in the fall of,goffer and kimelman recruited david slaine to join incremental capital.the hoped that slaine,who unbeknownst to them was working as a cooperating witness after his own arrest for insider trading,would provide them with the financial backing to get their insider business off the ground.kimelman urged goffer to tell slaine that he would get great information by investing with incremental.gov t ex.goffer mentioned that he had received tips about certain acquisitions before they happened,including,axcan,and hilton.gov t ex.goffer jokingly told slaine that the information came from a construction worker,but when pushed he elaborated you are probably better off not knowing where they were coming from y ou do want to know where it coming from obviously.gov t ex.kimelman chimed in,asserting that the source was that g uy fixing that pothole down there.id.
trial and sentencing 
the government evidence at trial included testimony from slaine,santarlas,plate,cardillo,and a ropes gray partner.it also included recordings of slaine conversations with goffer,kimelman,drimal,and emanuel wiretap recordings of goffer conversations with kimelman,drimal,emanuel,and others instant messages and sent between the telephone records and trading records.
defendants were convicted on all counts.the district court sentenced drimal who pled guilty to months imprisonment,goffer to months imprisonment,and kimelman to months imprisonment.the district court also entered forfeiture orders of million,and against drimal,goffer,and kimelman,respectively.
discussion 
defendants challenge the admission of wiretap evidence in support of their convictions the sufficiency of the evidence to support kimelman conviction on the substantive counts of insider trading the district court jury instructions on conscious avoidance the district court exclusion of evidence that kimelman rejected a plea bargain and the sentences they were issued.other arguments raised by defendants are addressed in a related summary order.goffer,wl.
lawfully obtained wiretap evidence is admissible in a securities fraud prosecution 
defendants contend that the district court erred in permitting the government to introduce evidence obtained through wiretaps because securities fraud is not a predicate offense under title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of,et title iii,and because the evidence was not intercepted incidentally to an otherwise lawful wiretap.see.concurring with the analysis of a recent and related case in the southern district of new york,we hold that the evidence was lawfully obtained and therefore properly admitted.see united states rajaratnam,cr rjh,wl,at,aff,cr,wl cir.june.
defendants assert two flaws with the wiretap evidence that the government adduced at trial first,they allege that the wiretap evidence should be excluded because securities fraud is not a predicate offense under title iii.second,they allege that the intercepts are not admissible in a securities fraud prosecution unless interception of information relating to securities fraud is inadvertent.neither argument is persuasive.
title iii contains an exclusionary rule prohibiting the use at trial of unlawfully intercepted communications.a i.to benefit from the exclusionary rule,defendants have to establish that the wiretaps were illegal.
section of title iii governs the use of evidence obtained on a wiretap relating to offenses other than those specified in the order of authorization or approval.t he purpose of is to prevent subterfuge searches,in which the government uses a warrant authorizing seizure of one type of evidence as a license to collect evidence of an offense not covered by the authorization.united states smith,cir.o ther offenses under section may include offenses,federal as well as state,not listed in section so long as there is no indication of bad faith or subterfuge by the federal officials in re grand jury subpoena served on doe,cir.
when an authorized wiretap intercepts communications relating to offenses other than those specified in the order of authorization,disclosure or use of those communications is permissible provided a subsequent application made to a judge of competent jurisdiction demonstrates the good faith of the original application.united states marion,cir.such subsequent application would include a showing that the original order was lawfully obtained,that it was sought in good faith and not as a subterfuge search,and that the communication was in fact incidentally intercepted during the course of a lawfully executed order.id.quoting,at.we perceive no reason why the principle undergirding this rule that disclosure or use of communications intercepted incidentally to an otherwise lawful,good faith wiretap application does not violate title not apply when the government forthrightly discloses the probability of intercepting communications relating to other offenses ex ante,at the time it makes its initial wiretap application.congress did not intend that a suspect be insulated from evidence of one of his illegal activities gathered during the course of a bona fide investigation of another of his illegal activities merely because law enforcement agents are aware of his diversified criminal portfolio.united states mckinnon,cir.
in this case,government investigators indicated in the wiretap applications that,in addition to wire fraud,they expected to uncover evidence of securities fraud which,they expressly noted,is not a predicate offense under.this representation ensured that the wiretaps were not obtained as a subterfuge or to surreptitiously investigate crimes other than those about which they informed the court 
w hen the government investigates insider trading for the bona fide purpose of prosecuting wire fraud,it can thereby collect evidence of securities fraud,despite the fact that securities fraud is not itself a title iii predicate offense.rajaratnam,wl,at.the ten judges reviewing wiretap applications in this case found that the government proved that it had a investigation of wire fraud money laundering.the fact that the government also informed the approving courts that defendants were involved in a conspiracy to commit securities fraud did not immunize defendants from otherwise lawful interception of communications related to their wire fraud.the wiretap evidence was lawfully obtained and properly admitted.
ii.the jury had sufficient evidence to convict kimelman of securities fraud 
kimelman challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his substantive securities fraud conviction for his purchase of shares of stock on august,and shares of stock on september.specifically,he contends that the government did not prove that goffer had tipped him about or that he knew or consciously avoided knowing that goffer had material nonpublic information about that was disclosed in violation of a fiduciary duty more specifically,he argues that the government main evidence,an unrecorded phone call he had with goffer on august and an email he wrote to goffer on august,does not indicate that he received a tip from goffer or knew that any such tip was based on information.he also insists that a discussion he had with the other on september,on the eve of the deal announcement,can not count as proof of his awareness of the earlier fraud.
a liable tippee must know that the tipped information is material and and the tippee knows or should know that there has been a breach of fiduciary duty.sec obus,cir emphasis retained quoting dirks sec.the government did not need to prove that kimelman knew the identity or nature of the source if he knew that the information was illegally obtained.id.in denying kimelman rule motion,the district court described this as a verdict that could go either way and certainly a close case,but decided that the jury verdict was not unreasonable such that it should be overturned.reviewing de novo and crediting every inference that the jury may have drawn in the government favor,we agree.united states hassan,cir quoting united states finley,cir.
a court examines each piece of evidence and considers its probative value before determining whether it is unreasonable to find the evidence in its totality,not in isolation,sufficient to support guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states autuori,cir.this requirement is particularly critical where,as here,some evidence derives its probative force from other evidence.t he jury verdict may be based entirely on circumstantial evidence.united states santos,cir quoting united states martinez,cir.moreover,we need not find that every reasonable jury would have convicted kimelman we affirm if we find that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states stewart,cir internal quotation marks omitted,emphasis in original.
kimelman argues that we should exclude from our analysis evidence related to activity after the trades at issue.we reject this argument.kimelman knowledge of the illicit nature of goffer source after the trades is still probative though not in itself sufficient to establish his knowledge before the trades.
evidence indicating a defendant knowing participation in a later stock manipulation scheme is relevant to the earlier scheme where,for example,it shows that a defendant was conversant in the language of stock manipulation.united states rutkoske,cir.this analysis applies equally in the context of insider trading.relevancy can not be reduced to a mere chronology whether the similar act evidence occurred prior or subsequent to the crime in question is not necessarily determinative to its admissibility and therefore its probative value.united states ramirez,cir.subsequent acts are frequently probative as to intent.see,united states germosen,cir.here,kimelman participation in goffer ongoing scheme led to later transactions that so closely paralleled the charged conduct that it was probative regardless of the temporal difference.united states curley,cir.
if we focus on the evidence in the record from prior to the public announcement of bain bid for on september,and credit every inference that the jury could have drawn in the government favor,we find ample support for the jury to conclude that kimelman was tipped by goffer and knew or consciously avoided knowing that goffer tip about was based on nonpublic information illegally disclosed in breach of a fiduciary duty.
the kimelman goffer telephone call of august,though unrecorded,marked a change in kimelman stock trading behavior.prior to august,kimelman stock in smaller quantities of,and shares,including on august,just two days before the call.kimelman did not maintain those positions but sold them before the end of each trading day.on august,the day after the evening phone call,however,kimelman bought shares of,easily his largest purchase,which he did not sell.in the subsequent days and weeks,he continued to add to that another shares on august and more shares on august.he maintained the accumulated position until after the merger bid was announced when the share price shot up,he sold the position and profited.
kimelman was so aggressive in acquiring that his employer at quad restrained him from making further purchases of stock.despite the warning from quad,kimelman managed to buy more shares of on september.from august to,kimelman behavior changed from being very cautious about to suddenly becoming very confident.such a sudden change in a defendant stock trading pattern,which can not be readily explained by other reasons,could be probative of trading on insider information.see united states smith,cir recognizing situations in which unique trading patterns or unusually large trading quantities suggest that an investor had used inside information.
his to goffer on august,with news of quad restraint indicates at the very least,that the two were actively discussing the trading in shares.kimelman new trading behavior matched that of goffer and of the other who were tipped by goffer on august.and like the others,kimelman cashed out of his positions shortly after bain bid was announced.parallel trading patterns among can be another indicator of insider trading.see,sec warde,cir.in this case,the manner in which kimelman sold the stock is at least suggestive of the motive he had for buying it,which was not for long term investment value,but in anticipation of a particular event.
also revealing is the discussion kimelman had with goffer on the eve of the deal announcement on september.goffer asked about the significance of signature pages in a pending transaction,and kimelman explained that the preparation of the signature pages meant that a deal signing was imminent.as a former associate at a leading corporate law firm,kimelman had to know that goffer,in asking such a question,was privy to the inner workings of a pending transaction to be aware of the status of signature pages.since goffer had no legal basis to have access to such information,kimelman must therefore have known or was aware of a high probability that this insider information was made available to goffer in breach of a fiduciary duty.indeed,it was from this exchange that plate,who testified about the conversation,became convinced that goffer tip was illegally obtained.
kimelman also argues that much of the government evidence applied equally convincingly to plate,who claimed at trial that he did not know of goffer inside source until the signature pages conversation.however,a rational juror could readily infer from the trust that goffer showed in kimelman by asking him about the signature pages and the manner in which kimelman answered without astonishment as to goffer knowledge or expression of concern about the sensitivity of such information that kimelman shared a relationship of trust with goffer that plate did not.this,in turn,would support an inference that kimelman had some degree of prior awareness of goffer illegal source of information,even if the jury also concluded that plate had no such awareness.moreover,the jury was free not to credit plate testimony that he did not know about the source of the inside information.w e defer to a jury assessments with respect to credibility as long as they are reasonably based on evidence presented at trial.united states torres,cir quoting united states ceballos,cir.
after september,evidence of his knowledge of the fraud becomes overwhelming and kimelman does not deny the sufficiency of the showing in support of his conspiracy conviction.goffer later described kimelman and emanuel as members of his inner circle or tight circle.a rational juror could find that this circle came together well before those statements were made and prior to the beginning of the trades.the government produced evidence from july showing that the trio bought and profited from shares of hilton hotels shortly after goffer received an insider tip.goffer and emanuel,along with outside the inner circle,bought shares of on august.kimelman habit of feigning indifference to the source of goffer information in the presence of not within the inner circle also continued in the subsequent months.
viewed in its totality,the government proof provides enough evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that kimelman was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of insider trading in.the jury verdict is supported by sufficient evidence and is not unreasonable we affirm kimelman conviction.
iii.the conscious avoidance jury instructions were proper 
over kimelman objections the district court instructed the jury on the theory of conscious avoidance,which permits a jury to convict a defendant for deliberately clos ing his eyes to what would otherwise have been obvious to him.united states gansman,cir.kimelman appeals the issuance and the substance of jury instructions on conscious avoidance as to the illicit origins of goffer tips.finding no flaw in either,we affirm.
a.there was a factual predicate for the instruction 
a conscious avoidance instruction may only be given if the defendant asserts the lack of some specific aspect of knowledge required for conviction and the appropriate factual predicate for the charge exists,the evidence is such that a rational juror may reach the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was aware of a high probability of the fact in dispute and consciously avoided confirming that fact.united states svoboda,cir quoting united states ferrarini,cir internal alterations and some quotation marks omitted.in this case,the first prong is met kimelman claimed ignorance at trial as to the source of the tip.however,kimelman contends that there was insufficient evidence for a juror to conclude that he was aware of a high probability that the tip came from an insider and chose to avoid confirming that fact,and for a juror to conclude that he ever knew about the illicit nature of goffer information.we disagree.
for substantially the same reasons discussed above,there was ample evidence supporting the inference that if kimelman did not know about those facts,that he had to have consciously avoided becoming aware of them.first,given the minute telephone conversation he had with goffer on the evening of august,the abrupt and pronounced change in his trading pattern of stock immediately thereafter,his subsequent outreach to goffer about trading on august,and the fact that goffer had shared the tip with other whom kimelman knew,a rational juror was entitled to conclude that kimelman was aware of a high probability that goffer had insider information about.second,the fact that goffer asked about signature pages on the eve of the deal announcement and the routine manner in which kimelman answered the question,again provides the basis for a juror to conclude that he was aware of a high probability that the source of goffer information was illegal.
with respect to kimelman conscious avoidance of knowledge of goffer sources throughout the conspiracy,kimelman challenge lacks any merit.while he and kimelman were recruiting slaine for incremental,goffer told slaine that he was better off not knowing where his tips were coming from.gov t ex.that way,goffer continued,if someone from the government ever ask ed you where did that tip come from.you would be like,i do freakin know where it came from.building on goffer facetious assertion that his source was a construction worker,kimelman added that it was a g uy fixing that pothole down there.his additions to this conversation about the need for plausible deniability underscore kimelman conscious avoidance of knowledge as to goffer source.the jury was entitled to hear the conscious avoidance instruction.
kimelman argument that the government evidence sought to prove actual knowledge rather than conscious avoidance is both unsupported and irrelevant.red flags about the legitimacy of a transaction can be used to show both actual knowledge and conscious avoidance.united states ferguson,cir citing united states nektalov,cir.
b.the content of the instructions was proper 
kimelman alleges that the district court erred in declining to amend its jury instructions to accord with the supreme court ruling in global tech appliances,seb.specifically,kimelman contends that the global tech decision required that jury charges indicate that the mental state of recklessness is insufficient for a finding of conscious avoidance.because global tech did not alter the conscious avoidance standard,we hold that the district court refusal to amend the jury instructions to accord with global tech was not error.
in global tech,the supreme court synthesized conscious avoidance holdings from eleven circuit courts in order to import the doctrine from criminal law to patent law.at and.the court did not alter or clarify the doctrine,but instead identified the common ground among the courts of appeals 
a ll courts of appeals appear to agree on two basic requirements the defendant must subjectively believe that there is a high probability that a fact exists and the defendant must take deliberate actions to avoid learning of that fact.we think these requirements give willful blindness an appropriately limited scope that surpasses recklessness and negligence.
id.at emphasis added.
kimelman urges us to believe that this language,built upon,inter alia,second circuit precedent in svoboda,at,was designed to alter the substantive law.global tech simply describes existing case law.in so holding,we follow other decisions in this circuit since global tech that have applied the traditional conscious avoidance doctrine.see,united states coplan,cir ferguson,at.
the district court instructions in this case properly imposed the two requirements discussed by the global tech decision kimelman requested that the district court insert the word reckless into a list of mental states that were insufficient.however,global tech makes clear that instructions such as those in this case that require a defendant to take deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of wrongdoing are inherently inconsistent with a reckless defendant who merely knows of a substantial and unjustified risk of such wrongdoing.at.the district court instructions were consistent with global tech we therefore affirm kimelman conviction.
iv.evidence of kimelman rejection of a plea bargain was properly excluded 
kimelman contends that the district court erred in excluding his rejection of a plea bargain.the trial court assessment that the probative value of relevant evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice is reviewed only for an abuse of discretion.united states khalil,cir internal quotation marks omitted.kimelman argues by analogy to united states biaggi,cir,in which we held that the defendant decision to forgo immunity out of an insistence that he was innocent was probative of his consciousness of innocence.id.at.
the defendant in biaggi was offered complete immunity.id.relying on the difference between this and an offer to plead guilty to reduced charges,we held that a defendant decision to reject an offer of immunity was probative.id.at.we did not decide whether a defendant is entitled to have admitted a rejected plea bargain.id.at.
this case differs from biaggi because the excluded evidence here lacked any probative value.kimelman has detailed the devastating collateral consequences flowing from the entry of a criminal conviction against him although the parties disagree as to the terms of the rejected plea offer,both parties concede that it would have entailed a conviction.this was not a case where the defendant was permitted to walk away scot free and declined to do so out of a strong belief of his innocence.rejecting this offer was,in this case,an indication that the defendant prefer red to take his chances on an acquittal by the jury,rather than accept the certainty of punishment after a guilty plea.id.
the district court briefly discussed the prejudicial effects of admitting this evidence,including the likelihood of jury confusion.admission would require the collateral consequences of a conviction to be discussed at length,requiring an already complex trial to gain additional and unnecessary dimensions.we find that the trial court was within its latitude in excluding kimelman rejection of a plea agreement under federal rule of evidence.see holmes south carolina.
defendants sentences were reasonable 
goffer and drimal challenge the substantive and procedural reasonableness of their sentences.the role of appellate courts in sentencing is important but limited.we review the work of district courts under a deferential standard.united states cavera,cir en banc quoting gall united states.
defendants sentences were procedurally reasonable 
defendants contend that the district court committed procedural error in sentencing them.in reviewing sentencing for procedural errors,we first look for error in the district court calculation of the united states sentencing guidelines range.id.at.her
