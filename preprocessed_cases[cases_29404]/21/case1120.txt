peter nedd appeals from his sentence of months imprisonment imposed after pleading nolo contendere to four counts of transmitting threatening communications in interstate commerce in violation of c and pleading guilty to one count of interstate violation of a restraining order in violation of a.he argues that the district court erred in its application of the grouping rules of the united states sentencing guidelines,in particular,groups of closely related counts,by grouping the indictment into three groups instead of into one group we affirm,although on an interpretation of the grouping rules different from that of the district court.
background 
the facts underlying this appeal are not in dispute.we take the facts and sentencing details from the presentence report psr and the transcript of proceedings below.united states lindia,cir.
defendant personal history 
defendant peter nedd is a year old man with a history of mental illness such as manic depression and schizophrenia,both of which were diagnosed in when he was living in boston and hospitalized for a brief time.
while a resident of boston,nedd attended the kingdom hall of jehovah witnesses in cambridge.there he met the carpenter family,richard and andrea carpenter and their daughter chantelle.nedd became obsessed with chantelle,desiring her romantic affection.nedd would call the carpenters house repeatedly requesting to see chantelle and would send chantelle gifts.his attention was unreciprocated.richard carpenter became especially concerned with nedd behavior when,in,nedd falsely claimed that richard carpenter had given chantelle permission to marry nedd.at the time,chantelle was a teenager and nedd in his early thirties.
although nedd moved to new york in,his obsession with chantelle did not end.he continued to call the carpenters home and to send letters and gifts to chantelle.the carpenters felt harassed by nedd repeated communications.they stopped answering their phone and began to record all of his telephone messages with their answering machine.
the carpenters describe nedd messages left on the their answering machine in the fall of as changing in tone from romantic obsession to threatening violence.those messages demanded that richard carpenter allow chantelle to marry nedd or that chantelle return all the gifts nedd had sent her.the carpenters did not return nedd calls.
in may,nedd came from new york to boston to see chantelle.when richard and andrea carpenter learned that nedd was in boston,they sent chantelle into hiding and obtained a temporary restraining order against nedd.that restraining order was made permanent on june,and prohibits nedd from,among other things,threatening either richard or chantelle carpenter.
criminal conduct for the instant case 
although nedd returned to new york without further calls or attempted visits to the carpenters home,during the summer of,he persisted in harassing the carpenters as before then,on october,nedd called the carpenters from new york and left what would be the first of four recorded violent messages on their home telephone answering machine that form the bulk of the present charges.on that day he left the following message on the carpenters answering machine hey richard carpenter,did you get that letter i sent your fucking daughter,if i see you and you come near me i will break your fucking jaw.if you have a fucking gun,i will shove that shit up your fucking hole and blow your fucking brains out this conduct forms count i of the indictment issued against nedd in this case interstate threats in violation of c.
on october,nedd again called the carpenters,this time saying that he was on his way to boston.after arriving in boston,he made several calls to the carpenters and tried to visit them at their home,to no avail.this behavior violated the permanent restraining order and is the conduct that forms count vi of the indictment interstate violation of a restraining order in violation of a.
on november,nedd left another message from new york on the carpenters answering machine that said,in relevant part hey richard,if i do get my fucking shit back that i gave your daughter with a fucking note that says i am sorry i hurt your feelings,i will fucking kill you,and her,and your fucking wife slams the phone down.this conduct forms count ii of the indictment interstate threats,c.
on december,nedd left the following message that forms count iii of the indictment interstate threats,c hey richard carpenter,guess what i going to kill you and i am going to beat the shit out of you and if i see your fucking daughter i beat the shit out of her and fuck her up the ass like a fucking dog 
on december,nedd left the last of the four messages described in the indictment.this one forms count iv interstate threats,c.it said hey richard carpenter i going to fucking kill you i coming to boston,richard,and this time you wo see me.and when you come to your fucking house i will break your fucking head open.i kill your wife and your fucking daughter if you do not send all my personal things back

on november,the district court sentenced nedd to months incarceration and three years of supervised release,imposing a number of special conditions including that the defendant continue to take his medication and that he have no contact with the carpenters.
d.the sentencing determination made below 
at the sentencing hearing in the district court,the court discussed with the parties the most appropriate method under the sentencing guidelines for grouping the five counts of the indictment.see generally,ch,pt.d,introductory cmt.entitled multiple counts,one purpose of which is to determin e a single offense level that encompasses all the counts of which the defendant is convicted.probation recommended grouping the five counts according to victim,positing three groups,one for each of the three members of the carpenter family the government advocated probation position with proffers of victim impact statements from each of the carpenters.nedd counsel objected to this method,arguing that grouping by victim was not permitted under the sentencing guidelines as such a method split a count among several groups,putting one count into more than one group,see supra note,and therefore had the potential to create more groups than counts and would thwart the purposes of grouping,which is to lessen the amount of sentencing determinations and to prevent multiple punishment for substantially identical offense conduct.id.it was and remains the defendant position that all five counts should form one group.according to the defendant,all five counts involve substantially the same harm within the meaning of stating that a ll counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single group.this would result in a sentence of eighteen to months,as opposed to the to month range for the three groups advocated by the government.
the district court sentenced nedd to months in prison,the of the government proposed guideline range.in so doing,the district court settled on three groups for the five counts of the indictment,accepting probation and the government position that grouping the counts of the indictment into three groups by victim,each a member of the carpenter family,was the correct application of the sentencing guidelines.nedd has appealed from this sentencing determination.
ii.discussion 
this appeal presents two related questions.first,whether the district court erred when it refused defendant request to group all five counts of the indictment as one group under groups of closely related counts.second,if grouping more than one group was appropriate,whether the district court erred when it split the counts of the indictment between three groups,each corresponding to a primary victim,either richard,andrea or chantelle carpenter.
a.the grouping rules 
we look first at the language and purpose of the grouping rules in the sentencing guidelines.the introductory commentary to the chapter at issue,ch,pt.d multiple counts,indicates that the grouping rules are meant to serve at least two main objectives.one such objective is to bundle indictments into sets of counts that share the same harm or can be otherwise characterized as the same type of wrongful conduct in order to provide incremental punishment for significant additional criminal conduct.ch,pt.d,introductory cmt.some offenses that may be charged in indictments are so closely intertwined with other offenses that conviction for them ordinarily would not warrant increasing the guideline range.id.for example,e mbezzling money from a bank and falsifying the related records,although legally distinct offenses,represent essentially the same type of wrongful conduct with the same ultimate harm,so that it would be more appropriate to treat them as a single offense for purposes of sentencing.id.
another objective of the guidelines grouping rules is to limit the effect of prosecutorial choices in the design of the indictment which,by charging multiple offenses intend to exact or threaten greater punishment but which,nevertheless,may be fairly characterized with fewer counts and thus punishable by a less severe sentence.
in order to limit the significance of the formal charging decision and to prevent multiple punishment for substantially identical offense conduct,this part provides rules for grouping offenses together.convictions on multiple counts do not result in a sentence enhancement unless they represent additional conduct that is not otherwise accounted for by the guidelines.in essence,counts that are grouped together are treated as constituting a single offense for purposes of the guidelines.
the rules that instruct a district court how to group closely related counts reflect the goals.those rules state in relevant part 
all counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped into a single group.counts involve substantially the same harm within this rule 
a when counts involve the same victim and the same act or transaction.
b when counts involve the same victim and two or more acts or transactions connected by a common criminal objective or constituting part of a common scheme or plan.
c when one of the counts embodies conduct that is treated as a specific offense characteristic in,or other adjustment to,the guideline applicable to another of the counts.
d when the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss,the quantity of a substance involved,or some other measure of aggregate harm,or if the offense behavior is ongoing or continuous in nature and the offense guideline is written to cover such behavior.
in addition to the above rules,the district court cited to the application notes to the guidelines and that correspond to the offenses of conviction,c and a respectively.those notes say that f or purposes of chapter three,part d multiple counts,multiple counts involving threatening or harassing the same victim are grouped together under groups of closely related counts.multiple counts involving different victims are not to be grouped under,cmt.emphasis added from this directive,and in light of,the district court determined that counts with distinct victims despite describing the same crime could not be grouped together.neither party quarrels with that generalization.indeed,the plain language of the guideline commentary quoted above leaves scarce room for any other interpretation 
first question presented 
based upon the premise that counts with the same victim may be grouped and those with different victims may not be grouped,the defendant urged the district court to group all five counts into one group because all five counts shared the same primary victim richard carpenter and a common criminal objective to harass richard carpenter family.nedd contends that andrea and chantelle carpenter were mere secondary or indirect victims of his threatening behavior.see,cmt.the term victim is not intended to include indirect or secondary victims.generally there will be one person who is directly and most seriously affected by the offense and is therefore identifiable as the victim.if this were so defendant argues it was by virtue of the fact that all four of his phone calls began hey richard b might be invoked to form just a single group from all five counts,thereby resulting in a lower guideline sentencing range.
the district court rejected this contention finding that t he plain reading of the communication the four threats,suggests there were three primary victims,there were threats directly to three different people.the district court therefore refused to find that richard carpenter was the sole primary victim,and that chantelle and her mother andrea were not also primary victims,of nedd threatening conduct.finding three primary victims,the court determined that it could not group all five counts as one.
the district court based its factual finding that all three victims were primary on the language of the indictment,the tape recordings of the threats,and the written victim impact statements submitted by each of the three carpenters.these sourc
