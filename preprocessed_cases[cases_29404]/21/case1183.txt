defendant david jim norman appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york following a jury trial before katherine forrest,judge,convicting him of conspiracy to commit wire fraud in violation of,and sentencing him to,inter alia,years imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release he was also ordered to pay in restitution and to forfeit.on appeal,norman challenges only the imprisonment component of his sentence,contending chiefly that the district court erred in calculating his offense level under the sentencing guidelines guidelines by making findings that increased his offense level for his role in the conspiracy,the number of victims of his crime,and the amount of loss they sustained,all principally on the basis of his testimony at trial,while also finding that he committed perjury at trial and increasing his offense level for obstruction of justice.norman also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.finding no merit in his contentions,we affirm.
background 
in mid,norman,along with two codefendants,olivia jeanne bowen and noemi dodakian,was charged in count one of an indictment alleging conspiracy to commit wire fraud,in violation of,from early through the filing of the indictment.norman was arrested in canada in and was extradited to the united states in.in the meantime,bowen and dodakian,who were also charged with a separate wire fraud conspiracy in count two of the indictment along with two other defendants but not norman,were convicted on both of the counts against them bowen after a plea of guilty and dodakian after a jury trial.
norman was tried alone in a jury trial in.the government evidence at his trial showed that the conspiracy involved a supposed investment program called the jim norman program,which was an scheme in which bowen and,along with others,norman called facilitators or his team trial transcript tr.communicated with numerous persons and persuaded them to invest.the facilitators see part.below,and sometimes norman himself,told prospective investors various stories as to the needs and purposes of the jim norman program,principally representing that norman had acquired or inherited many millions of dollars that were tied up overseas,much of it in accounts in his name or in the name of his nonprofit espavo foundation at the world bank or the international monetary fund imf.prospective investors were told that norman needed relatively modest amounts of money to pay fees and taxes in order to liberate his millions.
norman and his facilitators offered investors returns that were vastly disproportionate to the money to be invested and told them that their investments would be without risk,as norman would give them promissory notes.for example,investors were promised that if they sent norman,they would receive,within one week,the investment plus.see,tr.cindi owen,a victim who,with associates,originally sent norman,testified that they were promised that they would receive million plus the return of the invested owen and her husband subsequently invested an additional obtained from a line of credit secured by their home,for which they were promised plus the invested.see id.at.another victim testified that she and her husband invested funded by cash advances on credit cards and were promised that they would be paid million.see id.at.
no one who contributed to the jim norman program received the promised payout.few,if any,were even repaid their investments.
norman testimony at trial 
at his trial,norman testified and offered various explanations as to the means and goals of the scheme,contending that it was a valid investment program.a musician by trade,norman testified that he initiated his investment program after receiving,in or see tr,an email request for money from persons in the ivory coast with whom he had had no prior contact desmond see id.at and desmond mother and sister.norman testified that desmond said he and his mother and sister wanted to move to france but they could not get their initial sum of million out of the ivory coast because that country lacked a suitable banking system.id.at.they asked that norman be the recipient or the beneficiary of these funds and assist them in getting the money out into the western banking system.id.norman was to retain a portion of that money for getting it out of africa and was to send the remainder to desmond and his family when they reached france.
in order to initiate any transfer of the funds belonging to desmond,his mother,and his sister,however,the manager of the ir bank tr.see id.at requested hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees id.at.norman himself had no such assets indeed,from through he was on the verge of bankruptcy.see id.at,after the beginning of,norman was broke.norman,a canadian resident,testified that he therefore recruited facilitators,persons who were experienced in raising money in the united states.among norman facilitators were bowen and dodakian linda palmer,who worked with bowen and dodakian and john billingsley,who headed another fundraising group.see id.at.norman testified that the facilitators succeeded in raising money from investors and sending it to accounts at the world bank and the imf.see,id.at.he testified that they were so successful in raising money for desmond that norman was soon engaged to raise money to unlock accounts of others,including desmond brother david with million,and an asset manager with million,and another portfolio manager with more than billion.see,id.at.
norman testified that he had email communications with officials of the world bank and the imf who repeatedly warned him that additional fees must be sent to those institutions in order to preserve and unlock accounts established by norman in his name or that of his espavo foundation.see,tr.many such emails from a teresa referred to as t whom norman described as a representative of the imf with respect to economic affairs relating to west africa id.at.the government,in its,had called as witnesses officials of the world bank and the imf,who testified that those institutions had no accounts in the name of either norman or espavo foundation.see id.at.the world bank official testified that that institution did not maintain any accounts in the names of private individuals or nonprofit foundations a person can not wire money to the world bank.see id.at.nor did the world bank have any record of employing the person norman claimed to have dealt with at the world bank.see id.at.norman nonetheless testified that he and his facilitators sent to the world bank and the imf moneys demanded by those institutions for norman accounts,pointing to emails he claimed to have received containing such warnings and demands from european offices of the world bank and the imf.see tr.
on,norman held fast to his position that the emailed warnings and demands to which he pointed were from the world bank and the imf despite the fact that they were written in broken english.see,tr.and he insisted that the emails were from those institutions european branches despite being confronted with the fact that,to the extent that the emails revealed any place of origin,they showed that they originated on the west coast of the united states.see id.at.
also on,norman testified that more than people in the united states had sent him money for investments in the jim norman program.see,tr.he testified that,in all,he had collected from those persons between million and million.see id.at.he testified that he wrote promissory notes to the people on the wires coming in id.at,each with a specific deadline for payment see id.at.norman admitted that all of the due dates passed without any investor receiving any payout.see id.at id.at nobody has been paid back.
norman,however,who had no income of his own see id.at,spent many thousands of the invested dollars on himself.he maintained a bank account in the united states into which his investors wired money for the jim norman program the centura account.from that account in november through march,norman withdrew nearly in cash and made purchases totaling more than with a debit card.see tr.government exhibit gx.he spent,inter alia,some on gucci luggage see tr,nearly to update his audio equipment tr.see id.at,more than for clothing see gx,at tr,to updat e his wardrobe,more than on furniture,art,and persian rugs for his loft see tr.sentencing transcript,and bought a porsche truck see tr.because he needed transportation id.at.
norman testified that he was still,during the trial,seeking investors for the jim norman program see,tr.and that he believed the promised moneys would be received see id.at.the jury found him guilty of conspiracy.
sentencing 
the presentence report psr prepared on norman calculated that his guidelines offense level was,without consideration of a possible increase for obstruction of justice,an issue as to which the psr deferred to the district court.there was no dispute that norman criminal history category was i,as he had no prior criminal record.the range of imprisonment for a defendant with that offense level and criminal history is months for norman offense,the top of the range was limited to months because the statutory maximum prison term was years.
after receiving the psr and submissions from the parties,and hearing oral argument with respect to each side objections to various calculations,the district court too concluded that norman guidelines offense level was,although it did not reach that conclusion by exactly the same route as the psr.the court found that norman base offense level was seven,see guidelines a setting seven as the base offense level for a fraud offense for which the statutory maximum prison term is years or more.the court added steps pursuant to b j for a loss amount of more than million but not more than million four steps pursuant to b b for an offense involving or more,but fewer than,victims two steps pursuant to b because the crime involved sophisticated means or was committed in substantial part from outside of the united states four steps pursuant to a on the ground that norman was an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive and finally two steps pursuant to on the ground that norman had obstructed justice both in his trial testimony and in posttrial letters he sent to the court.see.
the court rejected objections by norman to the increases based on the amount of loss,the number of victims,the number of participants in,or the extensiveness of,his offense,and obstruction of justice.as to the first three objections,the court noted that norman himself testified that he had received between million and million and that none of his investors had been paid that norman testified that his investors numbered more than and that norman used numerous facilitators to obtain money from investors.the court stated that it could also have made the same findings as to loss amount even in the absence of such testimony by norman,given the documentary evidence introduced by the government with respect to moneys flowing from investors into his centura account.
with respect to the enhancement for obstruction of justice,the court found that numerous aspects of norman testimony were false,including his testimony as to how the jim norman program came into being,his testimony that he sent moneys he received from investors to accounts at the world bank and the imf,and his testimony that he received numerous warnings and demands for additional sums of money from those two institutions see.the court found that these and other false aspects of norman testimony were intended to influence the jury to vote for his acquittal.see id.at.the court also found that norman,after trial and before sentencing,had attempted to prevent the imposition of a just sentence by sending the court letters containing false information see letters from david norman to judge forrest dated june and july,dkt,respectively.in these letters,norman claimed that money for investors in the jim norman program had arrived and that he needed to make travel arrangements for several of his associates so that the funds could be accessed.the court stated the letter to me indicated some money had been received.there is no money.there are no accounts.the money has not been received.these are false statements.they are lies.the court found that norman had acted consciously with a purpose of obstructing justice.id.at.
although norman argued that it was internally inconsistent for the court to rely on his testimony in order to increase his offense level for such factors as loss amount and number of victims while simultaneously imposing an increase on the basis of his testimony id.at see id.at,the court rejected that argument.it pointed out that t he law allows the finder of fact in a sentencing proceeding as in other fact finding proceedings to credit some but not all of the testimony.id.at.it stated that 
o f course some witnesses tell the truth sometimes and lie other times.some lie all the time.some never lie in their testimony here,i believe there was a mixed bag.there was some perjurious testimony and there was some truthful testimony.
id.the court stated that it credited norman testimony to the extent that it was corroborated by other evidence.id.at.
after considering the sentencing factors set out in a,the court concluded that imposition of the statutory maximum term of imprisonment was required in light of each factor see.taking those factors and the applicable advisory guidelines range into consideration see id.at,the court sentenced norman principally to months imprisonment see id.at.the court stated that it would have imposed that prison term irrespective of the range.see id.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,norman pursues his contention that his sentence was substantively and procedurally unreasonable,arguing principally that the court could not permissibly rely on parts of his trial testimony to enhance his offense level for such guidelines factors as amount of loss and number of victims,while rejecting other parts of his testimony as perjurious,requiring a further enhancement for obstruction of justice.see norman brief on appeal at.he also argues that the court was not entitled to rely on his testimony as to the number of investors in his scheme or the total amount of loss he caused because his testimony was inconsistent id.at,unsubstantiated id.at,extravagant id,insufficiently corroborated id.at,and unreliable id.we reject all of his contentions.
sentencing procedure 
although the guidelines are advisory,rather than binding on the district court,see united states booker,the court must begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable guidelines range,gall united states.and after giving both parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate,the district judge should then consider all of the a factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.id.at.those factors include the nature,circumstances,and seriousness of the offense the defendant history and characteristics the need to deter the defendant from committing further crimes and to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.see,a.
we review the district court sentencing decision for both substantive and procedural reasonableness.see,id.at.review focuses principally on the district court application of the a factors see part.below and is essentially review for abuse of discretion,see,gall,at,united states broxmeyer,cir broxmeyer,cert.denied.united states cavera,cir en banc cavera,cert.denied.procedural errors in sentencing would include failing to calculate the advisory guidelines range,improperly calculating that range,failing to consider the a factors,or selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous factual findings.gall,at see,united states johnson,cir.
the district court factual findings at sentencing need be supported only by a preponderance of the evidence.see,united states cossey,cir united states salazar,cir united states gaskin,cir,cert.denied,united states ben shimon,cir.in reviewing a sentence,we will not overturn the district court findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.see,united states skys,cir skys united states garcia,cir.we give due deference to district court sentencing decisions,taking into account totality of circumstances.broxmeyer,at quoting gall,at.
that deference derives from a respect for the distinct institutional advantages that district courts enjoy over their appellate counterparts in making an individualized assessment of sentence under a.gall united states,at.accord united states jones,cir.among those advantages is a district court unique factfinding position,which allows it to hear evidence,make credibility determinations,and interact directly with the defendant and,often,with his victims,thereby gaining insights not always conveyed by a cold record.see gall united states,at 
broxmeyer,at.w here there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.united states abiodun,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,see,united states.sash,cir.
in the present case,the district court painstakingly calculated the range of imprisonment,finding that the factual components of its calculations were supported by at least a preponderance of the evidence see,loss amount of more than million established by well in excess of preponderance of the evidence,id.at perjury supported by clear and convincing evidence t here is no doubt.norman claims of procedural error are that the court improperly calculated his guidelines offense level by crediting parts of his trial testimony that required enhancement of his offense level while finding other parts perjurious,requiring a further enhancement of his offense level for obstruction of justice,and making findings as to loss amount,number of victims,role,and intent to obstruct justice that norman argues are clearly erroneous.none of his contentions has merit.
b.the claim of inconsistent treatment of norman trial testimony 
norman contention that the district court could not permissibly enhance his guidelines offense level based on parts of his trial testimony that it chose to credit and further enhance his offense level on the ground that he committed perjury is meritless.every criminal defendant is privileged to testify in his own defense,or to refuse to do so.harris new york.but the function of a trial is to seek the truth and witnesses,before testifying,must give an oath or affirmation to testify truthfully,see.a defendant right to testify does not include a right to commit perjury.united states dunnigan,see,nix whiteside,united states havens,united states grayson,harris,at the privilege of testifying can not be construed to include the right to commit perjury.
it is the job of the factfinder in a judicial proceeding to evaluate,and decide whether or not to credit,any given item of evidence.whether,and to what extent,testimony that has been admitted is to be credited are questions squarely within the province of the factfinder.a jury is properly instructed that it is free to believe part and disbelieve part of a defendant trial testimony.see,united states gleason,cir,cert.denied,see id.at where the court points out that testimony of certain types of witnesses may be suspect and should therefore be scrutinized and weighed with care,it must also direct the jury attention to the fact that it may well find these witnesses to be truthful,in whole or in part.emphasis added united states vega,cir approving instruction to the jury that t he testimony of an individual defendant is before you.you must determine how far it is credited.emphasis added united states martin,cir.approving instruction to jury that i t is for you to decide to what extent,if at all,defendant interest has affected or colored his testimony emphases added,cert.denied.
with regard to factfinding in connection with sentencing,the judge who presided over the trial or over an evidentiary sentencing hearing is in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses,and her decisions as to what testimony to credit are entitled to substantial deference.see,gall,at the sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under a in the individual case.the judge sees and hears the evidence,makes credibility determinations,has full knowledge of the facts and gains insights not conveyed by the record.internal quotation marks omitted broxmeyer,at,united states caracappa,cir.given the district court superior ability to make credibility assessments based on its observation of the witnesses at an evidentiary hearing as to the defendant decision not to testify,we defer to those assessments,cert.denied.united states iodice,cir giv ing particularly strong deference to district court findings after a suppression hearing where credibility determinations are at issue.and just as a jury is entitled to believe parts and disbelieve other parts of a witness trial testimony,so is the sentencing judge.like any other factfinder who assesses witness credibility,the sentencing judge is free to believe all,some,or none of a witness testimony.united states candie,cir.norman has cited no logiccontrary to this principle.
punishment for,for willful ly giving false testimony concerning a material matter,dunnigan,at is essential to the integrity of our trial system,id.at.
the requirement of sworn testimony,backed by punishment for perjury,is as much a protection for the accused as it is a threat.all testimony,from witnesses and the accused,has greater value because of the witness oath and the obligations or penalties attendant to it.
id.emphasis added.accordingly,when the sentencing court proper ly determin es that the accused has committed perjury at trial,an enhancement is required for a correct calculation of the defendant guidelines offense level.id.at.
the district court here expressly observed that,although the testimony of some witnesses is homogeneous with respect to truth or falsity,some witnesses tell the truth sometimes and lie other times.the court found that norman testimony was a mixed bag,containing some perjurious testimony and some truthful testimony.id.the court described aspects of norman trial testimony that the court found were false and were intended to persuade the jury to acquit norman see parts above and.below the court stated that it credited norman testimony to the extent that it was corroborated by other evidence corroboration that is described in part.below.
the sentencing court was entitled to credit some parts and to disbelieve other parts of norman sworn testimony and to sentence norman accordingly.
c.the challenges to specific guidelines determinations 
we also reject norman contentions that the record was insufficient to support the court findings that there were more than victims of his crime,that their losses totaled more than million,that his crime involved five or more participants,and that norman perjured himself at trial with the intent to obstruct justice.
amount of loss 
the guidelines require that the offense level of a defendant convicted of a basic economic offense such as conspiracy to commit fraud be calculated in part with reference to the amount of loss caused by his offense.for a loss amount of more than but not more than,the offense level is to be increased by steps.see guidelines b j.the sentencing court is not required to calculate the amount of loss with certainty or precision but need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss that is based on available information.guidelines application note c see,united states bryant,cir.the sentencing judge is in a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based upon that evidence.for this reason,the court loss determination is entitled to appropriate deference.guidelines application note c.
in finding that the total loss incurred by norman investors all,or virtually all,of whom lost their investments exceeded million,the district court relied principally on norman testimony during his and in response to questions from the court.after norman testified that he had told a prospective investor that the jim norman program had received more than million tr,explaining that million was a round figure and that it could have be en more,it could be less id.at,the court sought clarification from norman 
the court when you said it could be more,it could be less,would be less than million or is it between somewhere ish or above 
the witness to 
the court but at least is to the best of your recollection 
the witness yes,between and.
although norman argues that it was procedural error for the court to rely on this testimony because,he now claims,it was extravagant,unsubstantiated,and uncorroborated norman brief on appeal at,his argument is legally and factually flawed.first,while the district court stated that it credited his testimony to the extent that it was corroborated,the court could have accepted it to the extent that the court found it credible even without corroboration there is no requirement that a defendant sworn testimony be corroborated before it can be credited.any lack of corroboration for a witness it is incredible on its merely to the weight of the evidence the weight it is to be accorded is a matter for argument to the factfinder,not a ground for reversal on appeal.see,united states morrison,cir united states roman,cir,cert.denied.
second,norman recollection that the jim norman program received between million and million was in fact consistent with other evidence at trial.the government introduced,without objection see tr,exhibits that summarized the investments wired to norman centura account from through march,see,gx,gx,moneys sent in amounts see gx,at showing investments totaling in,in,in,and in the first three months of.from december through march,the centura account received investments totaling.see id.that account was closed by the bank after march,see tr,but norman testified that he continued thereafter to solicit and receive investments see id.at.that testimony was corroborated by trial testimony from some of norman victims.see,id.at,owen,her husband,and her associates invested in july and august id.at allan title invested in july.
indeed,norman,who was tried in,testified that he was still soliciting and receiving investments in the jim norman program as of the time of trial 
q.you testified that well after this account was shut down in 
march,you continued to raise money 
yes,to date.
you raising money 
nobody has been paid back,correct 
nobody has been paid back.
q.when was the last time you worked on the project 
a.this morning.
having continued to solicit and receive investments,norman testified that gx tally of received by the end of march severely underrepresented the total investments in the jim norman program 
q.the document that we saw in evidence yesterday made reference to approximately million that were received.was that the sum total of what was raised in your efforts to extricate these funds 
no,not even close 
tr.the district court noted that if norman scheme continued to take in money at its rate,by the time of his indictment in mid he would have received more than million in addition to the more than million received prior to march.see.
there was no evidence that the sums invested by norman victims totaled less than the million testified to by norman.the district court did not err in finding that the loss amount was more than million.
number of victims 
the guidelines define a victim to include any person who sustained any part of the actual loss as contrasted with intended loss,guidelines application note a ii determined in the district court calculation of the guidelines loss amount.guidelines application note.a increase in offense level is prescribed if the offense of conviction involved at least but fewer than victims.see guidelines b b.
the district court found that norman offense fell into that category,based largely on gx,which listed well over individuals who wired money to norman centura account from november through march.see.the court noted that although norman testified that he received small amounts from friends as gifts from time to time,he also testified that he had no other significant source of income during the period of the scheme.id.the court found that all in all the wire transfer information lists a number of individuals that are far in excess of.id.
norman argues that gx did not prove that his crime involved at least victims because he was asked whether the persons listed in gx from a through claire olivrious sic were people wiring you money tr,and that a through claire oliverius comprised only some persons see gx,at.see norman brief on appeal at.however,read as a whole,norman testimony about the persons listed on gx was not limited to that small fraction of the list norman admitted that he was receiving investments from t hese people,this long list of people on gx,a list that goes on for three pages tr.
in any event,the district court found,i n addition,that the existence of well above victims was established by norman explicit testimony at trial.norman testified that there were more than investors in the jim norman program see tr,all of whom see id.at,or all but maybe two or three of whom id.at,lost their investments.although on appeal norman contends that the court could not properly rely on his testimony because it was vague and inconsistent norman brief on appeal at in that norman said he had raised money from p robably more than a hundred people tr.and later said that the number of investors was off the top of his head id.at,norman at no point testified that he had fewer than investors,the threshold for the enhancement.he testified in pertinent part as follows 
q.more than a hundred people in the sent you money 
probably more than a hundred.
i would go that far,but i would round it off to a hundred.
id.when the court sought clarification as to how many people contributed to the jim norman program not only directly to norman but also through any of his facilitators,asking whether there were,id.at,norman testified as follows 
the witness off the top of my head really.
q.you already testified well more than a hundred 
yes,yes,yes.
q.other than the two or three or maybe four people who got paid back their principal 
all these other hundred plus people,they did get paid back their principal,right 
norman testimony was neither vague nor inconsistent in stating that there were more than investors in the jim norman over the victim minimum required for the b b increase.there was no error in the district court finding that there were at least victims of norman offense.
leadership role 
the guidelines provide that i f the defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,his offense level is to be increased by four steps.guidelines a.norman does not suggest that he was not an organizer or leader but rather contends that the district court made insufficient findings with respect to the scope of the activity and number of persons who were participants within the meaning of the guideline.although the district court here found both prongs of to have been met see,the standard for this increase is by its terms disjunctive,see guidelines a skys,at,and we conclude that the findings and the record suffice with respect to the five or more participants standard,without needing to reach the question of whether the court findings were sufficient with respect to the otherwise extensive standard.
a participant for purposes of is a person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the offense,but need not have been convicted.guidelines application note.the defendant himself is to be counted as one of the participants.see,skys,at united states paccione,cir,cert.denied.in imposing an enhancement for the defendant role in the offense,the sentencing court must make findings sufficient to permit meaningful appellate review.see,skys,at.
norman argues that the district court failed to make sufficient findings that four people other than himself were criminally responsible for the commission of the offense,rather than being simply unknowing or unwitting participants.norman brief on appeal at.this contention is contrary to the record.the district court fou
