jose regalado appeals from the sentence of months imprisonment imposed by the united states district court for the southern district of new york leisure,following his may,guilty plea to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base.in light of kimbrough united states,d,we are unable to discern whether the district court would have imposed a sentence had it been aware that the cocaine guidelines,like all other guidelines,are advisory only,and that it therefore had discretion to deviate from the guidelines where necessary to serve the objectives of sentencing under a.id.at.we remand the case to the district court for further proceedings necessary to determine whether resentencing is required 
background 
regalado pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of a and b a.at sentencing,the district court determined that regalado distributed more than kilograms of cocaine base,which resulted in a base offense level of.see c.after a enhancement for regalado leadership role,see a,and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see a and b,the resulting sentencing range at criminal history category i was months.regalado unsuccessfully sought a downward departure based on extraordinary family circumstances.however,he did not ask the district court to deviate from the guidelines on the ground that the base offense levels for crack cocaine fail to serve the objectives of sentencing under a.judge leisure sentenced regalado principally to a term of months imprisonment,the bottom of the guidelines range.
regalado appealed,and we remanded the case for further proceedings pursuant to united states crosby,cir.on remand,the government argued that the original guidelines sentence was reasonable and should not be disturbed.regalado crosby submission requested leniency,but made no argument bearing on the district court discretion to deviate from the sentencing ranges for crack cocaine offenses.the district court reviewed its original guidelines calculation,gave renewed consideration to the a factors,and discussed and responded to the parties crosby submissions.it then concluded that it would not have imposed a different sentence had the guidelines been advisory rather than mandatory.it therefore declined to resentence regalado,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
the guidelines drug quantity table sets base offense levels for crack and powder cocaine offenses.see.in kimbrough united states,d,the supreme court held that the cocaine guidelines,like all other guidelines,are advisory only.id.at.although a sentencing judge must give respectful consideration to the guidelines among the array of factors warranting consideration,the judge also has discretion to determine that in the particular case,a sentence is greater than necessary to serve the objectives of sentencing.id.at,citing a.in making that determination,the judge may consider the disparity between the guidelines treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses,so long as the court does not purport to establish a ratio of its own.kimbrough.at.kimbrough thus emphasized the broad discretion of a district court to tailor a sentence in light of other statutory concerns.id.at quoting united states booker,d.
in our review,we owe deference to that discretion.kimbrough.at the ultimate question in kimbrough case is whether the district judge abused his discretion in determining that the a factors supported a sentence of years and justified a substantial deviation from the guidelines range.quoting gall united states,d alteration in original.as the supreme court recently explained in gall united states,the appellate court must review the sentence under an standard.at.first,we ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,such as treating the guidelines as mandatory id.next,we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence for abuse of discretion.id.such review should take into account the totality of the circumstances,including the extent of any variance from the guidelines range it may consider the extent of the deviation,but must give due deference to the district court decision that the a factors,on a whole,justify the extent of the variance.id.furthermore,we may not reverse the district court simply because we would have imposed a different sentence.id.
this guidance and direction from the supreme court confirms the broad deference that this circuit has afforded the sentencing discretion of the district courts.see,united states fernandez,cir united states crosby,cir united states fleming,cir.however,until kimbrough and gall,this circuit tended to discourage district courts from deviating from the crack cocaine guidelines.our opinion in united states castillo,cir,may have been or misread to inhibit any deviation.district courts may also have been inhibited from exercising their full discretion by the fact that the sentencing commission borrowed the guidelines ratio from the mandatory minimums for drug offenses decreed by congress.id.at explaining origin of guidelines crack to powder ratio.therefore,when a district court sentenced a defendant for a crack cocaine offense before kimbrough,there was an unacceptable likelihood of error certainly,the court acted under the influence of a widespread assumption that is now known to be erroneous.where the defendant failed to argue for such a deviation from the guidelines range before the sentencing court,it is impossible to know,ex post,whether the court would have exercised its discretion to mitigate the sentencing range produced by the disparity.
in this situation,we review for plain error.to demonstrate plain error,a defendant must show error,that is plain at the time of appellate review,and that affects substantial rights.where these conditions are met,we have the discretion to notice a forfeited error if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states quinones,cir citing united states olano,d united states rybicki,cir en banc united states thomas,cir en banc.since the district court was,quite understandably,unaware of or at least insecure as to its discretion to consider that the ratio might result in a sentence greater than necessary,there was an unacceptable likelihood of error.while the risk of such error in crack sentences imposed between booker and castillo is not so high as to invariably satisfy the first step of plain error analysis,it is sufficiently real to merit identification in individual cases.as we have held,in the sentencing context there are circumstances that permit us to relax the otherwise rigorous standards of plain error review to correct sentencing errors.united states sofsky,cir.such relaxation is appropriate here because a sizable portion of,cases where error is identified will also satisfy the third and fourth plain error factors given the judiciary concerns about the severity of the crack guidelines.see,united states moore,cir rejecting equal protection challenge to crack guidelines but commenting that t he statistical evidence of disparate impact and several questionable passages in the legislative record are discomfiting and that moore arguments raise troublesome questions about the fairness of the crack cocaine sentencing policy united states singleterry,cir although singleterry has not established a constitutional violation,he has raised important questions about the efficacy and fairness of our current sentencing policies for offenses involving cocaine substances.the unusual circumstances surrounding application of the crack guidelines in the circuit after booker and before castillo justify a narrow and limited exception to our general rule that sentencing courts are presumed to know and follow the applicable sentencing law.see united states fernandez,cir united states gonzalez,cir.
if the district court did not fully appreciate the extent of its discretion to deviate from the crack guidelines range prior to kimbrough,there was an error.after kimbrough,such error would be plain.the remaining questions are whether the likely error affects substantial rights an
