a criminal defendant who,after he is sentenced,elects to cooperate with the government in the prosecution of others may in certain circumstances receive a reduced sentence.see.b.within wide limits,however,the government holds the key that can unlock the door to such leniency.this appeal implicates the extent of the government discretion in deciding when to withhold the use of that key.concluding,as we do,that the district court acted appropriately both in refusing to compel the government to file a rule b motion and in declining to allow either discovery or an evidentiary hearing,we affirm its ruling.
the underlying case had its genesis in the interception of a boat carrying more than kilograms of cocaine off the coast of puerto rico.a indictment against héctor for importation and ensued.
the indictment led to discussions between the defendant and the government anent possible cooperation.in a letter dated march,the government indicated that in light of three defendant reluctance to talk about the full scope of the illicit enterprise,his minimization of his role in that enterprise,and his unwillingness to testify against his would not move for a safety valve reduction 
the defendant was undeterred.on may,he pleaded guilty to a count that charged him with possessing kilograms or more of cocaine with intent to distribute.see a.the plea agreement contained no commitment concerning either the safety valve or the fruits of future cooperation.
nevertheless,following the lower court acceptance of his changed plea the defendant submitted to several debriefings.by the time of the disposition hearing october,the government had changed its tune it moved for the safety valve reduction,vouchsafing that the defendant had provided ample information.the district court granted the reduction and imposed a term of immurement.
subsequent to sentencing,the defendant continued to cooperate in the hope of further leniency.to that end,he submitted to a number of additional debriefings.the last of these occurred in the summer of,when he was interviewed in miami in anticipation of giving testimony before a federal grand jury.special assistant united states attorney jared lópez and the case agent,ricardo cruz,traveled to miami for the occasion.but their journey came to naught through no fault of the defendant,the government plans changed and the proposed grand jury testimony never transpired.
the defendant expected that a reduction of his sentence would be forthcoming.when none materialized,he contacted the prosecutor office in by which time lópez had gone elsewhere.the chief of the office criminal division rejected his overtures.she took the position that the defendant assistance had not been substantial and,thus,did not warrant the filing of a rule b motion to his behoof.
dismayed by this turn of events,the defendant moved to compel the government to invoke rule b.the government opposed the motion.it said,albeit conclusorily,that it had evaluated the defendant cooperation in good faith and discerned no sufficiently compelling reason to proffer such a motion.the district court ordered the government to be more specific and to provide facially adequate reasons for its decision.
the government complied.it limned three grounds for its refusal to invoke rule b.first,it noted that the defendant statements were not sufficiently corroborated by independent admissible evidence.second,it pointed out that certain of those statements were contradicted by another cooperating individual.third,it posited that the defendant had minimized his role in the enterprise.to support this final point,the government annexed to its response a copy of the march,letter mentioned above.
the defendant went on the offensive.he rejoined that the attached letter predated his most meaningful cooperation and,thus,its submission gave rise to a misleading impression.he set out a chronology of his cooperation as he saw it and suggested that the willingness of lópez and cruz to travel to miami for anticipated grand jury testimony reflected the importance that they attached to his assistance.he also professed his belief that lópez and cruz had written letters to the united states attorney recommending the filing of a rule b motion on his behalf.in this regard,he beseeched the court either to compel the government to produce copies of the letters or to convene an evidentiary hearing.
in a memorandum decision,the district court denied relief.even assuming the truth of the defendant allegations as to the views of lópez and cruz,the court saw only normal hierarchical functioning,characteristic of how government agencies and other stratified organizations operate,in the decision to override the recommendation of a subordinate.emphasizing the government decision not to use the defendant testimony either in seeking indictments or at trial,the court perceived no basis for doubting the government assertion that the defendant statements were insufficiently corroborated.finally,the court observed that the defendant had remained silent as to the government averment that he had downplayed his overall role in the criminal enterprise.this timely appeal followed.
congress has established two vehicles through which a convicted defendant sentence may be reduced for reasons unrelated either to his own guilt or to the integrity of the earlier proceedings in his case.see c united states ellis,cir.one of those vehicles,rule b,allows the government to move for a reduced penalty on the ground of substantial assistance rendered to the government cause.in charting the contours of substantial assistance under rule b,courts have consistently looked to the virtually identical language contained in ussg providing criteria for a presentence substantial assistance departure in calculating a defendant guideline sentencing range.see united states alegría,cir explaining that with regard to the meaning of substantial assistance,rule b and ussg are birds of a feather.along these lines,the ample discretion afforded to the prosecutor in deciding whether to seek a section departure is roughly equal to the discretion afforded to her in deciding whether to file a rule b motion.see united states orozco,cir united states gangi,cir.
broad though it may be,this discretion is not unbounded.in wade united states,d,the supreme court held that,notwithstanding the government wide discretion in choosing whether to file a section motion,it may not ground its decision in an unconstitutional motive.id.at.a motive not rationally related to any legitimate governmental purpose comes within the compass of this prohibition.id.at.this jurisprudence applies full force in the rule b milieu,placing unconstitutional motives outside the pale of the government discretion.see,ellis,at united states marks,cir.
the practical effect of this legal framework is as follows.when a defendant complains that an unconstitutional motive has animated the withholding of a rule b motion,the government must satisfy a modest burden of production.to do so,it need only adduce facially adequate reasons explicating its decision.see alegría,at.this is solely a burden of production,not a burden of persuasion.see id.
confronted with a facially adequate explanation for the government decision not to file a rule b motion,a defendant is bound to accept that explanation unless he can convince the court to allow discovery or to grant an evidentiary hearing.the wade court has warned of the dangers presented by unrelenting inquiries into prosecutorial motives.see wade,at.thus,neither discovery nor an evidentiary hearing should be ordered unless and until the defendant makes a substantial threshold showing of improper motive.id.internal quotation marks omitted united states panitz,cir stating generally that the right to an evidentiary hearing in connection with a motion in a criminal case requires that the defendant make a sufficient threshold showing that material facts were in doubt or dispute.
judicial review in this cobwebbed corner of the law has not been much discussed.a district court determination of the facial adequacy of the government proffered explanation for withholding a substa
