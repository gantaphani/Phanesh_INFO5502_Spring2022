eddie rodríguez was convicted by a jury in the district of puerto rico of several drug offenses.after a partially successful appeal of his conviction and sentence,he was resentenced by the district court on remand.he now appeals the resulting sentence,arguing that the district court failed to follow proper sentencing procedures and erroneously determined the quantity of drugs for which he was accountable.after careful consideration,we affirm.
facts background 
eddie rodríguez was found guilty of five offenses following a jury trial.this appeal arises from his resentencing after this court vacated two of those convictions and remanded the case to the district court.because this appeal follows a conviction,to the extent that it relies upon evidence submitted to the jury,we view those facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.see united states mercado,cir.we recounted the factual and procedural history of this case in some detail in united states díaz,cir,and thus summarize only the relevant background below,adding subsequent developments as necessary.
rodríguez was one of defendants named in a indictment alleging that,among other things,between and march,they conspired to operate a drug point in the san antonio public housing project commonly known as carioca,in the municipality of guayama,puerto rico.
as relevant to rodríguez,the indictment alleged that the defendants knowingly conspired to possess with intent to distribute various amounts of cocaine base crack,heroin,cocaine,marijuana,and oxycodone within feet of a school public housing facility playground,in violation of a,and the conspiracy count,and that,aiding and abetting each other,they knowingly and intentionally possessed with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin,fifty grams or more of crack,five kilograms or more of cocaine,and one thousand kilograms or more of marijuana,in violation of a and and the substantive counts.
following a jury verdict finding rodríguez guilty of all five counts,the probation department prepared a presentence report psr that recommended rodríguez be held accountable for more than kilograms of crack corresponding to the highest base offense level,under the sentencing guidelines.the probation department calculation was based upon trial testimony that,during the life of the conspiracy,the drug point sold approximately sixty grams of crack each day and the fact that rodríguez was an active participant in the conspiracy for approximately one year.after a increase because the offense occurred within feet of a protected location,and combined with a criminal history category of i,the probation department calculated the guideline range to be to months.
at the original sentencing hearing,the district court considered rodríguez role in the conspiracy and determined that he was accountable for grams to kilograms of crack,corresponding to a base offense level of.the court stated that it did not think we should go all the way to,as recommended in the psr.it also rejected the probation officer suggestion to use a base offense level of,corresponding to kilograms even though by preponderance he could easily have sold kilograms of crack cocaine,because resulted in a range that it can live with.with the enhancement,rodríguez sentencing guideline range was to months.after noting the disparity between this calculation and the psr,the court explained that the lower range reflected some sort of balancing act trying to find some sort of justice in light of rodríguez youth.the district court sentenced him to months of imprisonment and ten years of supervised release as to each count,to be served concurrently.
in his initial appeal,rodríguez challenged his conviction and sentence,raising,as relevant here,two issues whether the district court erred in calculating the quantity of drugs attributable to him for purposes of determining his sentencing guideline range and whether the district court lacked jurisdiction under the federal juvenile delinquency act fjda,u,for insufficient evidence that he participated in the conspiracy or committed any of the substantive drug offenses after he reached the age of majority.
absent certain exceptions not applicable here,the fjda prevents district courts from exercising jurisdiction over a defendant who is under the age of when criminal proceedings are commenced for acts that occurred before he turned eighteen.rodríguez entered the conspiracy before his eighteenth birthday,was absent from the conspiracy from may to august because he was incarcerated in a juvenile detention facility,and attained the age of majority during his incarceration.we affirmed his conviction of the conspiracy count,finding that there was sufficient evidence of participation.we also affirmed his convictions of the substantive marijuana and crack counts,but vacated his convictions of the substantive heroin and cocaine counts for lack of evidence that,after rodríguez had reached the age of eighteen,he or his possessed or distributed either drug.because the vacated counts may have alter ed the dimensions of the sentencing package,díaz,at quoting united states genao sánchez,cir internal quotation marks omitted,we remanded his case to the district court for resentencing.finally,in light of the remand,we did not reach rodríguez challenge to the district court calculation.
in resentencing on remand,the district court considered rodríguez extensive role in the conspiracy,based upon his participation both pre and,and determined that he could conservatively be held accountable for at least one year worth of crack sales at the drug point which,at sixty grams per day,amounted to kilograms.the court instead selected a very,very conservative number of between and grams of crack,which it adjusted to to grams of crack to reflect the quantity in the new crack sentencing guidelines this quantity corresponded to a base offense level of,and,after the enhancement,the sentencing guideline range was to months.the district court again imposed a sentence at the bottom of the range,sentencing rodríguez to months of imprisonment and ten years of supervised release as to each count,to be served concurrently.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,rodríguez claims that the district court failed to follow proper sentencing procedures and that it erred in multiple respects when determining the quantity of drugs for which he would be held accountable for sentencing purposes.
procedural error under 
rodríguez contends that the district court committed procedural error in arriving at his sentence by failing to consider the sentencing factors set out in a and by failing to give a statement of reasons for selecting a particular sentence as required by c.because he did not raise these claims before the district court,our review is for plain error.see united states medina villegas,cir.review for plain error entails four showings that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir citation omitted.a violation of mandates will warrant reversal under plain error review only if the defendant demonstrates a reasonable probability that,but for the error,the district court would have imposed a different,more favorable sentence.united states mangual garcia,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
pursuant to the sentencing reform act of,stat,et,as modified by united states booker,a sentencing court must impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary,to achieve the purposes of sentencing,a in determining the appropriate sentence,the court should consider various factors,including the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,the kinds of sentences available,the kinds of sentence and the sentencing range established by the sentencing guidelines,and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.a.finally,t he court,at the time of sentencing,shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence,c,and,if the guideline range exceeds months,the reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range,c.
this court has endorsed a sequential determination of the guideline range,including any proposed departures,followed by the further determination whether other factors identified by either side warrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.united states jiménez beltre,cir en banc.thus,the court typically should first calculate the correct guideline range,and then determine whether,after consideration of the a factors,a sentence above,within,or below that range will be sufficient,but not greater than necessary,in light of the sentencing goals.see united states kimbrough,endorsing district court adoption of this approach.finally,the court should articulate in open court how consideration of these factors led it to select a particular sentence.c see also rita united states,noting that this statement of reasons both assures the public that sentencing decisions are reasoned decisions and aids in appellate review.
here,the district court did not explicitly address the a factors,nor did it succinctly provide a clear statement of reasons for imposing a sentence at a particular point in the guideline range as required by c.and,to the extent that the court implicitly considered the a factors,it appears to have done so in selecting a guideline range,rather than first calculating the guideline range supported by the evidence and then considering the a factors to determine the appropriate sentence above,within,or below that range.that is,after determining that the evidence supported holding rodríguez accountable for kilograms of crack,the district court rejected the corresponding guideline range as too high,implicitly taking into consideration several of the a factors,and then,with no apparent evidentiary basis,selected a drug quantity that would yield a guideline range that reflected an appropriate sentence.
the district court failure to state explicitly that it was addressing any a factors or to provide any statement of reasons for selecting the particular sentence within the guideline range is somewhat troubling.however,we are somewhat more concerned about the district court procedure for determining the appropriate guideline range.the finding,supported by a preponderance of the evidence,determines the base offense level if,as apparently happened here,the court believed,in light of the a factors,that the corresponding guideline range was higher than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals,it could have imposed a sentence and articulated why it had done so.rodríguez did not raise this issue to the district court and,as it turned out,this procedure worked in his favor if he had,there would have been error that was both clear and obvious.
nonetheless,in this particular case,the procedure followed by the district court did not affect rodríguez substantial rights.o n this record,the likelihood of a different sentence on remand is an empty hope unsubstantiated by any plausible rationale.accordingly,there is no principled way that we can find plain error arising out of the district court failure to effect literal compliance with a and c.medina villegas,at see also mangual garcia,at district court rote recitation that it had considered relevant a factors,without any attempt to link them to defendant conduct or goals of sentencing,was clear and obvious error,but reversal unwarranted where defendant did not identify specific facts showing reasonable probability of different sentence on remand.
at various points throughout the sentencing hearings,the district court appears to have considered the nature and circumstances of the offense the history and characteristics of the defendant the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense,provide just punishment,and afford adequate deterrence and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities after considering all of these factors,the district court determined that the guideline range supported by the evidence was higher than necessary and settled upon a drug quantity that was between and of the amount that the court believed rodríguez was easily responsible for.even after making these adjustments,the court imposed a sentence at the very bottom of the reduced guideline range.
a court reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the report with what the judge did.jiménez beltre,at.here,the record demonstrates that the district court did consider albeit in a roundabout and implicit way the a factors that it deemed relevant and came to a reasoned determination of the appropriate sentence.there is no reasonable probability that,had the district court followed proper sentencing procedures,it would have imposed a more favorable sentence.see mangual garcia,at see also medina villegas,at to cinch the matter,the appellant has not identified any factors that make it likely that he would receive a different sentence on remand.therefore,the district court error though clear and obvious does not warrant reversal on review.
drug quantity calculation 
rodríguez raises three interrelated claims with respect to the district court calculation.first,he argues that the district court failed to make an individualized determination regarding the quantity of drugs that were attributable to him,instead automatically holding him accountable for the amount.second,he argues that,to the extent the court made an individualized determination,that determination was in error.finally,he challenges the reliability of the evidence upon which the calculation was based.we address these claims seriatim.
w hen a district court determines drug quantity for the purpose of sentencing a defendant convicted of participating in a conspiracy,the court is required to make an individualized finding as to drug amounts attributable to,or foreseeable by,that defendant.united states colón solís,cir.under the sentencing guidelines,relevant conduct that may be considered for sentencing purposes includes all acts and omissions committed,aided,abetted,counseled,commanded,induced,procured,or willfully caused by the defendant and in the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity,all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity a.the question of whether the calculation was based upon on individualized determination of rodríguez relevant conduct is a question of law that we review de novo.united states cintrón echautegui,cir.if it was,we review the result for clear error.id.we will not upset findings of fact or conclusions drawn therefrom unless,on the whole of the record,we form a strong,unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.cumpiano banco santander puerto rico,cir.
rodríguez first argument is a.the record plainly reflects that the district court considered rodríguez role in,and conduct in furtherance of,the conspiracy and made an individualized determination that he could reasonably foresee the entire amount of crack sold by the conspiracy during the time he was involved in it while it is error to automatically shift the drug quantity onto a particular defendant absent an individualized finding that the entire amount was foreseeable to that defendant,colón solís,at,the district court here did make such a finding.
rodríguez claim that the individualized determination was erroneous requires more analysis,but is ultimately no more successful.rodríguez argues that the district court clearly erred in finding that all of the conspiracy crack sales during the time of his participation in the conspiracy were foreseeable to him and within the scope of his conspiratorial agreement.the record suggests that rodríguez was significantly less involved with crack after he reached the age of eighteen than he had been before his detention.we previously affirmed his conviction of the substantive crack offense on the basis of a single seizure of vials of crack from a after rodríguez eighteenth birthday.see díaz,at.we assumed that the jury followed the district court pinkerton instruction and found that the possession of crack was reasonably foreseeable to rodríguez and was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.see pinkerton united states,conspirator may be liable for all foreseeable acts of in furtherance of conspiracy.but that does not mean that all crack sold by the conspiracy can automatically be attributed to rodríguez as relevant conduct for sentencing purposes.pinkerton liability is,in some cases,broader than relevant conduct.see united states laboy,cir while a conspiracy charge may encompass all acts by in furtherance of the conspiracy,relevant conduct is limited to the foreseeable acts resulting from the defendant particular agreement.thus,the scope of relevant conduct is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy.citations and internal quotation marks omitted see also cmt.whether the record would support a finding that all of the crack sales,pre and,were reasonably foreseeable to rodríguez and were within the scope of his agreement is a close question,but one that,for two reasons,we need not resolve.
first,the parties agreed below,and rodríguez does not dispute here,that a defendant who joined a conspiracy before the age of majority can be held accountable,for sentencing purposes,for his own and his acts that occurred before he reached the age of majority once it has been shown that he ratified his participation in the conspiracy after attaining the age of majority this court has never specifically so held.in united states welch,cir,we considered a calculation that included the defendant pre and conduct.we vacated the sentence not because it included conduct,but because it was based upon insufficiently reliable evidence.by implication,inclusion of the defendant conduct was permissible.several of our sister circuits have expressly held that,once ratification has been shown,relevant conduct for sentencing purposes includes acts of the defendant,see united states flores,cir united states gibbs,cir,and his,see united states sparks,app x,cir unpublished united states thomas,f d.however,in light of rodríguez explicit waiver,and in the absence of briefing by the parties,we need not reach the question and assume,without deciding,that the district court properly considered these acts.
when considering rodríguez conduct,the record supports the finding that all crack sales during that period were within the scope of his agreement and reasonably foreseeable to him.the trial testimony indicated that,before his incarceration,he occupied many roles in the drug point he served as a runner in charge of the crack,bringing packages of crack to the sellers,replenishing their supplies when they ran out,and collecting the proceeds from the sales.he served as a seller of crack on occasion.he served as a triggerman,and would go on a mission to shoot members of rival organizations.on these facts,the district court did not clearly err in finding that,the scope of rodríguez conspiratorial agreement encompassed all crack sales at the drug point and that all such sales were reasonably foreseeable to him.even if the evidence does not support the same conclusion with respect to his participation,his participation alone results in the same base offense level that would result from combining the pre and amounts 
second,as noted above,the district court did not ultimately hold him accountable for the entire conspiratorial amount.after finding that he could easily be held accountable for kilograms of crack,the court held him accountable for only to grams less than nine percent of the amount.there is simply no way to read the record in this case and conclude that this smaller quantity was not within the scope of rodríguez agreement and reasonably foreseeable to him.moreover,at the first sentencing hearing,rodríguez,through counsel,conceded that a quantity of between grams and kilograms was fair.the district court individualized finding was not affected by clear error.
we turn now to rodríguez final argument.he contends that the district court calculation was not supported by reliable evidence in the record.where the amount of drugs seized does not reflect the scale of the offense,the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.cmt.when it is impossible or impractical to obtain an exact drug quantity for sentencing purposes,a reasoned estimate will suffice.laboy,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the finding need only be based upon a preponderance of the evidence.cintrón echautegui,at.we review the district court determination for clear error.united states rivera maldonado,cir.
in making the determination,the district court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial,provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.a see also cintrón echautegui,at sentencing court may rely upon virtually any dependable information,including information that has never been subjected to and information contained in a presentence report.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we have frequently recognized that the district court enjoys broad discretion in determining whether given evidence is sufficiently reliable for sentencing purposes,and we review these decisions only for abuse of discretion.united states mills,cir.
the district court determined the drug quantity during the time of rodríguez participation based upon estimated daily sales.extrapolation is a common and permissible way of attributing drugs to a defendant.united states marquez,cir.we have upheld this method where the extrapolation is based on a known or readily calculable number of transactions involving clearly established or conservatively estimated quantities.id.if,however,the estimates rest too significantly on unreliable inferences,id.at citation and internal quotation marks omitted citing cases,reversal may be warranted.
here,based upon trial testimony,the district court estimated that the conspiracy sold sixty grams of crack each day at the carioca drug point.a cooperating testified that the drug point operated in three daily shifts a morning shift from to,an afternoon shift from to midnight,and a night shift from midnight to.he stated that the drug point generally sold over vials of crack during the morning shift,a similar amount during the afternoon shift,and between and vials during the night shift.he also stated that,during the first several days of the month,it could sell over or vials per shift.a cooperating witness stated that the drug point sold eight to nine packages of capsules of crack to capsules during an average weekday shift and sixteen to eighteen packages of capsules to capsules during an average weekend shift.an expert witness testified that each vial or capsule weighed approximately grams.the court adopted a conservative estimate of gram vials or capsules per shift and multiplied by three daily shifts to arrive at an estimate of sixty grams per day.the court then,using a conservative estimate of the duration of rodríguez participation in the conspiracy,multiplied the daily amount by days to determine his total attributable amount,kilograms.finally,notwithstanding the determination that at least kilograms of crack sales were within the scope of his conspiratorial agreement and were foreseeable to him,the court held him accountable for less than five percent of that amount.
the court did not abuse its discretion in relying on the unrebutted trial testimony,nor did it clearly err in making its quantity determination.the court used conservative figures in every step of the calculation,and easily could have arrived at a far larger quantity.we have often upheld findings,even if imprecise,if they were based upon conservative estimates or favorable assumptions.see cintrón echautegui,at upholding determination derived from plausible extrapolations and favorable assumptions united states correa alicea,and cir upholding inexact determination of drug quantity where it was based on rea
