in light of the district court conclusion,we must now consider whether the district court erred in using the modified categorical approach to decide whether a conviction under.stat.ann.triggers b mandatory minimum and,if so,whether,under the correct approach,simard conviction under.stat.ann.nonetheless triggers the sentencing enhancement because the vermont statute relate s to abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward,b.
we conclude,pursuant to our recent decisions in united states barker,wl cir.july,and united states beardsley,cir,that the district court should have applied the categorical approach not the modified categorical approach to decide whether simard conviction under.stat.ann.triggered b sentencing enhancement.despite this error,we also conclude that the district court ultimately was correct to apply the mandatory minimum because,under the categorical approach.stat.ann.is a state law that relat es to abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward,b.
for these reasons,we affirm the august,judgment of the district court.
background 
in,while simard was on probation for a prior offense that involved lewd or lascivious conduct with a child,two probation officers went with simard to his residence and discovered a laptop containing a video file depicting child pornography.investigators later discovered that the laptop had fourteen additional images of child pornography stored on it.
on may,a federal grand jury in burlington,vermont,returned an indictment charging simard with one count of receipt of child pornography,in violation of a,and one count of possession of child pornography,in violation of a.on may,simard pleaded guilty to the child pornography possession count count two.in exchange for simard plea of guilty,the government agreed to move to dismiss count one of the indictment.
as noted,the appropriate sentence for a conviction based on the possession of child pornography depends,in part,on whether the defendant has previously been convicted of a crime relating to aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.b.if he has no such prior conviction,a defendant convicted of possession of child pornography may be imprisoned for up to ten years,but if he does have such a prior conviction,he must be imprisoned for at least ten,and up to as many as twenty,years.id.
in,simard pleaded guilty to violating.stat.ann,which,at that time,provided that n o person shall willfully and lewdly commit any lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body,or any part or member thereof,of a child under the age of years,with the intent of arousing,appealing to,or gratifying the lust,passions,or sexual desires of such person or of such child.stat.ann.in light of simard prior conviction,the district court was confronted with the following question does.stat.ann.relat e to aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward,b,such that simard was subject to b mandatory minimum sentence when he pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography 
although the parties initially agreed that simard conviction under.stat.ann.triggered b sentencing enhancement,the district court asked the parties to brief this issue.thereafter,simard changed his earlier position regarding.stat.ann.and,in presenting the issue to the district court,claimed that his prior conviction did not trigger b sentencing enhancement.the government continued to contend that simard prior conviction was a predicate offense under b.
on september,judge sessions filed a memorandum and order holding that simard prior conviction for lewd or lascivious conduct with a child triggered b sentencing enhancement.in doing so,judge sessions considered the question under both the categorical and modified categorical approaches.first,he concluded that a conviction under.stat.ann.did not trigger the enhancement under the categorical approach,stating that although all of the conduct covered by.stat.ann.is for a purpose associated with sexual gratification,it is not necessarily abusive,insofar as the statute would also criminalize conduct such as exploratory touching between students in high school.united states simard,cr,wl,at,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.second,judge sessions determined that,under the modified categorical approach,simard prior conviction did trigger the sentencing enhancement in light of certain explicit factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.id.at internal quotations marks and alterations omitted.accordingly,judge sessions ultimately held that simard was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence.

discussion 
we review de novo all questions of law relating to the district court application of a federal sentence enhancement.beardsley,at.we also note that we are free to affirm a decision on any grounds supported in the record,even if it is not one on which the trial court relied.thyroff nationwide mut.ins,cir.
whether courts should apply the categorical approach or the modified categorical approach in deciding whether a prior conviction triggers a federal mandatory minimum sentencing enhancement has been discussed in several recent opinions by the supreme court and by this court.see descamps united states,d barker,wl,at beardsley,at.in describing the two approaches,we recently stated in barker that 
u nder a categorical approach,courts compare the statute forming the basis of the defendant prior conviction with the applicable generic offense in the federal sentencing statute.in contrast,under the modified categorical approach,courts may,to a limited extent in order to discover the elements of the prior conviction,consider facts underlying the prior conviction if they are based upon adequate judicial record evidence.

these recent cases have clarified many aspects of this area of law.as relevant here,we held in beardsley and reaffirmed in barker that the modified categorical approach is appropriate only where a statute is divisible into qualifying and offenses,and not where the statute is merely worded so broadly to encompass conduct that might fall within the definition of the federal predicate offense as well as other conduct that does not.beardsley,at.in light of this holding in beardsley which the supreme court approved of in descamps.at the first question raised in this appeal becomes straightforward.indeed,because simard pleaded guilty to violating.stat.ann,which criminalizes a single,offense willfully and lewdly commit ing any lewd or lascivious act upon or with the body,or any part or member thereof,of a child under the age of years,with the intent of arousing,appealing to,or gratifying the lust,passions,or sexual desires of such person or of such child the district court should have applied the categorical approach to determine whether simard prior conviction triggered b sentencing enhancement see barker,wl,at.accordingly,the district court erred in applying the modified categorical approach.
although these recent precedents answer the first question presented in this appeal,the second question presented whether b sentencing enhancement applies requires some additional analysis.as noted,the district court held that.sta
