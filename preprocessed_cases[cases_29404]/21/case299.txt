this case involves a defendant who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit promotional money laundering,stipulated to the amount of money laundered,and received a prison sentence.his appeal seeks to vitiate his guilty plea on grounds of factual insufficiency.for good measure,the appeal asserts a claim of sentencing error.after careful consideration,we leave the defendant where we found him.
the stage is easily set.on november,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico indicted edgardo torres vázquez for his role in a money laundering conspiracy.the appellant initially maintained his innocence but later entered a guilty plea to a single count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments in violation of a a i.
as a precursor to his change of plea,the appellant and the government entered into a plea agreement the agreement that contained,among other things,a statement of facts,which the appellant vouchsafed was accurate in every respect.the agreement also embodied a stipulation to the effect that the appellant was accountable for the laundering of more than but less than.
the agreement proposed a specific sentencing outcome.in it,the parties concurred that the adjusted offense level under the federal sentencing guidelines was a figure that took into account a level enhancement corresponding to the stipulated value of the laundered funds.see ussg b i.treating the appellant as a offender criminal history category i,the parties suggested that a guideline sentencing range gsr of months was appropriate.they agreed jointly to recommend a prison sentence at the bottom of the gsr months and not to advocate for any upward or downward variances.
finally,the agreement included a provision.this provision purported to foreclose the appellant right to appeal as long as the district court sentenced him in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
on march,the district court convened a hearing.in the course of a lengthy colloquy with the appellant,the court read the charge and obtained the appellant acknowledgment that he knowingly participated in the described activities.in addition,the court confirmed that the appellant had decided to voluntarily waive his right to appeal his sentence.the court then accepted the agreement,took the plea,and continued the matter pending the preparation of a presentence investigation report psi report.
on june,the district court held the disposition hearing.the court began by confirming that there were no objections to the factual account limned in the psi report.it then reiterated the key facts surrounding the appellant involvement in the money laundering conspiracy.having completed these preliminaries and heard the appellant allocution,the court imposed the mutually recommended month incarcerative sentence.this timely appeal ensued.
we pause at the outset to note that the provision does not end our inquiry.it is common ground that w here,as here,an appeal challenges the validity of the plea itself,a provision lacks force with respect to that challenge.united states ramos mejía,cir.consequently,we proceed to consider on the merits the appellant entreaty that the district court erred in accepting his guilty plea.
our standard of review is familiar.because the claimed lack of a sufficient factual foundation was not raised below,we review the district court acceptance of the guilty plea only for plain error.see united states negrón narváez,cir.thus,we will sustain the assignment of error only if the appellant can demonstrate that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.the appellant can not satisfy these requirements.
federal rule of criminal procedure b ordains that b efore entering judgment on a guilty plea,the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.seizing on this requirement,the appellant contends that the record fails to establish a sufficient factual basis to ground his plea.specifically,he submits that the government proffered facts establish only that he transported money,and that transportation simpliciter is inadequate to satisfy the statutory requirements that a financial transaction be attempted and that the funds in issue be derived from a specified unlawful activity.a.
the record belies this contention.to establish a sufficient factual foundation for a plea,the government need only show a rational basis in fact for the defendant guilt.ramos mejía,at.this showing can be achieved even if the government does not support every element of the charged crime by direct evidence.id.after all,a rule inquiry is not designed to prove a criminal defendant guilt beyond all doubt.united states jiminez,cir.as long as the record evinces some basis for thinking that the defendant is at least arguably guilty,no more is exigible.ramos mejía,at internal quotation marks omitted.
to support a conspiracy conviction,the government must show that a conspiracy existed and that a particular defendant agreed to participate in it with the intention of committing the specified underlying offense.united states sepulveda,cir.such a conspiracy may exist even if its ultimate objective is not accomplished.see united states david,cir.moreover,proof of a defendant involvement in a conspiracy may consist of indirect evidence,including inferences drawn from acts performed in furtherance of the conspiracy.id.the needed facts may be gleaned either from the defendant admissions or from the prosecution version of the evidence to the extent that it is acknowledged by the defendant.jiminez,at.
with this framework in place,we move from the general to the specific.here,the facts proffered at the hearing and acknowledged as accurate by the appellant indicate that the appellant and a coconspirator traveled from puerto rico to panama to attend a meeting with four other persons.one of these individuals was operating as a confidential source cs for the drug enforcement administration.the purpose of that meeting,which took place in september of,was to discuss the transportation of money for the purchase of drugs.
in miami four months later,the appellant reviewed the details of this scheme with a coconspirator and the cs.subsequently,the appellant and a coconspirator exchanged several telephone calls with the cs in order to coordinate the appellant delivery of to finance the purchase of the drug load on march while the appellant was on his way to meet with the cs the puerto rico police stopped his vehicle.this routine traffic stop resulted in the seizure of in cash.
in the agreement,the appellant admitted that these facts were accurate in every respect.during the colloquy,he also admitted both that the described events comprised the factual basis for his guilty plea and that he knew the seized funds were the proceeds of illicit drug trafficking.
there was more.a claim that a guilty plea rests on an insufficient factual basis,raised for the first time on appeal,opens the entire record for appellate inspection.see united states dominguez benitez,united states delgado hernández,cir.in this case,the psi report summarized the events surrounding the appellant transportation of over of drug money to be used to finance further drug purchases.at the disposition hearing,the court confirmed that the appellant had no objection to the factual account contained in the psi report.in the absence of such an objection,the psi report is itself proof of the recited facts.see united states zorrilla,cir.
we need not paint the lily.intent to launder money can be proven either through the defendant own statements or through circumstantial evidence,or through a combination of admissions and circumstances.see united states cruzado laureano,cir.based upon the appellant extensive admissions and the circumstances surrounding his possession and transportation of over in cash,a rational factfinder could conclude that the appellant intended to complete a financial transaction that he collogued with others to this end that he was aware that the funds in question w
