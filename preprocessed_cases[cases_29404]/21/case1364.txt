statement of the case 
a.the facts 
by,curley marriage to linda had deteriorated.curley behavior had become erratic and,in may,he demanded a divorce.three times in the following month,he threatened to kill her.first,during an argument,curley threatened to kill her and leave her body in a pool of blood.second,while they were in the car with their two children,he again threatened to kill her and promised he would not go to jail if he did.third,after returning from a walk,curley told linda i found a place today where i could kill you and nobody would hear you scream.
in july,curley served linda with divorce papers accusing her of infidelity.linda then filed for divorce herself and sought an order of protection and custody of the children.from july to august,linda regularly noticed curley truck following her and once saw his sister following her.she grew so frightened that she called the police and told them i really,really think he gon na kill me either him or his brother,somebody gon na kill me.in august,the rockland county family court granted linda custody of the children and issued an order prohibiting curley from,inter alia,assaulting,stalking,harassing,or intimidating her.thereafter,linda no longer saw him following her,but curley began to track her through a device he placed on her vehicle.curley friend tracked the device movements through an internet website and forwarded the information to curley.from august to october,someone accessed the tracking website over times.
in october,linda was involved in a car accident in new jersey,and when she took her car to a nearby repair shop,a mechanic discovered the device.on october,curley drove from new york to the repair shop in new jersey.while speaking with the owner,curley lied about his identity,giving varying reasons for his visit.after the owner wrote down the vehicle identification number of curley vehicle,curley tried to alter the owner notation.the owner reported the incident to the police and turned the device over to them.
proceedings below 
the government indicted curley on may.it filed a superseding indictment on october,charging curley with two counts of interstate and one count of interstate violation of a protection order,a.
by letter dated january,the government requested rulings in limine on the admissibility of certain evidence it intended to present at trial.the government sought to introduce testimony about the following incidents of curley physical abuse of linda 
in august,curley grabbed linda while she was holding their infant son and would not let her go 
in,he pushed linda into a wall while she was pregnant 
in either or,he pushed linda into a door while she was pregnant and 
in,he shoved her and banged her head against the floor.
the government also sought permission to elicit linda testimony that curley brother,michael,beat her in and that curley later instructed her not to report the incident to the police.
finally,the government sought to introduce evidence of curley traffic stop in january.police officers stopped curley because he was driving a rental car that had been reported stolen.curley fled on foot and was arrested.the police recovered three black powder rifles one of which was loaded,ammunition,a bulletproof vest,and a ski mask from the car.
by order dated january,the district court admitted the four incidents of curley own violent acts against linda.the court ruled that the evidence was either inextricably intertwined with the charged conduct or relevant to the issue of intent under rules b and of the federal rules of evidence.the court barred the evidence of michael abuse of linda and the traffic stop.
by letter dated february,the government sought to introduce new evidence regarding linda relationship with michael and asked the court to reconsider its previous ruling.the government had learned that police had arrested michael in for resisting arrest and assaulting an officer.under pressure from curley and michael,linda testified falsely at michael criminal trial and in michael subsequent civil action against the police.
at a pretrial conference on march,the district court reconsidered its earlier ruling and decided it was fair for linda to say part of the reason that she was in fear was that she knew that the defendant would be assisted by his family members because the government had to establish linda reasonable fear.the court indicated it was more troubled when there was only a single incident with michael,but the several incidents,including evidence that curley sister followed linda in,formed a basis for linda fear that this curley clan will come after her.the court reasoned that linda course of dealing with curley and michael could place a person in fear,reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury.thus,the court admitted the testimony of both incidents involving michael pursuant to rule b 
at the same conference,the government revealed a handwritten last will and testament recently found in curley rental car after the traffic stop and requested that the court reconsider admitting that evidence.the will indicated curley desire to leave all his belongings to his children and asked his sister to take care of them.at the time of the arrest,linda had sole custody of the two children.the government argued that the jury could infer from the will that curley expected linda to die before him.because the will was handwritten,the government argued that curley expected his own death imminently.therefore,the government argued,the will,rifles,ammunition,and bulletproof vest showed that curley was planning to murder linda and then commit suicide.
at a pretrial hearing on march,the court admitted the traffic stop evidence pursuant to rule b.the court explained that it had previously denied admission under rule because the evidence prejudicial effect substantially outweighed its probative value.according to the district court,however,the newly discovered evidence add ed significantly to the probative value of the traffic stop and helped prove curley intent to commit the crimes.
trial commenced on march.linda testified about curley prior violent acts,the incidents involving michael,and the forced perjury.the trial judge did not immediately issue an instruction about this evidence limited purpose.two police officers testified about the january traffic stop and the search that uncovered the rifles,ammunition,bulletproof vest,and ski mask.the government also showed a video of the traffic stop,which showed curley fleeing on foot from the police.finally,an employee of the rental car company testified about discovering the will.before the traffic stop evidence was presented,the trial judge instructed the jury that the evidence was offered for th e very specific purpose of determining what was curley intent back at the time of the acts charged in the indictment.in its charge to the jury after summations,the judge reminded the jury that it could only rely on the traffic stop evidence to infer curley intent in.the court then instructed the jury for the first time that it could rely on evidence that curley and his brother abused linda only to infer linda reasonable fear.
on march,the jury convicted curley on all counts.the jury made specific findings that curley committed interstate stalking under counts one and two with the intent to harass linda and to place her under surveillance with the intent to harass,intimidate,and cause substantial emotional distress.although the jury did not find that curley had the intent to kill or injure linda,it did find that his course of conduct caused linda substantial emotional distress and placed her in reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury.on july,after calculating a guidelines range of to months,the district court sentenced curley to concurrent terms of imprisonment,followed by concurrent terms of supervised release.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
applicable law 
rule b of the federal rules of evidence governs the admissibility of evidence of prior or subsequent bad acts evidence of crimes,wrongs,or acts other than those charged in the indictment.b.the rule prohibits the admission of such evidence if it prove s the character of a person to show his propensity to commit the charged act,but permits its admission for other purposes.id.this circuit follows the inclusionary approach,which admits all other act evidence that does not serve the sole purpose of showing the defendant bad character and that is neither overly prejudicial under rule nor irrelevant under rule.united states pascarella,cir.even under this approach,however,district courts should not presume that such evidence is relevant or admissible.united states halper,cir.
a district court evidentiary rulings are subject to review for abuse of discretion.united states mercado,cir.when reviewing evidence admitted pursuant to rule b,we consider whether the prior crimes evidence was offered for a proper purpose the evidence was relevant to a disputed issue the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice pursuant to rule and the court administered an appropriate limiting instruction.united states mccallum,cir citing huddleston united states.
other act evidence serves a proper purpose so long as it is not offered to show the defendant propensity to commit the offense.see.b united states pitre,cir.rule b provides that such evidence may properly show motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident.b,but this list is not exhaustive,united states williams,cir see also united states mendez ortiz,cir united states johnson,cir.the district court may admit evidence that serves any purpose,including state of mind.united states edwards,cir see also united states teague,cir.
to satisfy the relevance inquiry,the evidence must be sufficiently similar to the conduct at issue to permit the jury reasonably to draw from that act the state of mind inference advocated by the proponent of the evidence.united states peterson,cir.the district court must consider all the evidence presented to the jury and determine whether a reasonable jury could find the advocated inference.huddleston,at united states ramirez,cir.the court abuses its discretion if the evidence is not sufficiently similar to the charged conduct or if the chain of inferences necessary to connect the evidence with the ultimate fact to be proved is unduly long.peterson,at internal quotation marks omitted.
if the evidence is relevant,the district court must determine if its potential for unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its probative value.see.the evidence probative value depends largely on whether or not there is a close parallel between the crime charged and the acts shown.united states gordon,cir internal quotation marks omitted.evidence is unfairly prejudicial when it tends to have some adverse effect upon a defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its admission into evidence.united states massino,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if the other acts tend to prove a fact not in issue or to excite emotions against the defendant,they create a prejudicial effect.united states figueroa,cir.the district court abuses its discretion when it admits other act evidence with a high possibility of jury misuse but with only slightly more probative value than other evidence on the same issue.see mccallum,at.
in our review,we will also consider whether the district court issued an appropriate limiting instruction.although the law presumes that juries follow limiting instructions,united states.snype,cir,these instructions only minimize the evidence prejudicial effect,figueroa,at.a limiting instruction does not invariably eliminate the risk of prejudice notwithstanding the instruction.id.
if error did occur in the trial below,we will not vacate the conviction if the error was harmless and d id not affect substantial rights.a.the erroneously admitted evidence is harmless if it was unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question.cameron city of new york,cir quoting united states germosen,cir.several factors bear on this inquiry whether the testimony bore on an issue that is plainly critical to the jury decision,whether that testimony was material to the establishment of the critical fact or whether it was instead corroborated and cumulative,and whether the wrongly admitted evidence was emphasized in arguments to the jury.id.quoting wray johnson,cir.t he most critical factor,however,is the strength of the government case.mccallum,at.unless there is fair assurance that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,it is impossible to conclude that substantial rights were not affected.kotteakos united states,see united states rea,cir.
application 
we consider the admissibility of three sets of evidence first,curley prior abuse of linda second,michael interactions with linda,including his abuse of linda in and third,the traffic stop and the items discovered in the car.the district court admitted all of this evidence as probative of curley intent linda fear.both states of mind were relevant to the charged crimes,see,a,and thus the evidence served a proper purpose and was relevant to that extent,see teague,at our review,therefore,focuses on whether the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice and whether there was a sufficient limiting instruction.mccallum,at.
curley abuse of linda 
the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of curley abuse of linda.
first,curley abuse of linda in august was part of or inextricably intertwined with the charged conduct.he grabbed linda while she was holding their son during the same period that he was tracking her with the device.this act was directly relevant to his intent and her fear.see united states.carboni,cir noting that uncharged acts are not other acts subject to rule b if they arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,if they are inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,or if they are necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial accord united states quinones,cir quoting united states concepcion,cir.
second,the evidence of curley abuse of linda in the earlier years,or,and,was also relevant and not unfairly prejudicial.where the charged conduct involves domestic abuse,a spouse history of domestic violence is relevant to show intent to harass or intimidate his partner.see united states von foelkel,cir per curiam ruling that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting evidence of prior domestic violence to prove intent to violate protection order.specifically,the government had to prove that curley possessed the intent to either kill,injure,harass or intimidate linda and that she had a reasonable fear of death or serious bodily injury.see,a.
the earlier acts demonstrated a pattern of activity that was probative of curley intent and linda reasonable fear.these were aggressive acts against linda that were similar in nature and severity to the charged conduct curley threats to kill linda and his actions in stalking and tracking her.
the temporal remoteness of these acts does not preclude their relevancy.the district court may exclude older acts if they have become too attenuated to be relevant or too remote to render the witness memory reliable,see united states larson,cir,but that was not the case here.although the incidents the charged conduct by as much as fifteen years,collectively they demonstrate a pat
