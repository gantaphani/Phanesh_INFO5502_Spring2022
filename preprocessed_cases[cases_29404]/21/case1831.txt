background 
the facts relevant to this appeal are as follows 
in january,mercedes was deported from the united states to the dominican republic after serving a sentence for a conviction in the united states district court for the district of puerto rico for using an altered united states passport,in violation of.prior to his deportation,mercedes had also been convicted of several other offenses,including a conviction in new york supreme court for second degree robbery and a conviction in the southern district of new york for possession and distribution of cocaine,in violation of,a,b c.
around march,without the government permission or knowledge,mercedes illegally reentered the united states.in august,mercedes was arrested by the new york city police department on a state homicide charge.at the time of his arrest,mercedes used the alias robert figueroa,and a false date of birth was either given to or obtained by state officials.mercedes subsequently pleaded guilty to second degree manslaughter and was sentenced in may to four to eight years imprisonment.
in august,the immigration and naturalization service ins first learned of mercedes presence in the united states when they interviewed him at rikers island correctional facility,where he was awaiting sentencing on the state homicide charge.in december,after reviewing its files,the ins determined that mercedes had reentered the country illegally after his deportation.in march,the government filed a complaint against mercedes in the southern district of new york,charging him with illegally reentering the united states after having been deported subsequent to a felony conviction.the complaint named only mercedes robbery conviction as the prior felony.the same day,a federal arrest warrant based on that complaint was issued.
in february,mercedes was released from state prison and was immediately arrested by ins agents on the warrant.in march,mercedes was indicted in the southern district on one count of illegally entering and being found in the united states after having been deported subsequent to a conviction for the commission of an aggravated felony,to wit,a conviction on august,in the supreme court for the state of new york for robbery in the second degree,in violation of a,b.like the march government complaint,the indictment did not refer to any prior felony other than the robbery.
in december,mercedes pleaded guilty before magistrate judge ronald ellis.prior to the plea proceedings,the government provided mercedes with a pimentel letter setting forth the government view of mercedes sentencing exposure.see united states pimentel,cir suggesting that the government inform defendants,prior to accepting plea agreements,as to the likely range of sentences that their pleas will authorize under the guidelines.the pimentel letter stated that the illegal reentry charge carried a maximum term of years imprisonment.the letter also calculated mercedes expected sentencing range to be to months.the calculation included a enhancement,pursuant to b a,because mercedes was deported subsequent to an aggravated felony conviction.the calculation also took into account mercedes criminal history,and the letter listed seven separate crimes committed by mercedes.those crimes included both the state robbery and federal narcotics convictions the pimentel letter did not indicate which of the seven offenses constituted an aggravated felony.
at his plea allocution before magistrate judge ellis,mercedes expressly admitted to reentering the united states,without permission,after having been deported.he also admitted that he knew reentering the country was wrong,and said that he was in this country already so he was guilty.during the hearing,the magistrate judge advised mercedes,among other things,that the offense for which he was charged carried a maximum penalty of years imprisonment.the magistrate judge also told mercedes of the applicability of the sentencing guidelines,of the district court ability to depart from the guidelines under certain limited circumstances,and of the requirement,under the guidelines,that the district court take into account a number of factors,including any criminal history.mercedes indicated that he understood all of this information.
the magistrate judge further inquired,do you understand that if the sentence is more severe than you expected,you be bound by your guilty plea and will not be permitted to withdraw it mercedes responded that he understood and that he had been informed of the government sentencing calculations in its pimentel letter,although he stated that he did not agree with the letter.mercedes also specified that he would plead guilty to illegal only.the government explained that it understood this qualification to mean that mercedes was leaving open the sentencing issue as to whether or not he was deported after an aggravated felony.the magistrate judge thereafter found mercedes plea to be knowing and voluntary,and he recommended that judge berman accept the plea.
prior to the district court acceptance of his guilty plea,mercedes filed various pro se motions to withdraw his plea and dismiss the indictment.the motions alleged violations of the interstate agreement on detainers act.art.iii the speedy trial act.b the sixth amendment and the statute of limitations applicable to a offense.in june,judge berman denied the motions without prejudice because mercedes was represented by counsel and could therefore not proceed pro se mercedes was invited to resubmit the motions either through counsel or,if he elected to proceed without counsel,by appearing pro se.the district court nevertheless noted that it would have denied the motions on the merits anyway if it had considered them.later in the same proceeding,judge berman accepted the magistrate judge recommendation to accept mercedes guilty plea,and the plea was entered.
in august,mercedes,proceeding pro se,acted upon the district court suggestion and filed a new motion to withdraw his plea and dismiss the indictment because the prosecution was untimely with one exception,the other grounds alleged in his previous motions were not renewed in october,the district court denied the motion,finding the statute of limitations claim without merit.citing united states acevedo,cir,cert.denied,d,the district court ruled that the statute of limitations for an illegal reentry offense does not begin to run until the ins discovers the alien presence in the united states.the district court held that the indictment was filed within the statute of limitations because a mercedes state arrest and fingerprinting did not place the ins on notice of his renewed presence in the country,and b the ins first found mercedes in august after interviewing him in state prison.the district court further noted that there was no basis to permit withdrawal of mercedes guilty plea because mercedes entered the plea knowingly,intelligently,and voluntarily,and he never denied his guilt of the crime.
also in october,the probation department prepared a report psr in advance of mercedes sentencing.the psr,like the government pimentel letter,recommended a enhancement for deportation after a conviction for an aggravated felony.the psr,unlike the pimentel letter but like the complaint and indictment,identified the robbery conviction as the aggravated felony.the psr also,like the pimentel letter,listed mercedes other criminal convictions in its criminal history section.
mercedes,again represented by counsel,thereafter filed objections to the psr.among other things,defense counsel argued that mercedes robbery conviction did not qualify as an aggravated felony.before september,aggravated felonies were defined,for purposes of the illegal reentry statute,to include crimes of violence for which the term of imprisonment was at least five years.see,a mercedes robbery conviction,however,resulted in a sentence of only to months.because the change in legislation occurred after the completion of mercedes illegal reentry crime the indictment charges mercedes with conduct from about march,up to and including in or about august,defense counsel contended that the old law applied,that the robbery conviction was therefore not an aggravated felony,and that mercedes should receive only a enhancement pursuant to b d,rather than levels.
in response to defense counsel objections,the probation department revised the psr to eliminate any reliance on the robbery conviction as an aggravated felony.the revised psr nevertheless continued to recommend a enhancement,because mercedes conviction for possession and distribution of cocaine qualified as an aggravated felony even under the previous law.
defense counsel thereafter objected to the government reliance on the uncharged narcotics offense as an aggravated felony.counsel argued that it would be a violation of the due process and notice requirements of the fifth and sixth amendments,and the supreme court decision in apprendi new jersey,d,if mercedes was sentenced based on an aggravated felony not identified in the indictment.additionally,defense counsel maintained that the district court should find that mercedes was deported after the commission of a felony,and that a lower maximum sentence should therefore apply pursuant to b.defense counsel also renewed mercedes argument that the indictment was barred by the statute of limitations.
in march,the district court rejected mercedes argument on the aggravated felony issue and adopted the recommendations of the psr.citing united states,d and united states,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d,the district court ruled that apprendi did not require a jury finding to apply the level enhancement in this case for a prior aggravated felony.the district court also held,once again,that the indictment was timely because the statute of limitations did not begin to run until august mercedes was then sentenced to months imprisonment.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,mercedes argues that a the indictment should have been dismissed as,and b the district court should have allowed him to withdraw his guilty plea,and this court should vacate the plea pursuant to.e,because he was not properly notified that his sentence could depend on a prior conviction for an aggravated felony other than the one erroneously specified in the indictment.he also seeks to preserve his right to argue that,under apprendi,his sentence may not reflect an enhancement based on a prior conviction neither charged in the indictment nor admitted in his plea 
timeliness of the indictment 
section prescribes criminal penalties for any alien who has been deported and thereafter enters,attempts to enter,or is at any time found in the united states without the express consent of the attorney general.a emphasis added.as is the general rule for federal offenses,an indictment charging a violation of must be handed down within five years next after such offense shall have been committed.see also united states,cir.this limitations period shall not be extended e xcept as otherwise expressly provided by law.
statutes of limitations in criminal cases normally begin to run when the crime is complete.toussie united states,d acevedo,at.the commission of the offense of being found in the united states in violation of a the offense with which mercedes was complete when the authorities both discover the illegal alien in the united states and know,or with the exercise of diligence typical of law enforcement authorities could have discovered,the illegality of his presence,at citations omitted.
mercedes argues that the district court should have dismissed the indictment against him as,because it was filed more than five years after the ins should have found him in the united states.mercedes contends that,using diligence typical of law enforcement authorities,the ins could have learned of his illegal presence in the country shortly after he was arrested on the state homicide charge in,when his fingerprints were taken and a rap sheet was generated under the name robert figueroa.mercedes asserts that the rap sheet should have put any reasonably diligent official on notice of mercedes illegal presence because it a accurately reported mercedes place of birth the dominican republic and birthdate b listed the various other names he had used in the past,prominently led by nelson mercedes,and c chronicled an offense history that included among mercedes past charges a poss ible viol ation of immigration laws in,and a reported illegal entry and use of altered passport in.therefore,according to mercedes,law enforcement officials in had all the information they needed to identify him as a previously deported alien,and the delay until the indictment was unreasonable.
there is no dispute that the ins first physically located mercedes at rikers island in august and ultimately determined that his presence in the united states was illegal in december.thus,applying the test annunciated in,we must decide whether the ins should have discovered the illegality of mercedes presence earlier,using diligence typical of law enforcement authorities.
we hold that the ins need not have found mercedes earlier than for purposes of the statute of limitations for a offense.first of all,mercedes used a false name upon his arrest by state authorities.while it is true that the name nelson mercedes appeared on the rap sheet generated by the state,at least other aliases appeared on the same report it is hardly unreasonable to expect that the rap sheet listing of multiple false names,as well as different birthdates and places of birth,would delay ins officials from discovering that mercedes had been deported in.moreover,it is difficult not to find mercedes claim regarding the delay disingenuous when he was the one who attempted to deceive law enforcement officials by concealing his true identity.united states whittaker,cir there was no way the ins could have identified defendant who surreptitiously entered united states using fictitious name as a previously deported alien at the time of his reentry.
furthermore,if any authority was on notice of mercedes illegal presence in the united states in,it was the new york state department of corrections,not the ins.mercedes essentially asks us to adopt a rule that would make the ins responsible for any information discovered in state investigations of the hundreds of thousands of prisoners in state custody at any given time.see prisoners in,bureau of justice statistics bulletin dep t justice,at reporting total prisoners under the jurisdiction of state correctional authorities in and state inmates in prisoners in,bureau of justice statistics bulletin dep t justice,at reporting state inmates in.given mercedes attempts to deceive,the procedural mechanisms in place and the tools available to the ins in we can not say that the ins efforts fell short of the diligence typical of federal immigration law enforcement authorities,as discussed in,at.see also acevedo,at,holding that,despite arrest by new york state authorities in and,statute of limitations for found in offense did not begin to run until state correctional officials notified the ins of alien incarceration in.
we therefore hold that the indictment was timely accordingly,the district court did not err in so ruling,nor did it abuse its discretion in denying mercedes motion to withdraw his guilty plea on the statute of limitations ground 
b.the aggravated felony enhancement 
section a provides a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment for illegal reentry.section b,however,
