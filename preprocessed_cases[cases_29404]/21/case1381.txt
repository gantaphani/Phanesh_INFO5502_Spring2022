defendant eric skys appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york following his plea of guilty before william pauley iii,judge,convicting him on one count of securities fraud,in violation of b and three counts of wire fraud,in violation of and and one count of bank fraud in violation of and.skys was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release.on appeal,he challenges two aspects of the district court calculation of the range of imprisonment recommended by the advisory sentencing guidelines guidelines,contending that the district court erred in finding that there were or more victims of his offenses within the meaning of guidelines b,and in finding that he was the organizer or leader of criminal activity that was extensive within the meaning of guidelines a.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that the district court findings on these issues are insufficient to permit meaningful review,and we remand for supplementation of the record with appropriate findings or for resentencing.
background 
the events that gave rise to the present prosecution are no longer in dispute.on the third day of his trial on the above charges,skys elected to withdraw his plea of not guilty and to plead guilty on all counts,stating,inter alia,i am guilty and the evidence is overwhelming trial transcript,august,at.
a.the events underlying the counts of conviction 
in august,skys,whose real name is eric smith,launched a scheme to obtain large sums of money from several financial institutions.he held himself out to be the president and chief executive officer of a company he called or,which was supposedly in the business of providing information technology consulting services he approached citigroup citigroup and represented that owned approximately million shares of stock in sprint nextel sprint that had received as payment for an computer program called aedan,which had supposedly developed and which involved the use of artificial intelligence.at that time,the market value of million shares of sprint was approximately million.skys represented that sprint shares were restricted,they could not legally be transferred until october,and he sought to realize immediate cash for about of the shares by a means such as pledging them to citigroup in exchange for a an advance purchase million that would be repaid either in cash or by transferring the hypothecated shares.in fact,neither skys nor owned any sprint stock,and all of the documents that skys submitted to citigroup as evidence of ownership were fabricated.
citigroup seriously considered the proposed transaction but declined in october,after it contacted sprint and learned that skys claims were false and his documents were forgeries.skys made similar attempts to obtain funds from three other financial institutions,using some of the same forged documents.those attempts also failed.
skys was arrested in may and charged with one count of securities fraud and one count of bank fraud in connection with his fraudulent offers to sell the sprint shares to the financial institutions,in violation of b and,and u.and,and three counts of wire fraud in connection with interstate telephone or fax communications to citigroup with respect to,inter alia,securities accounts with fraudulently stated balances,in violation of and.as indicated above,skys entered a plea of guilty on all counts.
uncharged conduct 
the presentence report psr prepared on skys described the following additional fraudulent conduct in which skys had engaged but which was not charged in the present case.from january through march,skys solicited investments in a company he called predecessor of that he had become a multimillionaire by developing the aedan program and that he had existing contractual relationships with several large corporations and the united states department of defense.in support of these solicitations,skys distributed documents that were fabrications or forgeries.the psr stated that these solicitations were successful and that skys defrauded investors of moneys but it did not identify any such investor,did not state how many investors there were,and did not state the amounts of which they were defrauded.
in addition,the psr described skys receipt of from a florida dentist in in exchange for a false promise to develop dental imaging software.skys sales pitch had included representations as to his ownership of million shares of sprint stock.skys also solicited,unsuccessfully,a million investment from the dentist,promising to repay him million in the fall of when skys would be permitted to sell the sprint shares.
the psr characterized the dentist and the investors as victims in skys offenses but noted that his conduct with respect to those persons was uncharged.
sentencing 
the psr calculation of skys offense level began with a base offense level of pursuant to a it recommended increases for the following specific offense characteristics steps pursuant to b m for an intended loss amount of more than million but not more than million two steps pursuant to b a for an offense involving or more,but fewer than,victims and two steps pursuant to b c for an offense that involved sophisticated means.the psr also recommended a upward adjustment pursuant to a on the ground that skys was an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,and a downward adjustment pursuant to a for skys acceptance of responsibility prior to the imposition of sentence.
the total offense level was.given skys criminal history category of ii,the range of imprisonment was to months.the psr nonetheless recommended a prison term of months as sufficient,given,principally,that skys had a history of emotional disturbance and had actually obtained no money from the financial institutions.
skys submitted to the district court a presentence memorandum objecting to the enhancement for victims and the recommended adjustment for a leadership role in criminal activity involving five or more participants.he argued principally that the government had not sufficiently identified such victims or participants.responding to the objection,the government argued that the total number of financial institutions that skys had attempted to defraud,plus the florida dentist and the investors he had succeeded in defrauding,was more than,and indeed approached.as to the role adjustment,the government argued that there were in fact at least five participants in skys criminal activity skys himself his life partner coreen cunningham who,as the corporate secretary of,made material misrepresentations to skys targets supposed chief financial officer joseph cross michael breshears,who,along with cross,had acted as a middleman in assisting skys attempts co obtain financing from the financial institutions and gary griffiths,as a collaborator in the supposed development of aedan,who had helped recruit individual investors for.the government also argued that skys scheme,given its nature and his repeated misrepresentations and fabrications,was sufficiently extensive to warrant the role adjustment.
skys pursued his objections to the enhancement and the adjustment at the sentencing hearing.he argued,inter alia,that the investors should not be considered victims of his offense because that scheme was not part of the same enterprise as his offense conduct.he argued that the role adjustment was inappropriate because cunningham could not be a criminally responsible participant,as s he believed what skys told her,and there was no evidence that she knew anything she did for was fraudulent,and that the other individuals named by the government were merely doing their jobs and could not legitimately be considered coconspirators.sentencing transcript,december,at.skys claimed that the scheme did not meet the otherwise extensive branch of the leadership role guideline because he conducted the fraud alone through just.id.at.
in sentencing skys,the district court stated that except in certain respects not pertinent to this appeal this court has reviewed the presentence report.i adopt the findings of fact in the report as my own.id.at.in rejecting skys objection,the court stated as follows 
c onsidering the continuity with relevant conduct and the financial institutions involved,i find that the probation calculation of the enhancement for more than ten victims is warranted.
with respect to the role adjustment,the court had noted that a has two disjunctive branches,one requiring five or more participants and the other requiring criminal activity that was otherwise extensive.the court commented that skys really did need five or more people.he had cunningham and then he had the unwitting participation of other people at these various financial institutions.id.at.he did it from his home over a period of time in a number of calculated and orchestrated moves.and he was so good at it that he was capable of convincing other people chat his enterprise was a legitimate one.how is that not extensive id.in formally ruling on skys challenge,the court stated as follows 
now the defendant objects to the enhancement for being an organizer or leader of activity involving five or more participants or that was otherwise extensive,and this court finds that this was an extensive scheme.skys led a life that was entirely a life of fraud,and whenever he needed to offer another artifice,he did it,whether it was a forged stock certificate,a bogus account statement,a manipulation of.whatever it took,the defendant rose to the occasion.it was not a momentary lapse.it was extensive.and skys was constantly moving on to new targets of opportunity.and so a enhancement is warranted in this case.
the court concluded that skys range of imprisonment was to months.however,noting chat skys had not succeeded in his scheme to defraud the financial institutions,and finding that he was only years of age and possessed the ability to become a productive member of society,the court imposed a prison term of months.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,skys challenges the district court application of the and increases as part of the guidelines calculations.we have difficulty with both increases.
a.the standards of review 
the district court has discretion to impose either a guidelines sentence or a sentence,see,united states booker,but the court must begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable guidelines range,gall united states,see,booker,at.we review the district court sentencing decision for reasonableness,which is essentially review for abuse of discretion.see,gall,at united states brown,cir.
in determining whether there was an abuse of discretion,we review for an error of law,or clearly erroneous findings of fact,or a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.united states josephberg,cir,cert.denied.see,united states abiodun,cir.abiodun,cert.denied.rulings of law are reviewed de novo findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.see,e,united states rubenstein.cir.rubenstein,cert.denied.m ixed questions of law and fact are reviewed either de novo or under the clearly erroneous standard,depending on whether the question is predominantly legal or predominantly factual.united states thorn,cir.
t he interpretation of a sentencing guideline is a question of law,united states carr,cir.internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,and r egardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the guidelines range,we must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,such as improperly calculating the guidelines range or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence,gall,u.at.
as to disputed issues of fact,the district court must make findings with sufficient clarity to permit meaningful appellate review.see,united states ahders,cir united states ware,cir ware,cert.denied.united states cavera,cir en banc,cert.denied.united states carter,cir carter,cert.denied.a defendant role in criminal activity is a question of fact,see,ware,at carter,at.the number of persons or entities who are victims within the meaning of guidelines b is likewise a question of fact but the matter of who can properly be considered a victim within the meaning of that guideline is a question of law.see,abiodun,at.
b.the enhancement 
skys challenges the enhancement on the ground that neither the tour financial institutions that avoided being defrauded into accepting his proposed transaction nor the individuals who actually were defrauded into giving him money could properly be considered victims within the meaning of b.that section instructs the sentencing court,in pertinent part,as follows 
apply the greatest if the offense 
a i involved or more victims,increase by levels 
b involved or more victims,increase by levels 
guidelines b a i and b.the commentary to defines v ictim,in pertinent part,as any person including individuals,corporations,and companies who sustained any part of the actual loss determined under subsection b.guidelines application note emphasis added.
subsection b of is the loss table that prescribes increases depending on the amount of loss.the commentary focusing on subsection b provides,with exceptions not relevant here,that loss is the greater of actual loss or intended loss,guidelines application note a emphasis added.it defines i ntended loss as the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense,id.application note a ii emphasis added,and defines a ctual loss to mean the reasonably foreseeable pecuniary harm that resulted from the offense,id.application note a i emphasis added.to determine which is the greater,actual loss or intended loss,the court obviously must make some determination as to the amount in each category but it need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,id.application note c.
in sum,while the court loss determination under subsection b of is to be based on the amount of intended loss if that is greater than the amount of actual loss,victims,within the meaning of subsection b,are only those persons or entities who sustained actual loss determined by the court under subsection b.see,abiodun,at error as a matter of law to include as victims individuals whose losses were not included in the loss calculation.
skys,noting the above definition of v ictim,points out that 
a lthough the testimony adduced at trial could support a claim that the financial institutions bore some incidental,actual loss,that loss was not part of the b calculation.the purported incidental losses therefore can not form the basis for a finding that the financial institutions were victims moreover,if the court took lost time into account when it decided that the financial institutions were victims,it failed to determine the monetary value of this time when making its calculations of loss,as this section also requires.
skys brief on appeal at emphases added.we agree.the court loss calculation under subsection b was based on intended loss 
t he defendant admitted he attempted to deceive financial institutions by making fraudulent misrepresentations to them that he was in possession of more than million shares of stock.he made these representations in an effort to obtain million from financial institutions in the united states.
now this court has reviewed the presentence report.i adopt the findings of fact in the report as amended here on the record as my own.
turning first to the guideline calculation,because this crime sounds in fraud,the base offense level is,and because the offense involved an anticipated loss exceeding million but less than a hundred million,levels are added.
emphases added.
the district court itself made no determination that any of the four financial institutions mentioned in the psr suffered any actual loss.and although the court permissibly adopted the findings made in the psr,that report,while stating that the financial institutions had used their resources for several months in evaluating skys proposed transaction,stated that there was no determined loss amount to the institutions.
without any determined amount of actual loss to the financial institutions,the district court inappropriately included the institutions as victims und
