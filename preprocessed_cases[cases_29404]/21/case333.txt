facts background 
the following facts are drawn from the trial record and,in light of rogers challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction,are presented in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states valerio,cir.
on july,rogers,heather rogers,sold a laptop computer to coastal trading and pawn in brunswick,maine.later that day,she returned with rogers himself,who sold a second laptop to the store.in keeping with coastal trading usual practice,the clerk asked for,and received,the passwords to both laptops,to allow the store staff to access the computers and restore them to their factory settings.
the next day,coastal trading computer technician began the process of preparing the second laptop for resale.he turned it on and entered the password that rogers had provided.in an effort to find the program that would restore the laptop to its factory settings,he looked in the windows recycle bin.there,he discovered a video file captioned my year old sister.this discovery prompted him to search the laptop for other videos he found quite a few more.he viewed portions of a few videos and saw y oung children involved in sexual acts.he immediately notified the store manager,who called the brunswick police.
a few days later,brunswick detective william moir collected the laptop and the associated sales paperwork from coastal trading and took them to the police station.until moir came to collect it,the laptop remained in the store back room,and no one accessed it.moir,who had specialized electronic forensics training,removed the laptop hard drive and attached it to a write blocker,which allowed him to view the drive contents without altering them.after finding some files with names indicative of child pornography,he took the drive to the maine state police computer crimes unit for further analysis.there,he worked with an analyst to copy and review the contents of the drive.they found both videos and still images of children engaged in sex acts.
detective moir soon returned to coastal trading and seized the laptop that heather rogers had sold to the store on her first visit.nothing of significance was found on that first computer.moir then obtained a search warrant for rogers home,which he and other law enforcement officers executed on july.heather rogers was there when they arrived brian rogers returned home during the search.when the officers came upon a desktop computer and a case containing compact discs,they seized both.
the hard drive of the second laptop the one on which the store employees initially found child pornography was subsequently subjected to a more comprehensive forensic inspection.chris hull,an analyst with the computer crimes unit,used forensic software to examine the hard drive contents.he found two user accounts on the drive an account called mingan also designated admin and a default guest account.he also found six child pornography videos in a shared folder associated with the mingan user account,and still images depicting child pornography in the temporary internet files and lost files folders.the shared folder was created by limewire,a program that hull found in the recycle bin.the temporary internet files folder,as hull testified at trial,stores files from frequently visited websites that otherwise would have to be loaded remotely,with the goal of speeding up the user web browsing experience.
hull also examined the file,which records the computer user activity,whether it be visiting websites or opening files on the computer itself.the index file reflected numerous visits to websites like.com which was also bookmarked in the laptop default web browser,along with natural lolitas and.com.and hull found cookies widely used data packets that allow websites to recognize returning from various websites,including,a yahoo user account called,and the social networking site myspace which appeared to be associated with the same login information as the yahoo account.indeed,detective moir found a myspace page for a user called mingan one of the account three myspace friends was heather rogers,brian rogers wife.as it happens,hull determined that the password for the user account mingan on the laptop was heather,and the password hint associated with that account was my baby.
additionally,hull found ten infections,malware programs,on the laptop.to determine whether they might be responsible for the presence of child pornography,he installed the same infections on a test machine that replicated the conditions on the laptop and let them run for a week.no child pornography appeared on the test machine.
hull examined the desktop computer seized from rogers home as well.using the same forensic tools he used on the laptop,he uncovered child pornography images.these files were located in unallocated space,indicating that the files had been deleted by a user but not yet overwritten with new data.he also found two user accounts on the desktop bunny and nexcom,the latter of which was also captioned mingan.associated with the latter account were internet bookmarks for websites like and.org.

ii.analysis 
sufficiency of the evidence 
a challenge to a jury guilty verdict will not succeed unless no rational jury could have concluded that the government proved all of the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.united states green,cir.as noted above,we evaluate the facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict.id.we do not weigh evidence or assess credibility.united states tavares,cir.
a b creates criminal penalties for any person who knowingly possesses,or knowingly accesses with intent to view,any computer disk,or any other material that contains an image of child pornography that was produced or transported in interstate commerce,including via computer.here,it is undisputed that the images found on the laptop constituted child pornography and that the interstate commerce element was satisfied.rogers challenge focuses instead on the question of knowing possession.to satisfy the statute requirement,the government must show that rogers possessed,and knew he possessed,child pornography.see united states x citement video,d united states hilton,cir,disapproved of on other grounds by ashcroft free speech,d.
to begin with,there can be no serious dispute that the child pornography found on the laptop was downloaded knowingly and deliberately.the web browser cookies and indexed history indicated that someone had used the browser to make numerous visits to websites related to,or with names indicative of,child pornography,including.com,natural lolitas,and.com.see united states pruitt,cir conviction was supported by a record of visits to websites with a connection accord united states ramos,cir united states kain,cir.further,the discovery of child pornography in the temporary internet files folder suggests that those images were
