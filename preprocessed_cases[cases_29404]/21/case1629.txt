this appeal raises several important issues,including the bounds of reasonableness review,united states booker,d,and the requirement that a district judge provide a written statement of reasons for imposing a sentence outside the advisory guidelines range,c.the appeal is taken from a february,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york thomas griesa,judge sentencing james rattoballi to one year of home confinement and five years probation.the district court required that rattoballi pay in restitution it did not impose a fine,citing rattoballi inability to pay.we hold that rattoballi sentence,which represents a substantial deviation from the recommended guidelines range of to months imprisonment,is unreasonable.we also hold that if a district court elects to impose a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range,it has a statutory obligation to include a statement in the written judgment setting forth the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from the recommended guidelines sentence.c.finally,we find clear error in the district court conclusion that rattoballi lacked the ability to pay a fine.accordingly,we vacate and remand for resentencing.
background 
james rattoballi is a veteran of the printing industry for roughly the past twenty years,he has served as president and of print technical group,a printing brokerage firm that performed about million in annual sales and employed approximately twelve people.in recent years,rattoballi also has served as a commissioned sales representative for two graphic services companies,master eagle graphic services,and ltc fusion.
between and,rattoballi paid substantial kickbacks to executives at advertising agencies,including mitchell mosallem at grey global group,grey,in return for these agencies placing their business with his companies.the kickbacks included cash,italian clothing,a platinum watch,limousine services,meals,airline tickets,and personal printing services.for their part,the agencies executives would steer contracts to rattoballi and keep his companies on their lists.rattoballi managed to offset some of the costs associated with these kickbacks by submitting inflated invoices to the advertising agencies the agencies would then pass these inflated invoices along to their clients.
starting in,rattoballi also submitted exaggerated cover bids to grey in order to help mosallem create the illusion of competition among potential suppliers to a lucrative client account.mosallem used rattoballi bids,along with those of others,to help steer contracts to other preferred vendors,all at prices.in exchange for his cooperation,rattoballi continued to enjoy favored status at grey his companies earned approximately million annually from grey.
in,rattoballi was charged in an information with one count of conspiracy to rig bids in violation of of the sherman act,and one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud in violation of the information focused exclusively on rattoballi dealings with mitchell mosallem at grey.
rattoballi entered into a plea agreement with the government.under the terms of the agreement,rattoballi agreed to provide full,complete,and truthful cooperation to the government and to disclose fully,completely,and truthfully all information related to the government investigation.rattoballi also agreed to appear as a witness for the government in any case brought in connection with the charges.in exchange,the government agreed not to prosecute rattoballi further for any crimes arising out of the same conduct.in addition,the government agreed that if rattoballi abided by the terms of the plea agreement and provided substantial assistance in any investigations or prosecutions,it would file a letter advising the sentencing judge to take rattoballi cooperation into account during sentencing.see.
over the next two years,the government interviewed rattoballi on five occasions,and each time he was asked about the payments he made to mosallem and other purchasing agents.rattoballi readily admitted that he gave mosallem and other purchasing agents clothing and additional goods and services he denied ever having given mosallem,or any of the other purchasing agents,cash or items of significant value.
in the course of preparing for mosallem trial,the government became suspicious that rattoballi had been less than fully cooperative with its investigation.the government suspicions proved accurate.after the government confronted rattoballi with information obtained from other witnesses,rattoballi admitted for the first time that he made substantial cash payments to mosallem and other purchasing agents.rattoballi also admitted that he helped to provide mosallem with a diamond and platinum watch that listed for but was purchased wholesale for.finally,rattoballi admitted that he had spoken with mosallem about the investigation,and had agreed not to mention the cash or the watch to the government.as a result of rattoballi mendacity and its obvious effect on his credibility as a witness,the government determined that it could not call him as its witness at mosallem trial,which later was avoided when mosallem pled guilty.the government asserts that mosallem restitution order was undervalued because the government was not made aware prior to mosallem sentencing of the full extent of the kickback scheme.
in its sentencing memorandum,the government argued that rattoballi total offense level under the guidelines was,producing a range of to months imprisonment the probation office concurred in this calculation,which rested on that office assessment of the fraud loss and included a upward adjustment for obstruction of justice and no reduction for acceptance of responsibility.rattoballi sought,in his sentencing memorandum,a sentence consistent with the district court discretionary authority following united states booker,d,and united states crosby,cir.he challenged the government calculations and its proposed adjustments,and he argued for a sentence that did not include a term of imprisonment.at the same time,rattoballi admitted that he had accumulated some modest wealth and was capable of paying a modest fine.
at sentencing,the district court accepted the government recommendation for a enhancement for obstruction of justice but concluded that rattoballi still was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,based primarily on the fact that rattoballi did not force the government to go to trial.the district court also adjusted the calculation from to,which led to an additional reduction.these rulings resulted in an adjusted offense level of and a guidelines range of to months imprisonment the rulings and the resulting range are not contested on appeal.after listening to the defendant,the district court stated that it had considered the guidelines very,very seriously,and it acknowledged that rattoballi stood convicted of substantial crimes that require appropriate penalties.nevertheless,the district court stated that it had a problem with giving rattoballi a prison sentence.it then set forth its reasons for imposing a sentence 
the problem i have with a prison sentence is as follows despite the difficulty and the delay in coming clean with the whole range of criminal conduct,this defendant has pleaded guilty,and he has now,i believe,admitted the full range of his criminal conduct.he did not persist in denying,he did not force the government to go to trial,and that has always been regarded by courts as a very substantial matter.
moreover,if nothing else were done to rattoballi,this case has inflicted punishment.it has been hanging over him for a period of three years.now,there were reasons for that,and part of it was the idea that he might cooperate and testify.but be that as it may,the case has been hanging over him for three years.without any doubt,it has taken a severe toll on his business,although it is not completely destroyed,his business,fortunately,but he has been convicted of two federal crimes.that is not without meaning as far as punishment,and as i say,his business has been,although not completely destroyed,has been severely harmed.
it seems to me that both society and those closer to rattoballi would be legitimately benefited by having rattoballi attempt to continue in his small business.he employs people,he has a partner,and i have no doubt that a prison sentence would absolutely end that business.it is in the interests of society that he try the best he can to be from here on out a and productive member of society.
i also have in mind that,although there is certainly no excuse for the crimes he committed,the evidence in this whole litigation picture is that mosalle m and was sic a person who exerted an enormous amount of pressure upon other people and got them in trouble.they,of course,should not have gotten into trouble.they should have resisted.they should have done other things.
but mosalle m determination,his demands,his insatiable insistence were very difficult to deal with.again,as i have said,no excuse,but he part of the picture.
now,there were kickbacks paid to another agency,and it did not involve mosalle m,so what i say about mosalle m is not the entire excuse,but it part of the picture and an important part of the picture.
the district court then imposed a sentence of one year of home confinement and five years probation.it also ordered rattoballi to pay in restitution,while commenting that rattoballi would need to work in order to be able to pay such a significant amount in restitution.the district court never addressed the issue of a fine and did not impose one nor did it impose the mandatory special assessment of.
shortly after the hearing,the court issued its written judgment.the judgment did not contain the district court reasons for imposing a sentence below the advisory guidelines range it stated only that t he court deems the guidelines to be advisory and imposes sentence notwithstanding it sic determinations.the court did include the mandatory special assessment in the written judgment,but did not impose a fine,citing rattoballi inability to pay.
the government preserved its objections and filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
we review a district court sentencing decisions for reasonableness.united states booker,d united states crosby,cir.reasonableness review has two components procedural reasonableness,whereby we consider such factors as whether the district court properly a identified the guidelines range supported by the facts found by the court,b treated the guidelines as advisory,and c considered the guidelines together with the other factors outlined in a and substantive reasonableness,whereby we consider whether the length of the sentence is reasonable in light of the factors outlined in a.crosby,at.after booker,we still review a district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo and evaluate its findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard.united states selioutsky,cir.
the government lodges three separate claims of error on this appeal the sentence imposed by the district court differs substantially from the advisory guidelines range and is unreasonably low the district court failed to include a written statement setting forth its reasons for imposing a sentence below the advisory guidelines range and the court finding of an inability to pay a fine is clearly erroneous and the failure to impose any fine is unreasonable.we address these arguments in turn.
i.the reasonableness of the district court sentence.
booker worked a fundamental change in federal sentencing.no longer are the sentencing guidelines mandatory district courts are now simply under a duty to consider them,along with the other factors set forth in a.booker,at.crosby,at.at the same time,we have emphasized that booker did not signal a return to wholly discretionary sentencing.crosby,at stating that it would be a mistake to think that,after,district judges may return to the sentencing regime that existed before and exercise unfettered discretion to select any sentence within the applicable statutory maximum and minimum.while district courts enjoy discretion following booker,that discretion must be informed by the a factors a district court can not import its own philosophy of sentencing if it is inconsistent with the a factors.united states dean,cir see also united states smith,cir stating that t he sentencing court discretion remains constrained by a.
our own review for reasonableness,though deferential,will not equate to a rubber stamp.united states moreland,cir.we are also under a duty to consider a.booker,at.thus,while reasonableness admits to a range,not a point,united states cunningham,cir,it also is a concept that implies boundaries,even if those boundaries provide for some latitude,united states canova,cir noting that reasonableness review is necessarily deferential united states fleming,cir although the brevity or length of a sentence can exceed the bounds of reasonableness,we anticipate encountering such circumstances infrequently.
in calibrating our review for reasonableness,we will continue to seek guidance from the considered judgment of the sentencing commission as expressed in the sentencing guidelines and authorized by congress.see united states cage,wl,at cir stating that the guidelines are an expression of popular political will about sentencing that is entitled to due consideration when we determine reasonableness see also united states fernandez,cir stating that the guidelines range should serve as a benchmark or a point of reference or departure for the review of sentences citations omitted quoting united states rubenstein,cir.t he guidelines can not be called just another factor in the statutory list,a,because they are the only integration of the multiple factors and,with important exceptions,their calculations were based upon the actual sentences of many judges.united states,cir en banc citation altered emphasis removed citing booker,at.o see also united states johnson,cir by now,the guidelines represent approximately two decades of close attention to federal sentencing policy.united states claiborne,cir the guidelines were fashioned taking the other a factors into account and are the product of years of careful study.united states cooper,cir the federal sentencing guidelines represent the collective determination of three governmental,the judiciary,and the sentencing to the appropriate punishments for a wide range of criminal conduct.citations omitted united states mykytiuk,cir the sentencing guidelines represent at this point eighteen years worth of careful consideration of the proper sentence for federal offenses.it bears noting that the sentencing commission is an expert agency whose statutory charge mirrors the a factors that the district courts are required to consider.b.
we appreciate that the guidelines are still generalizations that can point to outcomes that may appear unreasonable to sentencing judges in particular cases,at emphasis removed.accordingly,we have declined to adopt per se rules,opting instead to fashion the mosaic of reasonableness through adjudication.crosby,at see also fernandez,at noting that,in,at,the first circuit likewise rejected the view that a guidelines sentence is presumptively reasonable.nevertheless,on appellate review,we will view as inherently suspect a sentence that rests primarily upon factors that are not unique or personal to a particular defendant,but instead reflects attributes common to all defendants.disparate sentences prompted the passage of the sentencing reform act and remain its principal concern.see booker,at.a b b see also,at a primary goal of sentencing reform is the elimination of unwarranted sentencing disparity,reprinted in.
further,in discharging our duty to review sentences for reasonableness,we are required to consider any pertinent policy statements issued by the sentencing commission or the congress just as the district courts are required to consider those policy statements when imposing sentence.see booker,at.a see also e stating that the commission,in promulgating the guidelines and its policy statements,shall assure that they reflect the general inappropriateness of considering the education,vocational skills,employment record,family ties and responsibilities,and community ties of the defendant.the commission derives its authority to issue these policy statements from an express congressional mandate.a,d.although the district courts are not required to follow these statements in every case,they must consider when imposing a sentence.see crosby,at stating that district courts must consider applicable policy statements a sentence that a district court imposes in reliance on factors incompatible with the commission policy statements may be deemed substantively unreasonable in the absence of persuasive explanation as to why the sentence actually comports with the a factors.see a moreland,at a sentence may be substantively unreasonable if the court relies on an improper factor or rejects policies articulated by congress or the sentencing commission.
finally,while we have refused to prescribe any formulation a sentencing judge will be obliged to follow in order to demonstrate discharge of the duty to consider the guidelines,crosby,at,and putting aside for the moment the specific statement requirement in c,see infra,we note that several other circuits have endorsed a rule that requires district courts to offer a more compelling accounting the farther a sentence deviates from the advisory guidelines range,united states dean,cir stating that the farther the judge sentence departs from the guidelines sentence in either of greater severity,or that of greater lenity,the more compelling the justification based on factors in section a that the judge must offer accord united states smith,cir united states smith,cir united states moreland,cir united states mcmannus,cir united states simpson.while we have yet to adopt this standard as a rule in this circuit,and do not do so here,we emphasize that our own ability to uphold a sentence as reasonable will be informed by the district court statement of reasons or lack thereof for the sentence that it elects to impose.crosby,at see also united states fairclough,cir per curiam evaluating the district court sentence in light of the reasons that it offered,including its statement that the guidelines range was inadequate to address the nature and circumstances of the offense united states green,cir recognizing that reasonableness review is informed by the statement of reasons articulated by the district court.indeed,a district court may be able to justify a marginal sentence by including a compelling statement of reasons that reflect consideration of a and set forth why it was desirable to deviate from the guidelines.in the absence of such a compelling statement,we may be forced to vacate a marginal sentence where the record is insufficient,on its own,to support the sentence as reasonable.united states,cir stating that a court of appeals must assess whether the district court choice of sentence is adequately explained given the record on appeal.with these thoughts in mind,we turn to rattoballi sentence.
the guidelines,after adjustments,contemplated a range between and months imprisonment.notwithstanding this recommendation,the district court rejected a prison sentence in favor of a sentence of one year of home confinement and five years probation.it should go without saying that the district court sentence represents a substantial deviation from the recommended guidelines range.
the district court attempted to substantiate its sentence through a statement that essentially rested on four points of support despite the difficulty and delay in coming clean,rattoballi eventually admitted to all wrongdoing and pled guilty rattoballi suffered significant punishment based on the fact that he was charged and stood convicted of two federal crimes a term of imprisonment would end rattoballi business and rattoballi unlawful conduct was brought about,in part,by mosallem insatiable appetite for luxurious goods and services.we find at least five problems with the points advanced by the district court.
first,the district court statement relies,in part,on factors that are common to all defendants.every convicted felon suffers the indignity and associated with a criminal conviction.such a reliance is contrary to a,which calls for a reduction in unwarranted disparities among similarly situated defendants.
second,the district court appears to have overlooked or ignored the commission policy statements in violation of a.as we have previously noted,in assessing a sentence for reasonableness,we are required to consider any applicable policy statements issued by the commission or congress.see supra see also booker,at.a.the district court sentence fails to take into account the commission view that alternatives such as community confinement not be used to avoid imprisonment of antitrust offenders,cmt.the guidelines reflect a considered determination by the commission that jail terms are the most effective deterrent for antitrust violations.see id.cmt.background stating that in very few cases will the guidelines not require that some confinement be imposed amendments to the sentencing guidelines for united states courts,may,explaining that the offense levels for antitrust violations were increased to make them more comparable to the offense levels for fraud with similar amounts of loss see also practice under the federal sentencing guidelines,at phylis skloot bamberger david gottlieb,ed.supp.noting that j ail terms were urged on the commission as the most effective deterrent by both the antitrust division of the department of justice and the private bar because imprisonment,even in a minimum security prison,is a terrifying and degrading experience for otherwise businessmen footnotes omitted.the sentencing commission also has explained that jail terms are ordinarily necessary for antitrust violations because they reflect the serious nature of and the difficulty of detecting such violations.amendments to the sentencing guidelines for united states courts.at.although the district court is not required to adhere to the policy statements promulgated by the commission,we do consider them in reviewing a sentence for reasonableness,and the policy statements make plain that imprisonment is generally warranted for antitrust offenders 
third,the district court stated that rattoballi business would absolutely end if rattoballi was sentenced to a term of imprisonment.we have previously held that a sentencing court may extraordinary strains that a criminal investigation places on a defendant business.see united states milikowsky,cir.but such circumstances are not present here.the record does not support the district court finding that a term of imprisonment would cause rattoballi business to absolutely end neither rattoballi nor his business partner predicted such an outcome.moreover,we are disinclined to accord the prospect of business failure decisive weight when it is a direct function of a criminal investigation that had its origins in the defendant own unlawful conduct.
fourth,the district court cited the fact that rattoballi agreed to plead guilty and eventually admitted to all wrongdoing.the district court already had rejected the government argument that rattoballi was not entitled to a reduction under guideline to his calculated guidelines range for acceptance of responsibility.to eliminate rattoballi term of imprisonment altogether based on this reason would give him credit for cooperation twice,which was especially unwarranted under the circumstances of this case.giving such significant weight to this factor would effectively ignore,indeed reward,the defendant deliberate withholding of information and his agreement with mosallem to obstruct justice by not disclosing the full extent of the kickback scheme to the government.
finally,the district court relied upon rattoballi lesser culpability,at least in relation to mosallem,to support a sentence that did not include a term of imprisonment.although a defendant culpability is always relevant in imposing sentence,we fail to see how rattoballi lesser culpability could justify the sentence that was imposed in this case,and no sufficient justification was offered by the district court.rattoballi engaged in criminal conduct for more than a decade,
