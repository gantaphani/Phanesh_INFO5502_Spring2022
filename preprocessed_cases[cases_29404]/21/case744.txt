this is an appeal of a criminal conviction for offenses and the resulting sentence.bounket thongsophaporn contends that the district court erroneously denied his motion to suppress certain statements that he contends were improperly taken after he asserted his right to remain silent.he also contends that the district court erroneously applied a enhancement under the sentencing guidelines for possession of a dangerous weapon.because we find that the district court properly denied the motion to suppress and that the application of the sentencing enhancement was not clearly erroneous,we affirm.
background 
on march,bounket thongsophaporn was arrested in brunswick,maine.he was taken to the police station and placed in an interview room.agents reginald walker,katherine barnard,and jonathan richards of the maine and drug enforcement agencies were with him in the room.barnard told defendant that they had evidence that he distributed drugs.she also read him his miranda rights,with the help of a laotian interpreter,who was available by telephone.defendant indicated that he understood his rights and that he understood english,but that he did not want to waive his rights or talk with the agents.barnard and richards then left the room.
walker,however,remained in the room with defendant.he sat approximately three to five feet away from him at the interview table.other agents came and went from the interview room.after approximately five minutes of silence,defendant asked for water.he was provided with.either before or after he received the drink,defendant asked walker what was going on.walker replied that he knew why he was in the position he was in now.defendant said that the agents wanted him to set up the big one.walker asked what he meant defendant responded that the agents wanted him to help get a cocaine dealer.
at that point,walker told defendant that the agents would like to talk with him,but that he had refused to answer questions.walker also said that defendant could answer some questions and refuse to answer others.defendant said that he wanted to talk.defendant expressed concern for his daughters and may have asked if he would be released if he cooperated.walker then summoned barnard and richards back into the room 
when barnard entered the room,she asked defendant whether he wanted to speak with the agents.defendant replied that he did.barnard repeated the miranda rights,again with the help of a laotian interpreter by telephone.defendant stated that he understood his rights,wanted to waive them,and wanted to speak with the agents barnard stayed for a few minutes,and then left the room.
defendant told walker and richards that he had cocaine and thousands of dollars of cash in his home.he said that he had two ounces of cocaine in his freezer,ten ounces of cocaine in a cereal box near a blue pickup truck,and another ten ounces of cocaine by the spare tire in the rear bed of the truck.he also said that there was cash located in a box near his bed and an additional in a closet near his shoes.defendant also told the agents about the source of his supply and a woman to whom he sold cocaine named mary gargan.
according to defendant,a person named addi lived in the rear bedroom of his house.he had seen addi with a gun three months earlier.however,addi was not inside defendant home when he saw him with the gun.defendant informed the agents if there are guns in the house at all,they would be in addi room.
after the interview was completed,defendant was driven to the portland office of the dea.he continued to answer questions along the way.
barnard used the information defendant provided to obtain a warrant to search his house and his pickup truck that same day.in defendant house,the agents found drugs and cash.in the rear bedroom,they found a loaded handgun,rounds of ammunition,and an unloaded shotgun.
defendant was charged with various offenses he filed a motion to suppress the statements made at the brunswick police station and on the way to portland.as noted,that motion was referred to a magistrate judge,who recommended denying it after an evidentiary hearing.the district court then adopted the recommendation.after a jury trial,defendant was found guilty of all counts on november.
during the trial,the government introduced a photograph lineup with a picture of a man it believed was addi insoban,defendant roommate.woman to whom defendant admittedly supplied the man in the lineup as a person she met and gave money to at defendant request.however,she did not identify him by name.no other witness at the trial identified addi or the man in the photograph.
at sentencing,the government requested a enhancement under based upon the guns found at defendant home.at the sentencing hearing,the government introduced the lineup photograph,with the following colloquy 
your honor,introduced at trial as government exhibit was a photo lineup which contained the photograph of an individual named addi insoban sic,who we believe to be the person that the defendant was referring to.i have marked as government exhibit for sentencing that photo lineup that was introduced at trial.it depicts insoban in seat number six and we believe that appropriate for sentence.
the court any objection 
defense counsel no,your honor.
the court they are both admitted.
the government then offered a portion of the trial transcript,with the following description 
i would also like to offer into evidence what i marked as which is a copy of a portion of the trial transcript in which gargan testified regarding the note she wrote on the photo lineup.above insoban photo it said met and talked,gave money and gargan indicated at trial that she,in fact,gave money to that person depicted in picture number six,addi insoban,and that she was instructed to do so by bob who,as the court knows from trial,is the defendant,and i would like to offer into evidence.
again,defendant did not object to its admission.
although defendant argued at the sentencing hearing that the evidence did not support a enhancement,he did not object to the government statement that the person in the lineup photograph was addi insoban.the court concluded that there was sufficient evidence to establish the required nexus between the guns and the drug offense and applied the enhancement.
ii.discussion 
motion to suppress 
under the miranda doctrine,police must advise a suspect who is in custody of his right to counsel and his right to remain silent.see miranda arizona,d.where a suspect asserts his right to counsel or to remain silent,further interrogation may not take place unless the accused himself initiates further communication,exchanges,or conversations with the police.edwards arizona,d accord oregon bradshaw,d.the critical safeguard of miranda is a suspect right to cut off questioning.michigan mosley,d,quoting miranda,at.by cutting off questioning,a suspect can control the time at which questioning occurs,the subjects discussed,and the duration of the interrogation,all of which counterac t the coercive pressures of the custodial setting.id.at.
the admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under miranda on whether his right to cut off questioning was scrupulously honored.id.at.in making that determination,courts must consider the totality of the circumstances.united states barone,cir.
the question presented here is whether the defendant freely initiated further communications with law enforcement and the subsequent questioning was therefore lawful or whether he was improperly coerced or pressured into making those communications.as noted,defendant initially stated that he did not wish to answer any questions.agent walker then sat silently in the room with him.approximately five minutes later,he requested a drink.at some point shortly thereafter,he asked agent walker what was going on.that question led to further discussions,and in turn to a second miranda warning and the subsequent interrogation.under the circumstances,we conclude that defendant initiated further communication of his own free will,without undue coercion or pressure,and that therefore subsequent interr
