hasan simmons appeals from a judgment of conviction,following a jury trial,for the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g,and a sentence of imprisonment,entered by the united states district court for the southern district of new york hellerstein.simmons appeals the district court denial of his motion to suppress evidence of his possession of two firearms the district court decision to excuse a juror during the jury deliberations,after which the remaining eleven jurors returned a verdict of guilty and the district court sentence.we find that the police officers,responding to a radio dispatch based on an emergency call that reported an assault in progress possibly involving a firearm,had reasonable suspicion to stop and to search simmons.we therefore affirm the district court denial of simmons motion to suppress the firearms.we also affirm the district court decision to excuse a juror pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure b.in light of our decision in united states darden,cir,we remand to the district court for resentencing.
background 
factual background 
the following facts are based on the evidentiary hearing held by the district court.on november,at approximately,new york police department nypd officer hugh mchugh and nypd detective robert dipaola,while on patrol in a squad car,received a radio dispatch informing them that an assault,possibly with a weapon,was in progress at a nearby apartment building.the dispatch was based on a call from an anonymous caller.the dispatcher stated receiving a with a weapon at prospect there is a possible gun involved,of a male black,wearing a grey hoody,black jacket.the officers understood a as code referring to an assault in progress.
the officers arrived at prospect avenue approximately two minutes after receiving the dispatch.officer mchugh testified that prospect avenue is located in a neighborhood that has a problem with drugs,shots fired,and a gang presence.when the officers arrived,they saw a group of people outside the apartment building,and asked whether anyone was being beaten up,to which the group answered no.mchugh did not see anyone being assaulted and did not see evidence that an assault had occurred.mchugh then approached the front entrance of the building,and looked through the window.mchugh saw three individuals inside the lobby,one of whom was simmons.simmons,a black male,was wearing a gray,hooded sweatshirt and a black jacket.there was no indication from the officers initial observations that simmons was engaged in an assault in progress.
mchugh called to dipaolo and the two officers entered the building.as the officers entered through the vestibule separating the lobby and the front entrance of the building,simmons began walking toward them with his hands in his jacket pockets.mchugh ordered simmons to hold on a second but simmons continued walking.mchugh again ordered simmons to hold on a second,and simmons stopped.mchugh then told simmons to remove his hands from his pockets.simmons did not remove his hands.mchugh asked a second time that simmons remove his hands,and simmons again did not comply.mchugh then grabbed over to simmons right side where he felt the butt of a gun,and told dipaola,he packing.the officers searched simmons and recovered two loaded firearms,one from each of simmons jacket pockets.simmons was arrested.
ii.the district court proceedings 
simmons was charged as a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.prior to the commencement of trial,simmons filed a motion to suppress evidence of the firearms on the ground that the officers violated his fourth amendment rights.the district court denied the motion,finding that simmons was seized for fourth amendment purposes at the time he complied with mchugh second order to stop,and that the officers had reasonable suspicion that simmons was engaged in criminal activity when he complied with the second order to stop.the court found reasonable suspicion o n the basis of the anonymous tip reporting an assault in progress,the time of night,the number of people gathered in front of the building and in the lobby at,and simmons positioning of his hands inside his jacket pockets.the court also found that,when simmons refused to remove his hands from his pockets,the officer simmons reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference in the first place.
simmons trial commenced on march.the jury began its deliberations at on march.during its deliberations,on march and,the jury twice requested that the court repeat the reasonable doubt instruction,and submitted a note to the court that said,w e can not come to a unanimous decision,to which the court instructed the jury to continue with its deliberations.the jury did not deliberate on friday,march,and returned to deliberate on monday,march.when the jury returned on march,juror was not present.the district court informed the parties that juror has reported unable to come today because her child is ill.on the record,the district court asked the clerk,anything more that you know the clerk responded,no.i spoke to her and i told her that i would call her back to let her know what we going to do.
the district court then had a colloquy with the parties as to whether the juror should be excused for just cause pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure b.simmons counsel objected to excusing the juror due to the lack of information regarding the juror anticipated length of absence,and because the course of deliberations suggested that there was a split jury.the government favored dismissal due to the shortness of the case and the narrow issues presented to the jury.the district court ultimately excused juror because of the quality of the trial and because of the indivisible nature of justice.the court also explained its interest in avoiding inconvenience to the other jurors,including one juror who previously indicated that protracted jury service would cause her financial hardship.
the district court informed the jury that juror was excused and instructed the jury to continue with deliberations.about a later,the district court was informed that the jury had reached a verdict.given the brief period of time between the dismissal of the juror and the jury reaching its verdict,simmons counsel requested that the court hold the verdict and allow juror to return.the court denied the request,noting that when juror was excused,it was unknown whether juror had come to a view or had not come to a view,how she was then voting,if the jury was taking votes or likely to vote.we knew nothing.the jury was called into the courtroom,and returned a verdict of guilty.
on november,the district court held a sentencing hearing.the district court ruled that the armed career criminal act,e,did not apply to simmons,and it therefore should have applied the statutory maximum pursuant to a.however,the district court sentenced simmons to imprisonment.in a letter dated november,and received by the district court on november,simmons requested that the district court reduce his sentence since imprisonment exceeded the statutory maximum provided in a.on december,the district court issued an order that recognized simmons was sentenced above the statutory maximum in error,but found that the period for reducing a sentence had elasped.see.a.the district court,therefore,instructed the parties to bring its order recognizing the error to the attention of the court of appeals.the parties now agree that we must remand to the district court for resentencing if the conviction is affirmed

standard of review 
the existence of reasonable suspicion to support a stop is a mixed question of law and fact that is reviewed de novo.united states singh,cir.the district court factual findings on a motion to suppress are reviewed for clear error.id.
ii.the terry stop of simmons 
anonymous tips and ongoing emergencies 
simmons argues that the nypd officers lacked reasonable suspicion to stop him based on an uncorroborated,anonymous call.in terry ohio,the supreme court held 
where a police officer observes unusual conduct which leads him reasonably to conclude in light of his experience that criminal activity may be afoot and that the persons with whom he is dealing may be armed and presently dangerous,where in the course of investigating this behavior he identifies himself as a policeman and makes reasonable inquiries,and where nothing in the initial stages of the encounter serves to dispel his reasonable fear for his own or others safety,he is entitled for the protection of himself and others in the area to conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing of such persons in an attempt to discover weapons which might be used to assault him.
d.in reviewing the reasonableness of a terry stop,we ask whether there was a particularized and objective basis for suspicion of legal wrongdoing under the totality of the circumstances.united states arvizu,d quoting united states cortez,d.
simmons argument relies on the supreme court decision in florida,d.in,the supreme court considered whether an anonymous tip that a person is carrying a gun is,without more,sufficient to justify a police officer stop and frisk of that person.id.at.an anonymous caller had reported to police that a young black male standing at a particular bus stop and wearing a plaid shirt was carrying a gun.id.there was no audio recording of the tip,and nothing was known about the informant.id.when police responding to the call encountered three black males at the bus stop,one of whom was wearing a plaid shirt,the officers stopped and frisked them,and discovered a gun on the black male in the plaid shirt.id.
the court explained that there are situations in which an anonymous tip,suitably corroborated,exhibits sufficient indicia of reliability to provide reasonable suspicion to make the investigatory stop.id.at.quoting alabama white,d.the court found,however,that the anonymous tip in lacked sufficient reliability.the problem with the officers actions in was that they stopped and searched based solely on the the bare report of an unknown,unaccountable informant who neither explained how he knew about the gun nor supplied any basis for believing he had inside information about id.at.
simmons contends that the anonymous tip here was similarly lacking in reliability because the officers never confirmed that an assault had occurred,and the officers observation that simmons race,clothing,and presence at the apartment building matched the information provided by the tip was insufficient to justify the terry stop.in,the court specifically rejected the government argument that a stop and frisk is permissible when an anonymous tip provides a description of a particular person at a particular location illegally carrying a concealed firearm,police promptly verify the pertinent details of the tip except the existence of the firearm,and there are no factors that cast doubt on the reliability of the tip.id.quotation marks omitted.the court reasoned 
an accurate description of a subject readily observable location and appearance is of course reliable in this limited sense it will help the police correctly identify the person whom the tipster means to accuse.such a tip,however,does not show that the tipster has knowledge of concealed criminal activity.the reasonable suspicion here at issue requires that a tip be reliable in its assertion of illegality,not just in its tendency to identify a determinate person.
id.at.see also id.at.distinguishing the reliable tip in white,at,where police confirmed the tipster accurate prediction of the future movements of the suspect.simmons concludes that compels suppression here because the officers investigative stop was based on an uncorroborated,anonymous tip.
the anonymous call in this case,however,reported an assault with a weapon in progress,unlike the tip in which reported the simple possession of a firearm.the court in noted that t he facts of this case do not require us to speculate about the circumstances under which the danger alleged in an anonymous tip might be so great as to justify a search even without a showing of reliability.id.at.several circuit courts drawing from this language have distinguished when the tip is not one of general criminality,but of an ongoing emergency.united states hicks,cir collecting cases see also united states brown,cir call reporting a man who entered an apartment brandishing a gun and threatening the tenant united states elston,cir call reporting a drunk driver who had recently left the caller home and threatened to use a firearm in his possession in the future united states,cir caller had been threatened by the suspect with a firearm united states holloway,cir warrantless search of a home was upheld based on a call that reported hearing gunshots at the residence.these cases have found that a tip reporting an ongoing emergency,as opposed to the general criminality at issue in,is entitled to a higher degree of reliability.
we have not had occasion in a criminal case to address whether an anonymous tip that reports an ongoing emergency is entitled to greater reliability than one alleging general criminality.however,in anthony city of new york,we considered a civil rights case that challenged,inter alia,the warrantless entry of police into a home based on an anonymous caller allegation that she was being attacked by a man with a knife and a gun,cir.we affirmed summary judgment for police officers,although the officers discovered no evidence of an assault,on the ground that their warrantless entry into the home was justified by exigent circumstances.id.at.any concern with the reliability of an uncorroborated,anonymous tip was not implicated where the caller expressed an immediate risk of harm to herself,and where the address from which the call was placed was verified.id.
we agree with our sister circuits that an anonymous call reporting an ongoing emergency is entitled to a higher degree of reliability and requires a lesser showing of corroboration than a tip that alleges general criminality.see also united states elmore,cir recognizing that it is useful to think of known reliability and corroboration as a sliding scale.the higher degree of reliability is rooted in the special reliability inherent in reports of ongoing emergencies.hicks,at.given the greater reliability of an emergency call,the requisite level of corroboration is lower.see id.at see also white,at.i f a tip has a relatively low degree of reliability,more information will be required to establish the requisite quantum of suspicion than would be required if the tip were more reliable.this approach recognizes the need for police to act on reports of an emergency situation without delay,see,at,but still requires police officers to corroborate allegations of criminal activity in some meaningful way.the basic requirement remains that an investigative stop must be predicated on reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.see terry,at.
b.the seizure 
a terry stop must be justified at its inception.id.at.a seizure occurs when a person obeys a police officer order to stop or a person that does not submit to an officer show of authority is physically restrained.united states swindle,cir.the district court found that simmons was seized when he complied with officer mchugh second order to stop.we agree for the reasons set forth below.
a police officer order to stop constitutes a seizure if a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave,united states mendenhall,d,and the person complies with the officer order to stop,swindle,at.as the officers entered the building,officer mchugh twice ordered simmons to stop and simmons complied with the second order to stop.the officers were then standing between simmons and the doorway to the building,and mchugh testified that simmons was not free to leave.the totality of the circumstances demonstrate that simmons was seized the moment that he complied with the second order to stop.
the government contends,assuming that simmons was seized when he complied with the second order to stop,that we may still consider simmons refusal to remove his hands from his pockets in reviewing whether the officers had reasonable suspicion for the initial stop.the government points to swindle where we found that supreme court precedent strongly implies that an unreasonable order to stop does not violate the fourth amendment and that the grounds for a stop may thus be based on events that occur after the order to stop is given.at discussing the rule from hodari,at.in our view,the government argument that simmons refusal to remove his hands is relevant to the reasonableness of the initial stop rests on a misapplication of the rule from hodari,as we explained that rule in swindle.
as we noted in swindle,in hodari,the supreme court assumed that police pursuit of the defendant was a show of authority,and although the officers lacked reasonable suspicion when they initially pursued the fleeing defendant,the court determined that since hodari did not comply with that injunction and was not seized until he was tackled,the cocaine abandoned while he was running was not the fruit of a seizure.id.quoting hodari,at.alterations omitted.similarly,in swindle itself,we found that police officers unreasonably ordered the defendant to stop based on his entry into a drug house,but that the defendant was not seized when police attempted to pull over his vehicle because the defendant did not stop the vehicle,proceeded to break several traffic laws,and threw a plastic bag containing cocaine from the vehicle.the cocaine was not the fruit of a fourth amendment seizure because the suspect discarded the drugs before he had been physically apprehended or submitted to police authority.id.at see also united states muhammad,cir the suspect who attempted to flee police on a bicycle was not seized until physically restrained by police,and thus the attempt to flee was relevant to the determination of reasonable suspicion for the seizure.
hodari,swindle,and muhammad are distinguishable from this case.the rule from hodari the grounds for a stop may be based on events that occur after the order to stop is given,swindle,at been applied only in cases where the suspect attempts to flee from police after being ordered to stop.hodari,swindle,and muhammad all involved a police show of authority,a defendant who refused to comply by fleeing,police pursuit,and a seizure occurring at the moment the defendant was physically restrained.hodari at.muhammad,at swindle,at.the facts of this case,by contrast,involve an order to stop,compliance with that order,and a seizure at the moment simmons complied with the order the arguably suspicious refusal to remove his hands came after he obeyed the order to stop.
the grounds for a stop must exist at the time of the seizure.see swindle,at.the rule from hodari is based on the settled requirement that reasonable suspicion must arise before a search or seizure is actually effected.id.at emphasis added.flight in response to an order to stop is relevant to the reasonableness of a stop because it precedes the seizure,which occurs when the fleeing suspect is physically apprehended.see hodari at.muhammad,at swindle,at see also united states baldwin,cir holding that a suspect is not seized when he halt s temporarily in response to an order to stop and then flees.conversely,a person compliance with an officer order to stop where a reasonable person would not feel free to leave is a seizure,and sets the point in time for evaluating the presence of reasonable suspicion for the stop.see swindle,at.
simmons was seized when he obeyed the officer second order to stop.see baldwin,at a reasonable person standing in the defendant place would have felt bound to stop,and having stopped and stayed,would be able to argue suppression on the ground of a baseless seizure.the events that occurred after simmons complied,therefore,do not factor into the analysis of reasonable suspicion for the initial stop.see united states brown,cir finding the defendant submitted to police authority when he complied with an officer order to stop and was informed that a robbery victim was coming to identify him as a possible suspect,even though he later struggled when the officer attempted to perform a patdown search.we inquire whether there was reasonable suspicion at the time of simmons wit,when he complied with the officer second order to stop.
reasonable suspicion 
here,while the case is close,we find that the officers had reasonable suspicion for the stop of simmons.responding to a dispatch that communicated the caller report of an assault in progress,possibly involving a weapon the officers,despite not finding evidence of an assault in progress,confirmed that simmons appearance matched the description of the suspect and that simmons was present at the specified location.the officers corroboration of information identifying the suspect,while insufficient in,at,is entitled to more weighty consideration in the context of an emergency call.this follows from our holding that a call reporting an ongoing emergency is accorded a higher degree of reliability and requires a lesser showing of corroboration.we need not determine whether the corroboration of information from an emergency call that identifies the suspect is,without more,sufficient to provide reasonable suspicion because,in this case,there were additional factors that supported the stop.
it is a relevant consideration,though by no means dispositive,that the officers,upon arrival,encountered simmons along with a gathering of people at the apartment building,late at night,and in a area.see illinois wardlow,d.officer mchugh did not observe any threatening behavior by simmons.yet,as the officers entered the building,simmons was walking toward them with his hands in his pockets.see united states padilla,cir noting that conduct as consistent with innocence as with guilt may support a finding of reasonable suspicion where there exists an indication of possible illicit activity see also terry,at.explaining that acts which are not inherently suspicious can taken together warrant further investigation.this conduct could have suggested to the officers that simmons was concealing a weapon,especially since the dispatcher reported that the suspect may have perpetrated an assault with a weapon based on information in the call.although a n individual approached by an officer who has no reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing may ignore the officer and go about his business without triggering reasonable suspicion,muhammad,at,simmons with the first order to stop,when viewed in light of the circumstances,reinforced the officers determination that he may have been engaged in criminal activity.swindle,at the grounds for a stop may be based on events before the seizure.in the context of the emergency call here,the totality of circumstances support the conclusion that the officers had reasonable suspicion to stop simmons.
the next question is whether the officers had reasonable suspicion to frisk simmons.see arizona johnson,d describing the two conditions for a constitutional terry stop and frisk the officer has reasonable suspicion that the person apprehended is committing or has committed a criminal offense and to proceed from a stop to a frisk,the police officer must reasonably suspect that the person stopped is armed and dangerous see also adams williams,d stating that a patdown is justified when an officer reasonably believes that a suspect is armed and dangerous because it allow s the officer to pursue his investigation without fear of violence.the officers,after initiating the stop,twice ordered that simmons remove his hands from his pockets,which he refused to do.the report of an assault in progress,the matching description,and the additional factors that supported the stop provided the officers with reason to believe that simmons was armed and dangerous,and that the refusal to remove his hands was an effort to conceal a weapon.accordingly,the officer conducting the patdown search was warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.terry,at.
simmons refusal to remove his hands is unlike the mere refusal to cooperate,that without more,does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for a detention or seizure.florida bostick,d.as explained,the factors supporting the stop were
