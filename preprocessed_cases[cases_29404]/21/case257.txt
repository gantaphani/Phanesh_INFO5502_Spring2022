joe suárez gonzález pleaded guilty to an array of counts,spread over two separate indictments,involving the theft conversion of postal money orders from the united states postal service usps.the district court sentenced him to serve months in prison.the appellant challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.the first of these challenges presents a question of first impression with respect to the interpretation of a guideline enhancement provision,ussg b a.finding both his procedural and substantive challenges unavailing,we affirm.
background 
because these appeals trail in the wake of guilty pleas,we glean the facts from the plea agreements,the colloquy,the uncontested portions of the presentence investigation report psi report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states nguyen,cir.
in the fall of,the appellant was employed as a construction worker in connection with the remodeling of a postal station in san juan,puerto rico the facility.while toiling there,he stole and cashed four usps money orders.he then filched a key to the facility and gave it to a confederate santiago peña.using this key,peña surreptitiously entered the facility and,acting on the appellant instructions,printed bogus usps money orders.the pair later arranged for others to go to post offices in the area and cash the money orders.
this scheme unraveled after postal inspectors received a tip about an attempt to redeem a suspicious money order.the ensuing investigation produced two indictments.after initially maintaining his innocence,the appellant elected to plead guilty to counts,spread over both indictments,of aiding and abetting others in stealing or knowingly converting postal money orders.see.
the plea agreement referable to the first of the two indictments suggested some preliminary guideline calculations a base offense level of nine,see ussg a a enhancement for loss in excess of but not more than,see id.b b and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see id.a.if the appellant criminal history score placed him in criminal history category chc i,the guideline sentencing range gsr was estimated to be eight to fourteen months.
the plea agreement referable to the second indictment also suggested a series of preliminary guideline calculations a base offense level of nine,see id.a a enhancement for loss in excess of but not more than,see id.b b and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see id.a.if the appellant criminal history score placed him in chc i,the gsr was estimated to be twelve to eighteen months.
both plea agreements permitted the appellant to request,without opposition from the government,a split sentence that is,a sentence to be served partly in prison and partly in home confinement.moreover,the government stipulated that it would not oppose concurrent sentences.
the district court accepted the appellant guilty pleas at an omnibus hearing.at the conclusion of this hearing,the court ordered the preparation of a psi report.when received,the psi report treated the two indictments as a unit and grouped all of the counts of conviction for a combined offense level of nine.see id.d.it then recommended an enhancement for an aggregate monetary loss above but not more than,see id.b b,and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see id.b.it likewise recommended a enhancement under ussg.b a because the appellant possessed or had custody of or control over a counterfeiting device or materials used for counterfeiting.finally,it tabulated the appellant criminal history score and recommended that he be placed in chc ii.
at sentencing,the district court embraced the grouping concept and the offense level adjustments.however,the court calculated the appellant criminal history score more charitably and placed him in chc i.these determinations yielded a gsr of to months,and the court imposed a incarcerative sentence.these timely appeals ensued.
ii.analysis 
in this venue,the appellant claims that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.we proceed directly to these arguments,bypassing the government problematic contention that these appeals are barred by the provision contained in each of the appellant plea agreements.see united states pérez crespo,app x,cir adopting a similar approach.
a.the procedural claims.
the appellant argues that his sentence is procedurally flawed for two reasons.we address these arguments separately.
ussg b a.the appellant concedes the correctness of all but one of the district court guideline calculations.he challenges only the enhancement under ussg b a.
by its terms,this enhancement applies to a defendant who has manufactured or produced any counterfeit obligation of the united states,or possessed or had custody of or control over a counterfeiting device or materials used for counterfeiting.ussg b a.the appellant says that he did not use a counterfeiting device.rather,the postal money orders at issue here were genuine that is,printed with conventional usps equipment on authentic postal money order blanks.therefore,the enhancement does not pertain.
we review the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo.see united states clark,cir.here,the appellant argument turns on the meaning of counterfeiting device.as is true of the interpretation of statutes,the language of a guideline provision furnishes the most reliable guide to its interpretation.see united states dixon,cir.when the language of the guideline is plain and unambiguous,that is the end of the matter.see id.at.if,however,the language of the guideline leaves legitimate room for doubt,an inquiring court may look to other interpretive aids,including context and background.see united states alvarez cuevas,cir.
we think that the term counterfeiting device has a plain,ordinary,and unambiguous meaning a device used for counterfeiting.while the guidelines do not define this term,the sentencing commission has explicitly defined a counterfeit as an instrument that has been falsely made,manufactured,or altered.ussg,comment.in turn,alter means t o make a change in to modify to vary in some degree to change some of the elements or ingredients or details without substituting an entirely new thing or destroying the identity of the thing affected.black law dictionary ed.
this definition of counterfeit informs the meaning of the term counterfeiting device.by arranging for the printing of fake dollar amounts on otherwise worthless money order blanks,the appellant altered those blanks and this alteration was accomplished through the use of a machine.taken at face value,the appellant actions comprise alteration of postal money orders through the use of a mechanical counterfeiting device.no more is exigible to warrant application of the enhancement.
the appellant rejoins that the word alter in the counterfeiting context is a term of art.he notes that the definition of counterfeit was added to the sentencing guidelines in,see ussg app.c,amend,and that prior to that time the term was undefined.he correctly points out that the addition of the definition was intended to resolve differing judicial treatment of bleached note cases cases in which defendants chemically stripped genuine united states currency and reprinted it with higher values.see compare,united states schreckengost,cir,with,united states dison,wl,at.the new definition made pellucid that bleached note schemes would qualify as counterfeiting because such schemes involved the false alteration of genuine monetary instruments.
building on this foundation,the appellant insists that the word alter is meant to apply exclusively to the bleached note context.but this reading is far too crabbed.although part of the impetus for the amendment was to clarify that bleached note cases are subject to the enhancement under b a,the language of the amendment was in no way limited to such cases.to the contrary,the sentencing commission stated unreservedly that the new definition was meant to insure that altered instruments are treated as counterfeit and sentenced under.ussg app.c,amend.the appellant offenses plainly involved altered instruments.
