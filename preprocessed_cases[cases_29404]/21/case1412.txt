this appeal stems from the defendants convictions in the united states district court for the district of connecticut underhill,for their participation in a cocaine trafficking conspiracy.the indictment charged rodriguez with being a major supplier of cocaine to a danbury,connecticut drug distribution network from to,and charged ramirez with similar conduct from to.ultimately,rodriguez was convicted of conspiracy to distribute kilograms of cocaine or grams of cocaine base,and ramirez for grams of cocaine or grams of cocaine base.see a,b.
on appeal,rodriguez challenges his conviction on two separate grounds,while ramirez challenges his sentence.rodriguez argues that two rebuttal officer waldo cuba and maria not have been permitted to testify about collateral matters,and that their testimony severely prejudiced his defense.he also complains that the bill of particulars filed by the government on the eve of trial was inadequate,and that the indictment should have been dismissed.ramirez,for his part,claims that the sentencing judge improperly found him responsible for kilograms of cocaine,resulting in a sentence,after the jury expressly rejected such a large drug quantity in its special interrogatory responses.thus,according to ramirez,the district court improperly relied on acquitted conduct to establish drug quantity at sentencing.
we find that the district court erred in admitting officer cuba testimony to impeach rodriguez.nonetheless,we affirm his conviction,ultimately finding this error harmless.because we reject rodriguez other claims,as well as ramirez sentencing challenge,the defendants convictions and sentences are affirmed.
background 
the defendants were charged and convicted for their roles in a drug distribution conspiracy involving the weekly transport of cocaine from brooklyn,new york to danbury,connecticut.jos√© adames also known as pompa or ponpa led the trafficking operation.from to,rodriguez was alleged to be adames driver for many of the trips to danbury,where the drugs were purchased for resale by alex luna,another.ramirez,in his role,also often accompanied adames to connecticut,and was responsible for supplying and distributing cocaine in brooklyn over an even longer period.
rodriguez was arrested in massachusetts and,according to the testimony of one of the arresting officers,confessed to his role in the conspiracy while being transported back to connecticut for prosecution.at trial,the government also offered the testimony of three other who described rodriguez involvement with adames,luna,and ramirez in regular cocaine transactions.finally,the government presented video surveillance of rodriguez meeting with adames and luna in danbury,although the video did not show any drugs changing hands.
rodriguez testified in his own defense.he foreswore any knowing involvement in the narcotics conspiracy and denied the alleged confession.instead,he claimed that,although he had acted as adames driver over a period of years,he had no knowledge of any drug transactions.according to rodriguez,he came to know adames socially,through friends and family when rodriguez later lost his job,adames began to ask rodriguez to drive him places,including danbury,to visit relatives.rodriguez testified that he never saw or knew of any cocaine on these trips.because he was without work,rodriguez says he continued to chaffeur adames periodically until late when rodriguez mother warned him that adames was thought to be involved with drugs.rodriguez claims that he confronted adames about these rumors and,although they were denied,that he subsequently distanced himself from adames.
the government sought to undermine rodriguez defense by,among other things,him about his contact with drugs during this period.relying on rodriguez denial of any involvement with cocaine on both direct and,the government also sought to introduce the rebuttal testimony of police officer waldo cuba and alex luna girlfriend,maria robles.in particular,officer cuba reported seeing rodriguez handling cocaine during an unrelated drug stop shortly after the conspiracy had ended.robles,for her part,testified about rodriguez involvement with drug trafficking during the indicted period.the trial court acknowledged that this testimony had the potential to be extremely damaging nonetheless,over rodriguez objections,it admitted the testimony of both witnesses.
ultimately,the jury convicted each defendant of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine,in violation of.rodriguez was subsequently sentenced to months imprisonment,while ramirez was sentenced to months imprisonment.

admission of impeachment testimony 
rodriguez claims that the district court erred when it permitted the rebuttal testimony of cuba and robles.the testimony of both witnesses was offered to prove that rodriguez had had previous contact with drugs,thereby impeaching his statements to the contrary as well as his overall credibility.officer cuba provided testimony describing rodriguez involvement in a separate stop in queens on march.importantly,this stop occurred after the period of the charged conspiracy and,in fact,after adames had already been arrested.cuba testified that,while posted with the special narcotics enforcement unit,he had seen rodriguez outside a vehicle placing what appeared to be plastic bags of cocaine into a small plastic box.cuba subsequently followed the vehicle and radioed his fellow officers,who pulled rodriguez over and arrested the suv two occupants.the arrest report indicates that rodriguez later received an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal acd and that all records relating to the incident were sealed.in view of this fact,the prosecution was unable to account for how it had received a copy of the sealed arrest report,claiming that it mysteriously arrived by fax with no identifiable source.
in her testimony,maria robles,briefly described a conversation with rodriguez while the conspiracy was ongoing,in which he recounted swallowing balloons of cocaine in order to smuggle them into the country from the dominican republic.she also reported seeing rodriguez accompany adames on drug deliveries to danbury on a weekly basis,and stated that rodriguez had made deliveries alone on two or three occasions.
standard of review 
in general,we will not overturn the district court decision to admit or reject evidence absent an abuse of discretion.see united states esdaille,cir.even if we conclude that the admission of the rebuttal testimony here was in error,the government contends that any such error was harmless.see.a united states madori,cir.broadly speaking,the erroneous admission of evidence is harmless where it had no substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury verdict,judged in relation to the total evidence on the issue in question.united states garcia,cir quotation marks omitted.
generally,the federal rules of evidence bar the admission of extrinsic evidence,like officer cuba testimony,related to the past conduct of a witness.the government concedes as much,acknowledging that the testimony related to an entirely collateral matter and did not serve as proof of the charged offense.indeed,because rodriguez march,arrest occurred after the end of the indicted conspiracy,officer cuba rebuttal testimony would normally have been precluded by federal rule of evidence b,which prohibits extrinsic evidence of exactly this kind.nonetheless,the government argues that this evidence was admissible for the purpose of impeachment by contradiction,which operates as a limited exception to rule b.where a defendant testifies on direct about a specific fact,the prosecution is entitled to prove that he lied as to that fact.united states beverly,cir permitting use of extrinsic evidence.more precisely,this doctrine provides that when a witness puts certain facts at issue in his testimony,the government may seek to rebut those facts,including by resorting to extrinsic evidence if necessary.according to the government,the point of this exception is that a defendant may not invoke the federal rules of evidence in order to shield his perjury from contradiction.
the government contends that rodriguez statements on both direct and triggered the exception,but the trial record simply does not bear out this rationale.it is an open question in our court whether the government can present extrinsic evidence to impeach by contradiction a statement made by the defendant on,where such evidence would otherwise be barred by the federal rules of evidence we need not resolve this question because,as a factual matter,officer cuba did not impeach either rodriguez testimony on direct examination or his responses on.
by highlighting rodriguez unrelated stop while in possession of cocaine,officer cuba rebuttal testimony was purportedly offered to impeach rodriguez statements that he had never seen or handled drugs.yet rodriguez never gave the testimony that the government ascribes to him.the transcript is pellucid that on both direct and,rodriguez was responding to a series of questions about his work for adames and the covered by the alleged conspiracy.for instance,at the end of a lengthy colloquy focused on adames activities from to,defense counsel asked rodriguez 
def.counsel during the time that you were just describing,did you see any deliveries of drugs of any kind 
rodriguez no,i never see no drugs.
gov t app x at emphasis added.the government pins its rebuttal claim on this testimony,yet it is abundantly clear from the context that rodriguez was not issuing a blanket denial of ever having seen drugs.
the very same is true of rodriguez testimony,where he was asked about his activities during the charged conspiracy 
gov t rodriguez,you claiming you never saw any drugs in this whole time period,correct 
rodriguez no,never.
gov t except for marijuana.you saw marijuana,right 
rodriguez yes.
gov t okay,but you never saw cocaine 
rodriguez no.
gov t app x at emphasis added.the government points to no instances where rodriguez forswore,as a universal matter,ever having seen drugs of any kind.compare walder united states.nor did his reference to having had a little problem before provide a predicate for admitting officer cuba testimony about the arrest.the government contends that this little problem referred to the drug stop,which opened the door to its rebuttal testimony.but reading rodriguez statement in context,again,makes clear that he was referring to an earlier he allegedly decided to distance himself from an arrest that occurred after the conspiracy conclusion y ou know,i do want to get no more trouble,so i think mom was right at that time.most of all,none of these statements show that rodriguez staked his credibility before the jury on any expansive assertion about lifelong avoidance of drugs.indeed,the government inaccurately characterizes the trial record when it suggests as much.
as a result,we see no basis for admitting officer cuba testimony under the impeachment by contradiction doctrine and conclude that it should have been barred by federal rule of evidence b.on the other hand,we sustain the district court admission of maria robles testimony.that rodriguez transport and delivery of to the charged conspiracy,and contradicted rodriguez statement on direct examination that he had no contact with drugs during the relevant period.we can not say that the admission of this evidence was an abuse of discretion.
harmless error 
a district court erroneous admission of evidence is harmless if the appellate court can conclude with fair assurance that the evidence did not substantially influence the jury.united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in reviewing for harmless error,we principally consider the overall strength of the prosecution case the prosecutor conduct with respect to the improperly admitted evidence the importance of the wrongly admitted evidence and whether such evidence was cumulative of other properly admitted evidence.united states kaplan,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we have frequently stated that the strength of the government case is the most critical factor in assessing whether error was harmless.see,united states lombardozzi,cir.
there is no question that a police officer testimony about a previous unrelated drug stop can prove extremely damaging to a defendant at trial.it functions essentially as evidence of criminal propensity and presents exactly the risk of undue prejudice that the federal rules of evidence are designed to guard against.we do not treat the erroneous admission of such evidence lightly,and we weigh its effect on the jury carefully.united states mccallum,cir in a different case,in which the government other evidence was not overwhelming,or where the other harmless error factors tilted more strongly in the defendant favor,or where the government summation emphasized the prior misconduct,a different result could well be indicated.
even with these precautions,we conclude that the government evidence was sufficiently conclusive and its case sufficiently robust such that the error in rodriguez case was harmless.the government introduced a series of who testified to rodriguez knowing involvement in the cocaine trafficking operation.nelson rosa testified about cocaine deliveries rodriguez made to him in danbury,about money that rodriguez received from alex luna in exchange for drugs,about how rodriguez would retrieve cocaine from the vehicle he drove for adames,and about how rodriguez helped adames cook cocaine into crack.
jos√© pena provided similar testimony,describing rodriguez role as a driver who would often bring down the merchandise,and who was frequently present when adames discussed cocaine sales or handed off drugs hidden in the car secret compartment.nicky carrasquillo recounted for the jury how rodriguez accompanied adames on repeated drug deliveries,and how he too had witnessed rodriguez and adames removing drugs from secret compartments in two vehicles.he also described seeing rodriguez compressing cocaine at adames is,mixing relatively pure cocaine with other substances in order to increase the overall resale profits.finally,maria robles,another cooperating,testified to seeing rodriguez and adames deliver cocaine,approximately one kilogram at a time,to her boyfriend alex luna on a weekly basis.she also told the jury that rodriguez and adames once ran luna drug business in danbury while she and luna vacationed in the dominican republic.
in addition to these witnesses,the prosecution called special agent rodney george,who described statements rodriguez made shortly after his arrest.according to this testimony,rodriguez confessed to his involvement in adames drug trafficking operation while he was transported from boston,where he was arrested,to connecticut.as he rode with agent george,rodriguez allegedly told him how he had become aware of adames cocaine trafficking,had met adames supplier,and had driven adames to make frequent deliveries in danbury.
lastly,the government produced video surveillance of rodriguez and adames meeting luna in danbury.this surveillance showed the three men arriving in a parking lot,warily surveying their surroundings,and then proceeding into an apartment.while the footage,taken outside,does not show any drugs changing hands,the meeting followed a phone call in which luna asked adames to deliver grams of cocaine.
together,all this evidence is at odds with rodriguez claim that,although he frequently drove adames to danbury for a period of years,he knew nothing of adames drug trafficking activities.needless to say,given the scale and frequency of adames cocaine deliveries to luna,such a defense strains belief.based on the strength of the government evidence to the contrary,and the many witnesses who testified to rodriguez knowing involvement,we conclude that the erroneous admission of agent cuba rebuttal testimony was harmless.
bill of particulars 
we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that the government submission in response to the district court order for a bill of particulars was sufficient.the district court granted rodriguez motion for a bill of particulars,and in response,the government submitted a summary of the evidence that it intended to introduce at trial.although the government submission did not t
