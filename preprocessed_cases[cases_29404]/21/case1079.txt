jos√© pled guilty to two counts of delivering adulterated milk into interstate commerce in violation of the federal food,drug and cosmetic act,a,a,and.the district court sentenced him to eighteen months imprisonment followed by two years supervised release,and ordered him to pay a special assessment.we have jurisdiction of his appeal pursuant to and a,and affirm.
factual background 
defendant was a dairy farmer in arecibo,puerto rico,engaged in the commercial production of milk.on at least five occasions over a period,defendant,together with delivery truck drivers,participated in a scheme to add water and salt to the milk produced at his farm.the adulterated milk was then delivered to a processing plant.the water was added to increase the amount of milk sold and salt was added to mask the addition of water and avoid detection of the adulterated milk at the processing plant.defendant furnished the water and salt and paid the truck drivers.defendant and the truck drivers used contaminated water and filthy hoses.the drivers transported the milk to the processing plant silos,where it became mixed with other milk delivered to the plant and where it was processed for distribution in puerto rico and the continental united states.as a result of the scheme defendant was paid for the increased amount of milk delivered.had the adulteration been discovered,however,it would have been considered worthless and been discarded.the addition of the adulterated milk to the contents of the silos,moreover,created a clear health risk to consumers.
discussion 
failure to continue the sentencing hearing 
defendant contends that he was denied due process because the district court failed to continue the sentencing hearing,even though the presentence report psr and the addendum were not timely delivered to counsel.rule b a of the federal rules of criminal procedure requires the probation officer to furnish the psr to defendant not less than days before the sentencing hearing,unless defendant waives this minimum period there is no record of defendant having waived here,the psr was delivered approximately fourteen days before the hearing.rule b b requires that the parties within fourteen days after receiving the psr communicate any objections to each other in writing here,the government submitted its objections to the psr approximately one week before the hearing,and it failed to deliver a copy to defendant until the commencement of the hearing.finally,rule b c requires the probation officer to submit the psr with an addendum setting forth unresolved objections not later than seven days before the hearing here,defendant did not receive the addendum until four days before the hearing and appears not to have received the government objections to the psr until immediately before the hearing.
we ordinarily review the district court failure to continue the sentencing hearing for abuse of discretion.see united states,cir.defense counsel,after complaining about the late receipt of the government objection,did not claim surprise and voiced no objection to the court going forward with sentencing,much less move for a continuance.see id.stating that untimely receipt of the addendum to the psr although in violation of rule b c is insufficient standing alone to establish undue surprise.to the contrary,counsel acceded to the court wish to proceed and gave no indication of lack of preparation.
while we perceive no abuse of discretion in the court proceeding with the sentencing hearing in these circumstances,we do not mean to minimize the importance of the time limits specified in rule or turn a blind eye to the indifference to them shown by the government and the probation officer in this case.those time limits are no mere technicalities they are integral to the fair and orderly process of imposing sentence.they are mandatory and we expect compliance with them.
defendant also contends that the failure to continue the hearing and afford him more time to respond to the addendum violated his rights.absent plain error,an issue not presented to the district court can not be raised for the first time on appeal.united states chaklader,cir.even if there were error in the proceedings,the error claimed by defendant certainly did not seriously affect the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states olano,d internal quotations omitted.
defendant argues that had he timely received the addendum,he would have been prepared at sentencing to discuss the disagreement between the government and the probation officer regarding the appropriate enhancement for his leadership role.in its objections,the government argued for a enhancement for his role in the offense.rejecting this argument,the addendum stated that a enhancement would be inappropriate because there were only four participants,not five as required by sentencing guideline a.sentencing guidelines manual a.at sentencing,as discussed below,the court applied a enhancement but it did so based not on the number of participants but on defendant otherwise extensive conduct,a theory not addressed by the government or the addendum.since the arguments in the addendum turned out to be irrelevant to the court application of the enhancement,defendant failure to receive it earlier did not adversely affect counsel ability to prepare.hence,the delay did not affect the sentencing proceeding fairness,integrity or public reputation.
ii.enhancement for more than minimal planning pursuant to sentencing guidelines b a 
defendant contends that the court erred in determining that the offense involved more than minimal planning,resulting in a enhancement pursuant to sentencing guidelines b a.we review for clear error.see united states chapman,cir.more than minimal planning exists if significant affirmative steps were taken to conceal the offense or in any case involving repeated acts over a period of time,unless it is clear that each instance was purely opportune.sentencing guidelines manual,cmt.f.
the court found that defendant engaged in more than minimal planning based on his affirmative steps to conceal the offense.as defendant admitted,the sole purpose of adding the salt was to conceal the milk adulteration.moreover,defendant repeated acts,occurring over a period of seven months,can not be characterized as purely opportune.defendant had the salt ready and had prefilled the milk vats with water in preparation for the adulteration.see united states rust,cir conduct is purely opportune only if it is spur of the moment conduct,intended to take advantage of a sudden opportunity.his actions did not occur unexpectedly and without previous notice.chapman,at.we find no clear error.
iii.enhancement for being a pursuant to sentencing guidelines a 
defendant contends that the court erred in imposing a enhancement for being an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that was otherwise extensive pursuant to guideline a.we review a role in the offense determination for clear error.see united states cadavid,cir.
a court making a adjustment under guideline a must first determine whether the defendant acted as an of a specific criminal activity.if so,the court asks the separate question of whether that criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.united states,cir.
in determining whether a defendant acted as organizer or leader,the court considers,inter alia 
the exercise of decision making authority,the nature of the participation in the commission of the offense,the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense,and the nature and scope of the illegal activity.
sentencing guidelines manual,cmt.
the district court finding that defendant was the owner of the farm and without his participation there can be no adulterated milk supports its determination that he was an of the criminal activity.
in determining whether a criminal activity is otherwise extensive,the court considers the totality of the circumstances,including not only the number of participants,but also the width,breadth,scope,complexity and duration of the scheme.united states dietz,cir.participants include those who unknowingly par
