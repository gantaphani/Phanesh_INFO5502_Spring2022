background 
because arroyo maldonado pleaded guilty,our discussion of the facts is drawn from the colloquy,the pre sentence investigation report psr,and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.see united states cintrón echautegui,cir.from august to may,arroyo maldonado,while incarcerated for other charges,led a scheme to defraud financial institutions.arroyo maldonado used prepaid cell phones to contact outside the bayamón penitentiary and instructed them to prepare false checks for deposit at financial institutions in order to fraudulently purchase motor vehicles or fraudulently pay off loan accounts.after the checks were deposited,arroyo maldonado would have other acquire the vehicles at car dealerships or from individuals selling them through newspaper classified advertisements.arroyo maldonado actions were in violation of and and.
arroyo maldonado pleaded guilty on march,pursuant to a plea agreement.the parties recommended that arroyo maldonado be sentenced at the lower end of the applicable guidelines sentencing range gsr if his criminal history category was iv or higher it was later calculated to be vi.as part of the agreement,the parties stipulated to the guidelines calculations.the guidelines provided that the base offense level,pursuant to a,was seven.a increase was added pursuant to b h because the stipulated amount of loss attributed to arroyo maldonado was at least,but less than a increase was added under b a because arroyo maldonado offense involved ten or more victims and an additional increase was added because arroyo maldonado was identified as an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of a criminal activity,pursuant to c.finally,arroyo maldonado received a reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to a and b,which resulted in a total offense level of twenty.

ii.analysis 
arroyo maldonado alleges that the district court erred in imposing a sentence of one hundred and twenty months,which is above the applicable gsr.
this court review of sentencing decisions involves evaluation of both procedural and substantive reasonableness.arroyo maldonado contends that the district court committed a significant procedural error by failing to consider the relevant sentencing factors and by giving undue weight to the nature and circumstances of the offense.arroyo maldonado also argues that the district court erred procedurally by mistakenly believing that the statute he pleaded guilty to contained a mandatory minimum sentence of one hundred and twenty months.in support of this contention,he highlights a portion of the sentencing hearing where the court stated,t he court has also taken into consideration the plea agreement between the parties however,it finds that a statutory sentence at the lower end is more adequate considering his criminal history and considering his nefarious white crime incidents.arroyo maldonado avers that and contain no mandatory minimum sentence.
as to the alleged substantive errors,arroyo maldonado suggests that the district court sentence was unreasonable because it gave greater weight to his criminal history and the punitive component of a sentence than to other factors such as rehabilitation measures.furthermore,he argues that the district court sentenced him outside of the properly calculated gsr of seventy to months solely based on punitive factors,which makes the sentence substantively unreasonable.he therefore contends that the court failed to abide by its obligation under the supreme court decision in kimbrough united states,d,to impose a sentence that is sufficient,but not greater than necessary.accordingly,arroyo maldonado argues that his sentencing decision must be vacated and remanded.
we review sentencing decisions under the advisory guidelines for reasonableness,regardless of whether they fall outside or inside the applicable gsr.united states turbides leonardo,cir.typically,we review sentences imposed under the advisory guidelines for abuse of discretion.see gall united states,d united states santiago rivera,cir citing united states martin,cir.however,w hen a defendant fails to preserve an objection below,the plain error standard supplants the customary standard of review.united states fernández hernández,cir quoting united states dávila gonzález,cir.r eview for plain error entails four showings that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states medina villegas,cir quoting united states duarte,cir.for this court to reverse a district court sentence under this standard,there must be a reasonable probability that,but for the error,the district court would have imposed a different,more favorable sentence.turbides leonardo,at citing united states antonakopoulos,cir.
in reviewing sentences imposed under the advisory guidelines,t he review process is bifurcated we first determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally reasonable and then determine whether it is substantively reasonable.united states clogston,cir.examples of procedural errors identified by the supreme court include failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence including an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.gall,at.if procedurally sound,we consider the totality of the circumstances,including the extent of any variance from the guidelines,to determine whether the sentence is substantively reasonable.see id.
the district court exercises broad discretion in weighing the different sentencing factors and we remain deferential to its sentencing determinations.see united states colón rodríguez,cir see also united states vargas dávila,cir the length of an increased sentence is necessarily a judgment call and,within wide limits,deference is due to the trier perceptions.t here is not a single reasonable sentence but,rather,a range of reasonable sentences.martin,at.accordingly,w e generally respect the district court sentence as long as the court has provided a plausible explanation,and the overall result is defensible.united states innarelli,cir.
requires a sentencing court to consider a variety of potential sentences and explain in open court the reasons for a particular sentence it imposes.see medina villegas,at.when a sentencing court deviates substantially from the guidelines,it must provide a more significant justification than for a slight deviation.martin,at citing gall,at.however,a sentence outside the applicable gsr does not come to the reviewing court with a presumption of unreasonableness.gall,at.although required to explain its sentence,a sentencing court is not required to address frontally every argument advanced by the parties,nor need it dissect every factor made relevant by one by one,in some sort of rote incantation.turbides leonardo,at quoting united states dixon,cir.although we review a sentencing court explanation in open court,a court reasoning can also often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the report with what the judge did.united states jiménez beltre,cir.ultimately,t he court reasons for deviation should typically be rooted either in the nature and circumstances of the offense or the characteristics of the offender must add up to a plausible rationale and must justify a variance of the magnitude in question.martin,at.
arroyo maldonado sentence of one hundred and twenty months of imprisonment was neither procedurally flawed nor substantively unreasonable.because arroyo maldonado did not raise any objections to his sentence below,we review for plain error.fernández hernández,at citing dávila gonzález,at.the record reveals no procedural errors in the imposition of arroyo maldonado sentence.first,at the sentencing hearing,the district court correctly calculated the gsr,and acknowledged that the guidelines were only advisory.the district court also clearly stated on the record that it considered all the sentencing factors set forth in a.see santiago rivera,at noting that a judge statement that he has considered all of the a factors is entitled to significant weight.moreover,the district court explicitly referenced specific factors.for example,the district court explained that in imposing a sentence it considered the nature and circumstances of the offense and the defendant history and characteristics,see a,and that it was going to order a remedial measure,under title,a d,that he receive mental and psychological evaluation.lastly,the district court stated that the chosen sentence would be imposed in order to afford deterrence and to provide just punishment of the offense.see id.a a b.accordingly,a review of the sentencing hearing reveals that the district court sufficiently considered the a factors.see dixon,at.
furthermore,the district court adequately explained its deviation from the gsr.at the sentencing hearing,the district court explained that t he judge reacts to what is on the record.what i have on the record is a gentleman that has the worst white collar crime history that i have seen in my career.the worst.i have never had anybody who has points on white collar.a review of the psr and the sentencing hearing transcript demonstrates the district court consideration of arroyo maldonado criminal history as a significant reason for deviating above the gsr.see jiménez beltre,at noting that it is permissible to infer a court reasoning by comparing the parties arguments and the psr to what the judge actually did.ultimately,the district court reasoning for deviating above the gsr is clearly based on arroyo maldonado criminal history.see martin,at the court reasons for deviation should typically be rooted either in the nature and circumstances of the offense or the characteristics of the offender.accordingly,the district court explanation of the sentence it imposed and its reasons for deviating from the applicable gsr was sufficient and did not amount to a procedural error.
arroyo maldonado claim that the district court mistakenly believed that the statute prescribed a mandatory minimum is not supported by the record.as the government correctly notes,the district court never made any reference to a mandatory minimum throughout the sentencing hearing,while referencing the statutory maximum sentence of thirty years several times throughout the proceeding.during the hearing,the court stated that it finds that a statutory sentence at the lower end is more adequate considering his criminal history and considering his nefarious white crime incidents.this statement alone is insufficient to indicate that the district court felt constrained by a mandatory minimum sentence.furthermore,the record as a whole contains no indication that the district court mistakenly believed that it was bound by a mandatory minimum sentence.accordingly,the district court sentencing of arroyo maldonado did not suffer from any procedural flaws.therefore,we next consider whether the sentence is substantively reasonable.see gall,at.
in considering the totality of the circumstances,including the extent of the district court variance from the guidelines,the district court one hundred and twenty month sentence is substantively reasonable and therefore does not constitute plain error.arroyo maldonado argument that the district court erred substantively by giving greater weight to his criminal history and the punitive component of a sentence than to rehabilitative factors is not supported by this court precedent.see clogston,at a sentencing court is under a mandate to consider a myriad of relevant factors,but the weighting of those factors is largely within the court informed discretion.see also martin,at r eversal will result if and only if the sentencing court determination falls outside the expansive boundaries of that universe.the district court was well within its discretion in giving greater weight to arroyo maldonado criminal history than other factors.therefore,the district court weighing of the relevant sentencing factors in a manner that arroyo maldonado does not agree with does not amount to plain error.
arroyo maldonado suggestion that the district court sentenced him above the applicable gsr based solely on punitive reasons is meritless.although at the sentencing hearing the court noted,p unitive wise,i raised it,this isolated statement does not indicate that the sole basis for the district court sentence was for punitive purposes.indeed,as discussed above,the district court discussion of the relevant a factors demonstrates that it considered additional factors such as arroyo maldonado need for psychological treatment the deterrence aspect of punishment,and arroyo maldonado criminal history.put simply,arroyo maldonado argument amounts to a disagreement with the district court weighing of the different sentencing factors,and does not establish plain error in the district court sentence.see clogston,at the appellant in effect seeks to substitute his judgment for that of the sentencing court.we can not countenance such a substitution.
the district court one hundred and twenty month sentence is neither procedurally flawed nor substantively unreasonable.here,like in clogston,t his was a defensible result,and the court stated a plausible rationale for reaching it.no more was required.id.
iii.conclusion 
in determining arroyo maldonado sentence,the district court considered all sentencing factors,adequately explained its sentence and deviation from the gsr,and imposed a reasonable sentence in the totality of the circumstances.accordingly,the district court imposition of a one hundred and twenty month sentence was neither procedurally flawed nor substantively unreasonable.therefore,the district court sentence is affirmed.
we note that even though arroyo maldonado plea agreement had a clause,his appeal is properly before us.here,arroyo maldonado waived his right to appeal to the extent he was subsequently sentenced in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the plea agreement.the sentence ultimately imposed was not in accordance with these terms and conditions,which recommended a sentence toward the lower end of the applicable gsr of seventy to months.thus,as the government correctly concedes,the does not bar the instant appeal.see united states murphy cordero,cir holding that a clause only precludes appeals falling within its scope.
although not raised by the parties below,we note that any attempt to challenge the sentence on the basis of tapia united states,d,would have been futile.in tapia,the supreme court held that a sentencing court may not impose or lengthen a prison term in order to promote an offender rehabilitation.id.at finding a district court sentence improper where the length of the sentence was imposed to ensure that the defendant could complete a hour drug treatment program.the court also noted,however,that a court commits no error by discussing the opportunities for rehabilitation within prison or the benefits of specific treatment or t
