amended opinion 
julio rosario otero appeals the sentence imposed after his conviction for possession with intent to distribute illegal narcotics.he claims that the sentencing court should have granted a continuance to allow him to marshal necessary evidence.he also argues that the sentencing court individualized finding as to the amount of drugs that he could have reasonably foreseen was erroneous.neither argument persuades us.we will,however,remand for the limited purpose of giving the district court an opportunity to consider whether rosario otero term of supervised release should be recalculated.
this case is before us for the second time.see united states fernández hernández,cir.as the underlying facts of rosario otero conviction are recounted in our previous opinion,we limit ourselves to the facts relevant to this appeal.
prior history 
rosario otero was a member of the los dementes drug trafficking organization operating in the municipalities of cataño and guaynabo in puerto rico.the government charged him and other members of the organization with various conspiracy and drug counts.a jury convicted rosario otero of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute,see,and possession with intent to distribute both cocaine and crack cocaine,see id.a.the jury made specific drug quantity findings for the possession offenses at least grams of crack cocaine and at least kilograms of cocaine.the district court,based on the jury finding as to drug quantity,sentenced him to months incarceration and years supervised release.rosario otero challenged his convictions in a rule motion,which the district court denied.
on appeal,we upheld rosario otero convictions both for participating in the drug conspiracy and for the substantive possession offenses.we also concluded,however,that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding,beyond a reasonable doubt,that rosario was responsible for the elevated drug quantities of which he was convicted,at least one hundred fifty grams of and five kilograms of cocaine.fernández hernández,at.consequently,we vacated rosario otero sentence and remanded for resentencing.in doing so,we express ed no view as to the drug quantities the sentencing court may properly attribute to rosario when the standard,unlike the standard for conviction,is preponderance of the evidence.id.at.
resentencing 
we issued our decision in fernández hernández on june.on august,rosario otero requested that the district court reschedule his resentencing hearing.he also requested a transfer from the mainland united states to puerto rico.the court granted both requests,setting the hearing for october.rosario otero arrived in puerto rico one week before the hearing.however,due to scheduling conflicts,he did not meet with his counsel until the night before the resentencing hearing.
at the hearing the following day,rosario otero,through his counsel,requested a continuance.this oral request was not accompanied by any written request,nor had rosario otero previously discussed a continuance with the government.nonetheless,rosario otero counsel argued that a continuance was necessary because rosario otero recent arrival in puerto rico had not given him enough time to prepare for the resentencing.in particular,counsel expressed a need to call juan rivera gómez,a at trial,to testify.when the district court asked where rivera gómez was,rosario otero counsel responded,he in miami,i believe.the district court denied this continuance,concluding that,notwithstanding rosario otero delayed arrival in puerto rico,he had ample time to prepare for the resentencing,including calling any witnesses.
the government then presented evidence regarding the amount of drugs that would have been foreseeable to rosario otero based on his involvement in the trafficking organization.william rosario garcía william,one of the trial witnesses,testified at the resentencing hearing that the los dementes organization processed roughly one kilogram of cocaine into crack cocaine each week at apartment,located at the juana matos housing project.william also testified that he saw rosario otero go into this apartment several times a week,often to pick up packaged drugs.
william testified that rosario otero owned a specific drug point in cataño.he learned this information from the drug sellers who worked at that drug point.moreover,on one occasion william washed rosario otero car and in return rosario otero gave him crack cocaine in vials with gray caps.according to william,this matched the color of the drug vials distributed at this particular drug point.at the time,rosario otero told william that these vials came from his drug point,but did not specify which drug point he owned.
finally,william stated that he saw rosario otero handle drugs on two additional occasions.in both instances,rosario otero asked william to process cocaine into crack cocaine and taste it for him.one of these encounters occurred at the coqui housing project across the street from the juana matos housing project.william did not specify the location of the second encounter.he also admitted that he had failed to mention this second encounter during his trial testimony.
on,rosario otero sought to demonstrate inconsistencies between william trial testimony and his testimony at resentencing.in particular,he noted how william testimony had become more specific in a number of respects since trial.william had been unsure about the various colors of drug caps at trial,yet exhibited no such hesitancy at resentencing.moreover,at trial he had testified to having seen rosario otero at apartment at least two times,yet at resentencing he revised that estimate to s everal times a week.
william was the only witness at the resentencing hearing.at the conclusion of his testimony,rosario otero asked to call agent cristobal rodriguez.agent rodriguez had previously interviewed william during the investigation of the los dementes organization,and rosario otero hoped that agent rodriguez could show how william testimony had changed over time.however,rosario otero had not subpoenaed agent rodriguez and the district court refused to continue the proceedings in order to bring him in.rosario otero counsel argued that the shifting substance of william testimony raised an unforeseen necessity,but the court determined that william testimony contained the same or musical variations of the same testimony that he had offered at trial.the district court further found william testimony credible.
the court,making a conservative measure of the amount of cocaine attributable to rosario otero,concluded that rosario otero could have foreseen the possession and distribution of to kilograms of cocaine,and imposed a sentence of months incarceration and years supervised release,which matched the original sentence.this appeal followed.
rosario otero asks us to vacate his sentence and remand the case to a different district court judge on the grounds that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant the request for a continuance that he presented at the beginning of the resentencing hearing and erred in its drug quantity determination.
