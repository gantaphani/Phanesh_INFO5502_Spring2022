the facts are presented in a light most favorable to the jury verdict.united states,cir,cert.denied,d.the government began investigating an alleged drug operation in puerto rico in october.undercover drug enforcement administration dea special agent angel arranged a meeting with a person named baéz.agent had received a tip that baéz was selling large amounts of cocaine in the las piedras,puerto rico area.during agent meeting with baéz,baéz called someone named mister who would supply agent with the cocaine he was attempting to purchase.mister was later determined to be marcial peguero,the leader of the drug ring.as the meeting ended,baéz and agent exchanged phone numbers.
after the meeting,the dea obtained court orders for pen registers and wiretaps for baéz phone number and a number of other telephone numbers used by the drug ring.agents then determined that the telephone number baéz had called during the meeting with agent was registered to the defendant.
while the dea investigation continued,an immigrant from the dominican republic,was asked by the immigration and naturalization service ins to update his immigration file.in doing so,provided a business address,which was for a kiosk at the luquillo beach area,as well as a telephone number.several months later,agent noticed a for sale sign on kiosk at luquillo and recognized the phone number on the sign.the kiosk was the one that had listed with the ins as his business address.agent,again acting undercover,set up a meeting with to discuss purchasing the kiosk.in the conversation with,told him that he wanted to use the kiosk to store drug shipments.told that he could introduce to someone who could help him out with that kind of business.also asked what he could get for helping the agent do so.through,obtained the phone number for the ringleader,peguero,and a meeting was arranged for november,at kiosk.
the dea listened to over telephone conversations obtained through the wiretaps,and based upon those intercepts,agents conducted surveillance,and on april,successfully interdicted a shipment of ten kilograms of cocaine and three kilograms of heroin.this shipment had been arranged by peguero and his associates and was intercepted by the authorities.
the evidence at trial showed that often obtained cellular phones and communications devices for the other coconspirators to use.when he became aware that a particular cell phone number had been compromised,would replace it with a new phone and number.the cell phone used by peguero to arrange the april,interdicted shipment was listed as having as the subscriber,and the day after the shipment was seized,told peguero he should no longer use that phone.
also arranged for the november,meeting between agent and peguero,thinking that agent intended to discuss drug smuggling and storage with peguero and that agent was interested in using kiosk for that purpose.
was considered to be peguero muscle man.dea agents testified that they observed on two different occasions.the first was at the november,meeting between and peguero at kiosk.and another individual arrived at the meeting separately and conducted.was later located inside the kiosk,playing pool and watching peguero and agent during the meeting.later was observed near the van agent drove to the meeting,writing down the license plate number of the vehicle.
through the telephone surveillance of the coconspirators,dea agents learned of a money planned to take place on march,and involving peguero,and a woman named elsa.at the appointed time,was observed as a passenger in the front seat of the minivan driven to the arranged location.when the van arrived at the prearranged location,a texaco station located across the street from the puerto rico police department headquarters,agents observed a woman approach the driver side of the minivan and,consistent with the intercepted information,be passed a shopping bag.the van drove off and the woman left in a separate vehicle.the jury was free to determine,based on the contents of the intercepted conversation arranging the,that peguero was the van driver and that the shopping bag contained the money.

the surveillance and drug shipment interception led to the indictment of,and four others.the other four were peguero and raul,who both fled and remain fugitives,and wilson and mercedes figueroa,who both pleaded guilty prior to trial.
ii.analysis 
sufficiency of the evidence 
we first address each defendant challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the conspiracy convictions.we review de novo,inquiring whether after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states washington,cir internal citations and marks omitted.all reasonable evidentiary inferences are to be drawn in harmony with the jury verdict,and all issues of credibility are to be resolved in the light most favorable to the government.id.internal marks omitted.
to succeed at trial,the government had to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed,the defendants had knowledge of the conspiracy,and the defendants voluntarily participated in the conspiracy.united states lizardo,cir.evidence to prove these elements need not be direct,but can be circumstantial.see id.to support a conviction for conspiracy each coconspirator need not know of or have contact with all other members,nor must they know all of the details of the conspiracy or participate in every act in furtherance of it.united states,cir,cert.denied,d and,d.
we are satisfied that the evidence was sufficient to support both of the conspiracy convictions against.the evidence included the recorded telephone conversations,procurement of cellular telephones for use in the conspiracy,the fact that,knowing its illegal purpose,arranged the meeting between agent and peguero which took place at kiosk,as well as the testimony of the two dea agents describing the factual events which occurred.looking at all of the evidence,the jury could reasonably conclude that was aware of the drug conspiracy and chose to participate in it voluntarily.while offered contradictory testimony and advanced alternative reasons as to why his name may have been associated with some of the cell phones,such as testimony that was the victim of identity theft,it is the jury duty to assess credibility,and it may accept or reject,in whole or in part,any testimony.united states nishnianidze,cir,cert.denied,d.taken in the light most favorable to the verdict,the evidence of participation in the drug ring was more than sufficient to support his conspiracy convictions.
with respect to sufficiency of the evidence argument,we well recognize that mere presence at the scene of conspiracy activities or simple association with conspirators is not enough,standing alone,to establish participation in a conspiracy.united states,cir.however,the government evidence was sufficient for a jury to find reasonably that was more than a mere bystander who found himself in the presence of drug conspirators and in the middle of two drug distribution conspiracies.the evidence showed that he transported money to the dominican republic and that he called the
