defendant jamie gene thompson appeals from a judgment of the district court sentencing him,as relevant to this appeal,to pay restitution under the mandatory victims restitution act mvra,for losses incurred through his fraudulent misuse of his victims bank and credit accounts.prior to his conviction,thompson returned a portion of the stolen funds to his victims,and the victims banks reimbursed another substantial portion of the stolen funds,ultimately leaving the victims with more than they had lost through thompson crimes.in calculating thompson restitution obligation,the district court found that the funds returned by thompson belonged solely to the victims and could not offset thompson liability to the banks for the value of their reimbursements,effectively ordering thompson to pay more in combined restitution to the banks and the victims than he stole,net of what he returned.
because the mvra limits a defendant restitution amount to the actual losses suffered by his victims,and because providers of compensation do not qualify as victims whose losses may expand the defendant restitution liability,the district court erred in ordering thompson to pay more in restitution than the victims actual losses.accordingly,we vacate the district court restitution order and remand for recalculation.
background 
i.the fraud 
jamie gene thompson has an extensive criminal record that includes at least twelve convictions for fraud and crimes.in,thompson began to work as a attendant for liddell and albert eardensohn,whom he had known for some time through his past services caring for liddell father.although the eardensohns knew of thompson criminal history,they welcomed him into their home,entrusting him with their financial records and eventually moving him into the house as a caretaker.
in october,after thompson flew to california on what he claimed was a family visit,liddell discovered numerous discrepancies in the eardensohns financial records.she retained an attorney to help investigate the inconsistencies and recoup any missing funds.the investigation ultimately revealed that thompson had misappropriated tens of thousands of dollars from the eardensohns.that fraudulent activity included unauthorized withdrawals from the eardensohns investment account at wells fargo,unauthorized checks cashed against their checking account at td bank,and fraudulent charges on their citibank credit card.
after the fraud was discovered,thompson wrote the eardensohns a series of letters confessing and apologizing for his crimes.in one letter,he promised to send to cover his withdrawals from the wells fargo investment account,begging liddell not to press charges against him because he was doing everything to make this wrong a right to you.thompson subsequently sent a check for,as well as a second check for towards the credit card charges he made.both checks were deposited into a restitution account in the eardensohns names.
the eardensohns attorney subsequently convinced wells fargo to reimburse roughly of thompson unauthorized withdrawals from the eardensohns investment account.citibank also forgave the full amount of thompson unauthorized charges on the eardensons credit card.
ii.procedural history 
on october,thompson pleaded guilty to a indictment charging him with access device fraud in violation of a.as part of the plea agreement,he agreed to pay restitution to the eardensohns for all losses resulting from his crime.
at the sentencing hearing,the parties calculated the total amount of thompson thefts at,comprising stolen from the eardensohns wells fargo investment account,cashed from their td bank checking account,charged to their citibank card,and in compensable attorneys fees.because wells fargo and citibank had reimbursed the eardensohns for some of those losses,and because in such circumstances a defendant should pay restitution directly to the reimbursers,see j,thompson owed portions of that sum setting aside any credit for the amount repaid to the eardensohns to three different parties to the eardensohns,reflecting the attorneys fees,td bank checks,and unreimbursed wells fargo withdrawals to citibank,reflecting the forgiven credit card charges and to wells fargo,reflecting the reimbursed withdrawals.
the parties also agreed that thompson repayments of to the eardensohns should be offset against his restitution obligation.however,they disagreed about how to apply that.thompson argued that it should be subtracted from his total restitution amount,leaving him with an outstanding obligation of,to be distributed as appropriate among the eardensohns and the banks.to the extent that the he had paid the eardensohns and the amounts that the banks had repaid to them exceeded their losses,and left the banks,thompson proposed that the eardensohns be instructed to remit to the banks any excess monies received from thompson.
by contrast,the government urged that the,which had been sent directly to the eardensohns,could be used only to satisfy thompson remaining obligation to the eardensohns,not his debts to either of the banks.by that calculation,thompson would need to make no further payments to the eardensohns,whose losses of,had been fully satisfied by thompson check payments,but would still have to pay wells fargo and citibank in restitution.
the district court garvan murtha,judge adopted the government position.judge murtha did not dispute that crediting the full against thompson debt to the eardensohns would effectively leave them with more than they had initially lost.nevertheless,he concluded that this outcome would not constitute an unfair windfall because thompson had sent the money to the eardensohns voluntarily,making those funds the eardensohns property to dispose of as they wished.app x at.judge murtha also suggested that any additional benefit accruing to the eardensohns was not inequitable under the circumstances,since they had experienced not only monetary expenses but also had to suffer through the process of trying to undo everything that thompson did to them.id.
judge murtha thus ordered thompson to pay a total of in restitution,with for the eardensohns,for wells fargo,and for citibank,with the further addendum that thomson debt of to the eardensohns was deemed satisfied in full by his earlier payments.that order left thompson owing an additional to wells fargo and citibank,which,combined with his in check payments to the eardensohns,would result in thompson having to pay more than he originally stole 
thompson appeals,arguing,inter alia,that the district court improperly treated the banks as victims pursuant to the governing restitution statute and thus erred by failing to offset the restitution due to the banks by the amount thompson had repaid to the eardensohns.
