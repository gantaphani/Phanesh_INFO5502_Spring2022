defendant appellant richard barker barker appeals from a june,judgment of the united states district court for the district of vermont reiss,sentencing him to months imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography in violation of a b.the district court applied a modified categorical approach in determining that barker prior conviction under vermont former statutory rape law.stat.ann.tit,a,triggered the mandatory minimum sentence found in b as a prior conviction under a state law relating to aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.we conclude that the district court should have applied the categorical approach in accordance with united states beardsley,cir.under the categorical approach,however,we agree that barker conviction subjects him to section b mandatory minimum sentence.affirmed.
on january,a federal grand jury indicted barker on one count of distribution of child pornography under a,and two counts of possession of child pornography under a b.barker eventually pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography.as part of the plea agreement,the government agreed to dismiss the additional charges against barker and recommend that he receive a sentence no longer than months.
at the time of his child pornography offense,barker was on probation in vermont for a felony conviction under vermont former statutory rape law.stat.ann.tit,a.that provision requires no significant age difference between the minor victim and the offender id.the information in barker state case,however,charged that barker,age,engaged in a sexual act with a minor under the age of who was not married to barker.
in the present federal case,barker presentence report assigned barker a sentencing guideline offense level and category that corresponded to a to month sentence.in its sentencing memorandum,the government argued that barker prior vermont state conviction categorically qualified as a predicate offense under section b recidivist provision,triggering that section mandatory minimum sentence.based on additional factors relevant to barker crime,the government ultimately recommended a sentence of months.
in his sentencing memorandum,barker argued that his prior vermont conviction did not constitute a conviction for abusive sexual conduct under either a categorical or modified categorical approach.specifically,barker contended that vermont statute lacked abusiveness as an element because,among other things,it did not require a significant age disparity between the victim and offender.barker thus argued that section b mandatory minimum sentence did not apply to him and asked for a month prison term.
based on united states rood,cir,the district court determined that it should apply a modified categorical approach to determine whether barker state court conviction met the requirements of section b.the district court then reviewed the charging document in barker vermont case and concluded that the document established a significant age disparity between barker and his victim and met the abusiveness requirement of section b.accordingly,the district court imposed the mandatory sentence.barker now appeals.
barker contends that the district court erred in concluding that his vermont felony conviction for statutory rape.stat.ann.tit,a,triggered the mandatory minimum sentence provided by b.we review de novo all questions of law relating to the district court application of a federal sentence enhancement.beardsley,at.we are free to affirm an appealed decision on any ground which finds support in the record,regardless of the ground upon which the trial court relied.united states yousef,cir internal quotation marks omitted.while we conclude that the district court should have applied a categorical approach to determine whether barker conviction triggered section b sentence enhancement,we nevertheless affirm the district court determination that section b mandatory minimum sentence applied.
an offender sentenced under section b generally faces a maximum punishment of no more than years imprisonment.section b provides,however,that offenders with certain prior convictions are subject to a mandatory minimum sentence.relevant here,section b subjects offenders who have previously been convicted under the laws of any state relating to aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward to a mandatory minimum sentence.
to determine whether a state offense qualifies as a predicate offense for a federal mandatory minimum sentence,courts generally take a categorical or modified categorical approach.beardsley,at.under a categorical approach,courts compare the statute forming the basis of the defendant prior conviction with the applicable generic offense in the federal sentencing statute.id.in contrast,under the modified categorical approach,courts may,to a limited extent in order to discover the elements of the prior conviction,consider facts underlying the prior conviction if they are based upon adequate judicial record evidence.id.at,internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court,based on our decision in rood,applied what it identified as a modified categorical approach and looked to the charging document,which established the significant age disparity between barker and his victim.given this age disparity,the district court concluded that barker conviction for statutory rape involved abuse and therefore triggered section b mandatory minimum sentence.
the district court imposed its sentence,however,without the benefit of this court decision in beardsley,which was decided two months after barker sentencing.beardsley makes clear that the district court should have applied a categorical approach.
in beardsley,we reviewed whether a defendant conviction under new york endangering the welfare of a child statute qualified as a state crime relating to aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor under b.id.at.we explained that 
the modified categorical approach is appropriate only where a statute is divisible into qualifying and offenses,and not where the statute is merely worded so broadly to encompass conduct that might fall within with the definition of the federal predicate offense here,aggravated sexual abuse,sexual abuse,or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward.b as well as other conduct that does not.
id.at.accordingly,because the new york statute under which the defendant was charged was merely broad,not divisible,we held that the district court should have applied a categorical approach in determining whether the federal sentencing enhancement applied.id.
the supreme court has now affirmed beardsley rule.in descamps united states,d,the supreme court resolved a split among the circuit courts as to the use of the modified categorical approach,id.at identifying beardsley place among the circuits,and held that sentencing courts may not apply the modified categorical approach when the crime of which the defendant was convicted has a single,indivisible set of elements,id.at.
it is clear from descamps and beardsley that the modified categorical approach serves a limited function.id.at.the modified categorical approach is merely a tool for district courts to use to determine which alternative element in a divisible statute formed the basis of the defendant conviction.id.at see also beardsley,at.once the district court has identified the particular provision of state law under which the defendant was convicted,the district court must then compare the elements of that provision to the generic federal sentencing enhancement to determine its applicability just as it would under a categorical approach.descamps.at beardsley,at.thus,neither the categorical nor modified categorical approach permit the district court to examine documents from a defendant state court conviction to determine whether the context and facts of the defendant crime fit the generic offense in the sentencing enhancement statute.descamps.at.
given the standard identified in beardsley and confirmed by descamps,the district court erred in its approach to determ
