appellant paul anderson challenges his sentence after pleading guilty to charges of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base.the district court sentenced anderson to months in prison,with concurrent terms of four years of supervised release,and a mandatory penalty.anderson argues that the district court erred by applying a sentencing enhancement for firearm possession under the sentencing guidelines.he also challenges his sentence under united states booker,d,which was decided after the court sentenced anderson.while we reject his argument that there was error in the court application of a guidelines enhancement,we remand his case for under booker.the government had the burden of demonstrating that the application of the mandatory sentencing guidelines by the district court was harmless error.it has not done so.
on november,a confidential informant told drug agents that anderson had agreed to sell the informant cocaine at anderson house later that day.the agents followed the informant to anderson house,where anderson sold him cocaine.over the next four weeks,the informant made several additional controlled buys of cocaine and crack cocaine from anderson in his house.on january,agents searched anderson house pursuant to a warrant and seized several baggies,each of which contained cocaine.during the search,agents also seized a loaded smith and wesson handgun,found in the living room along with a ledger recording money owed to anderson.the agents arrested anderson.
on august,anderson appeared in district court and pled guilty to a indictment.counts i through iii and vi charged him with distributing and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of a and b c.counts iv and v alleged distribution and possession with intent to distribute more than grams of cocaine base in violation of a and b b.
the investigation report psi found a base offense level of and a criminal history of i.the psi then recommended a reduction for the defendant acceptance of responsibility and reported that the government would recommend a further reduction.the psi also recommended a enhancement for firearm possession.the psi recommended against a safety valve reduction.the total adjusted offense level in the psi was,yielding an initial guidelines sentencing range of months.
the psi also noted that anderson and his mother stated that anderson had been dealing with serious mental health problems since childhood.while on pretrial supervision,anderson met with jeremy spiegel,a psychiatrist,who observed symptoms of multiple anxiety disorders,including disorder,panic disorder with agoraphobia,anxiety,and social anxiety.the psi noted that anderson might request a downward departure based on his mental health problems.
anderson objected to the psi.he disputed the recommended firearm enhancement,stating that the gun was not used in connection with the crime because this firearm was purchased as personal protection after a series of armed home invasions in sanford,maine in late.he also argued that his possession of a gun did not preclude the benefits of the safety valve reduction.
at the sentencing hearing,the government agreed that the defendant would be eligible for the safety valve reduction because,it stated,the prosecution would have to provide the court with some evidence that the gun was used in connection with the offense,which the prosecution ha s no such evidence.the district court applied the safety valve reduction.
the government then argued that,notwithstanding the application of the safety valve reduction,the firearm enhancement should apply.the defendant challenged the application of the enhancement,arguing that,under blakely washington,d,the government had to prove that the gun was actually connected with the offense in order for the firearm enhancement to apply.therefore,according to the defendant,the enhancement was inapplicable because the government stated that it could not prove this fact.the district court disagreed and applied the enhancement.
the defendant also asked the district court for a downward departure on the basis of his serious mental health problems.the district court noted that the guidelines discouraged departures on the basis of mental health unless the facts took the case outside of the heartland of other cases involving defendants with mental health problems.after carefully considering the facts,the district court noted that i t unfortunately the case that anderson condition is not outside the heartland and that,although his condition was serious and severe,the court see s a number of severe or serious mental health issues.
the district court calculated a final offense level of,yielding a guidelines sentencing range of months.the district court imposed a sentence of months in prison,with concurrent terms of four years of supervised release,and a mandatory penalty.the judge stated that the crime deserves the punishment that is being imposed,and noted that the sentence,at the bottom of the guidelines range,was a legitimate and adequate sentence.
anderson raises two main arguments on appeal.first,he argues that the district court improperly applied the firearm sentencing enhancement under the united states sentencing guidelines manual b.second,he challenges his sentence in the wake of booker,where the supreme court held that the guidelines must be treated as advisory rather than mandatory.we address his arguments in turn.
application of the firearm sentencing enhancement 
we review a district court interpretation of the guidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error.united states robinson,cir.in this case,the district court applied a sentencing enhancement for firearm possession under b,noting that the defendant acknowledged that the police had found a loaded handgun in his apartment,and that the defendant stated that he bought the gun for personal protection after a series of armed home invasions in his area.the court also applied a reduction under the safety valve provision of.the defendant and the prosecution agreed that the provision was applicable,despite its requirement that the defendant show that he was not in possession of the firearm in connection with the offense.
the defendant argues that,because the government conceded that the safety valve applies,the district court erred in applying the sentencing enhancement for gun possession.the district court found nothing contradictory about applying both the enhancement and the reduction,concluding that different standards apply for each.
we agree with the district court.the burdens for establishing the applicability of the safety valve reduction and the weapon enhancement are different.section,the safety valve provision,permits a reduction in offense level if the defendant and the offense meet certain enumerated criteria.see united states mclean,cir.pertinent to this case,the safety valve is unavailable to a defendant who possesses a firearm in connection with the offense.id.quoting.thus,the defendant has the burden of establishing,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he did not possess the firearm in connection with the offense.see united states,cir.
section b permits a enhancement i f a dangerous weapon including a firearm was possessed.to garner this enhancement,the government has the initial burden of establishing that a firearm possessed by the defendant was present during the commission of the offense.united states mcdonald,cir.once the government has made that showing,the burden shifts to the defendant to persuade the factfinder that a connection between the weapon and the crime is clearly improbable.id.emphasis added see also b,cmt.the adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present,unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.
thus,the burden on the defendant is different for these two sentencing provisions.the application of the safety valve which requires the defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he did not possess the firearm in connection with the offense does not necessarily mean that the defendant can meet the heavier burden,once the govern
