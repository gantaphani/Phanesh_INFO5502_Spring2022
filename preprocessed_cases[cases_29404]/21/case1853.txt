background 
this appeal arises out of donald carpenter plea of guilty to conspiring to steal firearms from two dick clothing and sporting goods dick stores located near syracuse,new york.during the period on or about september through march donald carpenter and marty wise,a sales associate at dick,participated in a conspiracy to steal firearms from dick,a federally licensed firearms dealer.their scheme,as outlined below,involved fifty firearm thefts,which netted a total of separate firearms during the two and year period the conspiracy was in existence.
the mechanics of the conspiracy firearm theft and resale scheme are not complicated.wise initially approached carpenter with the plan to steal firearms from dick.as part of their scheme,wise would contact carpenter and inform him when a specific theft should occur.when carpenter arrived at dick,wise handed carpenter a firearm.carpenter then completed the alcohol,tobacco and firearms atf form transferring the firearm from dick to himself,and wise signaled to the cashier that carpenter was all set and could leave without paying for the firearm.on each executed form,carpenter signed as the buyer and wise signed as the seller on behalf of dick.all of the firearm thefts occurred in roughly the same manner.
carpenter was in charge of disposing of the firearms stolen from dick.as a partner in a business named the gun room,which possessed a federal firearms license,carpenter was able regularly to acquire firearms and subsequently resell them to dick and other businesses.although the gun room firearms license expired in august,carpenter nevertheless continued to acquire firearms from dick until march,when dick first became aware of the thefts.
the thefts were discovered by david murano,the store manager at dick,after carpenter was unable to produce the sales receipt for one of the firearms he allegedly purchased from dick.after being confronted by murano,carpenter confessed to his and wise involvement in numerous firearm thefts from dick.a few months later,carpenter and wise made a similar confession to atf agents.based on these confessions,the atf conducted a audit of dick records to determine how many firearms were stolen by carpenter and wise.the atf audit revealed that between october and march,the period the conspiracy was active,carpenter and wise engaged in fifty separate firearm thefts from dick,netting a total of separate firearms of these fifty firearms,fifteen were resold by carpenter to dick and fifteen were given to wise.carpenter resold an additional eleven firearms as follows four to gem sports,a sporting goods store four to steve underwood,carpenter accountant one to krajacic,carpenter employer one to an individual named scott and one to an unknown gun dealer.one firearm was subsequently purchased by carpenter.an additional eight firearms were stolen by carpenter and wise,but atf agents were unable to track the whereabouts of these firearms or the amount of proceeds generated from their resales.
the proceeds from the resale of the firearms accounted for by carpenter were allocated as follows wise kept the proceeds from nineteen guns carpenter kept the proceeds from nineteen guns wise and carpenter split the proceeds from three guns and one firearm actually was purchased by carpenter.
on july,carpenter pleaded guilty to an information charging him with one count of conspiring to steal firearms from a licensed firearms dealer in violation of and m.the district court held numerous hearings in connection with carpenter sentencing.during the first hearing,which occurred on june,the mitigating role adjustment was initially raised by carpenter and the district court stated that it did not believe that such an adjustment was appropriate.carpenter also raised the issue of a possible departure pursuant to on the ground that he had voluntarily disclosed the firearm thefts to murano,the store manager at dick,and to law enforcement authorities.the government opposed such a departure,arguing that carpenter did not confess his and wise role in the firearm thefts until after being confronted by murano and atf agents.concluding that the question whether carpenter voluntarily disclosed the thefts to murano was a factual issue,the district court granted carpenter request for a hearing.
on june,the district court held a second hearing in connection with carpenter request for a departure under section,during which carpenter testified.carpenter testimony did not,however,address his role in the conspiracy wise,his in the firearm thefts.at the conclusion of that hearing,the district court ordered that the hearing be continued to allow murano to testify.
on march,the district court held a third hearing during which murano testified.following that hearing,the district court notified the parties by letter that it planned to revisit the issue of carpenter role in the offense at sentencing,which it scheduled for march.at sentencing,the district court heard extensive argument from both parties on the issue of whether carpenter was entitled to a mitigating role adjustment.the district court then reduced carpenter base offense level by three levels pursuant to for his role in the firearm theft conspiracy.the district court further held that although it was close,a downward departure under section was not appropriate because carpenter voluntarily disclosed the thefts only after he was confronted by murano and atf agents.
the base offense level for carpenter offense was twelve.because the offense involved firearms,the offense level was increased by five levels see b.the district court then departed downward three levels for a mitigating role adjustment,see,and two levels for acceptance of responsibility.see id.at.this resulted in a total offense level of.this offense level,combined with a criminal history category of i,resulted in a guideline imprisonment range of to months.this placed carpenter in zone c of the sentencing table,qualifying him for a split sentence,under which carpenter could satisfy one half of his minimum term of imprisonment by community confinement or home detention.see d.exercising its discretion under section d,the district court sentenced carpenter at the lowest end of that range,and ordered him to serve a term of imprisonment of five months,followed by five months in home detention.the district court also ordered carpenter to pay restitution in the amount of.the district court entered judgment to that effect on march.wise,who also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to steal firearms from a licensed firearms dealer,was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of fifteen months and ordered to pay restitution in the amount of.
on march,the government filed its notice of appeal,challenging the district court grant of a mitigating role adjustment to carpenter.carpenter brief opposing the government appeal was not received until may,and we have delayed reaching a decision to allow consideration of that brief.
discussion 
on appeal,the government argues that the district court misapplied as a matter of law when it held that carpenter was entitled to a mitigating role adjustment on the ground that his conduct was less culpable than that of wise,his.we agree that the district court erred.

reduction for role in the offense 
section of the sentencing guidelines provides for a downward adjustment if the defendant was a minimal participant in criminal activity,and a downward adjustment where the defendant was a minor participant.the commentary to the guidelines provides that a minimal role adjustment applies to a defendant who is plainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group,comment.under this provision,the defendant lack of knowledge or understanding of the scope and structure of the enterprise and of the activities of others is indicative of a role as minimal participant.id.the guidelines make clear that the minimal role adjustment should be used infrequently.id,comment.see also united states lopez,cir.
in comparison,a minor role adjustment applies to any participant who is less culpable than most other participants,but whose role could not be described as minimal,comment.the guidelines further provide that a mitigating role adjustment is appropriate if the defendant is substantially less culpable than the average participant.id,comment.background emphasis added stinson united states,d c ommentary in the guidelines manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the constitution or a federal statute,or is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that guideline.if the defendant falls in between being classified as a minimal participant and a minor participant,he is entitled to a downward adjustment.united states pitre,cir see also.
on numerous occasions we have reiterated that a reduction pursuant to will not be available simply because the defendant played a lesser role than his to be eligible for a reduction,the defendant conduct must be minor or minimal as compared to the average participant in such a crime.united states rahman,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d see also casta√±o,at united states neils,cir per curiam under,the district court is required to gauge the appellant culpability relative to the elements of the offense of conviction as well as in relation to the.united states ajmal,cir united states pena,cir lopez,at.accordingly,the fact that a defendant played a minimal or minor role in his offense the role of his is insufficient,in and of itself,to justify a mitigating role reduction.ajmal,at internal quotation marks omitted see also united states martin,cir.
the rationale for such a rule is.as we stated in neils,i f participation in the offense were measured solely in relation to the,the anomaly would arise that a deeply involved participant would be rewarded with a downward adjustment,just because his were even more culpable.at see also pena,at permitting the culpability of alone to determine the adjustment for role in the offense for all members of a criminal undertaking would subject defendants who had engaged in identical criminal conduct to different sentences.lopez,at.further,such a result runs contrary to the statutory purposes of sentencing,which are aimed at reduc ing unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar criminal conduct.united states sentamu,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the government argues that the district court decision to grant carpenter a mitigating role adjustment was in conflict with established second circuit precedent.our resolution of the government appeal requires us to analyze the basis of the district court determination.
in ruling that carpenter base offense level should be reduced by three levels pursuant to section for his role in the conspiracy,the district court found that 
carpenter role in the offense is much less culpable than that of marty wise,the.it clear from the record that wise initiated the offense and recruited carpenter to take part in the thefts and that he was the one that had unlimited access to the guns,decided which guns would be stolen,when the thefts would take place,et cetera.wise used carpenter and four other individuals to accomplish these thefts and reaped the most from the crimes.in addition,although it not a consideration to make as an adjustment,the court also notes that carpenter has been forthright and has accepted responsibility and has assisted the government to the best of his ability in the investigation of this offense.
our review of the totality of the district court statements indicate that its decision to grant carpenter a mitigating role adjustment was based solely upon the relative culpability of carpenter and his.ajmal,at.under our precedent,a finding that carpenter was less culpable than wise,his,is an impermissible basis,in and of itself,for granting a downward departure under section.see neils,at to the extent that appellant argues that he is entitled to a reduction in the offense base level under solely upon a finding that he is less culpable than the,he is wrong.martin,at ajmal,at to the extent that the district court based its determination solely upon the relative culpability of the defendant and his,it misconstrued the law.pena,at.because the district court compared carpenter role to that of wise,rather than to the average participant in a similar firearm theft conspiracy,the sentence imposed by the district court must be vacated.
the government next argues that carpenter role in the conspiracy and his knowledge of the scope and structure of the conspiracy render him ineligible as a matter of law for a mitigating role adjustment under.thus,the government asks that we decide this question in the first instance.in response,carpenter concedes that the district court seemingly employed the wrong legal standard,but asks that we remand the matter to the district court for additional factfinding because t here are sufficient record facts that support the same mitigating role adjustment with the application of the correct standard.we disagree.because the relevant facts on this issue are clear from the record,we choose to decide the question of carpenter entitlement to a mitigating role adjustment in the first instance,rather than remand that determination to the district court for additional factfinding.see,compagnie financiere de cic et de europeenne merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith,cir citing chase manhattan bank,am.bank trust,cir an appellate court has the power to decide cases on appeal if the facts in the record adequately support the proper result or if the record as a whole presents no genuine issue as to any material fact.thus,if we find that a party must prevail as a matter of law,a remand is unnecessary.internal quotation marks and citations omitted reid senkowski,cir per curiam.
