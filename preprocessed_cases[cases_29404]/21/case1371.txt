the united states appeals from a june,order of the united states district court for the northern district of new york hurd,entering a judgment of acquittal in favor of mark desnoyers on one count of conspiracy to violate the clean air act the caa and to commit mail fraud in violation of.the district court held that desnoyers conspiracy conviction must be set aside because the conspiracy count suffered from both factual and legal defects.we disagree.we therefore vacate the judgment of acquittal and remand the case to the district court with instructions to reinstate the jury verdict,enter a judgment of conviction on the conspiracy count,and resentence desnoyers.
background 
desnoyers was licensed in new york to conduct air monitoring at asbestos abatement projects and to document the results of asbestos removal work.based on evidence that desnoyers conducted his work fraudulently and sometimes not at all,the government charged desnoyers with conspiring to violate the caa and to commit mail fraud in violation of violating the caa in violation of c mail fraud in violation of and three counts of making false statements in violation of.the jury convicted desnoyers on all counts except one count of making false statements.
after trial,desnoyers filed a motion pursuant to federal rules of criminal procedure c and challenging his conspiracy conviction desnoyers conceded below that the government introduced sufficient evidence at trial to support the mail fraud object of the conspiracy.desnoyers argued that his conspiracy conviction is nevertheless defective because the caa object rendered the conspiracy count both factually and legally defective.the district court agreed that the conspiracy count was factually and legally defective and on june,entered a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count 
the government appeals the district court entry of a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count the other counts are not at issue on appeal.accordingly,we need only examine in depth the evidence relevant to the conspiracy count.we pay particular attention to the caa object of the conspiracy because desnoyers concedes that the mail fraud object did not suffer from any defects 
the indictment charged desnoyers and others with conspiring to violate the caa and the mail fraud statute based on desnoyers and his asbestos abatement work in eight buildings.the government conceded after trial,however,that seven of these buildings were not subject to the caa asbestos removal regulations.the caa asbestos removal regulations cover only residences with more than four units and commercial buildings additionally,buildings must contain friable asbestos and at least linear feet of asbestos on pipes or square feet of asbestos on other facility components in order to be subject to the regulations.see defining friable asbestos as any material containing more than percent asbestos that,when dry,can be crumbled,pulverized,or reduced to powder by hand pressure,a.when the caa asbestos regulations apply,specific work practices must be followed during asbestos removal.see.failure to observe these practices when a building is not subject to the caa asbestos regulations does not violate the caa.
the parties dispute whether one building at issue in the conspiracy as clinton subject to the caa asbestos regulations.evidence at trial showed that clinton street was a commercial property containing friable asbestos.no witness testified directly,however,about the exact asbestos measurements at clinton street indeed,these measurements were not taken by an epa monitor because the pipes had been removed before he visited the site.the government evidence on asbestos quantity came from the testimony of multiple witnesses that the clinton street project was either a large or not a small.these same witnesses all testified that in the new york asbestos industry,a large project is understood to be a project with sufficient asbestos to fall under the caa requirements,whereas a small project is not several witnesses explicitly explained that a large is understood as a project containing at least linear feet of asbestos on pipes or square feet of asbestos on other facility is,a project with sufficient asbestos to qualify under the quantity requirement of the caa asbestos regulations.
the district court concluded that the government failed to show that clinton street was subject to the caa asbestos regulations because no witness testified directly about the quantity of asbestos at clinton street.the district court reasoned that the testimony at trial was insufficient to show that clinton street contained at least linear feet of asbestos on pipes or square feet of asbestos because the witnesses opinions as to what constitutes a large project could obviously still fall short of the rule footage requirements.
based on the foregoing,the district court concluded that the jury verdict on the conspiracy count could not stand because the caa object suffered from a factual defect.although a factual defect in one object of a conspiracy does not ordinarily require a court to overturn a guilty verdict,united states garcia,cir,the district court entered a judgment of acquittal on the conspiracy count.in so holding,the district court found that the ordinary rule for conspiracies did not apply because an overwhelming amount of evidence relevant only to the unproved part of the conspiracy may have prejudiced the jury.see united states papadakis,cir.
the district court found in the alternative that a judgment of acquittal was required because the caa object of the conspiracy suffered from a legal defect.the district court reasoned 
here,the clean air act objective within count one suffered from a substantial legal defect because of the inapplicability of the act regulatory standards.even if the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the government,was sufficient to show that the clean air act applied to the clinton street project,it remains undisputed that it was legally impossible for defendant to conspire to violate the clean air act with respect to the remaining seven projects identified in count one t here were seven instances in which the jury had to consider a legally impossible theory of guilt.defendant conviction under count one may very well have been based upon any one of these seven legally impossible theories.accordingly,the weight of the evidence admitted at trial is irrelevant,and defendant conviction can not stand.
the court thereafter entered judgments of guilt on the remaining counts and sentenced desnoyers based on these counts 
the government filed this timely appeal challenging the district court entry of a judgment of acquittal as to the conspiracy count.
discussion 
standard of review 
we review a judgment of acquittal notwithstanding a guilty verdict de novo and apply the same standard of constitutional sufficiency as the district court.united states heras,cir.a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavy burden,united states aguilar,cir,because a reviewing court must sustain the jury guilty verdict if,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt,jackson virginia,emphasis in original.
b.the conspiracy conviction suffered neither a factual nor a legal defect 
claims of factual and legal defects both challenge the sufficiency of the government case,but they do so in distinct ways.a factual challenge tests the sufficiency of the evidence and requires a court to examine whether a reasonable jury could find each element of a crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson,at.a legal challenge,by contrast,questions whether a conviction rests on a mistake about the law,as opposed to a mistake concerning the weight or the factual import of the evidence.griffin united states.a mistake about the law occurs when a defendant is charged with conduct that is not legally,for instance,the charged conduct is protected by the constitution,is time barred,or fails to come within the statutory definition of the crime.see also garcia,at.the difference
