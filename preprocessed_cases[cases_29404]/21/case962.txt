vega sentencing appeal 
vega mounts two challenges to his sentence.first,he argues that neither the jury nor the district court made an individualized finding that more than five kilograms of cocaine were attributable to or foreseeable by him as part of his involvement in the conspiracy,and therefore the application of the statutory mandatory minimum of months that attaches to such a finding was error.second,he argues that it was error for the district court to adopt the findings of the presentence investigation report psr assigning him a criminal history category of ii.
the trial for all four lasted twelve days.at the close of evidence,on september,the court gave extensive instructions to the jury.the instructions relevant to vega appeal were 
now,it is alleged that the defendants and others conspired to knowingly and intentionally distribute a controlled substance.if you find beyond reasonable doubt that the defendants conspired to knowingly distribute the controlled this case the controlled substance alleged is shall then determine whether the government has proven beyond reasonable doubt that the conspiracy involved more than five kilograms of cocaine as charged in count.
please note that a defendant who knowingly and willingly participates in a drug conspiracy is accountable not only for his own acts,but he or she may also be held responsible for the acts of others,if those acts or actions of others were reasonably foreseeable by the individual defendant and those acts or actions were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy.
vega has not challenged the correctness of the instructions.
the jurors were then given both a general verdict form and special verdict form for each defendant.the general verdict form asked the jury to state whether it found each defendant guilty or not guilty of count i of the indictment conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance.vega special verdict form asked 
if you find the defendant felix vega guilty of the conspiracy charged in count i,please answer the following question 
do you unanimously agree,by proof beyond a reasonable doubt,that the quantity of cocaine which was distributed intended to be distributed as part of the conspiracy was more than five kilograms as charged in the indictment 
this instruction was consistent with the law of this circuit at the time,which allowed for the jury to make a finding as to the quantity of drugs attributable to the conspiracy as a whole,and allowed the district court to make individualized quantity determinations for each for sentencing purposes.see derman united states,cir.
the following morning,september,during jury deliberation the jury submitted a note to the court asking for clarification 
if the evidence shows that an individual is part of a conspiracy and the conspiracy network has distributed in excess of kilos of cocaine does it automatically make every single individual guilty of distributing in excess of kilos of cocaine 
that question may well have been intended to explore the gap between the instructions and the special verdict form.after receiving the note,the district judge met in chambers with the attorneys for the defendants and the government.the judge said that she thought the jurors were confused as to whether they must consider the evidence against each defendant individually,and proposed an instruction in response that would clarify that issue.she asked the attorneys for the defendants if they objected to this clarifying instruction,and they did not object the court then responded to the jury in writing that the answer to their question was no,and that it would instruct the jury on giving separate consideration to each individual defendant.the court instruction stated 
members of the jury,the case of each defendant and the evidence pertaining to that defendant should be considered separately and individually.the fact that you may find one of the defendants guilty or not guilty should not control your verdict as to any other defendant.
the jury then continued with its deliberation.that afternoon the jury reached a verdict of guilty for vega,as well as all three,on count i,and answered yes to vega special verdict question that more than five kilograms of cocaine was attributable to the conspiracy.there was no request from defense counsel for clarification of the verdict.
several months later,at vega sentencing hearing,vega counsel said that he discussed with vega fully the findings of vega psr,and that there were no objections to the psr.the psr stated that vega offense involved more than five kilograms but less than fifteen kilograms of cocaine,which triggers the mandatory minimum of months under b a ii.vega said that he understood his counsel explanation of the psr.neither vega nor his counsel argued that more than kilograms of cocaine could not be attributed to him.vega counsel then argued that nothing in the psr required the court to sentence vega above the statutory mandatory minimum of months,and that vega should receive that minimum.the government also requested a sentence of the mandatory minimum.the court then sentenced vega to the mandatory minimum of months imprisonment.
for the first time on appeal,vega challenges the application of the mandatory minimum sentence.vega does not argue the jury was required to make this finding of drug quantity.see blakely washington,d united states cotton,d.he argues that neither the jury nor the district court made an individualized determination as to drug quantity,but rather applied the drug quantity to him automatically,as did the probation office in his psr.relying on a subsequent decision in united states,cir,he argues that the district court committed error by automatically applying the drug quantity to him,and therefore erred in applying the mandatory minimum sentence.he does not explain why the judge,who properly instructed on the law as to the need for personalized findings of drug quantity,would have suddenly shifted to adopt a per se rule.
vega belated challenge gets him nowhere.first,vega has arguably waived the issue of drug quantity by affirmatively agreeing to the mandatory minimum sentence at his sentencing hearing.united states,cir holding that defendant waives objection to existence of a sentencing factor raised for first time on appeal where defendant conceded that factor below.in any event,by not raising an objection below,vega has at least forfeited the issue,and he can not demonstrate that the district court committed plain error.see united states barbour,cir.whether or not the instruction is ideal under later developed law,there is no indication that the jury would probably have reached a different result under a perfect instruction,or that an injustice has resulted.see united states dominguez benitez,d united states olano,d 
accordingly,we affirm vega sentence.
fernández carrera 
fernández carrera challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for conspiracy to distribute cocaine.in order to overturn his conviction,this court must find,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,that no rational jury could have found fernández carrera joined the conspiracy.united states reyes,cir.
fernández carrera was known to his friends as jesús.fernández carrera argues that the evidence suggests there was a person named jesús involved in the conspiracy,but that it was someone else,another jesús.he points primarily to the fact that some of the principal members of the conspiracy were taped stating that they were going to see what jesús says on december.this was two days after the
