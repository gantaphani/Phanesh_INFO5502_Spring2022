following a guilty plea on federal mail fraud charges,the united states district court for the western district of new york richard arcara,chief judge imposed upon the defendant,felix sindima,a sentence under the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines of,principally,three years probation.the terms of probation included a prohibition against sindima commission of any further crime.thereafter,while still on probation,sindima was charged with two violations of that prohibition.the district court found sindima guilty of both.on april,the court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,months above the high end of the advisory guidelines range.sindima appeals,asserting that the sentence is substantively unreasonable.
we conclude that under the circumstances presented,the district court statement of reasons for the length of the sentence is inadequate to assure us that those reasons are sufficiently compelling and present to the degree necessary to support the sentence imposed.united states rattoballi,cir.accordingly,we remand.
background 
on december,sindima pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud arising out of a scheme in which he caused two computer retailers to send computer equipment to him using the names and social security numbers of others.on may,the district court sentenced sindima within his guidelines range of months by imposing three years probation and restitution in the amount of.the provisions of sindima probation included the standard condition that he not commit another crime while on probation.
on august,while sindima remained on probation,the government filed a petition alleging two violations of that he had allegedly committed and for which he had been arrested by the buffalo police department on september,the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing.thereafter,on december,the court found sindima guilty of both charges.
the evidence presented at the hearing indicated that on or about april,almost two years after his mail fraud sentence,sindima opened a series of bank accounts in the name of fs computers.the first was with bank of america,where he deposited with two checks that were eventually returned for insufficient funds.prior to the checks being returned,sindima withdrew from the bank of america account,of which he used to establish a similar account at evans national bank.on june,after this check and another check for were returned for insufficient funds,evans national bank informed sindima that his account had been suspended.undaunted,sindima deposited another check,but it was also returned for insufficient funds.on june,he then wrote a check drawn on his evans account which he used to open a third account at the greater buffalo savings bank.in accordance with its policy,however,the bank placed an automatic hold on the newly opened account.this check was subsequently returned for insufficient funds,along with another check from a bank account in his wife name,which sindima had also sought to deposit.sindima was eventually arrested following an attempt to withdraw from and deposit to the greater buffalo savings bank account.
on january,the district court held an initial sentencing hearing,at which time it evidently accepted the probation office calculation that sindima violations were grade b and his criminal history category was i,for which the guidelines prescribe an advisory range of months the court gave the government and sindima notice,however,that it was considering a sentence of sixty months,the statutory maximum.we were informed at oral argument that no transcript of this hearing was prepared,and there is therefore nothing in the record before us indicating whether the district court stated reasons for considering the statutory maximum penalty,or if so,what they were.in any event,following adjournment of the sentencing hearing,defense counsel submitted additional letters from various persons attesting to sindima good character and a supplemental memorandum urging leniency.
on april,the district court sentenced sindima for violation of probation.although defense counsel and the government had urge d the district court to impose a guidelines sentence,at,the court sentenced sindima to,principally,months in prison,more than times the of the advisory guidelines range after expressing its view that sindima was a danger to the community,id.at,the district court explained the reasons for its sentence.first,the court indicated that it sentenced sindima to 
a term of imprisonment above the recommended g uideline s range because of what i consider egregious conduct while on probation.despite being given a substantial break by this court by being sentenced to probation,sindima went out and committed numerous additional acts of fraud.he,obviously,did not learn his lesson while on probation.he exhibited complete disregard for the rules of law.
it is clear this sentence was necessary to address the extent of the criminal behavior and to deter the defendant from future acts of fraud.this is not a situation where the defendant has made an isolated bad judgment call while on probation.instead,he engaged in a calculated pattern of fraudulent activity on a repeated basis in complete disregard of the terms of his probation.
second,however,the district court was persuaded in some respects by the mitigating factors presented by defense sindima provided financial and emotional support to five children,that he had continued his college studies while on probation,and that he had volunteered in a center for the elderly and in his church.id.at see also def.second sent g mem.these factors were considered and were the reason why sindima received a lesser sentence than the statutory maximum,at 
the district court did not record its reasons for the sentence in its written judgment.

standard of review 
we review sentences for reasonableness,united states booker,d,which has both substantive and procedural dimensions,see united states crosby,cir.in the substantive dimension in which this appeal is raised,we determine whether the length of the sentence is reasonable,rattoballi,at,focusing our attention on the district court explanation of its sentence in light of the factors detailed in a see id.at 
reasonableness review is akin to review for abuse of discretion.united states fernandez,cir,cert.denied,d.a district court abuses its discretion when its decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions or is based either on an error of law or a clearly erroneous factual finding.united states fuller,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.we have observed that reasonableness is inherently a concept of flexible meaning,generally lacking precise boundaries,crosby,at that it involves some degree of subjectivity that often can not be precisely explained,united states jones,cir and that our function in reviewing sentences is to exhibit restraint,not micromanagement,united states fleming,cir.accordingly,a lthough the brevity or length of a sentence can exceed the bounds of reasonableness,we have anticipate d encountering such circumstances infrequently.id.nevertheless,in any particular case a sentence,assessed even against the flexible standard of reasonableness,may be so far above or below a guidelines range and so inadequately explained by the sentencing judge as to require rejection on appeal.jones,at.
ii.section c 
a district court is statutorily required to state in open court the reasons for its imposition of a particular sentence.see c.where,as here,the sentence is outside of an advisory guidelines range,the court must also state with specificity in the written order the specific reason for the sentence imposed.id.c see also jones,at united states lewis,cir.
