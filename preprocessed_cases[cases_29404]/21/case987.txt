a federal grand jury in the district of maine indicted coleman fenton,on counts stemming from his involvement in a conspiracy.following his conviction on counts and the imposition of sentence,fenton appeals.he mounts a challenge,claiming i that a prejudicial variance occurred because the government proof showed multiple conspiracies rather than the single overarching conspiracy alleged in the indictment ii that the district court erred both in allowing the joinder of counts that ought to have been charged separately and in failing to sever the mismatched counts iii that the government failed to prove an essential element of the count charging malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device and iv that the double jeopardy clause barred conviction and sentencing on six counts that constitute lesser included offenses of other counts of conviction.
after exhaustive examination of an amplitudinous record,we find the appellant first three arguments unpersuasive.we do,however,accept his final point.accordingly,we vacate the convictions and sentences on six counts affirm the convictions and sentences on the remaining counts and remand for entry of an amended judgment.
background 
we briefly sketch the facts,later embellishing this sketch as required in connection with our discussion of particular issues.throughout,we take the facts in the light most favorable to the government,consistent with record support.united states noah,cir.
the appellant plied the cocaine trade for a number of years as the prime mover in a enterprise based in south portland,maine.he enlisted a number of other people as accomplices.these recruits included his son,joey beeler his daughter,kristin beeler and their,brenda sue beeler.all three of these individuals testified for the government at the appellant trial.
the evidence showed that joey began selling drugs for his father in,but floated in and out of juvenile correctional facilities for the next two years.consequently,he did not join the family business in earnest until.his participation continued until october of,when he was arrested.kristin began selling drugs in and remained active until sometime in.brenda sue got a late did not join the enterprise until while still a student but stayed in the game until the government intervention put a halt to the appellant operations.
the indictment painted a tawdry picture of cocaine sales,supplemented by occasional violence.count charged the appellant and others with participation in an overarching conspiracy that operated in maine from until.see a.the remaining counts charged specific offenses,including distribution of cocaine on various dates,id.a distribution of cocaine within feet of a school,id.enlistment of a minor to assist in conducting narcotics operations,id.a malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device,i possession of an unregistered explosive device,d and possession of a destructive device in connection with a offense,c.
the case originally was assigned to senior judge carter,who handled many of the pretrial proceedings including the motion to sever,described infra.eventually,the case was transferred to judge singal,who presided over the appellant trial.on december,a jury found the appellant guilty on counts.judge singal sentenced him to an aggregate of and years in prison.
ii.prejudicial variance 
before us,the appellant primary claim is that the government failed to prove the existence of a single overarching conspiracy.in his view,the evidence actually revealed two separate conspiracies,or,alternatively,a conspiracy that ended with joey arrest and morphed into a series of casual drug sales to various of the appellant acquaintances.the appellant suggests that this failure of proof resulted in a material and prejudicial variance between the crime charged in count and the crime or crimes that the government proved.we must determine whether such a variance occurred and,if so,whether it adversely impacted the appellant substantial rights.united states,cir,cert.denied,d,wl.
the ground rules are familiar.in a jury trial,given proper instructions or in lieu thereof,unchallenged instructions,the jury determination as to whether one or more conspiracies existed is subject to review only for evidentiary sufficiency.united states david,cir.in the case at hand,the trial court instructed the jurors that in order to find the appellant guilty of conspiracy,they must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the agreement specified in count of the indictment and not some other agreement or agreements,existed.this was a facially correct instruction,see,united states balthazard,cir,and one to which the appellant interposed no contemporaneous objection.our initial inquiry,therefore,is whether the evidence sufficed to support the jury finding of an overarching conspiracy.united states sepulveda,cir david,at.
in assessing sufficiency,we canvass the evidence direct and circumstantial in the light most agreeable to the prosecution and decide whether that evidence,including all plausible inferences extractable therefrom,enable d a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the charged crime.noah,at.it is not our province either to make credibility determinations or to insist that the prosecution rule out other possibilities that the evidence might be read to suggest.id.furthermore,we must uphold the verdict as long as a plausible reading of the record supports the jury finding of a single conspiracy,at.with these principles in mind,we turn to the task at hand.
a conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons,including the defendant,to commit a particular crime.united states moran,cir united states echeverri,cir.to determine whether a single agreement existed between a defendant and his coconspirators,courts consider the totality of the circumstances,paying particular heed to factors such as the existence of a common goal,evidence of interdependence among the participants,and the degree to which their roles overlap.united states portela,cir.the test is a pragmatic one the proof need not show that each conspirator knew of all the others,nor that the group remained intact throughout the duration of the enterprise.united states,cir united states boylan,cir.
in this case,the appellant concedes that the evidence,construed in the light most agreeable to the government,supports a finding that he and his kinfolk alleged to be coconspirators shared the common practice and goal of selling drugs for profit.he argues,however,that because joey activities were conducted in a different time frame than his sisters activities,no single overarching conspiracy existed.in the appellant estimation,the most that the government proved is that he and joey conspired to distribute narcotics from to,and that the subsequent activity involving kristin and brenda sue was a wholly separate affair.
the appellant attempt to compartmentalize his activities and carve out separate conspiracies fails.the record,read most favorably to the prosecution,david,at,contains evidence that is more than adequate to sustain the verdict.a number of drug users testified that they bought cocaine from the appellant on a continuing basis,throughout the time span described in the indictment.these individuals testified to a pattern and practice from time to time,they would receive drugs from one of the appellant children or other sales agents and later pay the appellant himself for the purchase.joey,kristin,and brenda sue each admitted that he or she peddled cocaine for the appellant,and the evidence suggested that each of them knew that other individuals,including his or her siblings,also toiled as sales agents for the appellant.
although the cast of characters changed over time,the modus operandi remained constant.the testimony indicated,for example,that one supplier,stephanie davis,furnished drugs to the enterprise from to.davis dealt indiscriminately with joey,kristin,and brenda sue as internuncios.the purchases from davis invariably were financed by the appellant and,once procured,the raw drugs invariably were delivered to him so that he could dilute,cut,and package them into smaller quantities suitable for retail sale.the drugs then were sold at uniform prices,set by the appellant,and each purveyor collected a commission for sales that he or she effectuated.contraband received from other suppliers was handled in much the same fashion.this pattern and practice bespeaks a single,continuing operation.
despite the appellant claim to the contrary,there is no significantly probative evidence that joey arrest and incarceration disrupted the conspiracy operations in any material respect.joey himself testified that the appellant promised him a share of the profits from the ongoing business while he was in fact that indicates or so the jury reasonably could have thought that the enterprise survived his detention.at any rate,joey was,from aught that appears,a fungible cog in the enduring wheel.kristin testified that she began to sell more cocaine after joey arrest partially to help defray the unanticipated costs associated with joey defense and the jury reasonably could have inferred that brenda sue recruitment she joined the conspiracy in was part and parcel of the same strategy.acting on the appellant instructions,the sisters endeavored to promote and maintain the success of the enterprise in spite of joey immurement.
from this and other evidence,a rational jury sensibly could have this jury apparently and overlap among the beeler siblings.more importantly,a rational jury sensibly could have found interdependence and overlap between the appellant and his progeny.the appellant himself was the linchpin that held the conspiracy together through its different phases.he controlled the wholesale purchases of narcotics,fronted the needed financing,readied the product for resale,and shaped the profit stream by setting the prices.his pervasive involvement fully satisfied the overlap requirement.see portela,at.
that ends this aspect of the matter see,at describing circumstances in which a defendant will be held to have maintained membership in a single overarching conspiracy united states,cir similar.there was no variance.
iii.misjoinder and severance 
certain counts in the indictment focused on the appellant alleged involvement in the manufacture and deployment of a homemade pipe bomb.count charged the appellant with malicious damage to a vehicle through the use of explosive materials in violation of i count charged him with possession of an unregistered destructive device in violation of and d and count charged him with possession of a destructive device in connection with a offense in violation of c.the appellant complains that these charges were improperly joined with the counts.in a related vein,he complains that judge carter improvidently denied his motion to sever these purportedly dissimilar charges.neither plaint is compelling.
although the indictment charged the appellant with engaging in a conspiracy,the multitude of specific offense counts related to cocaine sales in the last quarter of.the indictment also charged the appellant,in the same time frame,with involving a minor brenda sue in operations.the government evidence about illicit activities in was very potent.it included taped telephone conversations,the corroborating testimony of several customers,drug residue and paraphernalia seized during two searches,and the turncoat testimony of two cooperating coconspirators kristin and brenda sue who were active in that time frame.
the pipe bomb charges arose out of earlier events,and the appellant characterizes the government evidence as much weaker.the case for the earlier period was based largely on the testimony of other participants most prominently,joey beeler.this testimony indicated that,at one point in,the appellant supplier,stephanie davis,ran out of inventory.the appellant gave joey funds to purchase cocaine elsewhere.joey approached carol ann dorney,who took the money with the understanding that she would procure cocaine from her nephew,patrick dorney.carol ann returned with a package of white powder.joey soon discovered that the powder was crushed tylenol.despite his immediate protest,patrick refused to return the funds.
when the appellant learned that joey had been hoodwinked and had lost the front money,he vowed to retaliate.he and joey began with small acts of retribution,joey cut carol ann telephone line and put a stink bomb in her hallway.this petty harassment did not bring about a refund,so father and son constructed a pipe bomb,intending that it be used to frighten patrick.
patrick proved to be an elusive target.not having learned his lesson,joey trusted carol ann once again.she told him that patrick girlfriend was diedre nickerson and directed him to an address in yarmouth,maine.on the night of july,joey and two companions proceeded to that address,found a car that they believed mistakenly belonged to diedre nickerson,and bombed it.
against this factual backdrop,we turn to the appellant asseverations.we take them one by one.
misjoinder.
the misjoinder claim is raised for the first time on appeal.consequently,we review it only for plain error.united states taylor,cir.to establish plain error,an appellant must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.the appellant can not come close to making this showing.
a plausible basis for the joinder of multiple counts ordinarily should be discernible from the face of the indictment.united states natanel,cir.the appellant points to the indictment description of the charges and vouchsafes that the and pipe bomb counts are simply too dissimilar to be joined.but similarity of charges is not the sole criterion for joinder.the criminal rules allow joinder not only of offenses that are of the same or similar character,but also of offenses that are based on the same act or transaction,or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.a.
given the reach of this standard,the key datum here is that the indictment charged the appellant and his confederates with having used the pipe bomb during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.the narcotics sales and the pipe bomb charges were thus linked as elements of a common scheme or plan.the counts were,therefore,properly joined.see natanel,at describing as settled the rule that a conspiracy count constitutes a sufficient link to justify joinder of offenses and defendants.
counts that are properly joined need not always be tried together.even if offenses are properly joined,the criminal rules authorize a severance i f the joinder of offenses appears to prejudice a defendant.a.severance on the ground of undue prejudice is a judgment call and,thus,is a matter committed to the trier informed discretion.united states alosa,cir.on appeal,an allegedly aggrieved party must show that the trial court refusal to sever constituted an abuse of discretion.id.this usually entails a showing that the failure to sever deprived the defendant of a fair trial.taylor,at.
here,the appellant contention that the district court erred in denying his motion for severance is unconvincing.first,he argues that evidence of drug trafficking that occurred in should not have been admissible in a trial of charges relating to the pipe bombing because the two sets of events were separated by the passage of four years.this argument is a.
all the offenses those relating to narcotics and those relating to explosives were charged as overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy described in the indictment.in addition,the the government views the brought about by a desire to avenge a drug deal gone sour.this motive connected the two sets of offenses in an unusually intimate way.under these circumstances,no risk of unfairly prejudicial spillover existed because evidence as to each group of offenses would have been admissible in a trial of the other.see united states edgar,cir explaining that no prejudice exists where the same evidence would be admissible even if counts were severed taylor,at similar.
the appellant has a fallback position
