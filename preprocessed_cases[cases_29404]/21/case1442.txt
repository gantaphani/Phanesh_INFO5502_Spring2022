background 
appellant was tried with silverio romano and anthony basile.appellant had been charged with a myriad of crimes,many quite serious racketeering,c,racketeering conspiracy,id.d,murder and conspiracy to kidnap and murder in order to increase or maintain position in the racketeering enterprise,id.a,conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana,a,possession with intent to distribute marijuana,id.a,use of a communication device to facilitate narcotics offenses,id.b,use and possession of firearms in relation to crimes of violence and drug trafficking crimes,c,and receiving or possessing defaced firearms,id.k.on february,after a four and month trial and seventeen days of deliberation,the jury convicted appellant of racketeering,racketeering conspiracy,conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana,possession with intent to distribute marijuana,and the use of a communication device to facilitate a narcotics transaction.the jury could not agree on a verdict as to the remaining charges.
after several adjournments to allow present counsel,who was retained after the trial but before sentencing,to supplement trial counsel sentencing submissions with her own,the court held a series of hearings in march and april of.at the beginning of the final sentencing hearing on april,appellant was represented both by trial counsel and present counsel.at that hearing,present counsel pressed a claim,obliquely raised for the first time in an submission two days prior,that appellant was entitled to a sentence reduction for acceptance of responsibility.her argument was that trial counsel had misinformed appellant as to the court power to consider at sentencing conduct that was not the subject of conviction.that misinformation,the argument went,caused appellant to fail to plead guilty,thereby losing a reduction in sentence for acceptance of responsibility.see sentencing guidelines.the government immediately countered that it could disprove the factual basis of the it was an outrageous claim and utterly and completely false.puglisi sentencing,trans,at.
the court inquired of trial counsel as to their position on this issue,but they demurred on the ground of privilege.present counsel then invoked the privilege,thereby blocking the court inquiry.trial counsel moved to withdraw as counsel for appellant.
the court offered appellant present counsel an opportunity to present evidence on the issue.counsel declined.rather,she responded that before pressing appellant claim at an evidentiary hearing,she needed to speak with possible witnesses who were alleged to have overheard statements by trial counsel after the verdict.after chiding present counsel for raising a new point well after the scheduled deadline and without adequate preparation,the judge then granted trial counsel motion to withdraw and decided to proceed with the scheduled sentencing,leaving the issues to later proceedings.
appellant then addressed the court.he stated that he never wanted to go to trial but that t he circumstances dragged me to trial.trans.at.he said that he felt that he should have cooperated with the government but that there were people involved in the case that were killing witnesses.trans.at.he noted that if he had cooperated,his brother and would lose their established businesses on staten island and have to move,thereby ruin ing their lives and destroy ing their livelihood.id.
the district court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment.the court based its sentence on a total offense level of,which warranted a range from months to life,and imposed the highest term in the range after considering appellant role in the attempted murders and a murder,charges on which the jury had reached a hung verdict.
appellant appealed,making several claims,one of which is relevant to the present proceeding loss of the acceptance of responsibility reduction in sentence because of constitutionally ineffective assistance of trial counsel.see united states silvestri,wl,at cir.we affirmed appellant conviction and sentence but declined to rule on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim due to the sparse record.id.
on october,appellant timely filed the present motion under.the motion raised a number of claims,only one of which is before us trial counsel failure to provide effective assistance in rendering advice.the memorandum of law accompanying the motion deviated in one respect from the earlier claim on direct appeal concerning the alleged erroneous advice.the harm now alleged to have occurred was not simply the loss of the acceptance of responsibility reduction but rather the failure to accept a plea bargain offered by the government.the relief sought was the reversal of conviction,or in the alternative,that the sentence be vacated.no details were provided as to the plea bargain offered by the government.appellant filed a declaration and an affidavit in support of the motion,the former adopting counsel statements of facts as set forth in the motion and memorandum of law and the latter stating in relevant part that he had been misinformed by trial counsel in the manner noted above.
on november,the district court ordered the government to show cause why appellant petition should not be granted.after both the government reply and appellant traverse were filed,the government wrote to the court requesting that it issue an order directing appellant counsel to provide more detailed facts to enable the government to provide the court with attorney affirmations that would respond to appellant allegations.present counsel replied,suggesting that an evidentiary hearing was the appropriate vehicle.thereafter,without a hearing,the district court issued an order denying the petition.as to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim that is the subject of this appeal,the district court concluded that the appellant had failed to establish that counsel alleged misinformation prejudiced the outcome of his case because i he had persisted in his claims of innocence,ii he had exhibited no intent to accept any offered plea agreement,and iii even assuming that he would have accepted a plea offer,he remained subject to the court consideration of any acquitted charges at sentencing.
on february,we granted appellant a certificate of appealability with respect to the ineffective assistance of counsel claim relating to his rejection of a plea offer.
discussion 
appellant claim on appeal is that the district court erred by not holding an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective assistance of counsel claim asserted in his motion and presumably it is not explicitly argued that he is entitled to the sentence that he could have received had he accepted a plea agreement.
under section of title,united states code,a federal prisoner may move the sentencing court to vacate,set aside,or correct the sentence on the ground that such sentence was illegally imposed.a.the statute further provides that u nless the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief,the court shall grant a prompt hearing thereon,determine the issues and make findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect thereto.b.to warrant a hearing on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,the defendant need establish only that he has a plausible claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,not that he will necessarily succeed on the claim.armienti united states,cir quoting united states tarricone,cir.rule b of the rules governing proceedings further provides that i f it plainly appears from the motion,any attached exhibits,and the record of prior proceedings that the moving party is not entitled to relief,the judge must dismiss the motion.rules governing proceedings for the united states district courts,rule b,foll.
the procedure for determining whether a hearing is necessary is in part analogous to,but in part different from,a summary judgment proceeding.the petitioner motion sets forth his or her legal and factual claims,accompanied by relevant exhibits,an affidavit from the petitioner or others asserting relevant facts within their personal knowledge identifying other sources of relevant evidence.compare rules governing proceedings,rules,b,with.a c see also blackledge allison,d.the district court reviews those materials and relevant portions of the record in the underlying criminal proceeding.compare rules governing proceedings,rules b,a with.c.the court then determines whether,viewing the evidentiary proffers,where credible,and record in the light most favorable to the petitioner,the petitioner,who has the burden,may be able to establish at a hearing a prima facie case for relief.if material facts are in dispute,a hearing should usually be held,and relevant findings of facts made.compare armienti,at remanding for a hearing where appellant alleged several specified instances of attorney deficiencies that were product of specific conflict of interest,united states aiello,cir holding that hearing is appropriate when application includes assertions of fact that a petitioner is in a position to establish by competent evidence,and newfield united states,cir a motion supported by a sufficient affidavit including detailed and controverted issues of fact warrants a hearing,but bald allegations unsupported by evidentiary facts do not,with anderson liberty lobby,d requiring plaintiff present evidence from which a jury might return a favorable verdict in order to have survived summary judgment requirement that he provide a genuine issue of fact for trial.
the analogy to summary judgment is not complete,however.there is no discovery in a section case,as there is in summary judgment proceedings in a civil case.therefore,a petitioner may need only to identify available sources of relevant evidence rather than obtain it as in civil cases or seek a discovery order from the court under rule of the rules governing section proceedings.compare rules governing proceedings,rules b,a discovery requires leave of court,and armienti,at with,and holcomb iona college,cir.
moreover,a district court need not assume the credibility of factual assertions,as it would in civil cases,where the assertions are contradicted by the record in the underlying proceeding.compare contino united states,cir per curiam defendant failed to make a substantial showing that his plea was not voluntary or intelligent or that he received ineffective assistance of counsel where it was clear from the record,including the indictment,the signed plea agreement,and the allocution at the plea proceeding that he understood the nature of charges against him,zhang united states,cir defendant claim that his guilty plea was involuntary because he was unaware of the deportation consequences was insufficient where the judge at the plea allocution put defendant on notice of the consequences,frederick warden,lewisburg corr.facility,cir defendant claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because he did not know the nature of the charges was insufficient where the proceedings at the guilty plea hearing and the plea agreement showed otherwise,newfield,at defendant was not entitled to a hearing on his claims of incompetency at the time of trial where there was no assertion of new information and the trial judge reviewing the petition had ample opportunity to observe the appellant demeanor and behavior in the courtroom,and accardi united states,cir per curiam defendant was not entitled to a hearing where he claimed he was unable to understand the charges against him due to his poor english language skills and that he was incompetent at the time of trial where the trial judge reviewing the petition was familiar with the facts,the record showed that defendant did not need an interpreter and had discussions with his trial attorney in english,and there was no proof of the claimed medical condition,with cioffi averill park cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir when deciding a summary judgment motion in a civil case,all factual ambiguities must be resolved in the party favor and the court may not weigh the evidence,but rather must only determine whether a genuine issue of fact exists for trial.
indeed,for this reason,we have also held that when the judge that tried the underlying proceedings also presides over the section motion,a evidentiary hearing may permissibly dispose of claims where the credibility assessment would inevitably be adverse to the petitioner.
for example,we have so held in a case in which a petitioner raised a claim generic to all defendants who have not taken the stand in their defense at trial,namely,that trial counsel prohibited him from taking the stand.chang united states,cir.in chang,the district court did not hold a full hearing.id.at.rather,it invited trial counsel to respond to the claim.id.at.trial counsel submitted a detailed affidavit contradicting the claim that the petitioner was not advised of his right to testify,detailing conversations between counsel and the petitioner about the advisability of testifying,and explaining why they agreed that it was inadvisable for the petitioner to testify.id.at.we affirmed on the ground that a sufficient hearing had been held to reject the claim.id.at.
we held that in cases involving claims that can be,and are often,made in any case,the judge may properly rely on his or her knowledge of the record and may permissibly forgo a full hearing and instead request letters,documentary evidence,and affidavits to aid in its resolution of the claim.id.at.the trial judge is intimately familiar with the proceedings and the surrounding circumstances.the trial judge is also in a position,based on the knowledge gained in the underlying criminal proceeding and on his or her role as a trier of fact in the habeas proceeding,to hold that the particular petitioner had no chance of overcoming counsel detailed explanation and proving that counsel prohibited testimony in his or her defense.id.the intermediate deciding the motion without the benefit of any supplemental materials and a full hearing with live witnesses avoid s the delay,the needless expenditure of judicial resources,and the burden on trial counsel and the government.id.
finally,our standard of review with respect to a district court decision to hold a hearing and if held,its sufficiency,also differs from summary judgment general de novo review.see paneccasio unisource worldwide,cir.in some cases,such as where the judge who tried the case holds a limited hearing to decide a generic claim,the determination of whether the hearing was sufficient is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.chang,at.in the present case,in which the district court denied any form of an evidentiary hearing,our review of the district court denial of a hearing is for clear error as to issues of fact,such as a district court determination that the record precludes the claim,and de novo for issues of law.harris united states,cir chang,at.because petitioner claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a question of mixed fact and law,our review is de novo.see pham united states,cir chang,at.we turn now to the merits.
to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,a defendant must satisfy two requirements.see strickland washington,d.first,the defendant must show that counsel performance was deficient.id.given the procedural posture of this appeal,we will assume the deficiency of the advice allegedly given,although the record of the sentencing hearing suggests that trial counsel would,if allowed,dispute the claim.second,the defend
