petitioners appellants willis management vermont,willis,and venture reinsurance company,venture,an affiliate of willis collectively,the petitioners,appeal from a memorandum and order and final order of forfeiture entered by the united states district court for the district of vermont william sessions,iii,judge dismissing their petition for an ancillary hearing and rejecting their claim as beneficiaries of a putative constructive trust in defendant kenneth mackay forfeited assets.the district court ruled that the remission provision of i precluded the imposition of a constructive trust in the petitioners favor.it also determined that imposing a constructive trust would be inconsistent with the forfeiture statutory scheme provided in.because we conclude that i does not preclude,as a matter of law,recognizing a constructive trust and because a constructive trust is not inconsistent with the forfeiture statutory scheme,we vacate the petitioners dismissal from the ancillary proceeding,vacate the final order of forfeiture,and remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
kenneth mackay worked for willis,a business that manages captive insurance companies from to.from december to,mackay served as willis senior vice president and had the authority to make payments from willis bank accounts and the accounts of its clients and affiliates to various insurance companies and other businesses.in january,mackay incorporated rcm financial corporation rcm financial,which had an account at people united bank formerly known as chittenden bank from approximately january until early,mackay embezzled money from willis and its clients and diverted that money to his own personal use through the rcm financial account and through other means.mackay used a portion of the embezzled money to build a home in williston,vermont.mackay then obtained a line of credit from people united bank secured by a mortgage on his williston home.mackay used part of this line of credit to buy a condominium in orlando,florida.
on february,willis and venture aware of an ongoing federal investigation into mackay filed a civil action against mackay in vermont state court alleging fraud and other claims.on the same day,willis and venture obtained a writ of attachment on mackay williston and orlando properties.on february,people united bank filed a similar action against mackay,which was consolidated with willis and venture case.
on february,the united states filed a criminal complaint against mackay in the united states district court for the district of vermont.that same day,the united states filed civil forfeiture complaints against mackay williston and orlando properties,which complaints were stayed while the criminal action proceeded.on september,the united states filed an information charging mackay with wire fraud,pursuant to,with tax evasion,pursuant to,and with money laundering,pursuant to.a criminal forfeiture allegation included in the information against mackay sought forfeiture of both his williston and orlando properties pursuant to a.forfeiture under that section is governed by the forfeiture provisions of.see b.on september,mackay pleaded guilty to the information and agreed to forfeit his two properties and at least million to the united states.the final,amended judgment of conviction identified willis as the victim of mackay crimes and ordered restitution in the amount of.
the district court issued preliminary orders of forfeiture on mackay williston and orlando properties on november.in response,willis and venture filed a petition for a criminal ancillary proceeding pursuant to n,claiming that they were the real owners of the properties because mackay exclusively used funds stolen from willis to purchase the homes.people united bank also filed a petition for an ancillary proceeding,claiming an interest in both properties as a result of mackay outstanding of indebtedness on his line of credit.amy mackay,kenneth wife,filed a petition claiming an interest in both the williston and orlando properties.creative sound,a creditor of mackay,sent a letter to the united states attorney asserting an interest in the williston property,which letter was construed by the district court as a petition for an ancillary proceeding.finally,the town of williston filed a petition asserting an interest in the williston property as a result of mackay unpaid property taxes.
the united states subsequently moved to dismiss willis and venture from the ancillary proceeding on the ground that the petitioners could not show that they had a legal interest in the property pursuant to n a the district court granted the united states motion and also dismissed amy mackay and creative sound from the proceeding by a memorandum and order dated february.the district court rejected willis and venture argument that they were the beneficiaries of a putative constructive trust in the properties because the properties were purchased with money stolen from willis.the district court first explained that a constructive trust is an equitable remedy that should only be used when an adequate legal remedy is unavailable.the court then determined that united states ribadeneira,cir per curiam,supports the conclusion that the remission provision in i is an adequate legal remedy that preclude s the imposition of a constructive trust.united states mackay,cr,slip.op.at.the district court did note that in united states schwimmer,cir,we held that a constructive trust could serve as a legal interest superior to the defendant interest under an analogous forfeiture statute.the district court,however,decline d to follow schwimmer and instead follow ed ribadeneira because it determined that as borne out in the later ribadeneira case,an approach allowing for a constructive trust when a legal remedy is available is inconsistent with the statutory remedial scheme.mackay,cr,slip.op.at quoting united states bcci holdings lux.the district court therefore declined to impose a constructive trust and found that,as a result,willis and venture had no legal interest in the property that would allow them to contest the forfeiture of mackay assets.accordingly,the court dismissed willis and venture from the ancillary proceeding.
the district court ultimately entered a final order of forfeiture on april,based on a settlement agreement reached among the remaining parties.the settlement provided principally that people united bank and the town of williston would be paid their debts owed,plus interest,while the remainder of the proceeds from the sale of the property would be forfeited to the united states.willis and venture now appeal from the final order of forfeiture and the district court underlying rulings,including the memorandum and order dismissing their petition for an ancillary proceeding.for its part,people united bank asserts the alternative argument that any error by the district court in dismissing the petitioners from the ancillary proceeding was harmless because people united bank interest in the properties should be accorded at least equal priority with any constructive trust recognized in favor of the petitioners.finally,willis and venture urge that the district court also erred by accepting people united bank status as a valid claimant and by entering the final order of forfeiture pursuant to the remaining parties settlement agreement without first holding an evidentiary hearing.
discussion 
the parties disagree as to the proper standard of review on appeal.the united states and people united bank argue that the district court exercised its discretion in not imposing the equitable remedy of a constructive trust and that therefore an abuse of discretion standard applies.willis and venture,on the other hand,argue that because the district court denied the constructive trust as a matter of law,our review should be de novo.
it is true that we have applied an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a district court denial of equitable relief.see sharkey lasmo aul,cir.however,t he abuse of discretion standard is used to evaluate the court application of the facts to the appropriate legal standard,and the factual findings and legal conclusions underlying such decisions are evaluated under the clearly erroneous and de novo standards,respectively.garcia yonkers sch,cir internal quotation marks,ellipsis,and alteration omitted.in this case,the district court reached two legal conclusions on the basis of which it declined to impose a constructive trust.first,the court determined that ribadeneira supports the conclusion that the statutory remission provision of i is an adequate legal remedy that precludes the imposition of a constructive trust.second,after recognizing our potentially conflicting schwimmer decision,the court decline d to follow schwimmer and instead follow ed ribadeneira because it believed that an approach allowing for a constructive trust when a legal remedy is available is inconsistent with the statutory remedial scheme.mackay,cr,slip.op.at quoting bcci holdings,at.as a result,the district court concluded that a constructive trust is inappropriate in this instance.id.because the district court relied on its view of issues of law in ultimately declining to recognize a constructive trust in this case,we review its decision de novo.
subsection n of title of the united states code provides that 
a ny person,other than the defendant,asserting a legal interest in property which has been ordered forfeited to the united states may petition the court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of his alleged interest in the property.
that subsection further provides that 
i f,after the hearing,the court determines that the petitioner has established by a preponderance of the evidence that 
a the petitioner has a legal right,title,or interest in the property,and such right,title,or interest renders the order of forfeiture invalid in whole or in part because the right,title,or interest was vested in the petitioner rather than the defendant or was superior to any right,title,or interest of the defendant at the time of the commission of the acts which gave rise to the forfeiture of the property under this section or 
b the petitioner is a bona fide purchaser for value of the right,title,or interest in the property and was at the time of purchase reasonably without cause to believe that the property was subject to forfeiture under this section 
the court shall amend the order of forfeiture in accordance with its determination.
n.ancillary proceedings pursuant to n are governed by federal rule of criminal procedure c,which provides that 
in general.if,as prescribed by statute,a third party files a petition asserting an interest in the property to be forfeited,the court must conduct an ancillary proceeding 
a in the ancillary proceeding,the court may,on motion,dismiss the petition for lack of standing,for failure to state a claim,or for any other lawful reason.for purposes of the motion,the facts set forth in the petition are assumed to be true.
subsection i of title of the united states code provides that,once property is forfeited to the united states,
the attorney general is authorized to 
grant petitions for mitigation or remission of forfeiture,restore forfeited property to victims of a violation of this subchapter,or take any other action to protect the rights of innocent persons which is in the interest of justice and which is not inconsistent with the provisions of this section.
in this case,mackay forfeited his interest in the williston and orlando properties to the united states pursuant to his plea agreement and the preliminary order of forfeiture entered by the district court in november.in response to that preliminary order,willis and venture petitioned for an ancillary hearing pursuant to n,asserting that the court should recognize a constructive trust on the properties in their favor and that the properties should not be forfeited to the united states.the united states responded by moving to dismiss the petition pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure c a on the ground that a constructive trust in favor of willis and venture should not be recognized and that willis and venture therefore had no legal interest in the properties superior to mackay interest such that the order of forfeiture should be amended by the court.
a motion to dismiss a petition in a forfeiture proceeding prior to discovery or a hearing should be treated like a motion to dismiss a civil complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b.pacheco serendensky,cir.therefore,a petition should not be dismissed if the petitioner has stated enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.see bell atl.twombly,d.in reviewing the petition,we will assume that the facts set forth in the petition are true,see.c a,however,we are not required to accept any legal conclusions included in the petition.ashcroft iqbal,d t he tenet that a court must accept as true all of the allegations contained in a complaint is inapplicable to legal conclusions.
state law determines a petitioner legal interest in the property at issue.see pacheco,at applying new york law to the question whether the petitioner was a bona fide purchaser for value.under vermont law,a constructive trust is a tool often used by courts to prevent unjust enrichment.legault legault,internal quotation marks omitted.it is an equitable remedy that will arise whenever title is acquired through a confidence which has been abused.see also savage walker.in considering whether to recognize a constructive trust,a court inquiry turns on whether,in light of the totality of circumstances,it is against equity and good conscience to allow the defendant to retain what is sought to be recovered.legault,at,internal citation omitted.
we have held that a constructive trust qualifies as a legal right,title,or interest in the property that may be a superior interest to a defendant interest for the purposes of a forfeiture statute analogous to n a.see schwimmer,at,holding that legal interest in l means one that arises under the law and not one that is traditionally enforceable at law,and therefore includes constructive trusts.in this case,the district court relied on our subsequent decision in united states ribadeneira,per curiam,for the proposition that while schwimmer teaches that a constructive trust may qualify under n a,when there is a satisfactory legal remedy available,namely i,the court should not impose an equitable remedy.mackay,cr,slip.op.at.
in ribadeneira,customers of an exchange house that the defendants had used to launder money petitioned for an ancillary proceeding pursuant to n,claiming an interest in the defendants forfeited money.united states ribadeneira.the petitioners had purchased checks from the exchange house that they held when the defendants accounts were seized by the government.id.the district court first ruled that,like bank depositors,the were general creditors of the exchange house who did not have a claim in the specific property to be forfeited and therefore did not have a legal interest as required by n.id.at.the district court also declined to impose a constructive trust in the petitioners favor.it noted that i t is hornbook law that before a court may impose equitable relief,it must find there to be no adequate legal remedy available.id.at citing morales trans world airlines,d.the district court concluded that the remission process provided in i was not only a satisfactory,but also the appropriate,legal remedy for the petitioners.id.
this court affirmed the district court judgment in ribadeneira on the grounds that the petitioners had no legal interest in the defendants property as required by n.ribadeneira,at.in a footnote,we also rejected the petitioners argument that they should be recognized as beneficiaries of a constructive trust.we explained that the district court correctly declined to establish a constructive trust on the petitioners behalf both because the petitioners have not met the elements required by new york law for a constructive trust and because i provides a legal remedy which obviates the need for application of an equitable remedy.id.at.
in this case,the district court erred in relying on the ribadeneira footnote to conclude that i provides an adequate legal re
