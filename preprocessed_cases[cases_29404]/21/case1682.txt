background 
a.the investigation 
at approximately one in the morning on april,shlomo koenig,a detective on the computer crime task forces of both the rockland county sheriff department and the united states secret service,connected to the internet and entered a chat room titled.the detective testified at rowe trial that the chat room was a room which i known from prior experience where there is trading of child porn.the detective also testified that the name of the room is used basically in the pedophile community.once in the chat room,the detective came across a posting that read b fserve trigger tun ratio offering pre pics.read the rules.of slots in use emphasis in original.this text had been posted by a person with the screen name tunlvd,a name later determined to belong to rowe.
according to the government undisputed explanation,b indicated that the software program rowe used was panzer version fserve trigger tun indicated that tun was the password needed to access the file server containing the images on rowe computer.ratio indicated that users wishing to download images from rowe computer had to upload an equivalent number of images to his computer.offering pre pics indicated that the images available on rowe computer were pictures of boys and girls.read the rules indicated that a user wishing to download images had first to read the rules of use.finally,of slots in use indicated that two users could access rowe computer at the same time,and that one user was doing so when detective koenig viewed the posting.
when the detective typed the trigger,he was linked to rowe computer.once connected,he was presented with rowe rules of use,which provided 
by entering this fserve you are agreeing that you are not a law officer or affiliated with the law in any way and do not hold this fserve nor owner there of accountable for anything you upload or download.if u do i guess i just screwed if you do not agree to the above leave now 
now for the rules 
up only pre no clothes no pube hair 
if your pic wo up 
i prolly have it already 
im still sorting so there maybe stuff i havent pulled yet 
after reading these rules,detective koenig reviewed and copied a text list of the images available for download from rowe computer.that list named files such as.jpg and incest kiddy.when the detective attempted to download an image without also uploading one,as the rules required,he was disconnected from rowe computer.
after verifying that the posting in the chat room linked to rowe computer and that tunlvd was rowe,in june secret service agents executed a search warrant at rowe home.among the items seized was a computer hard drive found to contain approximately images and videos.as the agents were searching rowe home,he spoke with one of them and,after being informed of his right to remain silent,admitted that his screen name was tunlvd,that he was likely in the chat room at one in the morning on april,that he knew it was illegal to download or upload images and that he had downloaded approximately such images and had uploaded an equivalent number from his computer to other users.
b.the proceedings below 
the following day,june,the government filed a criminal complaint in the southern district of new york charging rowe with violating c.in february,a federal grand jury sitting in the southern district of new york returned a indictment charging rowe with violating c.
prior to trial,rowe moved for a transfer of both constitutional and convenience the southern district of new york to the eastern district of kentucky,in which rowe resided.in his brief on the motion,rowe anticipated the government arguing that venue would be proper in any district from which one might read rowe online posting.rowe argued that such a rule would give the prosecution tremendous and improper freedom within which to determine as a matter of its own discretion where to bring a case.at the hearing on the motion,rowe emphasized that under such a theory,venue for prosecuting criminal internet advertisers would be proper any place in the world.
in deciding rowe motion,the district judge first noted that article iii s venue provision essentially requires a determination of where the crime occurred.the judge next observed that for offenses committed in more than one judicial district,venue is proper,both under the constitution and under the federal rules of criminal procedure,in any district in which such offense was begun,continued or completed.that a quotation from title of the united states code section,subparagraph the judge then noted this circuit substantial contacts test for determining proper venue,and analyzed the facts of rowe case under the test factors.responding to rowe contention that locating venue in the southern district gives the prosecution improper discretion in determining where to prosecute a crime,the judge reject ed that argument.
specifically,the judge concluded that this crime occurred in any district in which the advertisement appeared that is to say,anywhere where the internet chat room was accessible and was actually accessed by anybody.after thus finding venue in the southern district constitutionally proper,the judge also denied rowe motion to transfer venue for the sake of convenience or in the interests of justice.
rowe was tried before a jury in november.when the government rested its case,rowe moved for judgment as a matter of law on the argument that the posting identified in the indictment does not make a reference to child pornography t he charged conduct is only whether or not that specific posting amounts to a specific solicitation for exchange of child pornography,and the defendant asserts that it does not.the district judge denied the motion,finding that the government evidence ca be viewed in isolation the posting invites the reader to amplify the statement by reference to rowe rules,which are adequate,in the court views,to indicate that there is an intention to offer or receive only with no clothes and no pubic hair.the district judge concluded that these exhibits are adequate to charge validly and prove the offense of the indictment the district judge also refused to direct acquittal on the argument that the posting did not travel through interstate commerce.
the defense put its case on and rowe eventually took the stand,claiming that his posting in the chat room was not an advertisement to exchange child pornography,but a link intended for someone with the screen name babyk to use to gain access to rowe computer.according to rowe,babyk was a woman who claimed to be the katie from a website called katie world.rowe testified that he was totally infatuated and in love with babyk three days of meeting her in the chat room.rowe further testified that babyk told him that she had been raped by four men,and that she sent rowe the pictures paralleling what had happened to her so that rowe could understand her.rowe implied that the images found on his computer had been uploaded by babyk,to whom he had given complete,total access to his machine.the posting placed in the chat room was merely,rowe claimed,a convenient means of assuring babyk access to rowe computer the message that the secret service agents referred to it as an advertisement.it was a message between me and babyk.and i never in any way ever considered it an advertisement.rowe did not explain why,if this was the case,his posting was offering pre pics emphasis in original,why a reader of the posting should read the rules or why there was of slots in use.
the jury found rowe guilty.at sentencing,the district judge and rowe attorney both expressed the belief that rowe crime carried a mandatory minimum of years in prison.the district judge voiced his displeasure with this,stating that statutory minimums generally create a problem and that this may be a classic case where the issue of proportionality is presented.the judge sentenced rowe to years in prison followed by three years of supervised release.the judge also ordered rowe to undergo treatment and forbade him from having any deliberate contact with any child under years of age without the permission of a probation officer.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,rowe argues principally that his posting was not a notice or advertisement within the meaning of c,that venue was improper and that his sentence of years in prison violates the eighth amendment.we consider these arguments in turn.
was rowe posting a notice or advertisement under c 
rowe argues that his posting does not meet the definition of an advertisement prohibited by c,and that his conviction must therefore be reversed.the government apparently asserts that this is an argument regarding the sufficiency of the evidence,and thus urges a deferential standard of review.we believe rowe argument is more accurately characterized as a purely legal question of statutory interpretation,and we therefore review the district judge ruling de novo.see,field united states,cir.
rowe placed his posting b fserve trigger tun ratio offering pre pics.read the rules.of slots in use emphasis in original in the chat room.the government maintains that this chatroom was devoted to the exchange of child pornography images,and that typical postings included anybody with baby sex pics for trade and young teen amateur movie cum,gag,teen gangbang,and more rowe does not dispute the government characterization,and effectively concedes it by arguing that the context of the chat room and the presence of other explicit advertisements for child pornography in the chat room do not make the posting an advertisement prohibited by c.rowe contends,as he did unsuccessfully below,that nothing in his posting indicates that pornography is involved of any kind his posting in the chat room,rowe asserts,is only an advertisement offering pictures of.
contrary to what rowe would have us hold,only offering pictures of children in a chat room peppered with queries such as anybody with baby sex pics for trade is sufficient to constitute a notice or advertisement within the meaning of c.as the government aptly characterizes it,rowe decision to place into this forum his notice that he was offering pics could have had only a single advise others that he had child pornography available for trade.
rowe insists that his posting is beyond the scope of c because it does not by its very terms indicate it is seeking or offering materials of a pornographic nature.rowe cites no authority to support this proposition,which is belied by c plain language,case law and common sense.section c makes it a crime to knowingly make,print,or publish any notice or advertisement seeking or offering any visual depiction,if the production of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and such visual depiction is of such conduct.c a.as a recent district court decision in this circuit correctly observed,there is no requirement that an advertisement must specifically state that it offers or seeks a visual depiction to violate c a n o particular magic words or phrases need to be included.united states,d,quoting jury charge,aff in relevant part,cir.
the question here is thus whether rowe knowingly offered or sought images depicting minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct.there is no doubt that he did.section c is not so narrow that it captures only those who state,i have images for trade.we agree with the government that if that were the case,then all a distributor of child pornograph y need do to avoid c is use a modicum of sub t lety in describing the images sought or offered.we further agree that congress did not intend its bar on advertising for child pornography to be so easily evaded.we therefore affirm the district judge ruling that rowe posting was a notice or advertisement within the meaning of c.
was venue in the southern district proper 
rowe argues that venue in the southern district of new york was improper and thus that the district judge erred in denying his motion to transfer the case to the eastern district of kentucky,where rowe resided and used his computer to post the advertisement at issue.the government maintains that both venue and the district judge ruling were proper.we review de novo.see,united states geibel,cir.
the question of what a proper venue is for a c prosecution is one of first impression in this circuit.it appears,in fact,that no other federal court has yet ruled on this matter.
we begin with the observation that v enue in federal criminal cases is controlled by a complicated interplay of constitutional provisions,statutes,and rules.charles alan wright,federal practice and procedure ed.the constitution mentions venue in two places.first,article iii provides that the trial of all crimes shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed const.art.iii,cl.second,the sixth amendment guarantees that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial,by an impartial jury of the state and district wherein the crime shall have been committed const.amend.vi.these provisions have been read to afford defendants a right to be tried in the district in which the charged crime was committed.fed.prac.proc.in particular,the case law suggests that these provisions were designed to protect defendants from the bias and inconvenience that may attend trial in a forum other than one in which the crime was committed.see,united states johnson.noting the unfairness of requiring trial before a tribunal favorable to the prosecution as well as the difficulties,financial and otherwise,of being tried in places remote from home united states cores,d the provision for trial in the vicinity of the crime is a safeguard against the unfairness and hardship involved when an accused is prosecuted in a remote place.in addition to these constitutional provisions,there are various substantive statutes that lay venue for particular crimes,as well as federal rule of criminal procedure,which provides that u nless a statute or these rules permit otherwise,the government must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was committed.
in this circuit,we pointed out some time ago that 
there is no single defined policy or mechanical test to determine constitutional venue.rather,the test is best described as a substantial contacts rule that takes into account a number of site of the defendant acts,the elements and nature of the crime,the locus of the effect of the criminal conduct,and the suitability of each district for accurate factfinding 
united states reed,cir.in united states,d,the supreme court instructed that a district court determining the suitability of a particular venue must initially identify the conduct constituting the offense the nature of the crime and then discern the location of the commission of the criminal acts.id.at.
as for the conduct constituting the offense,c makes it a crime to knowingly make,print,or publish,or cause to be made,printed,or published,any notice or advertisement seeking or offering child pornography.c a.the statute requires that violators knew or had reason to know that their notice or advertisement would be
