jose cardona pled guilty to conspiring to distribute narcotics near three public housing projects and possessing a firearm in furtherance of the drug trafficking offense.after accusing his first lawyer of coercing him into accepting a plea agreement,cardona was appointed new counsel for sentencing purposes.on appeal,cardona argues that the district court assignment of new counsel,who also represented a in the drug trafficking conspiracy,resulted in a conflict of interest for counsel number two.he also claims that the district court erred in failing to hold a foster hearing to address the purported conflict.cardona insists that these errors require us to vacate his sentence and remand the case for resentencing with new counsel.but because there was no clear error with the sentencing court fact finding and no actual conflict of interest,we affirm the sentence imposed below.
background 
on april,cardona was indicted,along with,for his involvement in a drug trafficking conspiracy which operated out of three public housing projects in mayag√ºez,puerto rico.several months later,cardona pled guilty to counts one and six of the indictment pursuant to a plea agreement the agreement.count one charged him with conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute various amounts of heroin,cocaine,crack cocaine,and marijuana within a thousand feet of the three public housing projects,in violation of a,and.count six charged him with carrying and using a firearm in relation to the drug trafficking offense,in violation of c a and.the remaining charges against him counts two through five were dismissed pursuant to the agreement.
by the terms of the agreement,the parties agreed to calculate cardona total offense level at,but made no stipulation as to cardona criminal history category the parties agreed to recommend a sentence at the lower end of the sentencing guidelines the guidelines range for the possession count and the mandatory minimum of five years for the firearm charge.additionally,cardona agreed to waive his right to appeal the judgment and sentence if sentenced in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement.and the government agreed that it would not seek any further adjustments to or departures from cardona offense level outside of the enhancements already applied.
on august,days after cardona change of plea,but before sentencing,cardona attorney at the time,peter diaz,moved to withdraw because cardona had accused diaz falsely,in diaz opinion of coercing him into pleading guilty.in response to diaz motion,the district court set a hearing date september,to learn the details surrounding cardona claims and diaz desire to withdraw.the district court requested that miguel oppenheimer oppenheimer,an attorney for one of cardona drug trafficking,attend the hearing to assist if need be.
at the proceeding,cardona sought to withdraw his guilty plea.as per the court instruction,oppenheimer interviewed cardona and diaz to better understand the circumstances surrounding cardona attempts to withdraw his plea and diaz request to withdraw as defense counsel.after meeting with both cardona and diaz,oppenheimer summarized their respective positions for the court and then questioned both individuals under oath.cardona testified that he felt pressured to either accept the plea deal or go to trial and receive a life sentence if convicted.on the other hand,diaz stated that he met with cardona on multiple occasions to discuss the charges against him,denied cardona allegations of coercion,and stated that although cardona was unhappy with the amount of time offered in the agreement,cardona still chose to plead guilty and never indicated that he was hesitant to accept the plea or that he did not want to sign the agreement.rounding out the dispute,the government argued that cardona request to withdraw his plea should be denied because he was essentially attempting to his plea deal as the government saw it,he still wanted to plead guilty he just wanted a better deal.
after hearing from cardona,diaz,and the government,the district court denied cardona request to withdraw his guilty plea,finding his allegations against his attorney to be totally frivolous and ultimately granted diaz request to withdraw,assigning oppenheimer as cardona new counsel for sentencing purposes.upon oppenheimer appointment,the government vocalized concerns regarding a potential conflict of interest arising from a murder that cardona had allegedly ordered from jail that was ultimately executed by a who was also represented by oppenheimer.the government opined that this might cause a conflict because oppenheimer might want to argue one way for one defendant and another way for another defendant and accordingly remarked that a foster hearing might be necessary.however,the court did not believe that an actual conflict existed,noting that neither the agreement nor any facts included in the agreement contained anything regarding the murder and that the murder was not at issue in cardona case.
in any event,oppenheimer advised the court that he would check with cardona to ensure that there were no potential conflicts and he would let the court know if a foster hearing was necessary.oppenheimer never informed the court of any conflict and proceeded to represent cardona for sentencing purposes.on december,after cardona had already been sentenced for his role in the drug trafficking conspiracy pursuant to his own plea agreement and two days before cardona sentencing hearing,oppenheimer filed a sentencing memorandum reiterating,among other things,cardona wish to recant his guilty plea.
on the day of the hearing,cardona pressed his contention that he was coerced into pleading guilty.but after hearing cardona reiterated plaint,the court reminded cardona that it had already denied his request to withdraw his plea and would not reconsider its decision.
after the court reaffirmed its ruling,the government,concerned about cardona continued attempts to withdraw his guilty plea,decided to introduce evidence of cardona role as a leader and his use of a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy the court then accepted probation recommendation of an applicable criminal history category of iii rejecting cardona push for a lower one and determined the appropriate offense level was rather than,resulting in a guidelines range of months for count one nonetheless,consistent with the plea agreement,the government recommended a sentence of months for count one and the mandatory minimum of months for count six.
rejecting this recommendation as inadequate,the court sentenced cardona to a sentence of months on count one and months on count six,to be served consecutively.
this timely appeal followed 
discussion 
cardona contends that the district court denied him his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel because the court failed to hold a foster hearing and oppenheimer labored under a conflict of interest the government argues that the failure to hold a foster hearing resulted in no reversible error because there was no actual conflict of interest.where an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is premised on counsel alleged conflict of interest,we review the ultimate issue de novo,but defer to the district court subsidiary fact findings unless they are clearly erroneous.united states,cir.citing united states,cir.
under the sixth amendment,a defendant has a right to representation.united states,cir.a lawyer can represent multiple defendants,but not if the joint representation gives rise to a conflict of interests adversely affecting the lawyer performance for then there would be a sixth amendment violation.id.
and given the ubiquitous and insidious risks of multiple representation,the sixth amendment imposes a duty on trial courts to investigate a defendant timely objections to joint representation and to inquire into the propriety of multiple representation whenever the trial court knows or reasonably should know that a particular conflict exists.id.at.federal rule of criminal procedure c expands these duties by requiring an inquiry into the possibility of a conflict in all cases where defendants retain the same counsel.id.at.specifically,under rule c,u nless there is good cause to believe that no conflict of interest is likely to arise,the court is required to take appropriate measures to protect each defendant right to counsel.fed.crim.c.rule c requires a district court to inquire into each instance of joint representation of multiple defendants,and requires the court to advise each defendant of his right to separate counsel.united states,cir.the timing and form of this inquiry is left to the discretion of the court.see foster,at.
if a satisfactory inquiry does not appear on the record,the government has the burden of persuasion of demonstrating that prejudice to the defendant was improbable.united states mazzaferro,cir.citing foster,at.if a satisfactory inquiry was held,the defendant bears the burden of persuasion that he was deprived of a fair trial resulting from a conflict of interest arising from the joint representation.id.
here,no foster inquiry was held.however,even if we assume that a foster inquiry was required,the government has sufficiently demonstrated that any prejudice to cardona was improbable because there was no actual conflict of interest 
as mentioned above,the joint representation of does not in itself constitute a per se violation of the sixth amendment right to representation.see burger kemp,cuyler sullivan,holding that multiple representation does not violate the sixth amendment unless it gives rise to a conflict of interest and a reviewing court can not presume that the possibility for conflict has resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel.indeed,t he sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is violated when an actual conflict of interest adversely affects counsel representation.bucuvalas united states,cir.citing cuyler,at.and a defendant who raised no objection at trial or at the district court below must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.united states,cir.citing cuyler,at.to establish an actual conflict of interest,a defendant must show that the attorney could have pursued a plausible alternative defense strategy,and the alternative strategy was inherently in conflict with or not undertaken due to the attorney other interests or loyalties.id.citing united states,cir.in other words,cardona can prevail only if there was a plausible alternative defense strategy that was either foreclosed or inhibited by the joint representation.united states lachman,cir.citing united states,cir,cert.denied sub nom.united states.if cardona can demonstrate that some plausible alternative defense strategy or tactic might have been pursued,h e need not show that the defense would necessarily have been successful if it had been used,but merely that it possessed sufficient substance to be a viable alternative.brien united states,cir.citing foxworth wainwright,cir.
but speculative or theoretical conflicts of interests do not amount to a sixth amendment violation.see,at finding appellant claim of a conflict of interest to be based on mere speculation and holding that a theoretical or merely speculative conflict of interest will not invoke the per se rule citing united states aeillo,cir.brien,at holding that the tactics the appellant suggests that his attorney could have pursued appear to be merely hypothetical choices that in reality could not have benefited the appellant and were often not in any conflict with his attorney other loyalties cuyler,at noting that the mere possibility of a conflict is not sufficient to establish a violation of a defendant right to representation and that a defendant must show that his counsel actively represented conflicting interests in order to establish an actual conflict.
cardona begins by conjuring up three hypothetical situations which he contends could have given rise to a conflict of interest.first,he theorizes that if the government had sought to nullify the plea agreement given his perceived breach presumably based on his attempts to withdraw his guilty plea,this may have resulted in a trial where he might have had to defend against murder allegations.second,he suggests that if the court had allowed him to withdraw his guilty plea,and if he had then chosen to plead guilty without a plea agreement,he may have had to defend against a cross reference guideline for the murder pursuant to ussg.and third,he hypothesizes that even if his plea agreement remained intact,he may have had to defend against a cross reference at the recommendation of probation.
but even cardona concedes that the conflicts he complains of did not materialize.the government never moved to find cardona in breach of his plea agreement despite his continued attempts to withdraw his guilty plea,and the court repeatedly denied cardona multiple attempts to withdraw his plea a ruling he does not contest on appeal.and with that plea agreement impermeable below,cardona never faced trial and he never,under any other contrivance he imagines,had to defend against a ussg cross reference guideline for murder.because none of the hypothetical situations he outlines actually occurred,there was no opportunity for his attorney at the time to pursue any plausible alternative defense strategy that was either foreclosed or inhibited by oppenheimer joint representation.lachman,at 
as w e have long ago cautioned,where the conflict relies on some attenuated hypothesis having little consequence to the adequacy of representation,brien,at,we will not grant an undeserved windfall to defendants by automatically vacating convictions,at citations omitted see also united states newton,cir.rejecting a rule of automatic reversal in cases where a defense attorney conflict of interest does not adversely affect counsel performance,observing that such a rule makes little policy sense quoting mickens taylor.that is so because the sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel has been accorded not for its own sake,but because of the effect it has on the ability of the accused to receive a fair trial.mickens,at quoting united states cronic.where there is no conflict of interest and thus no effect on counsel representation or a defendant fair trial interests,there is no sixth amendment violation.see newton,at.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm the sentence of the court below.
as this sentencing appeal follows a guilty plea,we glean the relevant facts from the colloquy,the unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report psi report,and the record of the relevant disposition hearing s.united states vargas,cir.
the offense level at was based on the following a base offense level of under ussg c and a plus levels under ussg c for his role as a leader,organizer,manager,or supervisor in the drug organization minus levels for acceptance of responsibility.
a foster hearing requires a trial court t o comment on some of the risks confronted where defendants are jointly represented to insure that defendants are aware of such risks,and to inquire diligently whether they have discussed the risks with their attorney,and whether they understand that they may retain separate counsel,or if qualified,may have such counsel appointed by the court and paid for by the states foster,cir.
although the government introduced evidence of cardona role as a leader and his use of a firearm in furtherance of the conspiracy at sentencing,this was only in response to cardona continued attempts to withdraw his guilty plea.the government made clear that it did not intend to violate the agreement and only sought to introduce the evidence to show that cardona indeed possessed firearms and was a leader,contrary to his plea withdrawal assertions.the government never asked the court to find cardona in breach of the agreement.indeed,at sentencing,the government recommended an offense level and sentence in accordance with the terms of the agreement and did not argue for any additional enhancements that were not provided for in the agreement.the sentencing judge also noted before allowing the government to introduce the evidence that it was not a violation of the plea agreement to do so.
