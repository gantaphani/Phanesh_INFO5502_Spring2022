defendant terrence glaum appeals from his conviction and sentence for participating in a marijuana distribution conspiracy.he raises several claims of error.we affirm.
background 
we state the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.see united states diaz,cir.
glaum joins the conspiracy 
the conspiracy underlying this prosecution operated to distribute marijuana throughout the united states.the head of the conspiracy was a man known only as jefe.he raised large crops of marijuana for shipment across the border.an individual known as the old man or dad worked under jefe as his chief distributor.the old man received large shipments of marijuana from jefe to distribute to other dealers,including anthony salsberry,who operated out of san diego.salsberry,in turn,would distribute the marijuana to other smaller dealers,who would sell the drugs to users.among salsberry customers were an individual in new york,ralph martino,and two individuals in maine,ronnie kerrigan and paul sekenski.
as part of his operation,salsberry employed glaum,sheila case,to assist him in shipping the marijuana.in the middle of,case asked salsberry if he could put glaum to work.salsberry agreed and provided glaum with approximately fifty pounds of marijuana to sell in arizona.in addition to his work distributing marijuana,glaum assisted salsberry in packaging the drugs.working out of his garage,glaum weighed,shrink wrapp ed and vacuum seal ed marijuana to prepare it for shipment.as compensation,salsberry paid glaum a percentage of the profits.
at approximately the same time that glaum started working for salsberry,the old man offered salsberry a load of marijuana to distribute.after a portion of the load was smuggled across the border,salsberry obtained a sample to send to martino to gauge his interest in purchasing the load.
in,after receiving word from martino that he was interested,salsberry met with jefe and the old man in san diego to discuss the martino deal.at this meeting,jefe and the old man told salsberry that only one ton would be available immediately and that the other ton would be placed on hold salsberry concluded the meeting by telling his superiors that he would organize the transportation of the load to martino.
salsberry knew that martino could arrange to transport the shipment himself,but salsberry preferred to find an alternate method so that he could charge martino a higher fee.in a subsequent conversation with glaum,salsberry learned that glaum had access to several trucks which could be used to ship the marijuana to new york.
soon after this conversation,salsberry attended another meeting with jefe and the old man.this time glaum also attended,and salsberry introduced him to the heads of the organization.at this meeting,salsberry assured the old man and jefe that glaum was capable of organizing the transportation for the martino deal but that he could not begin the transport for two weeks.the participants therefore agreed that for two weeks the deal would remain on hold.
salsberry arrest and cooperation 
on november,during the hiatus in the martino deal,salsberry was arrested after one of his drivers turned him in to authorities.after his arrest,salsberry was incarcerated in san diego.from jail,salsberry called glaum to check on the martino deal and to inform him of his status.while salsberry was incarcerated,he spoke to glaum nearly every day.during these calls,glaum assured salsberry that he would let him down and that he wanted to keep things going.the two eventually agreed that glaum would carry on salsberry business while salsberry was in jail.
on november,glaum sent his attorney,phil gagnon,to meet with salsberry in jail.gagnon served as an intermediary between glaum and salsberry,meeting with salsberry on several occasions.at one of their meetings,salsberry provided gagnon with ronnie kerrigan and the old man telephone numbers.
on january,salsberry decided to cooperate with the government.soon afterwards,drug enforcement agency dea agent paul wolf traveled from maine to california to debrief salsberry.as part of his cooperation agreement,salsberry agreed to remain in contact with glaum and gagnon and to provide glaum with wolf pager number.eventually,salsberry gave glaum the pager number,pretending that it belonged to paul sekenski.
c.the sting operation 
wolf returned to maine from meeting with salsberry on january.two days later,he received an electronic page from glaum.in their introductory call,glaum identified himself as a friend of salsberry and asked wolf if he wanted to discuss doing some business.glaum said that he soon would be traveling to maine to bring drugs to ronnie kerrigan and that he would be able to deliver drugs to wolf at that time.wolf told him that he would have to check him out before placing an order.glaum invited wolf to call him when he was ready to deal.
on january,wolf called glaum.after glaum explained how he had become associated with salsberry,wolf broached the subject of the martino deal.wolf asked glaum if he knew martino.glaum stated that he knew of him but that he knew dad real well.at the conclusion of the conversation,glaum offered to send wolf a small shipment of marijuana.
on january,wolf and glaum negotiated the smaller shipment that they had initially discussed on january.glaum agreed to send wolf a load.wolf,in turn,rented a mail drop box to receive the shipment at a mail boxes in saco,maine.on february,wolf provided the address to glaum,and glaum told him to expect the drugs to arrive in a package appearing to contain candles.
on february,glaum and wolf again discussed the shipment.this time they discussed payment.wolf agreed to send half of the money immediately and to pay the rest when they met.in their next conversation,on february,they discussed the possibility of a larger shipment.glaum offered to send a sample of the larger shipment or to bring it to maine when he visited kerrigan.he told wolf that he had just obtained three hun dred pounds of marijuana and that the drugs were dad thing and were all dad.
wolf received the shipment on february.wolf called that day to inform glaum that the shipment had arrived.the next conversation between wolf and glaum took place on february,during which wolf told glaum that martino was kinda anxious about the larger deal.
at this point,wolf arranged for dea agent ralph caruso to pose as martino,in order to expand the investigation.on february,wolf told glaum that he had shared some of the shipment with martino and that,as a result,martino wanted to meet to finalize the deal.wolf asked glaum if he could give martino his telephone number.glaum agreed.
the investigation then shifted to san diego.caruso and dea agent judy gustafson,who was posing as martino girlfriend,met with glaum on february.glaum told caruso that he had arranged to transport the drugs.at their next meeting on march,glaum insisted that caruso provide immediate payment for the shipment the dea was unwilling to provide such a large payment to glaum and accordingly shifted its focus to gagnon,in the hope that it could arrange the martino deal through him.after numerous attempts over several months,the agency abandoned this effort because gagnon refused to take a proactive role in organizing the deal.
because caruso was unable to make progress through either glaum or gagnon,the dea decided that wolf should reinitiate contact with glaum,and on july,wolf placed a call to glaum.during this call,wolf asked glaum about obtaining new shipments of marijuana.glaum stated that he had quality marijuana available but that he was upset that he had not been paid for earlier shipments to maine.he also said that he had a new person working in bangor,maine to oversee some of his affairs.
wolf and glaum proceeded to discuss the logistics for sending smaller shipments.glaum suggested sending lots on the same day to two different addresses.he said that he had been shipping between and pounds of marijuana every two weeks and that,in some weeks,he had sent pounds.glaum also explained that he had formed a shipping company called simply shipping through which he trafficked drugs.glaum noted that his associate in bangor,eugene monroe,had probably about a hundred pounds of marijuana on hand,and suggested that wolf meet with him to set up a deal.
dealing with monroe 
the day after wolf conversation with glaum,he received an electronic page from monroe.monroe explained to wolf that he was working with glaum and that,going forward,glaum wanted monroe and wolf to handle the account themselves.
on july,monroe met wolf at a restaurant in waterville,maine.monroe said that glaum had taken over the business after salsberry was incarcerated.he also explained that,because of difficulties that glaum had encountered working with ronnie kerrigan,glaum had hired him to oversee the maine operations.monroe described the method for shipping the drugs.the drugs would arrive from simply shipping in boxes with religious logos so as to dampen suspicions about their contents.wolf provided monroe with an address at a mail boxes in scarborough,maine,where glaum could send the drugs.monroe showed wolf a sample of the available marijuana.after seeing the sample,wolf placed an order for pounds.monroe responded that,prior to delivering such a large amount,he would have to check on availability with glaum.
later that day,monroe contacted wolf and told him that,even though glaum had pounds of marijuana in his possession,only forty pounds were available to him.monroe said that he would bring twenty five pounds to the same restaurant where they earlier had met and that glaum would ship the rest.
on the afternoon of july,monroe and wolf met in the restaurant parking lot.monroe placed the drugs in the backseat of wolf car the next morning,wolf received a call from the mail boxes informing him that he had received two boxes from faith unity world service sent by simply shipping.both boxes contained vacuum sealed bricks of marijuana.
after receiving the shipment,wolf called monroe to tell him that it had arrived.monroe stated that glaum had just received another pounds of marijuana to distribute.on july,monroe and wolf made plans for wolf to receive an additional twenty five pounds of drugs.the two agreed to meet in brunswick,maine,the following day.monroe was arrested just as wolf arrived at the meeting spot.at approximately the same time,glaum was arrested in san diego.
trial and sentence 
glaum was charged in a indictment with conspiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute or more kilograms of marijuana,see and a.after a trial,the jury convicted glaum but specifically found that he was responsible for only between and kilograms of marijuana.at sentencing,however,the district court determined that glaum was responsible for kilograms of marijuana.the court sentenced glaum to months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release.glaum timely appealed from the conviction and sentence.
ii.discussion 
glaum raises six main issues on appeal.first,he claims that the government failed to prove his participation in the single conspiracy alleged in the indictment.second,he claims that he was entrapped.third,he claims that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on his entrapment defense.fourth,he claims that the district court erred in its drug quantity calculations.fifth,he claims that a portion of the drug quantity attributed to him should have been excluded because of sentencing manipulation.sixth,he claims that the district court erred by declining to grant him credit for acceptance of responsibility.we address these claims seriatim.
single conspiracy 
glaum argues that the government failed to prove that he was involved in the single conspiracy described in the indictment.the indictment alleged that,from the fall of until his arrest,on july,glaum participated in a single conspiracy with salsberry and others to distribute marijuana.glaum asserts that the evidence established two separate conspiracies.the first involved salsberry and concluded when salsberry agreed to become a government agent the second involved monroe and concluded when glaum was arrested.
whether a given body of evidence proves one conspiracy or multiple conspiracies is an issue of fact.see united states portela,cir.thus,on appeal,we review the jury determination by asking whether the finding was rational given the evidence.id.we have identified a list of factors to guide this inquiry was there evidence of a common purpose were the various elements of the plan interdependent and was there some degree of overlap among the participants see united states,cir portela,at.
here,there was sufficient evidence to find glaum guilty of participating in the charged single conspiracy.there was evidence that,in the fall of,glaum conspired with salsberry to sell drugs.see portela,at goal of selling drugs for profit satisfies common goal requirement.after agreeing to join with salsberry,glaum performed several acts to further the goals of the conspiracy,including weighing and preparing drugs for shipment and sale and meeting with salsberry suppliers.following salsberry arrest,glaum agreed to assume salsberry role in the business and proceeded to honor this agreement,unaware that salsberry had agreed to become a government agent.
glaum contends that the charged conspiracy ended when salsberry became a government agent.see id.at explaining that a conspiracy can not exist where one of the members is a government agent because a conspiracy requires the existence of two genuine parties.but the portela rule has no relevance here because there was evidence that glaum continued to work with other members of the conspiracy after salsberry agreed to cooperate with the dea.see united states giry,cir noting that the rule providing that government agents do not count as is relevant only in situations where the conspiracy involve d one defendant and a government informer internal quotations omitted.for example,glaum told wolf that he knew dad real well and that the marijuana in his possession was all dad and was dad thing.the jury easily could have concluded that glaum statements were references to his work with the old man whose other alias was dad.there was thus sufficient evidence that glaum continued to receive marijuana from the supply end of the conspiracy after salsberry departure from the organization.
there was also sufficient evidence to conclude that glaum continued to work with the distribution end of the conspiracy.in conversations with wolf,glaum described his continued work with ronnie kerrigan,including his plans to travel to maine to bring him drugs.in addition,eugene monroe testified that glaum ushered him into the conspiracy only after glaum encountered difficulties working with kerrigan.glaum continuing relationship with kerrigan permitted the jury to conclude that he continued to deal with distributors that he had met through his involvement in the charged single conspiracy 
entrapment 
glaum second claim challenges the jury decision to reject his entrapment defense.like the issue discussed above,we review this claim under the sufficiency of the evidence rubric.see united states lafreniere,cir.thus,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,asking whether a rational jury could have rejected glaum entrapment defense.united states tom,cir.
the entrapment defense is.it requires proof of improper government inducement to commit the crime,and lack of predisposition by the defendant to engage in criminal conduct.see united states gamache,cir.to present an entrapment defense,the defendant must make an initial prima facie showing of proof raising the issue.see tom,at.it is undisputed that glaum made this initial showing.
at this point,the burden shifts to the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not entrapped.id.sufficient evidence that the government did not improperly induce the crime or that the defendant was predisposed towards criminal conduct defeats the entrapment defense.see united states capelton,cir.we focus here on predisposition,considering the character or reputation of the defendant whether the initial suggestion of criminal activity was made by the government whether the defendant was engaged in criminal activit
