james treacy is a former chief operating officer and president of monster worldwide,monster also formerly known as tmp worldwide,operates the website.treacy,who left his position as an officer in and left monster board in,was one of several monster officials implicated in a conspiracy to backdate stock options at the company and obtain favorable strike prices for the officials and others while creating the false appearance that the options had been granted at fair market value.
treacy was indicted in august on one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud,file false reports with the securities and exchange commission sec,make false statements to auditors,and falsify books and records,in violation of and one count of substantive securities fraud,in violation of b,and.a jury found treacy guilty on both counts,and in september the district court rakoff,sentenced treacy principally to months imprisonment and ordered him to pay restitution and forfeiture in the amount of.
on appeal,treacy argues that his conviction must be reversed because the district court denied him his rights under the confrontation clause when it strictly limited his of a wall street journal reporter because of the journalist privilege and the district court abused its discretion in conducting voir dire when it declined to use a questionnaire agreed to by the parties and refused to question prospective jurors about their views on corporate america generally.treacy also argues that the district court committed clear error in determining the forfeiture amount.
for the reasons that follow,we reject treacy challenges to his conviction,but we agree that the district court erred in calculating forfeiture and that the case must be remanded for entry of a revised order of forfeiture.
background 
before trial,with the government consent,treacy provided the district court with a list of questions that he proposed be given to the prospective jurors in written form.the majority of the questions on the form were general biographical inquiries that might be made in any trial.a number,however,pertained specifically to the jurors experiences with and views of the financial sector.representative examples included 
the defendant in this case is a former president and chief operating officer of a public company.have you or has any family member or close friend ever worked as a corporate executive or as a director or officer of a public company proposed juror questionnaire at.
do you believe that you can be fair and impartial in a case in which a senior business executive who was paid large amounts of compensation is charged with committing a crime id.
do you personally know anyone who has been charged with violations of the securities laws id.at.
would the fact that the charges in the case involve the securities industry or fraud alleged to have been committed in connection with the securities industry affect your ability to be fair and impartial in this case id.
is there anything about what you have heard,read,seen or experienced with regard to the current economic crisis that you believe would affect your ability to be a fair and impartial juror in a case involving a former executive of a public company id.at.
the district court refused to give the jury a written questionnaire,stating i never give them,ever.i did it once,and it was the biggest mistake i ever made.the judge explained 
the re are many problems with questionnaires,but the single biggest problem is that there is no one in the world who can draft a question that will not have ambiguities that will be,as i learned the one time tried it,that will be picked up on by various prospective jurors.and thus during the voir dire,a huge amount of time will be spent explaining to a juror why he or she misunderstood the question in the questionnaire or finding out that the way he interpreted it was not the way the lawyers interpreted it.
tr.of,hrg.at.
immediately before the first venire was brought into the courtroom,counsel for treacy stated that the two questions he considered most important were the jurors knowledge of corporate america generally and options in particular and whether or not a particular juror has suffered a financial hit as a result of recent events and carries potential prejudice against people associated with wall street as a result.voir dire tr.at.the district court agreed to ask jurors about their knowledge of options,but deemed a broader inquiry to be too remote to warrant inquiring in the way you phrased it.id.at.
the district court asked the prospective jurors,inter alia whether they could be fair and impartial in a securities or stock fraud case involving a former chief operating officer and president of monster whether they or any of their family members or close friends had ever received any stock options whether they owned stock in or were associated with,or had a close friend or relative who worked for,monster and whether they had been exposed to any pretrial publicity about the case.where prospective jurors gave affirmative answers to any of these questions,the district court probed further for possible bias.when one prospective juror mentioned that a very close friend had been burned by the bernie madoff case,the district court stated this has absolutely nothing to do with the bernie madoff case or anything like it.id.at.the district court admonished the jury w e all read about cases,high visibility economic cases a number of them have come up in this very court.this has nothing to do with those cases.it is a totally separate,different kind of case,and you should even think for one second that it has anything to do with those cases whatsoever.id.at.
evidence of the backdating scheme 
monster vice president for human resources,erin barriere,testified how stock options typically work at monster.she explained that a stock option usually gives the holder the right to buy a share at a set price,known as the strike price or exercise price,and that this price is normally the fair market value of the stock on the day the option is granted.trial tr.at.the typical vesting period for an option at monster was four years,with percent of the granted shares vesting after each interval.
cooperating witness myron olesnyckyj testified that he worked at monster from until,when he was fired because of his participation in the backdating scandal.olesnyckyj testified that he helped put together documentation relating to the backdating and hid information from directors,auditors,and the public.he testified to how the scheme worked 
by backdating i mean that we would select a price with the benefit of hindsight.we would look back for some period of time to select a favorable low price,and instead of having the documents reflect the actual market prices on the date of selection of that price by the compensation committee,i would create fictitious documents,suggesting that price was selected on the date of the low price.
q.did the date you or others selected have anything to do with the date the grants were actually approved by the compensation committee 
a.it did not.
q.what did monster tell its auditors and the public about how the exercise price was being chosen for option grants during the period through 
monster told its auditors and the public that the price reflected the price on the actual date of approval by the compensation committee,and that price reflected the fair market value on the date of approval by the compensation committee.
were those representations accurate 
a.they were not 
q.what was the purpose of the backdating of option grants 
a.the purpose of the backdating of option grants was to provide options at low prices without taking the required expense for those options that served the purpose of making the company earnings and profits look a lot better than they were.
trial tr.at.
during the years in question,monster filed public documents with the sec claiming that it followed accounting principles board opinion,titled accounting for stock issued to employees apb.as effective during the relevant years,apb required a company to record any expense or charge on its earnings for the value of an employee stock option on its measurement date,defined as the date on which the officials at the company who were authorized to confer stock options approved and issued a known and specified number of options at a known and specified price.because of this requirement,whenever a company issued any options in the money meaning,any options with a strike price lower than the fair market value of the stock on the measurement date,it was required to report a charge on its earnings in the form of a compensation expense,apportioned over the vesting period.
under monster official stock option policy,no members of authority to grant options,whether acting individually or collectively.rather,exclusive authority to grant options was vested in a compensation committee comprising independent directors,all of whom had to sign a unanimous written consent form uwc to confer an option,and every uwc had to specify an as of date,meaning the date on which the option was deemed to have been granted.the government introduced evidence at trial to show that treacy and his granted options to themselves and others with strike prices often far below the fair market value of the stock on the day of the grant,and did so by falsifying uwcs with as of dates chosen in hindsight based on low closing prices and not based on the dates of any actual action taken by the compensation committee.by backdating the uwcs,the conspirators could avoid the requirements of apb and compensate themselves without reducing monster reported earnings.
copies of introduced at trial showed that treacy often voted on when to set as of dates and vesting dates,and approved backdating proposals by other conspirators.the prosecution also introduced documents that treacy had signed,including sec filings and management representation letters that contained false statements.treacy own profit was received more than one million options in eight different grants,six of which were backdated.
ii.testimony of wall street journal reporter charles forelle 
the prosecution also introduced a june,story from the wall street journal wsj,by reporter charles forelle and titled monster worldwide gave officials options ahead of share run ups.the story stated that the wsj had put the odds at about one in nine million that a pattern of grants as favorable or more favorable than treacy would have occurred if the dates were selected randomly,without regard to stock price.the story contained the following passages,among others 
treacy,who has since left monster,said that,like any other employee,he had no involvement in the process,which he said was all in the purview of the board compensation committee and andrew mckelvey,monster founder and chief executive.he said he believes the dates were the days that the comp committee and andy granted the options 
treacy said that he did notice the favorable strike price at the time.i was busy working,and there was a lot to do and a lot of moving parts and a family to get home to,he said.
he also said that not all of his grants were unusual.a grant came before a fall in share price,and another grant was dated on the same day the company publicly announced his promotion to president.he left the company in,but remained on the board until.
treacy never exercised any of his options while he was an executive.as part of his separation agreement,the company allowed him to keep them after he left.he cashed out some for the first time in december,he said.asked how much he made on the transaction,treacy said he does have to disclose the sum.i did ok,he said.but i waited a long time.
charles forelle and mark maremont,monster worldwide gave officials options ahead of share,wall,june,at.
at trial,the government subpoenaed forelle to testify to the accuracy of the statements attributed to treacy in his story.forelle sought to quash the subpoena,invoking the journalist privilege and claiming that his testimony would be irrelevant,cumulative and available from other sources.the government argued that treacy statements to forelle were made in furtherance of the conspiracy,showed his consciousness of guilt,and demonstrated his knowledge of the stock options process at monster.the government also argued that forelle testimony was the only means by which the statements could be authenticated.
at oral argument on forelle motion to quash,the government asked to be permitted to ask questions primarily to confirm the substance and accuracy of treacy statements in the story.treacy argued that he should be able to forelle regarding the specific questions that led to the statements attributed to treacy statements attributed to mckelvey and forelle other reporting on backdating schemes,including those at other companies.treacy argued that he wished to show that his statements to forelle were about his own stock options,not about generally.
the district court denied forelle motion to quash but tightly limit ed both direct and of the reporter.dist.mem.ord.dated,at.the court rejected forelle contention that the evidence was cumulative.applying our decision in gonzales broadcasting,cir,the district court noted that the testimony sought was nonconfidential and concluded that the statements were relevant,at a minimum,as statements made in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy and false exculpatory statements evidencing consciousness of guilt,and may also prove admissible for other purposes.id.at.but the court limited direct examination to four essential inquiries in or around june,was forelle a reporter for the wall street journal did forelle interview treacy during that time did treacy make statements to forelle that forelle subsequently reported and with respect to each of those statements,what specifically did forelle say to treacy and what specifically did treacy say in response id.the district court,noting that treacy had not argued that the statements had not been made or misreported,but only that they were taken out of context,limited his to asking about the questions forelle had asked treacy immediately before those that elicited the responses quoted in the story.
called to testify,forelle confirmed that treacy had made the statements in the wsj article.on,treacy counsel asked forelle if what you asked him about during that conversation was treacy options,and forelle replied,it correct that i asked him about his options.trial tr.at.treacy counsel then asked and you asked him reason you called him is because you saw his options in public filings and you wanted to ask him about it,is that true id.at.the district judge sustained an objection to that question from the reporter counsel,whom the court had previously granted permission to appear and raise silent objections where appropriate.at a sidebar conference,the district court explained that,because of the need to balance press interests with the parties interests,treacy could not make an attack on forelle credibility.treacy attempted to ask forelle several times about a that forelle sent to monster public relations consultant in which he mentioned the interview with treacy,but the district court ruled the questions improper.on redirect,the government asked forelle,were your questions to treacy limited to his own grants or was it more broadly the grants and practices at the company as a whole id.at.forelle replied,it was both.id.on inquiry from the bench,forelle was unable to recall the specific questions he had asked that had elicited the statements by treacy quoted in the story.although treacy was prohibited from forelle based on the forelle had sent to monster public relations contact,the district court did allow treacy to introduce the itself,which contained the following passage 
treacy says that his options terms were all decided by the compensation committee and kckelvey.is this accurate he characterizes mckelvey role in as andy gave grants to senior executives.could you expand on the role of mckelvey in determining the dates,amounts and nature of executive awards 
from charles forelle to peter duda dated june.
in its summation,the prosecution mentioned forelle article at several different points,and argued that treacy quotes in the wall street journal,after the news of the backdating broke,that like any other employee,he had no involvement in the options dating process,were a monster lie and a lie.trial tr.at.the government directly tied this observation to its broader case that i nstead of doing the right thing,treacy lied over and over again.id.at.treacy counsel,in turn,argued in summation that the phrasing of forelle treacy says that his options terms were all decided by the compensation committee and mckelvey,is that accurate showed that mckelvey was the principal force behind the backdating scheme and the conversation with the wall street journal reporter was not about treacy relationship with the option program in toto but was specific to treacy grants.trial tr.at.
iii.forfeiture 
the government sought forfeiture under a c,which authorizes forfeiture of a ny property which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to a multitude of criminal offenses,including securities fraud.a c.invoking apb opinion,the government argued that the measurement date for determining the cost of stock options was the first date on which are known both the number of shares that an individual employee is entitled to receive and the options or purchase price,if any.the government supplied a chart showing the measurement dates as modified by the trial evidence in the manner most favorable to treacy position,which calculated a profit of.
with respect to the option grant dated as of january,the government chart proposed a measurement date of april.the government pointed to testimony by olesnyckyj,who stated that the date and price for this option grant were not selected until at least the end of january,and that the recipients of the grants were not fully determined until april.the government also presented a facsimile sent on april,which included an unexecuted unanimous written consent uwc form of the compensation committee for a grant of million options dated as of january,of which were granted to treacy.
with respect to the grant with an as of date of december,the government chart proposed a measurement date of april.in support of this measurement date,the government relied upon a series of dated april,in which treacy,olesnyckyj,and monster controller discussed the number of options to authorize under monster stock option plan,pursuant to which the options backdated to december,would be issued.on or about april,as evidenced by the modify date in the relevant computer file,olesnyckyj created a uwc for the grant with the grant date december.
the district court found by a preponderance of the evidence that the government chart accurately reflected the evidence adduced at trial and specifically rejected treacy contention that two of the grants had not been backdated at all.the district court ordered treacy to forfeit,the amount in the government chart.
discussion 
i.the confrontation clause and the journalist privilege 
treacy contends that the strict limitations the district court placed on his of forelle violated his rights under the confrontation clause.specifically,he argues that prescribed questioning of forelle was no substitute for adversarial examination the confrontation clause requires that the defense be able to attack credibility and because the government argued repeatedly to the jury that treacy was denying any involvement at all in monster stock options process a notion that the defense says is preposterous treacy should have been able to test forelle testimony by attempting to show that treacy was only speaking of his own options.treacy br.at.
we review a district court decision to restrict for abuse of discretion,even where the basis for challenging those restrictions is the confrontation clause.see,united states figueroa,cir.when that decision rests on an error of law such as the application of the wrong legal principle,a district court necessarily abuses its discretion.id.quoting zervos verizon,cir.
it is settled law in this circuit,at least in the civil context,that a journalist possesses a qualified privilege protecting him or her from the compelled disclosure of even nonconfidential materials.see chevron berlinger,cir gonzales nbc,cir.this is so because 
even where there is no issue of betrayal of a promised confidence,wholesale exposure of press files to litigant scrutiny would burden the press with heavy costs of subpoena compliance,and could otherwise impair its ability to perform its if potential sources were deterred from speaking to the press,or insisted on remaining anonymous,because of the likelihood that they would be sucked into litigation and unrestricted litigant access to press files would create socially wasteful incentives for press entities to clean out files containing potentially valuable information lest they incur substantial costs of subpoena compliance,and would risk the symbolic harm of making journalists appear to be an investigative arm of the judicial system,the government,or private parties.
chevron,at quoting gonzales,at internal citations omitted.
no party or amicus argues that any of the information sought from forelle was confidential,or that he is protecting the identity of any source.forelle,therefore,is not entitled to invoke the stronger privilege that protects confidential materials.united states cutler,cir where a party seeks confidential material from a journalist,disclosure may be ordered only upon a clear and specific showing that the information is highly material and relevant,necessary or critical to the maintenance of the claim,and not obtainable from other available sources.on the contrary,not only was forelle not protecting any confidential material or source,he sought to withhold evidence that his source himself treacy desired be disclosed.thus,because the protection of confidential sources is not involved,the nature of the press interest protected by the privilege is narrower and the privilege is more easily overcome.gonzales,at.where a civil litigant seeks nonconfidential materials from a nonparty press entity,the litigant is entitled to the requested discovery notwithstanding a valid assertion of the journalists privilege if he can show that the materials at issue are of likely relevance to a significant issue in the case,and are not reasonably obtainable from other available sources.id.
before we review the manner in which the district judge curtailed cross examination,we will address the argument of amicus dow jones company dow jones,parent company of the wall street journal,which urges us to hold that the district court ought to have quashed the subpoena to forelle outright.although appearing in support of neither party and taking no position with respect to whether treacy conviction should be reversed,dow jones argues that the bar should be higher for overcoming the reporters privilege in criminal cases,and that we should apply the clear and specific showing in civil cases only when confidentiality is at all criminal cases.
we are not persuaded.dow jones argues that its proposed rule is necessary to avoid a constitutional paradox that arises when a court must balance a reporter first amendment rights with a criminal defendant sixth amendment rights,but this argument depends on the assumption that the reporter privilege is derived from the first amendment rather than a federal common law of privileges,a question we have previously declined to resolve absent any congressional retrenchment of the privilege.see gonzales,at.we once again decline to wade into these constitutional waters,because absent from dow jones brief is any convincing reason why the gonzales test should not apply in criminal cases where the prosecution seeks to introduce nonconfidential materials.dow jones suggests that because the department of justice has adopted strict guidelines for itself with respect to subpoenaing reporters,see,this court should adopt the same principles as binding propositions of law.nothing in our case law suggests,however,that the journalist privilege is stronger in criminal cases.if anything,in fact,we have recognized that our court once set too high a bar for overcoming the privilege in criminal cases and consciously lowered that bar.see united states cutler,cir united states burke,cir see also gonzales,at observing that cutler recognized that burke undervalued the needs of criminal defendants.we now hold that,in instances where a reporter is not protecting a confidential source or confidential materials,the showing required to overcome the journalist privilege is the same in a criminal case as it is in a civil,the showing required by that this is true whether the party seeking to overcome the privilege is the prosecution or the defense 
to the extent that it denied forelle motion to quash,while limiting the scope of the government direct examination of the reporter,the district court applied gonzales correctly.as that court explained,false exculpatory statements can provide circumstantial evidence of guilt,and this satisfies the gonzales likely relevance test.because treacy possessed an absolute fifth amendment right not to testify himself,forelle was the only potential witness who could confirm that treacy had made the statements quoted in the article,satisfying the requirement that the material be not reasonably obtainable from other sources.finally,by restricting the questions the government could ask on direct examination,the district court protected the privilege,tailoring the questions to the showing of relevance and necessity made by the government.
the limitations the district court imposed on the scope of,however,are another matter.treacy and his supporting amicus,the national association of criminal defense lawyers,argue that once a trial court has determined that the government has made the required showing to overcome the journalist privilege and compel a reporter direct testimony,the trial court may not,consistent with the sixth amendment confrontation clause,thereafter employ the privilege to restrict the defendant of the reporter to a greater degree than it would restrict such in a case where no privilege was at issue.we agree.
during forelle testimony,when treacy counsel attempted to challenge forelle credibility by bringing up forelle to monster public relations representative,the district court sustained objections from forelle counsel,stating in the balancing of various competing considerations here,i did not open it up to a general attack on credibility.anything can relate to credibility,and i limited the scope much more specifically.trial tr.at.defense counsel argued that t his relates to his writing of the article and that this is just general impeachment here.id.at.the judge replied it was always the defense position that if he recalled at all,you should be able to get into the whole interview,both to establish context and to test credibility.and the c ourt,because it had to consider the third party interests here,namely,the press interests and the press privilege,said no,you ca do that.id.
the confrontation clause guarantees a criminal defendant the right to delve into the witness story to test the witness perceptions and memory and to impeach,discredit,the witness.davis alaska.although the scope of is generally within the sound discretion of the trial court,united states pedroza,f d,cir,the trial judge discretion can not be expanded to justify a curtailment which keeps from the jury relevant and important facts bearing on the trustworthiness of crucial testimony,id.at quoting gordon united states.
once the district court made the correct decision that the government had sufficiently overcome the gonzales privilege to compel forelle testimony,it was an abuse of discretion to restrict treacy from to ordinary rules regarding the scope of direct and relevance,see.b as he would any other witness.the only privilege forelle possessed in this case was the qualified gonzales privilege,and the question before the district court during was the same as on direct examination,namely,whether the answers defense counsel sought were of likely relevance to a significant issue in the case,and not reasonably obtainable from other available sources.the district court committed an error of law when,instead of applying the test we set forth in gonzales to evaluate treacy need for forelle answers,it treated forelle interest as a competing interest to be balanced against treacy confrontation clause rights.
it will generally be the case that the defense can satisfy the gonzales test on to the extent that it seeks to challenge a reporter credibility about the specific content of his direct testimony.we agree,of course,with the district court observation that a nything can relate to credibility,and the district court possessed the discretion to prevent a general attack on credibility.but we agree with treacy that,because the purpose of forelle testimony was to confirm the accuracy of the statements in the wall street journal article,attempts to test forelle memory with respect to the writing of the article were not a general attack on credibility but a challenge to the specific details of forelle direct testimony.such a challenge is of likely relevance to a significant issue in the case,and no person but forelle could provide the required answers.with the gonzales test satisfied,the district court erred in balancing the defendant confrontation clause rights against a general press interest.
it is the law in this circuit that if a witness invocation of the fifth amendment privilege against prevents the defendant from the witness with respect to a matter,the witness direct testimony must be stricken.see bagby kuhlman,cir dunbar harris,cir united states cardillo,cir.a general attack on credibility is,concededly,a collateral matter.see cardillo,at.but testimony should ordinarily be stricken when the invocation of the privilege against prevents the defendant from the witness with respect to his credibility regarding the specific details of his direct testimony.see id.at.and if the confrontation clause requires this result when a constitutional privilege is involved,it must a fortiori require the same result when a witness invokes a privilege that may derive only from federal common law,and the weakest variation on the common law privilege,at that.in other words,if the district court had believed that treacy could not fully exercise his confrontation clause rights because of forelle assertion of the privilege,it ought to have granted forelle motion to quash or subsequently stricken his testimony.
however,e ven if we conclude that the trial judge has improperly curtailed in violation of the defendant confrontation rights,we are not to reverse automatically but are to apply analysis,in order to determine whether,assuming that the damaging potential of the were fully realized,the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.united states rosa,cir quoting delaware van arsdall.that is,we should not reverse if we conclude that the error was unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question.id.quoting yates evatt.the factors to be considered on harmless error review include the importance of the witness testimony in the prosecution case,whether the testimony was cumulative,the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points,the extent of otherwise permitted,and the overall strength of the prosecution case.cotto herbert,cir quoting van arsdall,at.
here,even though the prosecutor repeatedly emphasized treacy statements to forelle as evidence of his mendacity,any confrontation clause error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the other evidence in the prosecution case was vastly more significant to demonstrating treacy actual actions.first,although treacy was unable to forelle based on the,he was able to introduce the itself.he was therefore able to somewhat less forcefully than he could have if permitted to engage in effective argument during summation that his comments to forelle were taken out of context.second,this court has recognized that false exculpatory statements evincing consciousness of guilt are only circumstantial evidence of guilt,and weak circumstantial evidence at that.see united states lorenzo,cir.concededly,the government,at summation,did repeatedly point to
