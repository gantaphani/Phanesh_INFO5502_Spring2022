on october,john frechette was convicted in state court in lewiston,maine,after pleading no contest to a charge that he had assaulted his then girlfriend.this offense was a misdemeanor,see.ann.tit,and frechette was sentenced to a jail term of thirty days,which was immediately suspended,and to a term of probation.
in congress passed,as part of the omnibus consolidated appropriations act of,the lautenberg amendment to the gun control act of the amendment,stat,to codified as amended at.see united states hartsock,cir.the amendment was intended,in part,to address the growing national recognition of the importance of deterring domestic violence.see id.at citing sources.it expressed congress recognition that firearms were frequently used in domestic violence attacks.see id.
congress also recognized that there was a loophole in the law,which it moved to close.although earlier law had restricted the possession of firearms by those convicted of domestic violence felonies,no such restrictions existed as to possession of firearms by persons convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors.see id.the amendment eliminated this disparity.under g,it is now unlawful for a person who has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to,inter alia,possess in or affecting commerce,any firearm or ammunition.the statute defines misdemeanor crime of domestic violence as an offense that 
i is a misdemeanor under federal,state,or tribal law and 
ii has,as an element,the use or attempted use of physical force,or the threatened use of a deadly weapon,committed by a current or former spouse,parent,or guardian of the victim,by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common,by a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse,parent,or guardian,or by a person similarly situated to a spouse,parent,or guardian of the victim.
a a.this provision is subject to some affirmative defenses,two of which are described below and are involved in this appeal.
on february,a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging frechette with having knowingly possessed in and affecting commerce a firearm,specifically a phoenix arms,caliber pistol,in violation of g and a there seems to be little dispute frechette had a firearm his main defense was that his misdemeanor domestic violence conviction did not count as a predicate offense within the meaning of the statute.
frechette did not argue that his maine offense was not a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,as defined at a a.instead,he moved to dismiss the indictment on the basis that the offense did not count as a conviction within the meaning of a b i i and ii,because it was secured without his having knowingly and intelligently waived both the right to counsel,a b i i,and the right to have the case tried by a jury,id.a b i ii.
the text of the affirmative defenses frechette invoked provides 
i a person shall not be considered to have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence for purposes of this chapter,unless 
i the person was represented by counsel in the case,or knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel in the case and 
ii in the case of a prosecution for an offense described in this paragraph for which a person was entitled to a jury trial in the jurisdiction in which the case was tried,either 
aa the case was tried by a jury,or 
bb the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury,by guilty plea or otherwise.
the statute also sets forth another affirmative defense,which is set out just below those already described.see id.a b ii.that defense is not at issue here,but is pertinent to understanding the provisions that are at issue 
ii a person shall not be considered to have been convicted of such an offense for purposes of this chapter if the conviction has been expunged or set aside,or is an offense for which the person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under such an offense unless the pardon,expungement,or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship,transport,possess,or receive firearms.
in response to frechette motion to dismiss the indictment,the government entered into evidence a transcript of frechette october,appearance on the assault charge.the transcript showed that the state court conducted a mass arraignment,in which it brought a large group of defendants into the courtroom and advised them collectively about their rights.frechette does not dispute that he was among that group of defendants.
among other things,the court informed frechette and the others that they had the right to a jury trial 
now here are your rights.since you here on a criminal charge,i want to advise you,first and foremost,that you all presumed innocent until proven guilty.under our system of justice,and the state and federal constitution s,you are entitled to a trial by judge or jury.you are entitled to have the state,and by the state,i mean the law enforcement agency that has arrested you and charged you with a crime,to come to court and prove their case to a judge or jury 
the court also informed the group of defendants that each of them had the right to counsel 
the third right and the last right that i want to explain to everybody is your right to an attorney.if any of you are here and there is a probability or a possibility that you could be facing jail if you are convicted of the crime that you are being charged with here,i would advise you to get a lawyer or get legal advice.also,if you ca afford a lawyer,depending on your financial circumstances,you can ask me to appoint a lawyer at the state expense for you.here how that happens.you let me know.i obviously going to let you know how serious the offense is and you are going to be asked about whether you are going to represent yourself,hire a lawyer,or ask for a court appointed lawyer.if you ask for a court appointed lawyer,you gon na be screened this morning by a financial screening officer who will interview you and decide whether you meet the guidelines for a court appointed lawyer.if you meet the guidelines,a lawyer will be appointed who practices within our jurisdiction here if you do qualify,that means you will have to hire your own lawyer or represent yourself.please understand the case does go away because you do get a court appointed lawyer.you still have to face the charges 
finally,the court explained to the group that each defendant could enter one of three pleas,and that each would waive the rights to a trial and to counsel by pleading guilty or no contest 
i am going ask you to enter one of three pleas guilty,not guilty,no contest.guilty means what it says.it means that you will end up saying i guilty you admit the charge and we will impose a sentence this morning.if you plead not guilty,you are asking for a trial and i will give you a date for your trial.if you plead no contest that means that you do want to plead guilty,but you do want a trial and you want to dispose of the matter and you want to get rid of it today.there is still a conviction.in other words,i make a finding of guilt.the only difference is that you have pled guilty,you still convicted without a trial.those of you who plead guilty and those of you who plead no contest waive your right to a trial.obviously,you not going to have a trial.you waive your right also to get the advice of a lawyer,so please understand those consequences before you decide to plead guilty 
now if you plead not guilty you get a date for told you that.then we going to hand you three pieces of paper page one is your ticket to a jury trial.since it a criminal offense,you have a right to say,i want a jury trial instead of a judge trial.the reason you in district court is because all of you are here on class d and e crimes if you want a jury trial,you take the first piece of paper that is handed to you this morning and within three weeks of today date,sign it and bring it to the clerk in the lobby if that happens,your case is transferred across the river and goes to the superior court in auburn and you be notified by that court of the time and date of your trial by jury.if you do file it within three weeks,you have to be here on the day i give you for a trial before a judge in this court.
following the mass arraignment,the court engaged in an individual plea colloquy with frechette.the court observed that frechette had already pleaded not guilty at his initial appearance in state court and that he was presently before the court on a bench warrant for not showing up for trial the court advised frechette that he ha d a right to either ask for a new court date if you want to do so,at which point frechette seems to have interrupted and said no.frechette then indicated that he wanted to change his plea to no contest,and the court warned him that by so doing,he would be waiving his right to trial.the court did not,however,as it had done earlier at the mass arraignment,invoke the phrase jury trial 
court all right,frechette,you have already pled not guilty.this was a bench warrant for not showing up to your trial and you have a right to either ask for a new court date if you want to do so.
frechette no.
court do you want to change your plea 
frechette no contest.
court do you want to change your plea to no contest do you understand by doing that you waive your right to trial.right 
frechette yes.
in the course of the colloquy,the court also noted that frechette did not qualify financially for a lawyer.it informed frechette that by pleading no contest,he would be waiving his right to counsel 
court your right to the advice of a lawyer does he get a court appointed lawyer no,he did qualify.okay.do you understand that by pleading no contest that you waive your right to trial and the advice of a lawyer all right 
frechette yup.
court okay.do you want to have him waived,please 
court officer this is a waiver of counsel i going to read to you 
i am the person charged in this proceeding.i am fully aware of my right to have my attorney of my own choosing or,if i am unable to afford an attorney,to have an attorney appointed by the court at public expense.i do not desire an attorney and hereby waive my right to be represented by an attorney.
do you understand what i read to you,sir having read that to you,you can sign right here,please.
frechette does not dispute that he signed the waiver after this exchange.
frechette conceded that the transcript provided by the government was a n accurate transcript of the plea colloquy and advisement of rights for the predicate offense.nevertheless,as part of his motion to dismiss the indictment,he requested an evidentiary hearing,at which he sought to present evidence,inter alia,of his educational background and lack of sophistication about the criminal justice system,the underlying facts of his predicate domestic violence offense,his lack of recall about being notified by the state court of his rights to counsel and to a jury trial,and his financial circumstances at the time of his no contest plea,which allegedly precluded him from securing paid counsel.the magistrate judge,without ruling on frechette motion to dismiss the indictment,rejected his motion for an evidentiary hearing in a memorandum decision,to which frechette timely objected.
the district court subsequently allowed for oral argument,both on the magistrate judge order denying frechette an evidentiary hearing and on frechette motion to dismiss the indictment.in an opinion issued on june,the district court overruled frechette objection to the magistrate judge order denying him an evidentiary hearing,but allowed his motion to dismiss.see united states frechette,d.the court entered a judgment of discharge,pursuant to rule k of the federal rules of criminal procedure,on june.
in its june opinion,the district court held that the question of whether frechette knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury,by guilty plea or otherwise under a b i ii bb,was to be determined by the law of the state of the predicate conviction and not by federal law,see frechette,d at that if federal constitutional law were the appropriate standard,then the waiver of jury trial would be valid,see id.at,but that under the law of maine,specifically state rowell,me,the waiver was invalid,see frechette,d at that frechette was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing,see id.at and that frechette had not shown that his waiver of counsel in the predicate state proceeding was invalid under a b i i,see frechette,d at.each side appeals from the issue s it lost.
the key question on appeal is whether the jury waiver question is determined by reference to state law standards or to the federal constitutional standard for waiver.we review this question of statutory interpretation de novo.united states,cir.
we hold that the validity of a waiver of jury trial for purposes of a b i ii bb is to be evaluated under the federal constitutional standard and that frechette validly waived that right.we also hold that the district court was correct to conclude that frechette was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing and that frechette validly waived his right to counsel.as a result,we reverse the district court solely on the question of whether frechette validly waived his right to a jury trial,vacate the order of dismissal,and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
interpretation of statutory provision regarding waiver of jury trial 
our task is to interpret the federal statute.a bit more precision is in order.the statute does define the standard for the waiver of the jury trial right the standard is whether the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to trial by jury.the question is whether the phrase knowingly and intelligently is to be measured by federal or state standards.
the question becomes meaningful in situations in which the standards turn out to be different.we can think of at least two such situations.the first is when the federal constitutional standard has been met,but state law,applying a more standard of knowingly and intelligently,has not been met.the district court thought that was the situation here 
the second at least hypothetical situation is one in which the federal constitutional standard has not been met,but a less state standard for waiver has been met.state law,after all,may give a defendant a right to a jury trial where one is not mandated by the sixth amendment,see duncan louisiana,d drawing a distinction between serious crimes and petty offenses,and holding that the sixth amendment entitles defendants to a jury trial only for serious crimes see also baldwin new york,d holding that no offense can be deemed petty for purposes of the right to trial by jury where imprisonment for more than six months is authorized,and where a state has chosen to do so,it is conceivable that it might allow a defendant to waive the right by some procedure that is less stringent than that required under federal law for waiving a constitutional right to a jury trial for serious crimes 
frechette argument would have this court apply state law standards for what constitutes knowing and intelligent waiver,regardless of whether the particular state law being invoked affords greater or lesser protection to defendants than would the federal constitutional standard.under his theory,congress would have to have intended for there not to be one national standard for knowing and intelligent waiver,but a large number of standards,some of which may be more and others of which may be more.
the government position is that the statute requires the application of a uniform federal standard.use of normal principles of statutory interpretation favors this reading,although the text is not so clear as to eliminate all questions.furthermore,frechette argues that because the statute does at times incorporate state standards,national uniformity in the federal statutory scheme to control domestic violence is not the consistent guiding principle throughout the statute.still,we agree with the government.
first,when a federal statutory term such as knowingly and intelligently is used,ordinarily the interpretation is supplied by federal law,not state law,absent some express language to the contrary.see jerome united states.w e must generally assume,in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary,that congress when it enacts a statute is not making the application of the federal act dependent on state law.see also dickerson new banner,d noting that in the absence of a plain indication to the contrary,it is to be assumed when congress enacts a statute that it does not intend to make its application dependent on state law,because the application of federal legislation is nationwide and at times the federal program would be impaired if state law were to control quoting nlrb natural gas util,d,superseded by statute,firearm owners protection act,stat,as recognized in molina ins,cir united states,cir per curiam words in federal statutes reflect federal understandings,absent an explicit statement to the contrary,even if a state uses the word differently.
second,the very phrase knowingly and intelligently can easily be read as a shorthand encapsulation of the federal constitutional standard.see,patton united states.not only must the right of the accused to a trial by a constitutional jury be jealously preserved,but the maintenance of the jury as a body in criminal cases is of such importance and has such a place in our traditions,that,before any waiver can become effective,the consent of government counsel and the sanction of the court must be had,in addition to the express and intelligent consent of the defendant,abrogated on other grounds by williams florida,d accord united states leja,cir upholding validity of jury trial waiver,so long as it was knowingly,voluntarily,and intelligently made edwards arizona,d noting that waivers of counsel must not only be voluntary,but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege boykin alabama,d requiring that a plea be intelligent and voluntary johnson zerbst.
third,the structure of the statute favors the government construction that the jury waiver question is to be analyzed under the federal constitutional standard.the affirmative defense under discussion has two subsections,i and ii 
i a person shall not be considered to have been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence for purposes of this chapter unless 
i the person was represented by counsel in the case,or knowingly and intelligently waived the right to counsel in the case and 
ii in the case of a prosecution for an offense described in this paragraph for which a person was entitled to a jury trial in the jurisdiction in which the case was tried,either 
aa the case was tried by a jury,or 
bb the person knowingly and intelligently waived the right to have the case tried by a jury,by guilty plea or otherwise.
a b i.the parties agree that in subsection i,which deals with the right to counsel,the term knowingly and intelligently waived is to be analyzed under the federal constitutional standard.only in subsection ii,which deals with the jury trial right,does frechette argue that the very same term is to be analyzed under state law.there are two prongs to his argument.first,he points out that subsection ii refers to the jurisdiction in which the case was tried to determine whether there was any jury trial right at all.second,he notes that the second affirmative defense to g,set out in the paragraph immediately below the affirmative defense under discussion,excludes as predicate convictions those offenses for which the person has had civil rights restored if the law of the applicable jurisdiction provides for the loss of civil rights under such an offense.a b ii.the reasoning,propounded by frechette and employed by the district court,is that if congress explicitly referred to the law of the jurisdiction in which the offense was committed to determine whether there is a jury trial right at all and to determine whether there is a loss of civil rights for a certain offense,congress implicitly meant all issues concerning the right to a jury trial,including waiver,to be resolved by looking to state standards.on balance,we think this approach is wrong.
on its face,the separate restoration of civil rights provision itself has nothing to do with the right to a jury trial.
that congress referred to state law to define whether there was any jury trial right at all has an independent rationale.as noted earlier,states may provide jury trials even when they are not compelled by the federal constitution to do so.it is easier to administer the federal statute by simply accepting the states choice to give or not to give a jury trial that is a background fact against which the whole provision operates.
but,as this case demonstrates,it is not easier to administer the federal statute by then looking to state law to determine what is meant by a knowing and intelligent waiver of the right to a jury trial a single,federal standard for waiver of jury trial is clearly easier for federal courts to apply than would be a patchwork of conflicting and changing state laws.see jerome,at.noting the desirability of uniformity in application of federal criminal laws dickerson,at.holding that w hether one has been convicted within the language of the gun control statutes is necessarily a question of federal,not state,law,despite the fact that the predicate offense and its punishment are defined by the law of the s tate.
in the statute,both references to state law in relation to whether a jury is available and to whether there is a loss of civil rights are isolated structurally and grammatically from the subsection,a b i ii bb,setting forth the requirement of a knowing and intelligent waive r of the jury trial right.it is tempting to credit this arrangement as evidence that congress knew how to direct attention to state law standards when it so desired and that it purposefully did not do so as to waiver of the jury trial right see barnhart sigmon coal,d i t is a general principle of statutory construction that when congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quoting russello united states,d.
the text,while not entirely plain,is more consistent with an intent by congress that the term knowingly and intelligently be interpreted by the federal constitutional standard,and not by state standards.we have already mentioned that federal statutes are usually defined by federal law,that there is no express reference to state law in this particular provision where one might otherwise expect one,and that the statute is more easily and better administered by use of one a familiar one at that.the view that state law governs the content of knowing and intelligent waive r of the jury trial right also,as we have described,raises the risk of lowering protections for defendants in situations in which state law standards for waiver are more relaxed than those set forth by the federal constitutional standard.that is all the more reason to give the statute its most natural reading,that the knowing and intelligent standard is to be determined by the federal constitutional standard.this appears to be the practice of other circuits.see united states bethurum,cir applying,without discussion,federal constitutional standard to the question of whether a jury trial waiver was knowing and intelligent within the meaning of a b i ii bb united states jennings,cir same.
waiver of rights to jury trial and to counsel under federal law 
we analyze,under the federal standard,whether frechette knowingly and intelligently waived his rights to jury trial and to counsel.the district court alternative holding was that if the federal standard were applied,then frechette waiver of jury trial was valid.the court also held that frechette waiver of his right to counsel was valid.we review factual findings by the district court for clear error and the determination of whether a waiver of rights was voluntary de novo.united states,cir.
