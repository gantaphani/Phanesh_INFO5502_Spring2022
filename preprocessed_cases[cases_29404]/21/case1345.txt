petitioner appellee frank lopez challenges the manner by which the federal bureau of prisons bop calculates good conduct time gct under b.lopez maintains he should be eligible to receive gct for the months he spent in state and federal custody prior to the date on which he was sentenced in district court in addition to his time in custody following sentencing,even though those months were credited to a prior state sentence.the bop disagrees,asserting that lopez can accrue gct only as to the months he spent in custody after he was sentenced.
this appeal presents,therefore,a question of statutory interpretation whether b,which provides that an inmate may receive gct toward the service of the prisoner sentence of up to days at the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment,permits the award of gct for presentence custody served by an inmate that,under b,can not be credited to the defendant federal sentence.the district court holwell,agreeing with lopez,held that the phrase term of imprisonment under b means and that an inmate can accrue gct for the total time served for a federal offense,both before and after sentencing,regardless of whether the inmate presentence custody is credited to another sentence.the bop challenges this ruling.it contends that as used in b,an inmate term of imprisonment is coterminous with his or her federal sentence as defined under,such that he or she is eligible for gct only as to the period of incarceration following the date of sentencing,as well as for any presentence custody credited to that period under b.
we conclude that the bop interpretation of b is persuasive under skidmore swift,and defer to the agency interpretation.we therefore reverse the judgment of the district court granting frank lopez petition for a writ of habeas corpus and remand with instructions to dismiss the petition.
background 
i.the statutory framework governing good conduct time 
we are concerned here principally with the interpretation and interaction of two statutes.the first,b,governs gct,and provides in part 
a prisoner who is serving a term of imprisonment of more than year other than a term of imprisonment for the duration of the prisoner life,may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner sentence,beyond the time served,of up to days at the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment,beginning at the end of the first year of the term,subject to determination by the bureau of prisons that,during that year,the prisoner has displayed exemplary compliance with institutional disciplinary regulations.
b.the second,titled,calculation of a term of imprisonment,provides in full 
a commencement of sentence.a sentence to a term of imprisonment commences on the date the defendant is received in custody awaiting transportation to,or arrives voluntarily to commence service of sentence at,the official detention facility at which the sentence is to be served.
b credit for prior custody.a defendant shall be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences 
as a result of the offense for which the sentence was imposed or 
as a result of any other charge for which the defendant was arrested after the commission of the offense for which the sentence was imposed 
that has not been credited against another sentence.
id.under b,therefore,the bop may grant a defendant credit against his federal sentence for time served in custody prior to sentencing in district court so long as that presentence custody has not been credited against another sentence.b see united states labeille soto,cir a defendant has no right to credit on his federal sentence for time that has been credited against his prior state sentence.if a defendant presentence custody has been credited to another sentence,no b credit is available,but the sentencing guidelines provide a functional equivalent.under the version of the guidelines applicable in this case,when sentencing a defendant with an undischarged term of imprisonment that ha s fully been taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the defendant instant offense,see.b,a district court 
s hould adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into account in determining the guideline range for the instant offense if the court determines that period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the bureau of prisons for clarity,the court should note on the judgment in the criminal case order that the sentence imposed is not a departure from the guideline range because the defendant has been credited for guideline purposes under b for time served in state custody that will not be credited to the federal sentence under b.
b,cmt.see united states gonzalez,cir holding that because the defendant presentence custody was credited to his state sentence,no b credit was available thus,b applied.section b of the guidelines therefore applies where a defendant faces punishment for the same criminal conduct in two prosecutions,and ensures that the defendant receives credit for time already served to eliminate double punishment.united states fermin,cir citing witte united states.
ii.the facts and procedural history 
on august,lopez was arrested in the bronx,new york,for selling crack cocaine,and was charged by the state of new york with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.lopez pled guilty to that charge in november and was sentenced to an indeterminate term of four and to nine years imprisonment.in november,after serving four years and three months in state custody,lopez was transferred to federal custody pursuant to a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum,and in april,lopez was indicted by a federal grand jury on one count of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine,in violation of,a,b a.the only overt act specified in the federal indictment was lopez august,sale of crack cocaine the same offense for which he had earlier been convicted in state court.
lopez pled guilty to the federal charge on september,and was sentenced on june,as of that date,lopez was still serving his state sentence.the district court holwell,determined at sentencing that lopez was eligible for a month adjustment under b based on his presentence custody,since his prior state conviction qualified as relevant conduct with respect to his federal offense.because lopez presentence custody was credited to his state sentence,no b credit was available.the court thus imposed a month term of imprisonment to run concurrent with lopez state conviction,with a credit for time served in state and federal custody from august.the district court clarified in its written judgment that the term of imprisonment was months,minus months for time already served,which resulted in an actual term of months imprisonment.after sentencing,lopez was remanded to state custody to serve the remaining portion of his undischarged state sentence,which he completed on december.he then returned to federal custody to complete his federal sentence.
in early,lopez discovered that the bop had calculated his release date as march,based on its determination that he was eligible for gct only as to the months he served following his date of sentencing in district court.lopez challenged this calculation in a letter submitted to the bop,asserting that because the district court had sentenced him to months imprisonment on his federal conviction,he should be eligible for gct for the entirety of that month term,from his arrest on august,onward.in a letter dated march,bop assistant general counsel sonya cole explained that based on the agency interpretation of a,the earliest date a federal sentence could commence was the date of imposition,which meant,for purposes of calculating lopez gct,that the relevant term of imprisonment was months.dissatisfied with this response,lopez filed a complaint through the bop administrative remedy program arp,which was denied initially by the prison warden,and on appeal by the bop regional office.in a written decision dated july,the bop regional director explained that the agency interpreted b to permit the award of gct only for time actually served rather than on the sentence imposed,which meant that lopez was eligible for gct only for the months following the date on which he was sentenced in district court,and not for his months of presentence custody.the regional director noted that the bop had promulgated its interpretation of b under.
thereafter,lopez filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus challenging the bop interpretation of b the district court granted the petition in march.the court held that the agency interpretation was unpersuasive under skidmore,and was not entitled to deference because it conflicted with another agency regulation governing presentence custody and did not rely on any particular agency expertise.construing b in the first instance,therefore,the district court concluded that for purposes of calculating gct,the phrase term of imprisonment in that statute encompass ed all of the time a prisoner serves for the federal offense,whether before or after the sentence date,and,if before the sentence date,whether credited under b or.the court thus ordered the bop to compute lopez gct beginning from his initial date of incarceration on august,and,after factoring in his disciplinary record while in state and federal custody,this resulted in the advancement of lopez release date by approximately eight months lopez was subsequently released from prison,but the bop has asserted the right,pending this appeal,to him for the remaining period of his sentence which the agency asserts he owes 
discussion 
we review de novo a district court ruling on a petition.see gueits kirkpatrick,cir.the bop asserts that the district court erred by not deferring to its interpretation of b,which the agency maintains is consistent with federal sentencing law.lopez counters that the bop construction of the statute is not persuasive,and urges us to affirm the judgment below for substantially the same reasons identified by the district court in its decision granting his petition.we determine first the appropriate level of deference to afford the agency interpretation,and we then address lopez specific challenges to that interpretation.
agency deference 
because the bop is the agency charged with implementing b,whether and to what extent we should defer to the bop interpretation turns first on whether the statute is ambiguous.see sash zenk,cir chevron instructs us to defer to the bop interpretation if the statute is ambiguous.citing chevron,natural res.def.council.our analysis begins with the statutory language.
chevron deference 
the parties contest the definition of term of imprisonment as used in the phrase,a prisoner may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner sentence of up to days at the end of each year of the prisoner term of imprisonment.b emphasis added.lopez asserts and the district court agreed that term of imprisonment means the total amount of time an inmate must serve in prison for a federal offense,both before and after sentencing,regardless of whether the inmate receives a credit under b or an adjustment under b.the bop counters that a term of imprisonment is coterminous with an inmate federal sentence as defined under a,such that gct can be awarded for presentence custody credited under b,but not for presentence custody adjusted under b.because both of these interpretations are facially consistent with the language of the statute,and because the statute itself offers no clear definition for term of imprisonment,we have no difficulty concluding that b is ambiguous.indeed,we have already reached this conclusion,albeit in a different context.see sash,at we join our sister circuits in holding that b is ambiguous.barber thomas,observing that b uses the same phrase term of imprisonment in two different ways.
because b is ambiguous,the bop asserts that we must,under chevron,defer to its interpretation of the statute as set forth in,which the agency identifies as its implementing regulation.see generally united states mead,a dministrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.accord de la mota dep t of,cir.that regulation,titled good conduct time,provides in relevant part that f or inmates serving a sentence,the bureau will award days credit for each year served.c.the bop contends that was promulgated to reflect the agency approach to administering a sentence as provid ing credit where permitted by and,in section b cases,to administer the adjusted sentence as it was imposed by the sentencing court.it further asserts that helpfully eliminates th e ambiguity in b by eliminating the phrase term of imprisonment,casting the bop good conduct rule exclusively in terms of the sentence.
we are not convinced by the agency arguments.although the framework of deference set forth in chevron appl ies to an agency interpretation contained in a regulation,christensen harris cnty,where the regulation identified by the agency does not speak to the statutory ambiguity at issue,chevron deference is inappropriate,see id.at declining to afford chevron deference to agency regulation that did not address the dispositive issue in that case.such is the case here.contrary to the agency assertion,provides little guidance to interpret term of imprisonment as used in b indeed,the regulation does not even mention that phrase.and while the bop urges that the word sentence in clarifies that term of imprisonment must refer to an inmate federal sentence as defined under a,this construction unfairly strains the regulation plain and sparse language.most importantly,the agency interpretation of is contradicted by its own announcement in the federal register,published at the time the regulation was promulgated.there,the agency made clear that it was issuing,not for the purpose of defining term of imprisonment in the context of calculating gct under b,but for the limited and unrelated purpose of implementing certain provisions of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of,stat,and the prison litigation reform act of,stat,which keyed accrual of gct to an inmate satisfactory progress toward earning a general educational development ged credential.see good conduct time.
because we reject the bop reliance on as the basis for its construction of b,the agency interpretation at issue here is contained only in sonya cole march letter and the july arp decision by the bop regional director.cole letter is not entitled to chevron deference.see christensen,at holding that agency interpretations contained in informal opinion letters are not entitled to chevron deference accord nathel,cir.the arp decision presents a closer question.christensen made clear that interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals and enforcement guidelines do not warrant chevron style deference.de la mota,at quoting christensen,at.by comparison,interpretations derived from agency lawmaking which would fall within the ambit of chevron are typically those pronouncements which are binding on third parties and originate in a fashion.id.at citing mead.we conclude that the interpretation of b set forth in the july arp decision falls within the former category.it is clearly not the product of a procedure,since it originated from lopez administrative complaint,nor is it binding on any party other than lopez himself.we therefore decline to afford chevron deference to the bop interpretation of b.
skidmore deference 
where chevron deference is not appropriate,we will defer to an agency interpretation only to the extent that it has the power to persuade.catskill,park place entm t,cir citing christensen,at.under skidmore less deferential standard,the weight afforded an agency interpretation depends on the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.natural res.def.council,cir quoting skidmore,at alteration in natural res.def.council omitted.in applying skidmore,we construe the statute in the first instance,giving effect to the agency interpretation to the extent we find it persuasive.estate of landers leavitt,cir.
because the meaning of term of imprisonment is unclear,the bop maintains that the phrase must be understood within the context of the statute as a whole and,in particular,in reference to the word sentence in the preceding phrase,a prisoner may receive credit toward the service of the prisoner sentence.b emphasis added.and unlike term of imprisonment,the agency urges that under sentence has a clear and accepted definition under federal law.it contends,therefore,that because b links accrual of gct to a prisoner sentence,and because a defendant federal sentence is defined in,that latter statute should inform how gct is calculated.applying this interpretation here,the bop calculated lopez gct based solely on the months of imprisonment he served following the date of sentencing because under a,this term of imprisonment constituted lopez federal sentence.the agency excluded from its gct calculation the months of imprisonment lopez served in state and federal custody prior to sentencing,reasoning that under b,those months of imprisonment could not form part of lopez federal sentence because they had already been credited to his state sentence.
we find the bop construction of b persuasive.the agency contextual approach aligns with traditional canons of statutory interpretation.see frank bd.of,cir observing that to resolve an ambiguity in a statute,a court should focus upon the broader context internal quotations and citations omitted see also barber.at relying on the context of b to determine the meaning of term of imprisonment.a defendant sentence is under federal law as the period of incarceration that commences on the date the defendant is received in custody awaiting transportation to,or arrives voluntarily to commence service of sentence at,the official detention facility at which the sentence is to be served.a see united states luna reynoso,cir relying on a to define a defendant federal sentence accord reynolds thomas,cir same united states hayes,cir same moreno cebrero gonzales,cir same united states wells,cir same.because makes clear that gct is earned toward the service of the prisoner sentence,b,the most natural reading of the statute is that a defendant is eligible for gct only as to the term of imprisonment which constitutes the defendant federal sentence as defined by,a construction which,significantly,preserves a consistent definition of sentence in both b and a.gustafson alloyd,i dentical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.gozlon peretz united states,noting that i t is not uncommon to refer to other,related legislative enactments when interpreting specialized statutory terms,since congress is presumed to have legislated with reference to those terms.
in practice,this means in the ordinary course that a defendant is eligible for gct as to each year served on the sentence imposed by the district court.where an inmate is in custody prior to being sentenced,two possible scenarios arise.in the first,if a defendant is arrested for a federal offense and placed in presentence custody,the bop will typically grant the defendant a credit against his sentence under b for that period,but the agency is only empowered to do so after the district court has imposed its sentence.see united states wilson,congress has indicated that computation of the credit under b must occur after the defendant begins his sentence.accord united states waters,cir citing wilson,at see also wilson,at after a district court sentences a federal offender,the attorney general,through the bop,has the responsibility for administering the sentence.luna reynoso,at t he credit to be granted a defendant under b for time during which he was held in federal custody prior to sentencing is administered by the bureau of prisons.because a b credit is awarded after sentencing,the credit has no effect on the sentence imposed by the district court the bop simply advances the ultimate date of release by subtracting from that date the period of time the defendant spent in presentence custody.pepper united states,an award of good time credit by the bop does not affect the length of a sentence.when the bop calculates gct,therefore,it will include the time spent in custody following the date of sentencing as well as any period of presentence custody credited under b,since both periods,in combination,constitute the defendant federal sentence.
in contrast,the second scenario arises when a defendant is convicted and sentenced in state court,and,while serving his state sentence,is indicted federally and sentenced in district court for an offense for which the relevant conduct includes his prior state conviction.under these circumstances which are analogous to the instant case,because the defendant presentence custody has already been credited against another sentence namely,the defendant state sentence the agency is prohibited from crediting that time against his federal sentence.b see gonzalez,at holding that presentence custody credited to a defendant state sentence can not be credited to a defendant federal sentence.to ensure that the defendant does not face punishment for the same criminal conduct in two prosecutions,fermin,at,however,the sentencing guidelines instruct the district court to adjust the defendant federal sentence based on the time already served on his state sentence,since that period of custody can not be credited by the bop under b,b,cmt.when the bop calculates gct,therefore,it will count only the period of incarceration following the date of sentencing in district court because that term of imprisonment constitutes the defendant federal sentence.see labeille soto,at under u.a,a federal sentence can not commence prior to the date on which it is imposed.the agency will not award gct for any presentence time in custody adjusted under b because that time does not constitute part of the defendant federal sentence having already been credited to the defendant state sentence.see b gonzalez,at.
we are persuaded by this reasoning.although no express statutory language requires that b be read in tandem with,the above demonstrates that the agency approach is a valid and convincing construction of the statute,and is consistent with federal sentencing law.see skidmore,at.indeed,we note that the ninth circuit has recently reached this same conclusion on facts substantially identical to those in this case.see schleining thomas,wl at cir.june,because a prisoner can receive gct credit only on time served on his federal sentence,and his federal sentence does not commence until after he has been sentenced in federal court,schleining is not eligible for gct credit for the months he spent in state custody serving a state sentence before imposition of his federal sentence.we disagree,therefore,with the district court ruling to the contrary.
the lower court rejected this approach principally because it concluded that the agency construction of b was inconsistent with l,which the court viewed as permitting the award of gct for periods of detention preceding the defendant federal sentencing date.this was incorrect.section l,which provides that a pretrial detainee may be recommended for good time credit,falls under subpart b,part of title of the code of federal regulations titled extra good time pursuant to which t he bureau of prisons awards extra good time credit for performing exceptionally meritorious service,or for performing duties of outstanding importance or for employment in an industry or camp.a.while the district court relied on l to hold contrary to the agency interpretation of b that the bop did in fact award gct for pretrial detention that did not constitute part of an inmate federal sentence,subpart b,part makes clear that inmates sentenced under the sentencing reform act provisions for offenses committed on or after november,are not eligible for extra good time,but may be considered for a maximum of days of good conduct time credit per year see b.b emphasis added.indeed,as the supreme court observed in barber,with the enactment of the sentencing reform act of,stat,congress sought to achieve both increased sentencing uniformity and greater honesty by mak ing all sentences basically determinate.at quoting mistretta united states,with the result that the sentence the judge imposed would be the sentence the offender actually served,with a sole statutory exception for good time credits under b,id.citing mistretta,at emphasis in original.accordingly,because lopez was sentenced under the sentencing reform act,he was eligible only for gct as defined by b.section l of title of the code of federal regulations,which exclusively governs extra good time,was inapplicable to that calculation 
that said,we recognize a certain tension between some of the institutional concerns the agency identifies and its construction of b this does not make its interpretation unpersuasive,however.one of the rationales advanced by the agency is that to award gct for presentence custody adjusted to another sentence under b would impose an undue administrative burden,because it would compel the bop to monitor and assess disciplinary records from institutions outside its control.at first glance,this reasoning appears to undermine the agency construction.lopez spent nearly four years in federal custody prior to his sentencing in district court,for which he did not receive gct,and after sentencing,he spent six months in state custody,for which he did receive gct.were we to credit the agency rationale,the inverse should be true,since there is little question that the bop administrative burden is significantly reduced if an inmate is in federal custody.
this is not the only relevant consideration,however.although it may be more difficult for the bop to monitor an inmate conduct when he or she is in state custody,if the agency has advance knowledge that such custody constitutes part of the inmate federal sentence,there is a clear incentive for it to do so.here,because the district court ordered that lopez federal sentence run concurrently with his undischarged state prison term,the bop knew from the date of sentencing that any time lopez spent in state custody from that point forward formed part of his federal sentence.thus,the agency had an incentive to monitor lopez behavior during the six months he spent in state custody following sentencing because it was aware that he was eligible for gct during that period.see also schleining,wl at observing that limiting the award of gct to an inmate federal sentence not only tracks the language of a and b it also makes practical sense because it puts the bop on notice of its responsibility either to house the prisoner itself or to monitor his continued incarceration in state prison.by contrast,the bop had no incentive to monitor contemporaneously lopez behavior during the time he spent in state custody prior to sentencing.to require the agency to investigate and assess lopez disciplinary record for that time well after that period had passed would impose a significant administrative burden,avoidance of which does justify,in part,the bop approach to calculating gct.see id.at noting that this contrary rule would pose significant administrative difficulties for the bop,which would be forced to award gct credit to prisoners for a period of time when the bop might have been unaware of the prisoner existence or behavior and unable to monitor the prisoner or the state prison in which he was housed.
ii.lopez arguments 
lopez challenges the bop interpretation of b on three principal grounds.he first contends that the bop applies two different meanings of term of imprisonment depending on whether a defendant receives a credit under b or an adjustment under b.in the former,he asserts that the bop construes term of imprisonment to include time served prior to sentencing,and in the latter,he asserts that the agency restricts term of imprisonment to only the term served after sentencing.we reject this argument.as already discussed,see supra at,the agency uniformly construes term of imprisonment as coterminous with a defendant federal sentence.that this definition results in the award of gct for presentence custody where a defendant receives a b credit,but not where a defendant receives a b adjustment,does not mean that the agency construction of b unfairly strains the meaning of term of imprisonment.rather,this distinction derives simply from the statutory definition of a federal sentence,which excludes presentence custody credited to another sentence see b.
second,lopez maintains that the agency interpretation conflicts with our decision in united states rivers,cir.in rivers,the defendant pled guilty to a single count of distribution of crack cocaine in violation of.a,based on which he was required to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment not less than years.id.at quoting b b.at sentencing,the district court first determined that a month sentence was appropriate,which fell within the applicable to month sentencing guidelines range,and then sua sponte granted rivers an month adjustment under b based on time he had already served in state prison on a related drug offense,which resulted in a remaining sentence of months.see id.at.the government argued on appeal that because b b mandated a minimum sentence,the district court lacked the authority under b to adjust rivers sentence below this statutory threshold.see id.at.we rejected this argument,holding that while an adjustment under b was neither a departure from the sentencing guidelines nor a credit against the minimum sentence,
t he effect of an adjustment is similar to that of a credit.in that sense,the adjustment is no less proscribed by the statutory minimum than where the prisoner is credited by the bop for time already served.so long as the total period of incarceration,after the adjustment,is equal to or greater than the statutory minimum,the statutory dictate has been observed and its purpose accomplished.here,rivers was sentenced to an aggregate period of months,above the minimum sentence mandated by b b.at the end of the day,the resulting adjusted sentence the district court imposed for the totality of the conduct amounts to the sentence intended by the statute.
id.at internal citations omitted.lopez points to rivers as requiring that a b credit and a b adjustment be treated as functionally similar,thus barring the bop from awarding gct as to the former but not as to the latter.we disagree.
although we held in rivers that a b adjustment should be treated similarly to a b credit,we did so specifically in the context of interpreting the phrase sentenced to a term of imprisonment as used in b b,a statute markedly different from b.see rivers,at.in doing so,we relied on decisions by our sister circuits construing criminal statutes containing analogous provisions,which mandated that a defendant shall be imprisoned not less than a certain number of years.id.citing,united states drake,cir.in response to the government claim that those decisions were distinguishable,we held there was no reason to apply a different rule for,despite the fact that statute used the phrase sentenced as opposed to imprisoned,since it would be illogical to permit adjustments for some criminal statutes but disallow them as to others.see id.at.this reasoning is inapplicable to this case.unlike rivers,there is no logical analogue here between,which governs the bop administration of gct,and,which concerns the appropriate punishment for a criminal offense.on that basis alone,we see no reason why rivers should preclude the distinction drawn by the agency between b and b for purposes of calculating gct.see also schleining,wl at holding that drake,in which the ninth circuit announced a rule functionally analogous to our holding in rivers,was inapplicable to that court determination of the relationship between a and b.in any event,the point is not that a b credit and a b adjustment are similar.no one,including the bop,could reasonably dispute with respect to determining t
