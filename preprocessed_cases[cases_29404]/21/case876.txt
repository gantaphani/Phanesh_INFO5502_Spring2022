appellant diego ortiz claims that he unknowingly got caught up in a drug deal when he agreed to drive an acquaintance around town for a few hours.he was indicted along with his passenger and a third individual,but was tried alone after the other two entered pleas.a jury found ortiz guilty on one count of conspiracy and one count of possession,both with the intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine.see,a.on appeal,he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence and also claims that the prosecutor improper closing argument severely prejudiced his case.he further asserts that the district court erred in imposing a mandatory term of imprisonment.we affirm both his conviction and his sentence.
background 
the facts presented at trial,taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution case,are as follows.see united states llinas,cir.
in the of february,an undercover massachusetts state trooper,jaime collazo,and a cooperating witness,raphael tejeda,met in east boston with victor sosa,the target of an investigation by the drug enforcement administration dea,to discuss a purchase of five kilograms of cocaine.sosa,who had sold collazo grams of heroin two weeks earlier,said the cocaine transaction would have to wait until later in the day,when he could get the drugs from his friend.
sosa remained in regular telephone contact with collazo and tejeda,and they eventually arranged to meet up again at a kentucky fried chicken in everett,massachusetts.in the interim,appellant ortiz had become sosa driver and the phone calls from sosa to collazo after were made on ortiz cell phone.sosa told collazo that his phone had run out of minutes.neither collazo nor the cooperating source,tejeda,had encountered ortiz in prior dealings with sosa.
at about,sosa and ortiz,traveling in ortiz car,drove up beside the car in which collazo and tejeda were waiting in the kentucky fried chicken parking lot,and then ortiz pulled back out and drove away with collazo and tejeda following.at some point,collazo called sosa and asked him to stop so they could talk.both cars pulled over,and sosa got out of ortiz car to speak with collazo,out of ortiz hearing.although the plan they devised called for collazo and tejeda to follow sosa to his apartment,collazo became concerned about a possible ambush and stopped following after a while.
two phone calls between the cars,in which the parties discussed whether and how to consummate the deal,then occurred.only the undercover agents end of the conversation was recorded,so no voice identification could be made of the individual who was speaking.although the defense and prosecution agree that the calls were made using ortiz phone,their debate is whether ortiz participated in either conversation.collazo testified that it was not sosa in either instance collazo knew his voice and had had multiple telephone conversations with him earlier in the day.collazo testimony led inevitably to an inference that ortiz had been on the phone discussing resumption of the drug deal.ortiz testified,however,that he never conversed with collazo.moreover,he argues that the evidence shows that tejeda,who did not testify,received the first of the two pertinent collazo testimony about that call.in addition,he asserts that the taped content of the second call,in which collazo refers to meeting at your house,makes it implausible that collazo was talking to ortiz,given that the plan had been to rendezvous at sosa house.
ultimately,the parties agreed to meet at a stop shop.according to the plan,collazo would arrive alone and would call tejeda to bring the money once he saw the cocaine.sosa and ortiz arrived after collazo,and ortiz parked his car beside collazo.ortiz remained in the driver seat while sosa and collazo met between the trunks of the two vehicles.collazo noticed another man,later identified as alex perez,sitting in a third car that was parked parallel to ortiz.when sosa tapped on ortiz trunk,ortiz popped it open using a latch inside the car.sosa showed collazo the cocaine,which was in a blue gym bag,and collazo then alerted waiting law enforcement agents to arrest sosa and the other two men.
as police officers and agents converged on the parking lot,ortiz drove off.a few minutes later,he ran away from the car,leaving it unparked and rolling.with a state trooper siren sounding,the officers,some shouting police,pursued,apprehended and arrested him.ortiz stated,what happened what happened i a united states citizen,and also told the arresting officers he was just the driver.the other guy was doing the deal.
at the police station,after waiving his miranda rights,ortiz was asked if he knew what sosa did for a living.detective joseph gallarelli testified that ortiz replied,sarcastically,officer,please.later in the interrogation,ortiz said that he did not know sosa profession and did not know perez.he admitted that he let sosa use his cell phone and that he had given rides to sosa before.he also told gallarelli that he had given rides in the past to others he believed were drug dealers.
an inventory search of ortiz car turned up small amounts of marijuana and cocaine in the glove compartment,which ortiz admitted were his.the blue bag that had been in the car trunk contained kilograms of cocaine.
testifying in his own defense,ortiz admitted seeing sosa put the blue gym bag in his trunk but said he never saw the contents and did not know what was in it.he explained that he fled the stop shop parking lot because he was frightened and initially neither heard the police siren nor saw the dea or boston police labels on the officers jackets.he said that he had agreed to drive sosa around because he was not working at the time and had nothing to do.he acknowledged answering the phone once while driving sosa around and said that he told the caller to hold on and then handed the phone to sosa.
in rebuttal,the prosecution introduced the testimony of perez,who described bringing the cocaine to sosa apartment.he corroborated ortiz testimony that they did not know each other and that ortiz was not in the room when perez gave sosa the cocaine.perez assisted the government case,however,by testifying that he neither used sosa or ortiz cell phones on the day of the arrest nor spoke with collazo or tejeda that day,reinforcing the inference that ortiz was the unfamiliar voice collazo heard on the phone.
at the end of the government and again at the end of the trial,ortiz moved for judgment of acquittal,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to prove his knowing participation in either the conspiracy or possession.the court reserved its ruling and ultimately allowed the jury verdict to stand.on appeal,ortiz again argues that the evidence was insufficient to support conviction,and he contends that the prosecutor flawed closing argument unfairly impacted the jury deliberations.he also challenges the sentence imposed.we begin by discussing the sufficiency of the evidence,saving the details of the closing argument and sentencing claims for our discussion of those issues in sections iii and iv.
ii.sufficiency of the evidence 
when a judge expressly reserves decision on a motion for acquittal under.a,it must decide the motion on the basis of the evidence at the time the ruling was reserved.b see united states moran,cir.our review,which is de novo,is similarly limited.united states finn,cir united states wahl.we therefore consider only the evidence presented in the government to assess whether a rational factfinder could find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime,moran,at quoting united states,cir.
in so doing,we take all inferences in the light most favorable to the verdict,we give equal weight to both direct and circumstantial evidence,and we neither weigh witness credibility nor require the prosecution to eliminat e every possible theory consistent with the defendant innocence,united states,cir citation omitted.see also united states hatch,cir united states,cir.a s long as the guilty verdict finds support in a plausible rendition of the record,it must stand.moran,at quoting united states ortiz,cir.
it is a rare appellant who can mount a successful sufficiency attack in the face of these principles,see,at,and ortiz has not managed to so distinguish himself.while he raises intelligent challenges to multiple pieces of evidence,he is unable to offset the tilt in favor of the jury judgment.cumulatively,as we shall describe,the evidence and the inferences reasonably drawn from it allowed the jury to find him guilty on both counts.
to prove a defendant guilty of the crime of conspiracy,the government must show the existence of a conspiracy,the defendant knowledge of the conspiracy,and the defendant voluntary participation.united states,cir see also united states,cir.mere association with conspirators or mere presence during conduct that is part of the conspiracy is insufficient to establish knowing participation,at the defendant must be found to have shared his intent to commit the substantive offense,llinas,at.the substantive count,which was charged under the aiding and abetting statute as well,see,required proof of essentially the same state of mind,ortiz intent to help sosa effectuate the cocaine deal.see united states henderson,cir.
the evidence,viewed in the government favor,was more than ample to support the verdict.it is undisputed that ortiz spent several hours in the late afternoon and early evening on the day of the deal driving sosa from location to location,making one stop to rendezvous with collazo and tejeda in the kentucky fried chicken parking lot and another stop to allow sosa to converse with collazo.multiple phone calls were exchanged between the occupants of the two vehicles.even if the encounter started out simply as a request from sosa for a ride,given the length of time they spent together,the phone calls in ortiz presence,and sosa placing the blue gym bag in the trunk of ortiz car,a jury reasonably could suspect that ortiz had become aware of the nature of sosa business at some point before the meeting at stop shop and become a willing accomplice in the transaction.significantly,ortiz was not a novice with respect to drugs he admitted to police that the marijuana and cocaine found in his glove compartment were his own,suggesting a familiarity with the methodology of drug deals.
collazo testimony about his phone conversations with someone other than essence,testimony that he spoke with the transformation of ortiz from possible bystander to knowing collaborator.that characterization was reinforced by ortiz flight and his statement that t he other guy was doing the deal,both reasonably viewed as efforts to distance himself from a crime he knew about and assisted but considered sosa responsibility.other evidence,while independently less inculpatory,also supported a finding that ortiz willingly participated in the attempted transaction that he pulled in beside collazo and tejeda car at stop shop that he immediately opened the trunk at sosa bidding that he allowed sosa to use his cell phone repeatedly to call collazo and perez.
appellant seeks in his brief to diminish the force of the government evidence by pointing to innocent explanations.sosa always needed a ride,and ortiz was unemployed,so his lengthy engagement as sosa driver was unremarkable.ortiz claims that he fled the scene when the police arrived because he did realize at first that they were law enforcement officers,and he feared for his safety.he asserts that his first excited statements what happened what happened i a citizen.i did do nothing wrong.reflect confusion and innocence,not consciousness of guilt.indeed,he points out that,once it became clear that he had been caught in a drug deal,he cooperated with the officers and gave a full account of his travels with sosa.although he concedes that the evidence shows that he knew what was going on by the time he was arrested,he asserts that there was no evidence of knowledge before that time.the officers had never previously seen him during surveillance of sosa,and there was no evidence that he played a role in this transaction before he turned up as sosa driver.
on each of these points,however,the possibility of innocuous explanations for his behavior does not foreclose the jury contrary inferences.see united states hughes,cir citation omitted t he jury is generally at liberty to select freely among a variety of reasonable constructions of the evidence.on the excited utterances,for example,ortiz assertion that he did nothing wrong could simply reflect his belief that driving someone else to transact that person drug deal is not illegal.
appellant similarly challenges the strength of the evidence on the phone conversations that collazo testified were with someone other than sosa,and we grant that the pertinent testimony was confusing.at one point on direct examination,collazo appeared to testify that someone other than sosa was involved in three separate phone conversations,while his testimony on referred explicitly only to one.in their briefs,the parties focus on two calls.appellant argues that collazo testimony about the unfamiliar voice he heard on the first of these calls was entirely discredited on when collazo admitted that it was tejeda,not collazo,who was on the phone that time.the transcript,however,reveals that,while tejeda answered the phone and initially relayed collazo words to the caller,tejeda ultimately said y ou talk to him.the next bit of dialogue may reflect collazo talking directly to the so the jury reasonably could have found.
while there is no direct evidence that collazo received a response to his thus heard the caller voice at that an inference would have been reasonable based on collazo testimony that he heard the other voice more than once.but however opaque the testimony about the earlier call,ortiz was implicated by collazo unequivocal testimony that it was not sosa with whom he spoke on the second call.ortiz,however,argues that the content of the second to your house and noting collazo past demonstration that he was serious about the it clear that collazo must have been speaking with sosa it was sosa house to which they had been heading to consummate the transaction,and it was sosa with whom collazo had been negotiating.
although ortiz logic is rational,his view is again not the only possible interpretation of the conversation.collazo knew that sosa was using someone else phone and traveling as a passenger in someone else car,and it is quite plausible that,perceiving ortiz and sosa to be partners,he would make no distinction between them in framing his comments.to the extent such an inference depends upon the credibility of collazo repeated assurance that the second caller was not sosa,the judgment was the jury to make.
we thus acknowledge that plausible competing inferences exist and concede that,even from the government perspective,the evidence,which was entirely circumstantial,shows only limited involvement by ortiz.but competing inferences are not enough to disturb the jury verdict,and limited involvement is nonetheless involvement.when the pieces of evidence are layered,with inferences taken in the government favor,this is not a case in equipoise a jury easily could find that ortiz,while perhaps brought into the conspiracy on the spur of the moment because he had a car and was available,was a willing participant at the critical time.we therefore conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
iii.prosecution closing argument 
ortiz argues that his conviction should be reversed because the government closing argument was severely flawed,prejudicing the jury against him.he asserts that the prosecutor misstated the record on multiple occasions,invited an improper inference and vouched for a witness.because he did not object to any portion of the closing at trial,however,his claims may be reviewed only for plain error.see united states decicco,cir henderson,at.under the plain error standard,a defendant not only must show an error that was obvious and that affected substantial rights but also must persuade the court that the error seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.johnson united
