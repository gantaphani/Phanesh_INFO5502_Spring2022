background 
in april,politano sold three guns and approximately rounds of ammunition to a confidential witness.on august,politano was indicted on one count of engaging in the business of dealing in firearms without a license.politano subsequently pled guilty to the charges in the indictment.
at sentencing,the district court adopted the presentence report psr recommended guidelines offense level of.to arrive at that offense level,the court began with a base offense level of for prohibited transactions involving firearms or ammunition,a,added two levels because the offense involved three to seven firearms,id.b a,and two more levels because at least one firearm was stolen,id.b a.it then reduced the offense level by three for acceptance of responsibility to arrive at the offense level of.id.a b.the court also accepted the psr determination that the defendant had a criminal history category i,and that his advisory gsr was therefore twelve to eighteen months.
the district court went on to invite the parties to address the sentencing factors set forth in a and suggest an appropriate sentence.the government stated that it was concerned about what will happen when politano is discharged and that it was important to continue to detain politano until the probation department could devise a program to prevent recidivism.the government recommended a sentence of twelve months incarceration,followed by a term of supervised release.
the district court asked the probation officer about certain unresolved criminal matters in brockton district court the probation officer stated that the cases were in fact unresolved and that default warrants had been issued because politano,being in federal custody,was unable to appear in those cases.counsel for politano said he would move those cases along once he had the opportunity to do so.
politano told the court that he agreed with the government recommendation of twelve months incarceration.he noted that he agreed it was necessary for a plan to be in place with the probation department before politano release.politano also emphasized that he had only one prior conviction for resisting arrest.finally,he noted that under the supervision of the probation department,politano could start working and lead a productive life.
at that point,the district court began its consideration of the sentence,first addressing the nature and circumstances of the offense.the district court explained that,pursuant to,it would consider the seriousness of the offense,to promote respect for the law,to provide just punishment,to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct both specifically and generally,and to protect the public from further crimes by the defendant.the court further stated 
i think any reader of the daily newspapers is aware that the illegal trafficking of firearms at the street level is a significant contributing factor in what,without exaggeration i think,can be called an epidemic of handgun violence in communities within this district.not only do guns sold illegally in this way directly facilitate crimes of violence,but they also indirectly facilitate other crimes,including drug offenses.and so i think in light of these considerations,it is necessary to regard this engaging in the business,i emphasize that,of selling firearms illegally to be a very serious offense in this district at this point in time.and so i think it has to be punished by a sentence which reflects the seriousness,promotes respect for it in compliance with the law,and has an effect both specifically but also a general deterrence effect as advice to others who might commit it.
another factor is the history and characteristics of the defendant.and it is true he is a young man.he has a very brief countable criminal history.there are more encounters with the law enforcement than are countable under the guidelines.and i think when considered in conjunction with the defendant social history,it is,i think,fair to say that the guidelines somewhat underestimate or undercount the likelihood of recidivism,which is a concern.
the district court then sentenced politano to months incarceration.the court had not advised the parties beforehand that it was considering a sentence above the guidelines recommendation.
on appeal,politano challenges the sentence on two grounds.first,he argues that the sentence is unreasonable.second,he argues that the sentence is defective for lack of notice.
ii.discussion 
reasonableness 
we review a district court sentence for reasonableness,which involves a procedural as well as a substantive inquiry.see gall united states,d united states martin,wl,at cir.
we first determine whether the district court made any procedural errors such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.gall.at.where the district court has committed no such error,we next turn to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence actually imposed and review the sentence for abuse of discretion.see martin,at,wl,at see also gall.at our explanation of reasonableness review in the booker opinion made it pellucidly clear that the familiar standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions.citing united states booker,d rita united states,d r easonableness review merely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.
in view of the supreme court recent decision in gall,we emphasize that the broad discretion afforded to the district court is paramount after the court has calculated the gsr,sentencing becomes a judgment call,and a variant sentence may be constructed based on a complex of factors whose interplay and precise weight can not even be precisely described.martin,at,wl,at quoting united states,cir en banc.t he linchpin of a reasonableness sentence is a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible overall result.id.at,wl,citing united states,cir en banc.
after properly calculating the gsr,the district court in this case sentenced politano to a term above the recommended range based on the a factors.our focus is,therefore,directed at whether the district court provided a sufficient explanation for its variance and whether the overall result is defensible,wl,at the court reasons for deviation should typically be rooted either in the nature and circumstances of the offense or the characteristics of the offender must add up to a plausible rationale and must justify a variance of the magnitude in question.
in imposing its sentence,the district court noted that the crime of engaging in the business of dealing in firearms without a license is a very serious offense in the district of massachusetts at this point in time,specifically because it directly facilitate s crimes of violence,and indirectly facilitate s other crimes,including drug offenses in the district of massachusetts.consequently,the district court opined,politano crime ha d to be punished by a sentence which reflects the seriousness of the offense,promotes respect for it in compliance with the law,and has an effect both specifically but also a general deterrence effect as advice to others who might commit it.thus,in considering the factors set forth in a the district court thought that the characteristics in the district of massachusetts made politano offense more serious and the need for deterrence greater than that reflected by the guidelines.
considerations regarding the seriousness of the offense and adequate deterrence are both factors which the
