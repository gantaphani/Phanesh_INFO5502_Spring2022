following a trial,a jury found shi yong wei and lin guang guilty of conspiracy to commit extortion,in violation of.shi was also convicted of eight substantive counts of extortion,each involving a different victim,and lin was convicted of three of the substantive counts of extortion,counts,and.the united states district court for the southern district of new york berman,entered judgment of conviction in lin case on august,and sentenced him to months imprisonment,to be followed by three years supervised release.the court entered judgment of conviction in shi case on november,and sentenced him to months imprisonment,to be followed by three years supervised release.both defendants were ordered to pay restitution.shi and lin now appeal their judgments of conviction and the sentences imposed upon them.
lin raises five issues on appeal.challenging his conviction,he argues that the district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of lin uncharged bad acts,and that trial counsel failure to object to the admission of tapes and transcripts amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel challenging his sentence,lin argues that factors which determine a sentencing guidelines range must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that due process required an evidentiary hearing to resolve the dispute over the application of guideline enhancements and that the sentencing enhancements were not supported by sufficient evidence.
shi raises four issues on appeal.challenging his conviction,he argues that the district court should have granted his motion for new trial based upon ineffective assistance of counsel.challenging his sentence,shi argues that the district court determination that a victim sustained permanent injury was unsupported by the evidence that its determination of the amount of loss was likewise unsupported by the evidence and that as a result the order of restitution lacked a factual basis.
we find no merit in shi and lin challenges to their convictions.their challenges to their sentences likewise fail to persuade,with one exception.we agree with the defendants that the district court lacked sufficient facts to make a finding of permanent bodily injury to one of the victims.because this error could have affected both defendants sentences,their cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
i.the offenses 
between and,shi yong wei engaged in a campaign of extortion designed to generate business for his gift shop,which catered to chinese tourists.the victims of the extortion scheme were a rival gift shop owner,a restaurant owner,and tour guides who were coerced by force and threats of force to steer business to shi shop,known as the gift shop.shi enlisted lin guang and a gang of young men known as the little brothers to carry out the intimidation.many of the gang members were younger than eighteen years old.count,of which both lin and shi were convicted,charged them with conspiracy to commit extortion.
zhang qing hai count 
zhang qing hai came to the united states from china in.he opened a gift shop in midtown manhattan in that catered mainly to chinese tourist groups,as well as students and workers at the united nations and the chinese consulate.zhang typically paid tour guides a commission of between five and twenty percent of sales.the store,named xinhua,was located on street,less than a block away from shi store,which opened in may.the two stores directly competed for business.
zhang store was doing well,generating profits of more than a month during his best months.in january shi called zhang and complained that his prices were too low.zhang paid no particular attention,and ended the call,but several minutes later he received an anonymous phone call that first asked you want to live or not,and proceeded to threaten to break his legs if he came outside.
zhang called shi in an effort to resolve the problem,and they agreed to meet at a restaurant called the jade palace a little after midnight.shortly after zhang arrived,his table and the next table filled up with supporters of shi,some of them teenagers.shi identified them as his brothers.this group proceeded to ridicule him and threaten to shut down his store.shi handed him a document and a member of the group told him that if he did not sign he would not be safe.zhang refused to sign without reading it and everyone at the table stood up.zhang was afraid that something dangerous was about to happen.shi sent them out,and arranged that zhang could go home safely that night,but told him to call and tell shi what he intended to do.
zhang received several threatening phone calls from one of shi gang,and about a week later zhang store was plagued by the daily presence of shi gang in front of the store,taking photographs of the tour guides vehicles and disparaging zhang wares.business fell off.after approximately three weeks of this,shi came to zhang store and demanded for his little brothers.zhang paid.the youths stopped appearing in front of his store for approximately three months,then the youths reappeared and shi demanded and received another in protection money.lin was involved in organizing the youths to harass zhang.
in may zhang opened a second store several blocks away,hoping to keep his ownership secret and escape shi attention.in july a gang of the little brothers led by lin assaulted zhang near his second store.shi was present.the gang punched and kicked zhang,sprayed a blinding liquid in his face and left him bleeding and moaning in the street.zhang was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries.at the hospital zhang was able to rinse out his eyes and they felt better.zhang testified that from that point on he found it difficult to read newspapers because it hurt his eyes.after the assault zhang closed his second store.he stated that he lost in reduced sales after shi gang besieged his store,and as a result of the opening and closing of the second store.
xiao yung fei count 
xiao yung fei came to the united states in.he heads the friendship association,and conducted tours for delegations from china.as part of his tours xiao would take his groups to gift shops,for which he would receive a commission.
in spring of,xiao twice encountered shi at the statue of liberty.both times shi complained that xiao was not giving him face by not bringing groups to shi store.shi embarrassed and frightened xiao in front of his tour groups.some time later the front window of his van was smashed.tires were slashed on three different vehicles.
in june xiao was giving a tour at the united nations when shi accosted him,insulted him and threatened to beat him up.shi bragged that he had a gang of juveniles who would face any penalties if they were to injure or kill someone.shi proceeded to punch and attempt to choke him.the next day xiao received an anonymous phone call telling him that he had been beaten enough and that the caller was going to break his legs.xiao virtually stopped giving tours.
peter yuan count 
peter yuan came to the united states in.he worked as a tour guide from to,and currently wholesales tickets to tourist destinations in the new york city area.shi invited yuan to dinner at the jade palace in or early and told him he wanted yuan to find investors for a new store shi intended to open.shi wife bragged about his underworld connections.yuan,intimidated,said he think about it.he did not seek out investors,and over the next few weeks received phone calls from shi asking about his progress in collecting money.yuan tried to avoid him but eventually shi took him again to the jade palace and confronted yuan,telling him that with a phone call he could have ten or twenty little brothers there.yuan said he would try,but did not.
after shi opened his gift shop,he told yuan that he must bring his tours only to his store,and threatened to slash his tires if he refused.yuan tires were slashed,and he began bringing his groups to the gift shop.after yuan was accosted and threatened by two of shi young men,he stopped conducting tours.
nevertheless,shi demanded protection money if yuan wanted to do business in new york.for seven months yuan paid each month.yuan attended another dinner at the jade palace at shi invitation,along with several other tour guides.shi demanded that the tour guides accompany him to a karaoke bar,where he introduced lin as one of his gang.lin threatened to photograph the face and license plate of any tour guide who did patronize shi store.
in january shi required yuan to attend a chinese new year banquet at the jade palace along with about fifty other tour guides.while they were eating a group of thirty to forty youths dressed in black paraded into the restaurant and sat down at several tables.lin was among the group.at one point one of the group began chanting a slogan,and all of the group stood up and began chanting together.
shi continued to threaten yuan once he began wholesaling tickets,telling him he would send his little brothers to his home to break his legs.in the fall of yuan essentially did not leave his home for fear of what shi and his gang might do to him.
at zhang request yuan made a digital recording of shi and lin on xiao recorder.the government and the defense stipulated to the admission of the recordings and accuracy of the english translation,with one exception,a phrase attributed to lin,whose translation he disputed.
lin ji tiang count 
lin ji tiang came to the united states from china in.he opened a restaurant in manhattan called sun east.shi wanted lin ji tiang to send customers to his gift shop.in lin ji tiang held a small chinese new year party for tour guides at his restaurant.he invited shi for the next day,but shi showed up on the first day with six or seven of his little brothers.lin ji tiang did not dare to charge them,although they were uninvited.
shi tried to get lin ji tiang to throw a bigger party for tour guides of shi selection.when lin ji tiang protested that he could afford this party,shi got angry and left.on occasion shi would arrive at the restaurant and treat the kitchen as his own,cooking meals for himself.one time shi hauled lin ji tiang up the stairs of his restaurant holding his arm behind his back.twice lin ji tiang found cement in the lock of his restaurant.once he found a on the floor while shi was in his restaurant.shi said such a knife is used on people who do listen,gesturing with the knife as though he would slip it between his ribs.shi also said such a knife is used to slash tires.lin ji tiang was scared.
lin ji tiang restaurant displayed a sign advertising the gift shop.when the sign fell down,shi berated him and threatened to get his gang to beat him to death.he demanded as the cost of the sign.the tour guides stopped coming to his restaurant because shi was constantly there and they were afraid to come.the restaurant was losing money,and lin ji tiang was scared all the time,so he decided to close the restaurant,in october.
xu xin count 
xu xin came to the united states from china and worked as a tour guide in.after shi opened his store,he ordered xu to bring his tours there exclusively.when xu failed to do so,shi began calling and threatening to have his little brothers beat him up.xu was angry and frightened.he learned from peter yuan that shi and lin knew where he lived in new jersey.xu found his tires slashed and sugar poured in his gas tank.lin left a message on his answering machine claiming credit for the damaged car.xu left the tour business for awhile as a result of the threats and the harassment.
wang jun count 
wang jun came to the united states from china in.he worked as a tour guide from to.when shi store opened,he took his tours there a few times,but stopped doing so after an employee of the store told him not to mess with shi.about two weeks later the tires on wang van were slashed.his tires were slashed three more times over the summer of.during that time he received repeated telephone calls from shi threatening to do worse than slash his tires.wang also saw shi at the united nations and statue of liberty writing down the license plate numbers of tour guides vans.
zhang liang count 
zhang liang came to the united states from china in.he began working as a tour guide in spring of.on his first day on the job,shi accosted him at the statue of liberty and told him to bring his business to the gift shop.some time later he was approached by two of shi gang with the same message while he was at the united nations.zhang liang complied with shi demands out of fear of the consequences.
zhang fuchi david zhang count 
david zhang came to the united states in.he worked as a tour guide in new york city from to.after shi opened up his store,he told zhang to bring his tours there,and not to any other store.david zhang continued to bring his tours to different stores,and shi threatened to beat him up and break his legs.he was threatened again a few days later,in an anonymous voicemail.he recorded the message,and gave the tape to the police.some days later the same individual called and threatened him again.some time after that two individuals jumped him,pulled his over his head,beat him up and ran away.after this david zhang decided that he did not want to work as a tour guide anymore.he took a variety of much jobs thereafter.he returned to the tour guide business when he learned that shi had been arrested.
ii.the ineffective assistance of counsel claim and rule motion 
following the convictions on march,shi attorney wrote to the district court,requesting that new counsel be appointed for shi to pursue shi claim that his trial counsel had been constitutionally ineffective in having failed to object to the admissibility of the recorded conversations and their transcripts.shi obtained new counsel,who filed an ex parte request on may,for an expert to make a forensic examination of the two audio recordings to determine whether they had been altered or manipulated.lin new counsel sought to join the motion.
the district court ordered the government to respond to the request,finding no basis for an ex parte discovery application.the government opposed shi request for leave to hire an expert to analyze the recordings,pointing out first that shi allegations of tampering with the recordings would have gone to the weight rather than the admissibility of the evidence,and second that any error in failing to object to the recordings would not have been prejudicial,given the testimony of eight victims of shi extortion scheme and corroborating testimony of former members of shi and lin gang.
the district court denied the motion for a new trial on october.it found that the decision not to hire an expert was a strategic choice,that the defense had vigorously peter yuan who made the recordings,that it found yuan testimony credible,and that the evidence against the defendants was overwhelming despite the recordings.the district court concluded that defense counsel performance was not objectively unreasonable.
iii.the presentence investigation reports and the sentencing hearings 
the united states probation office prepared presentence investigation reports for lin and shi,and calculated guideline sentencing ranges for both according to the advisory united states sentencing guidelines.
for each conviction of violating,the base offense level was,pursuant to sentencing guidelines manual a.two levels were added for the use of express or implied threats of death or bodily injury,pursuant to b.with the exception of count,the district court found that the extortions involved the use of minors,and added two levels pursuant to.
for count,the extortion involving zhang qing hai,the district court concluded that shi and lin caused a loss of more than,and added two levels pursuant to b and b.the district court also concluded that zhang sustained permanent bodily injury from his beating,and added six levels pursuant to b c.
lin sentencing 
according to the guidelines analysis,lin adjusted offense level was,based on the upward adjustments for use of threats,minors,the loss and permanent injury suffered by zhang qing hai,and an additional increase for his role as a manager or supervisor of criminal activity involving five or more participants.see b.application of the grouping rules added two levels for a total combined offense level of.at criminal history category i,lin guideline range was to months.
at lin sentencing on august,the district court acknowledged the advisory nature of the united states sentencing guidelines,and that it was bound to consider the factors set forth at a in determining a reasonable and appropriate sentence.the district court decided that a fatico hearing to resolve disputed sentencing issues was unnecessary,given the extensive trial testimony and the parties submissions.see united states fatico,cir.
the district court concluded that a sentence at the low end of the guideline range was reasonable,in light of the a factors.lin received a sentence of months,plus three years of supervised release.the court ordered restitution to four victims to zhang qing hai,to xiao yung fei,to peter yuan,and to david zhang 
shi sentencing 
according to the guidelines,shi adjusted offense level was,based on the upward adjustments for use of threats,minors,the loss and permanent injury suffered by zhang qing hai,and an additional four level increase for his role as an organizer or leader of criminal activity that involved five or more participants.see a.application of the grouping rules to shi convictions added four levels for a total combined offense level of.at criminal history category i,shi guideline range was to months.
at shi sentencing on november,the district court followed a similar analysis to that performed in lin case.the district court considered the guideline determination,along with the sentencing factors listed at a,and concluded that a sentence at the low end of the guideline range was reasonable and appropriate.accordingly,the district court sentenced shi to months imprisonment,plus three years of supervised release.restitution was ordered in the amount of,to zhang qing hai,to xiao yung fei,to peter yuan,and to david zhang.
discussion 
denial of motion for new trial 
both shi and lin argue that the district court erred in denying motions for a new trial on the ground that trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective representation by failing to challenge the admissibility of recordings made by one of the victims,and the transcripts of those recordings.shi also argues that the district court erred in denying his ex parte request for funds to hire an expert to determine whether the recordings had been altered,and in forwarding the defense request to the government for a response.
rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides that a trial court may vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.the test is whether it would be a manifest injustice to let the guilty verdict stand.united states sanchez,cir quoting united states reed,cir.for a trial judge to grant a rule motion,he must harbor a real concern that an innocent person may have been convicted.united states parkes,cir quoting united states ferguson,cir.denial of a rule motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.id.
the trial judge refused to grant shi and lin a new trial,stating that he had no concern that an innocent party had been convicted,and that the defendants had not met either prong of the strickland washington standard.see strickland washington,d.
we review a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel de novo.united states finley,cir.under strickland,a defendant must demonstrate that counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for the deficiency,the outcome would have been different.id.alterations in original quoting mckee united states,cir.
a strong presumption exists that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,given that t here are countless ways to provide effective assistance in any given case and that e ven the best criminal defense attorneys would not defend a particular client in the same way.united states aguirre,cir alterations in original quoting strickland,at.defense counsel have a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.strickland,at.accord gersten senkowski,cir.
in this case,however,even were shi and lin to establish that their counsel unreasonably failed to employ an expert to challenge the authenticity of the tapes,and unreasonably failed to object to the admission of the recordings and transcripts,they have failed to establish prejudice.as the district court accurately pointed out,the evidence against the defendants was overwhelming.the district court also found that peter yuan testimony,as the authenticating witness,was sufficient to support the admission of the recordings under rule of the federal rules of evidence,and that disputes over the reliability of the recordings or the accuracy of the translation went to the weight rather than the admissibility of the evidence.moreover,lin counsel vigorously yuan on his identification of lin as the speaker on portions of the tape.he presented an alternative translation for a particular portion of the recording attributed to lin that was alleged to be a threat.
given that the jury had more than sufficient evidence from which to find both defendants guilt without the admission of the recordings and transcripts,counsels failure to secure the services of an expert to investigate whether the tapes showed signs of tampering did not prejudice lin or shi.their decision to stipulate to the admission of the recordings and translations was a strategic choice that could not have prejudiced them,given yuan availability to authenticate the recordings,the translators testimony as to the accuracy of the translations,and the defense of both yuan and the government translator concerning disputed portions of the recordings and transcripts.because the defendants can not show prejudice,this court need not consider the objective reasonableness of counsel actions.united states birkin,cir accord greiner wells,cir t here is no reason for a court deciding an ineffective assistance claim to address both components of the inquiry if the defendant makes an insufficient showing on one.alterations in original quoting strickland,at.
as we do not find the stipulation to the admission of the recordings and translations or the failure to obtain the services of a forensic audio expert to have caused prejudice to the defendants,the district court denial of their motions for a new trial was not an abuse of discretion.the failure to grant a application for funds to hire such an expert likewise did not constitute an abuse of discretion,and there was no error in the district court refusal to consider ex parte the request for funds.
ii.admission of uncharged bad acts against lin 
lin argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of four incidents of prior bad acts involving lin.specifically,the government offered evidence that one of the extortion victims observed lin confront unruly customers at a massage parlor controlled by shi with his hand inside his jacket as if he concealed a gun that lin and others assaulted a former confederate who had betrayed lin that lin ran a gambling house owned by shi and that lin became the leader of the gang because he reputedly beat up the leader of a taiwanese gang.for three of the incidents the trial court gave a limiting instruction that the evidence was admissible to show a relationship of mutual trust between shi and lin with regard to lin reputation for having beaten up the taiwanese gang leader,no limiting instruction was requested and none given.the trial court excluded several other incidents proffered by the government.
a district court decision to admit other crimes evidence under rule b will not be overturned on appeal absent abuse of discretion.united states rosa,cir.in a conspiracy case,other acts evidence is admissible as background information,to demonstrate the existence of a relationship of mutual trust,or to enable the jury to understand how the illegal relationship between the developed.united states pipola,cir.
the second circuit inclusionary approach to the admission of other act evidence allows such evidence to be admitted for any purpose other than to demonstrate criminal propensity.united states laflam,cir per curiam.
to determine whether a district court properly admitted other act evidence,the reviewing court considers whether it was offered for a proper purpose it was relevant to a material issue in dispute its probative value is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect and the trial court gave an appropriate limiting instruction to the jury if so requested by the defendant.
id.evidence of the four uncharged incidents was properly admitted.the evidence was not offered to show lin criminal propensity,but to show the existence of the illegal relationship between shi and lin and how it developed.the trial court found that the evidence was not unfairly prejudicial,and gave limiting instructions as requested by the defendants.we find no abuse of discretion.
iii.sentencing issues 
lin and shi challenged the application of sentencing enhancements for their role in the offense,use of minors to commit the offenses,permanent injury to one victim,and the loss amounts.in addition,lin argued that the enhancements could not be applied unless they were proven beyond a reasonable doubt,and both defendants argued that a fatico hearing was necessary to determine challenged facts.see united states fatico,cir.
lin argument that the facts upon which a sentencing court calculates the applicable guideline range must either be admitted or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt perished with this circuit confirmation in united states salazar that the statutory requirement to determine a guidelines range,and do so in the same manner as before booker,necessarily means that facts relevant to sentencing must be found by a preponderance of the evidence,cir per curiam.
lin and shi contention that the sentencing court was required to give them a fatico hearing likewise lacks merit.the district court is not required,by either the due process clause or the federal sentencing guidelines,to hold a evidentiary hearing in resolving sentencing disputes.all that is required is that the court afford the defendant some opportunity to rebut the government allegations.united states phillips,cir quoting united states slevin,cir.lin and shi submitted letter briefs opposing the probation department calculation of their guideline ranges in its presentence reports.at sentencing their attorneys argued against the enhancements that they currently challenge.
the district court stressed that it had heard extensive trial testimony,had observed the demeanor of the witnesses and assessed their credibility over a trial.it had reviewed the submissions of all parties,as well as the presentence investigation report,and concluded that the challenged enhancements were warranted.lin and shi had notice of the proposed enhancements,including the evidence upon which the enhancements were based,and had an opportunity to dispute the evidence.the only issue is whether the challenged enhancements were based upon sufficient facts.
in reviewing a district court application of the guidelines to the specific facts of a case,we accord de novo review to issues of law,and accept its findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous.united states gotti,cir.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states cuevas,cir quoting united states hazut,cir.f actual findings based on the testimony of witnesses are entitled to special deference,because assessing the credibility of witnesses is distinctly the province of the district court.united states beverly,cir accord cuevas,at.
use of minors 
section of the sentencing guidelines provides for a increase i f the defendant used or attempted to use a person less than eighteen years of age to commit the offense.the application notes indicate that u sed or attempted to use includes directing,commanding,encouraging,intimidating,counseling,training,procuring,recruiting,or soliciting.id.cmt.lin argues that there is no record evidence that the little brothers were younger than eighteen years of age.the record demonstrates the contrary,as the district court noted in citing the government august,submission.among the numerous witnesses who testified about shi gang of little brothers,describing them as kids,was steven han,a member of the gang,who testified that the membership ranged in age f rom until the.shi himself told one of his extortion victims,xiao yung fei,that the members of his gang were all juveniles because in america,when a juvenile injures or kills someone,they do face any penalty.extortion victim zhang qing hai testified that the kids sent to loiter in front of his gift shop were kids,around,teenager kids.there was no error in adjusting lin guidelines offense level upward by two levels for use of a minor.
loss amount 
pursuant to b and b c,the district court imposed a enhancement for a loss greater than but less than sustained by zhang qing hai.loss to a victim in an extortion case means any demand paid plus any additional consequential loss from the offense.id.cmt.the district court based its determination of loss on zhang testimony that he suffered in lost sales,in loss associated with the opening of a second store and paid in protection money.the defendants argue that a district court may not rely upon the uncorroborated testimony of a victim as to amount of loss when that amount is disputed,and that the victim own testimony indicated that his estimate was unreliable.
a district court need not establish the loss with precision but rather need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,given the available information.united states carboni,cir quoting united states jacobs,cir.
zhang testified that in good months he made more than in profits,but in his worst months,for example after september,he lost money.he testified that the extortion began in early,and he continued to feel the effects of the intimidation campaign in lost profits up to the trial.this was because many tour guides who used to frequent his shop stopped bringing their tours to his shop in spring of,and never returned.shi was arrested in november.zhang estimated that overall,as a result of the intimidation campaign in spring of,he lost at least.zhang also estimated that he lost as a result of closing his second store after shi gang assaulted him.
the district court found zhang testimony entirely credible.we give strong deference to findings based on credibility determinations.united states johnson,cir.zhang estimate of in lost sales at his first shop is not unreasonable,given the length of time that his business continued to suffer the effects of shi and lin intimidation campaign.the district court conclusion that the evidence at trial established that the extortion of zhang caused a loss of more than was likewise not unreasonable,given the added losses associated with closing the second store after six months of operation,and the protection money payments.
v iew ing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,id.at,the district court reliance on zhang estimate of his losses was not clearly erroneous.
permanent injury 
section b of the sentencing guidelines provides for an increase in offense level if any victim sustained bodily injury,according to the seriousness of the injury.bodily injury,defined as any significant injury,an injury that is painful and obvious,or is of a type for which medical attention ordinarily would be sought,cmt.b,receives a increase.id.b a.serious bodily injury,defined as injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty or requiring medical intervention such as surgery,hospitalization,or physical rehabilitation,id,cmt.l,receives a increase.id.b b.permanent or bodily injury,defined as injury involving a substantial risk of death loss or substantial impairment of the function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty that is likely to be permanent or an obvious disfigurement that is likely to be permanent,id,cmt.j,receives a increase.id.b c.an injury whose degre
