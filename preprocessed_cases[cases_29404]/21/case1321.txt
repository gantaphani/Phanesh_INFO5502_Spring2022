statement of the case 
a.the facts 
the evidence at trial established the following 
in november,an individual the cooperating witness,or cw was arrested in norwich,connecticut,on narcotics charges,and began cooperating with authorities.on december,the cw told investigators that he had spoken with page with whom he had a prior relationship about buying crack cocaine.under the supervision of law enforcement,the cw arranged to purchase crack cocaine from page.the cw spoke to page,and page directed him to a woman the cw knew to be page girlfriend,josephine sullivan the cw had previously purchased drugs from her after making the arrangements with page.sullivan,who testified at trial,had been a part of page drug distribution business since the summer of.the cw met sullivan at her apartment,on boswell street,and purchased grams of crack cocaine for.
in the spring of,page stopped selling crack cocaine and began selling heroin.sullivan moved to hickory street.she continued to assist page by selling heroin that he delivered to her at that location.
on july,there was an incident outside a bar.page became enraged and waved a gun.later that evening,page and sullivan returned to hickory street.page was still agitated about the earlier incident,and thus,as he was about to leave the apartment,sullivan suggested that he leave the gun to avoid any trouble.he agreed,and sullivan placed the gun in her bedroom,near the mattress.
early the next morning,law enforcement agents executed a search warrant at sullivan apartment at hickory street.sullivan and her cousin were present.the agents seized heroin,marijuana,and a loaded smith wesson caliber revolver.the gun was found in the bedroom,next to the mattress.some bags of heroin were found in the same bedroom.
page was arrested later that day at a different location.after being read his miranda rights,he admitted that the firearm and heroin belonged to him.dna testing would later show positive results for page dna in the dna mixture found on the firearm.
prior to july,page had been convicted in new jersey of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than a year.
proceedings below 
page was initially charged,by himself,in a indictment with a narcotics violation.on october,the government filed a superseding indictment,against page and sullivan,containing six counts.counts one through five asserted narcotics violations count one named sullivan only,and page was named in all of counts two through five,either alone or with sullivan.count six charged page and only page with possessing a firearm after previously being convicted of a felony,in violation of g.
on january,page moved to sever count six.he argued that any limiting instruction would not eliminate the inherent prejudice that would result from the jury learning of his prior felony conviction.the district court discussed the motion with the parties during a conference on february,but it did not rule.
in the meantime,on february,sullivan pled guilty to selling five grams or more of crack cocaine.
page motion to sever was argued on september,before jury selection was to begin.the government agreed to sever count three which was later dismissed at the government request,but otherwise opposed page motion.on september,the district court denied the motion,holding 
the defendant has agreed to stipulate that he has a prior felony conviction.the jury will be made aware that he has stipulated to having been convicted of a prior felony,but no description of the facts underlying his prior conviction will be provided and no other mention will be made of his criminal record during the trial unless he chooses to testify.together with a limiting instruction to the jury,this arrangement will serve the interest in judicial economy without unduly prejudicing the defendant.
at trial,at the close of the evidence,the jury was read a stipulation that prior to july,anthony page was convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year in new jersey superior court,essex county,new jersey.during the jury charge,while instructing the jury on the first element of the count,the district court gave the following limiting instruction 
t he defendant prior conviction may be considered only for the fact that it exists and not for any other purpose.you are not to consider it for any other purpose.you are not to speculate as to what the conviction was for nor may you consider the prior conviction in deciding whether the government has proven that the defendant actually possessed the firearm as alleged in the indictment.
on september,the jury found page guilty on all four of the remaining counts,including the count.on july,page was sentenced to months imprisonment on each of counts two,four,and five,and months imprisonment on count six,all to run concurrently.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
the sole issue presented on appeal is whether the district court erred in denying page motion to sever count six from the narcotics counts.relying on this circuit decision in united states jones,cir,page argues that the inevitable spillover effect of his prior felony conviction required severance,or at least bifurcation,of the count from the narcotics counts and that the court limiting instruction was insufficient to prevent the prejudicial effect of that knowledge.we reject the argument.
applicable law 
rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides for the joinder of offenses when they are of the same or similar character,or are based on the same act or transaction,or are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.a.joinder is proper where the same evidence may be used to prove each count,united states blakney,cir,or if the counts have a sufficient logical connection,united states ruiz,cir.
even if offenses are properly joined,in certain circumstances severance may be warranted.rule a provides that where joinder of offenses for trial appears to prejudice a defendant or the government,the court may order separate trials of counts,or provide any other relief that justice requires.a.moreover,rule leaves the tailoring of the relief to be granted,if any,to the district court sound discretion.zafiro united states.this is because rules b and are designed to promote economy and efficiency and to avoid a multiplicity of trials,so long as these objectives can be achieved without substantial prejudice to the right of the defendants to a fair trial.id.at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.accordingly,less drastic measures than severance,such as limiting instructions,often will suffice to cure any risk of prejudice and permit joinder.id.at.
a district court denial of a motion to sever is reviewed only for abuse of discretion,and will not be overturned unless the defendant demonstrates that the failure to sever caused him substantial prejudice in the form of a miscarriage of justice.blakney,at internal citations omitted internal quotation marks omitted see also united states amato,cir defendant seeking severance under rule carries a heavy burden of showing that joinder will result in substantial prejudice internal quotation marks omitted.hence,the defendant must show that unfair prejudice resulted from the joinder,not merely that he might have had a better chance for acquittal at a separate trial.united states rucker,f d,cir.in addition,a defendant seeking severance must show that the prejudice to him from joinder is sufficiently severe to outweigh the judicial economy that would be realized by avoiding multiple lengthy trials.united states walker,cir.
finally,we have rejected
