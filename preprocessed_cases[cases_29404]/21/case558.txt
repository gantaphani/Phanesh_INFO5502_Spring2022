at issue is the meaning and application of a sentencing guideline for possessing child pornography,c,which instructed sentencing judges to apply the stiffer penalties for trafficking in child pornography cases i f the offense involved trafficking in material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor including possessing material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor with intent to traffic.c.the issue is one of first impression for this circuit.the defendant,mark david dyer,primarily argues that the sentencing judge erred in determining that the evidence sufficed to establish he had an intent to traffic in child pornography under c of the sentencing guidelines,thus adding a minimum of thirteen additional months to the defendant sentencing guidelines range.despite this,the trial judge exercised his discretion to sentence below the range,and sentenced dyer to sixty months in prison,followed by eight years of supervised release.
dyer pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography,in violation of a a b.the original guideline range for the total offense level under possession was to months the application of the trafficking guideline made it seventy to months.dyer argues on appeal that the district court wrongly interpreted and applied c,the trafficking.
he also argues that the district court relied upon ex parte grand jury testimony to reach its factual conclusions and thereby violated his rights under the confrontation clause.
we disagree with both arguments and affirm his sentence based on the facts of this case.
the basic facts are undisputed.on june,agents of the federal bureau of investigation fbi executed a warrant to search the brunswick,maine residence of mark david dyer.the agents seized a computer hard drive and ten compact disks cds,all of which were later found to contain numerous images of child pornography.
later that day,dyer consented to an interview with special agents james lechner and paul pritchard.dyer told them that he owned the computer and the cds and that no one else had access to them.the cds,dyer conceded,contained images that would likely qualify as child pornography.he admitted that he had downloaded what he estimated to be several thousand nude pictures of girls,had saved these images on his computer,and had burned them onto cds.he obtained these images,he told agents lechner and pritchard,either by temporarily joining websites or through the use of the limewire program.dyer used these methods once or twice a week to obtain new pornographic images of prepubescent girls aged fourteen or younger.when asked about a notebook seized during the search,dyer explained that he had used it to list common keywords like pedo,teen,and that he entered into limewire to find new files.
dyer had used limewire for two years and explained his understanding of the program to agents lechner and pritchard.he knew,he said,that when he downloaded photographs or videos from limewire,the program saved the files in a completed folder on his hard drive.this folder,dyer noted,was automatically treated as a shared folder by the limewire software.dyer knew that anything he downloaded would therefore be available for other limewire users to keyword search and download.he also knew how to stop the material from getting to other limewire users.to prevent this file folder from being shared with other users,dyer added,he would have had to transfer the file to another location on his hard drive.he had not done so.
forensic analysis of dyer computer and cds revealed several hundred images of what appeared to be child pornography.when the national center for missing and exploited children ncmec analyzed the images at the fbi request,it determined that dyer had downloaded photographs and four videos featuring known and actual child victims of sexual exploitation.
the most graphic of these images was a series featuring a single prepubescent girl.the ncmec confirmed,and dyer did not dispute,that the girl featured in these images was an actual child and a known victim of sexual abuse.one of the photographs in the series showed an adult male urinating on the young girl.in another photograph,the girl had been posed on a bed naked,with the words cut me,hurt me,and slut written across her torso.the image also showed someone holding a knife near her vagina.this image was saved under the file name pthc,ultra hard pedo child porn pedofilia new.dyer had stored the entire series featuring the girl in the shared folder on his computer hard drive,making it available to all limewire users.
other files in dyer shared folder had titles such as young girls rub pussies many included the acronym pthc,standing for,in the title.
an august,indictment charged dyer with knowingly possessing child pornography in violation of a b on november,dyer pleaded guilty to this charge in the federal district court of maine.
the court applied the version of the sentencing guidelines in order to avoid ex post facto considerations.the report psr submitted to the district court calculated a total offense level of under the sentencing guidelines.the psr used,which applied to defendants convicted of possession of child pornography and carried a base offense level of,and adjusted the sentence upwards to reflect a number of relevant enhancements 
at the conference,the government argued that the psr should have applied the trafficking in c and should have therefore used the trafficking provision rather than the possession provision to calculate dyer base offense level for sentencing.the sentence enhancement under the trafficking should have been imposed,the government contended,because dyer had manifested an intent to distribute the child pornography on his computer by making it accessible to other limewire users.dyer argued that leaving files on a shared computer folder did not qualify as trafficking and that,in any event,there was insufficient evidence that he had intended to traffic in child pornography 
at the sentencing hearing on march,agent lechner testified and was regarding his interview with dyer.lechner described his role in the search of dyer residence,his subsequent interview with dyer,and the fbi ultimate conclusions regarding the quantity and nature of the images of child pornography discovered on dyer computer and cds.he testified that dyer had said during the interview that he understood that the child pornography downloaded onto his shared drive would be made available to other limewire users.the government also introduced lechner contemporaneous report of the interview into evidence.the report included dyer admission that he knew how to prevent the files from being shared.he had opted not to disable this feature.another exhibit displayed the results of the forensic analysis of dyer computer and a selection of the more graphic images discovered in dyer shared folder.dyer did not introduce any evidence at sentencing.
on the basis of this evidence and a fifth circuit case involving similar facts,united states todd.cir,the district court applied the trafficking in c.however,it did so on the basis of the specific facts of the case and implicitly rejected the government argument that any use of limewire would automatically constitute trafficking due to the program features.trafficking,the sentencing judge noted,included bartering,and dyer had exhibited an intent to traffic by knowingly making images of child pornography available to other limewire users.the sentencing judge emphasized the facts essential to this conclusion dyer had told agent lechner that he knew that any file downloaded from limewire would be available to other users he knew where limewire stored the files he downloaded on his computer,and that they could be accessed and downloaded by other limewire users he knew that he could have moved the file to a different location to prevent other users from accessing it and he had used limewire for two years,during which he downloaded files and had his own files available for download.these acts,the sentencing judge found,demonstrated an intent to traffic within the meaning of c.the sentencing judge also determined that this conclusion was consistent with congress intention to punish those who furthered the market for child pornography more severely,reasoning that was qualitatively different from mere possession of files on an inaccessible computer hard drive location.
in calculating dyer sentence,the sentencing judge emphasized that dyer had pleaded guilty to an exceptionally serious offense that involved the sexual abuse of real children.but the sentencing judge also acknowledged that dyer had received an honorable discharge from the united states navy and was a offender who had shown remorse and a willingness to undergo a sex offender treatment program.dyer total offense level under the guidelines was,which would ordinarily result in a prison sentence of between seventy and months.however,in light of dyer character and circumstances,the sentencing judge imposed a sentence of sixty months in prison,followed by eight years of supervised release.
dyer now appeals this sentence.
interpretation of guidelines terms 
dyer main argument on appeal is that the facts of his case supported only the application of the guidelines pertaining to possession of child pornography,and not trafficking.the district court interpretation of the meaning of an intent to traffic under c and of the are questions of law,which we review de novo.see united states,cir.we review the district judge findings of fact for clear error,and the government must prove facts essential to sentencing enhancements by a preponderance of the evidence.id.at.
the issue before us is not whether mere use of limewire by one who possesses child pornography shows an intent to traffic simply because limewire is a program.the government has withdrawn that argument and the district court did not adopt it.rather,the outcome of this case depends upon the particular facts and not on a per se rule.dyer challenge raises issues of interpretation of both intent and traffic,but ultimately turns on the facts.
the guidelines set forth a distinction between possession of and trafficking in child pornography as those terms are used in and c.dyer suggests a series of limitations on the definition of trafficking,which we reject.to define the kind of acts that constitute trafficking as opposed to mere possession,we employ ordinary rules of statutory construction.see united states,cir looking to the text,guideline commentary,statutory context,and use of similar language in criminal statutes to interpret the meaning of a term in united states deluca,cir holding that the sentencing guidelines should be interpreted according to principles of statutory construction.
the text of the sentencing guidelines separated sentencing for the possession and trafficking of child pornography into two distinct subsections.sentencing judges were to apply to defendants convicted of trafficking in child pornography receiving,transporting,shipping,or advertising such material or possessing such material with an intent to traffic.this guideline carried a base offense level of.by contrast,prescribed a base level of for defendants convicted only of possessing child pornography,subject to the condition we describe next.
the condition is that a in the possession guideline,c,mandated that i f the offense involved trafficking in material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor including receiving,transporting,shipping,advertising,or possessing material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor with intent to traffic,then the sentencing judge was to use,the trafficking guideline,instead.c 
as a result,the plain language of c unambiguously extended the trafficking both to defendants who actually trafficked in child pornography and to defendants who possessed child pornography with the intent of trafficking but had not yet completed the act.in other words,this trafficking,by its terms,could be imposed even absent evidence that others received child pornography from the defendant.
the government needs only to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant possessed the requisite intent to traffic.see,united states jordan,cir.dyer unsuccessfully advances limitations,not in the text,on what intent means and on what traffic means.we,like the second circuit in jordan,reject dyer argument that the in c governed only when the government proved that the defendant actually engaged in trafficking and did not merely intend to do so we also reject dyer argument that the government must show that third parties actually retrieved and downloaded images from defendant computer to show that the defendant had an intent to traffic.
first we address the legal arguments about the meaning of the terms traffic and intent we then turn to whether,in light of those meanings,the facts sufficed to meet those definitions.
meaning of traffic under c 
because the guidelines do not define the term traffic,we interpret this word by looking to its commonly accepted meaning.see deluca,at.to traffic in something commonly means t o trade or deal in goods,esp.illicit drugs or other contraband,black law dictionary ed,or to engage in the activity of exchanging commodities by bartering or buying and selling,webster third new international dictionary.
at oral argument,defendant argued that mere trading or bartering of child pornography is not trafficking.we reject the argument.we also reject the argument that a defendant must expect some financial gain from trafficking.in the context of c,a defendant traffics in child pornography if he engaged or intended to engage in an exchange or trade of such images.no financial gain or expectation of financial gain is necessarily required.see united states todd,cir,vacated on other grounds,d noting that trafficking ordinarily means both buying and selling commodities for money and exchanging commodities by barter united states parmelee,cir observing that trafficking under includes bartering united states johnson,cir same united states horn,cir section and the cross reference in c apply when the offense involved the exchange or barter of child pornography,and not only when this material was offered for sale.these cases confirm that the crucial acts separating mere possession from trafficking involve the intent to share images of child pornography with others,irrespective of financial motive.
this interpretation is also borne out by the legislative history of the protection of children against sexual exploitation act act,which was amended in to include.see child pornography prevention act of,stat,to codified as amended in,and see also united states sromalski,cir finding that and related guidelines should be interpreted in relation to the harms congress identified when passing this act.section includes separate subsections prohibiting the distribution,sale,and possession of child pornography,with a further section prohibiting the distribution of child pornography to minors with the intent of inducing them to participate in illegal activities.see a.for purposes of punishment,b distinguishes between possession and all other offenses,mandating a maximum sentence of years for possession and a sentence between five and twenty years for all other offenses.see id.b.
the rationale underpinning the amendments,congress said,was that the dissemination and production of child pornography differs from possession because active participation in the market for child exploitation encourages further exploitation of children to an even greater degree.see,at.see also united states grosenheider,cir footnote omitted it is clear that congress established a series of distinctly separate offenses respecting child pornography,with higher sentences for offenses involving conduct more likely to be,or more directly,harmful to minors than the mere possession offense.similarly,the guidelines clearly reflect consideration of whether and the degree to which harm to minors is or has been involved.
congress further found that child pornography victimizes children not only at the time of actual abuse but each time the image is accessed and distributed anew,since its continued existence causes the child victims of sexual abuse continuing harm by haunting those children in future years,at.by this metric,trafficking is qualitatively different from mere warrants heavier sanctions.it makes these images available to new viewers and keeps an image of exploitation in circulation,and thus may encourage the growth of a market leading to further exploitation.see new york ferber,d united states hoey,cir.
second,the legislative history unequivocally shows that trafficking in child pornography means bartering these materials even when no financial stake is involved.in,congress expressly found that the child pornography market was dominated by collectors who bartered pornographic images to expand their collections and had little interest in trading for profit.see,at see also united states jesús,cir explaining that congress eliminated the commercial purpose requirement because of the prevalence of child pornography distributors who shared images with each other with no pecuniary motivation.concerned that the act was being,congress amended the statute specifically to ensure that it extended to these collectors.see child protection act of,stat.codified as amended at,see also at,cong.because the harm to the child exists whether or not those who initiate or carry out the schemes are motivated by profit,congress deliberately broadened the scope of the act to better serve its purpose,at,cong,at 
based on this analysis,we conclude that the district court properly interpreted the trafficking under c to include situations in which a defendant intended to exchange child pornography without any commercial purpose.
meaning of intent under c 
before the district court,dyer never used the term specific intent to set forth the legal requirements for applying c,and has waived the argument.as a result,the district court did not directly comment on the meaning of the term intent as used in c.it rather concluded that in light of the specific facts concerning dyer use of limewire,the intent requirement had been met.dyer raises for the first time on appeal the argument that c requires evidence of specific intent,but only in passing and without any legal argument to support this assertion.this argument is twice waived on appeal.we accordingly review it for plain error.we find there was no error of law,and we reject a reading of c that would require specific intent to traffic in child pornography.
this court recently emphasized the challenges in defining the term intent when it is used to denote an element of a crime.see united states tobin,cir few areas of criminal law pose more difficulty than the proper definition of the mens rea required for any particular crime.emphasis original quoting united states bailey,d.in tobin,we interpreted intent as used in a criminal statute prohibiting harassing phone calls by employing principles of statutory construction and looking to plain meaning,statutory structure,and legislative history.when these indicia were inconclusive,we turned to general considerations,namely the principle that for most crimes,intent ordinarily requires only that the defendant reasonably knew the proscribed result would occur general intent,not that the defendant specifically intended such an outcome as his purpose specific intent.id.at citing bailey,at.see also united states pitrone,cir observing and applying the rule that when the text of a criminal statute is indeterminate,courts should look to context,including purpose,legislative history,and background legal principles,to discern the kind of intent congress had in mind.
we then reasoned that this principle that intent ordinarily means general intent would have less force in some situations where the consequences of the action are not necessarily wrong or harmful.thus,when interpreting a d,which prohibits making repeated phone calls to the same number with an intent to harass,tobin held that the government must prove the defendant specifically intended to harass the person at the called number because t here is nothing inherently wicked or even suspect about multiple phone calls absent the wicked intention motivating them.id.
intent has at least two possible ordinary meanings in the criminal context,referring either to the fact that a defendant purposefully and affirmatively desired an unlawful outcome or,alternatively,to a defendant reasonable knowledge that his acts might result in such an outcome.see bailey,at.
the texts of and are not explicit on what kind of scienter requirement the commission intended.while pertains to trafficking and is predominantly concerned with possession,both guidelines penalize conduct that congress has deemed inherently harmful.that the guidelines enhance punishment for both actual trafficking and for intent to traffic suggests the commission intended to enhance penalties for those whose actions support the market for child pornography and for those who should reasonably know that their conduct would do so.there is no indication that the commission intended to depart from the ordinary meaning of the term intent.further,there is every reason to think the commission was,in this understanding of intent,carrying out congressional intent.certainly,the commission chose not to use alternate language which would have required specific intent.
the dissent incorrectly argues that the phrase with intent to is a term of art that mandates the conclusion that c requires proof that a defendant specifically intended to traffic in child pornography.that argument is undercut by bailey,which noted that the word intent is quite ambiguous when interpreting what the court of appeals had meant when using that precise phrase.at.the use of the words intent to traffic does not by itself signify specific intent,as numerous other courts have found in other contexts.for instance,punishes anyone who,inter alia,intentionally traffics or attempts to traffic in goods or services and knowingly uses a counterfeit mark on or in connection with such goods or services.a.other circuits have held that specific intent was not required for culpability,on the grounds that specific intent requirements are not ordinarily prerequisites in criminal offenses and the legislative history did not support such an interpretation.see,united states gantos,cir.likewise,the second circuit has interpreted,which makes it a crime to knowingly and with intent to defraud,utter,pass,or put off,in payment or negotiation,any false,forged,or counterfeited foreign bonds,only as a general intent crime.see united states mucciante,cir 
indeed,treating such language as per se imposing a specific intent requirement runs counter to the careful,weighing of text,structure,legislative history,and general considerations that we have long employed and is contrary to our analysis in tobin.
the legislative history,in turn,supports a reading that intent in the sense of knowledge suffices.congress described the evils of the child pornography market by focusing on the child victims involved,not by distinguishing between the motives of purveyors.trafficking in child pornography has an equally horrific effect upon the children involved irrespective of whether the trafficker actively desires or merely knows that his actions will likely make images of child pornography more available to others.that congress eliminated the requirement that traffickers in child pornography could only be prosecuted if they were acting with a commercial purpose underscores congress understanding that such conduct is culpable regardless of the underlying motive.see,at,cong,at.
we also turn to the general considerations explained in tobin.these considerations strongly confirm that c does not require specific,purposeful intent.we should instead rest upon the default assumption discussed in bailey and elsewhere that an intent to traffic in child pornography,like most other crimes,requires only general intent.unlike the repeated phone calls at issue in tobin,sharing child pornography qualifies as inherently bad conduct.indeed,tobin itself makes this exact distinction.another subsection of the statute at issue in tobin prohibited making phone calls if those calls involved content that could be considered child pornography,with the intent to harass another person.tobin stated that this subsection involve d suspicious or even malign conduct and concluded that unlike the provision at issue,intent in this subsection meant only mere knowledge of consequences.tobin,at 
further,courts are ordinarily concerned with the distinction between specific and general intent when defining elements of a crime in order to put defendants on notice of where the line between culpable and innocent conduct falls.see,carter united states,d.no such concern applies at sentencing.courts routinely interpret the sentencing guidelines by looking at related conduct beyond the specific elements of a criminal offense,because the purpose is to assess the severity of the defendant particular crime in light of the surrounding circumstances.see witte united states,d.in so doing,courts are not punishing a defendant for a distinct offense they are instead evaluating the totality of a defendant conduct in order to arrive at a reasonable sentence.see united states amirault,cir holding that a sentencing court can look to past,uncharged conduct to impose an aggravated sentence for the possession of child pornography because such conduct bears upon the gravity of the possession offense.
we therefore reject the defendant argument that the government must necessarily show the defendant actively and subjectively desired that others would get images of child pornography from him and that ordinary general intent does not suffice.
application of intent to traffic in this case 
we consider the district court application of this guideline to the facts of this case to be a mixed question of law and fact,which we review using a sliding standard of review.we review predominantly legal questions de novo,while we defer to determinations and review them for clear error.see united states sicher,cir.the district court application of c in this case was heavily,and we find that it did not err in concluding that dyer online conduct showed an intent to traffic under c.we would reach this conclusion even if we were to review the district court application of c de novo.
the internet,and its capacity to facilitate online bartering of computer files between collectors and purveyors of child pornography,readily links a single computer user to a possible network of others.see united states lewis,cir.it is clear that for there to be any meaningful distinction between the crimes of possession and the enhancement for intent to traffic,more than mere receipt of child pornography on a computer must be shown for c to apply.sromalski,at.other circuits have held that this applies to defendants who arranged to exchange images of child pornography with others over or by posting these images in an online chatroom.see,united states bender,cir applying to defendant who traded child pornography over email united states johnson,cir,cert denied,d applying c to defendant who conceded that he sen t and received images of child pornography on his computer.
we do not decide whether the use of software such as limewire per se would have qualified as trafficking under c.our holding centers on the facts of this case.as the sentencing judge emphasized,dyer chose to download and frequently use limewire,a type of software that creates a shared system of users,and he did so to acquire images of child pornography for his personal collection he downloaded these files into a shared folder that he knew would be made available to others.he did so for two years and gave no indication to agents lechner and pritchard that he would have stopped had he not been arrested.he knew how to turn off the sharing feature of limewire and prevent other users from accessing these features,but he did not,at any point,make an effort to do so.by his actions,dyer took deliberate steps to become part of a virtual community of consumers of child pornography who shared images to enlarge their own collections.our holding that these acts showed an intent to traffic likewise comports with the holdings of other circuits on similar fact patterns.see united states groenendal,cir holding that the defendant engaged in trafficking under c when he posted images online to child group todd.at finding that b y downloading the images and making them accessible to others,defendant became eligible for sentencing pursuant to c 
to be clear,we do not today reach the abstract issue of whether any limewire user who downloaded child pornography could have been sentenced under c because of limewire inherent features and purposes.dyer,by his own admission,was differently situated from an unwitting limewire user who failed to realize that by downloading files,he was also saving them to a shared,universally accessible folder on his own computer.on the facts of this case,the district court was correct to conclude that dyer conduct warranted the application of c.
finally,dyer asserts that the district court relied upon agent lechner testimony before a grand jury to conclude that dyer knew that he could have made child pornography files unavailable to other limewire users by transferring the files to another location.this,dyer claims,violated his confrontation clause rights because the grand jury testimony was never part of the record and because he had no chance to challenge that testimony during the sentencing hearing.
this argument lacks merit,not least because the confrontation clause does not apply at sentencing.see united states luciano,cir.
further,dyer failed to raise this argument before the district court,and any claim would therefore have to rise to the level of plain error to warrant reversal.see united states antonakopoulos,cir.there is no possibility of plain error in this case.dyer presents no evidence that the district court relied upon lechner grand jury testimony.moreover,dyer counsel effectively agent lechner about dyer understanding of at the sentencing hearing.beyond this,the district court conclusion that dyer knew he could have disabled the sharing feature is supported by a number of documents throughout the record,including the government exhibit a at sentencing.that exhibit,in fact,explicitly summarized agent lechner conclusion from his interview with dyer that dyer knew you would have to physically move the file to another location to make it unavailable for sharing.
the sentence is affirmed.
i dissent from the majority conclusion that appellant mark david dyer dyer was properly sentenced under c for possession of child pornography with intent to traffic.i write separately to state my conclusion that c requires specific intent to traffic in child pornography and to note that the facts of this case fail to establish that dyer exhibited specific intent to traffic in child pornography.i join the majority in rejecting dyer claim that the sentencing court violated his sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses presented against him.
c requires specific intent 
the determination of the sentence that should be applied to dyer conviction for possession of child pornography hinges upon an interpretation of the term intent to traffic within the purview of c.the majority interprets the term intent to traffic to require general intent in the sense of knowledge,and not specific or purposeful intent.i respectfully disagree with this interpretation.
during the sentencing proceedings dyer argued that he had no intention to distribute the images he possessed and that he did not have an actual intention for anybody else to receive those images.the government,on the other hand,contended that dyer possessed the images with intent to traffic.on the basis of dyer arguments and taking into consideration the government position,the district court concluded that dyer actions met the requirements of c on appeal,dyer argues that the government failed to show that he acted with specific intent to traffic in child pornography and the government has not contested dyer assertion that c requires specific intent.
as a threshold matter,the majority claims that dyer has waived the argument that c requires the government to prove that he acted with specific intent to traffic in child pornography.the majority attempt to justify the application of plain error review in this case fails not the least because the record shows that dyer has argued that he lacked actual or specific intent,but because it is clear that the government never argued that c requires general intent to traffic.thus,the government never put the district court in position to decide whether general intent suffices to apply c.the majority therefore errs when it faults dyer for not developing his specific intent argument,even though dyer has argued that he lacked specific intent and the government never claimed that general intent suffices to apply c.i therefore can not partake in the majority assertion that this court interpretation of the mens rea required by c is controlled by plain error analysis.
the distinction between general and specific intent is sometimes difficult and at times elusive.see united states bailey,d acknowledging the difficulty courts face in defining the mens rea required for a particular crime and discussing the different interpretations of general and specific intent.but it is critically important in a case like this where the sentence to be imposed on one convicted of possessing child pornography depends on the state of mind with which he possessed said material 
a specific intent crime is one committed voluntarily and purposely with the specific intent to do something the law forbids.united states blair,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it requires more than a knowing violation of the law.united states kimes,cir.the defendant must act with a bad purpose or with the objective of committing the act prohibited by the law.see blair,at united states kleinbart.in contrast,a general intent crime requires the knowing commission of an unlawful act.kleinbart,at.the defendant must act voluntarily and intentionally,and not because of mistake,inadvertence or accident.blair,at.
the majority provides several arguments to support its conclusion that the term intent to traffic under c requires general intent.the majority claims that the sentencing commission chose not to use language that would require specific intent and that both the legislative history of the panoply of statutes that criminalize distribution and trafficking of child pornography,and the general considerations of criminal intent support the conclusion that c requires general as opposed to specific intent.regrettably,the majority misapprehends the text of the guidelines,ignores their clear mandate,and misapplies the general considerations of criminal law and intent.
first,the plain language of c reveals that the commission required specific intent in order to find that one convicted for possession of child pornography should be sentenced under,which is the trafficking guideline.by employing the term intent to traffic,the sentencing commission chose language that has been interpreted by several of our sister courts to require specific intent.kimes,at explaining that when congress intends to create a specific intent crime it does so explicitly by employing,for example,the term with intent to see also united states welch,cir interpreting the travel act,and holding that by requiring an act with intent to promote or facilitate the promotion of an unlawful activity,the statute required specific intent or proof that the defendant acted with the objective of promoting some unlawful activity.for example,the federal statute that criminalizes the knowing use of unauthorized access devices with intent to defraud,a,has been interpreted to require specific intent to defraud.united states ismoila,cir similarly,in the context,we have consistently held that to prove possession with intent to distribute in violation of,the government must establish that the defendant knowingly and intentionally possessed a controlled substance with specific intent to distribute.united states,cir united states,cir.
additionally,the structure of c and its interaction with bolster the conclusion that the sentencing commission included a specific intent requirement.the commission added to address offenses involving possession of child pornography,as distinguished from trafficking offenses which are covered under.the commission also directed that when the offense involves trafficking in child pornography,including possession of said material with intent to traffic,an enhanced sentence should be imposed under the trafficking provisions of.c.put another way,c allows a sentencing court to apply to a defendant who has been convicted for possession of child pornography when the government establishes by preponderance of the evidence that the defendant intended to traffic in said material.a requirement of specific intent is thus consistent with the commission endeavoring to separate punishment for possession of child pornography from those offenses that involve trafficking in said material.it also guarantees that only those who are more than mere possessors of child pornography are sentenced under and its trafficking provisions.
secondly,i disagree with the majority assertion that a requirement of general intent better comports with the legislative history of the statutes that criminalize trafficking in child pornography.in the majority view,the fact that trafficking in child pornography no longer requires proof that the defendant acted with a commercial purpose reveals that motives are irrelevant and that consequently c should be interpreted to require general intent to traffic.in pursuing this argument,the majority conflates the actions that amount to trafficking in child pornography with the mens rea required by the guidelines.the fact that financial gain or commercial purpose is not necessary to convict an individual for trafficking in child pornography informs our interpretation of the term traffic by clarifying the actions that amount to trafficking in child pornography.however,this legislative history does not end our inquiry regarding the mens rea an individual must exhibit to be deemed to possess child pornography with intent to traffic.we are here concerned with whether the defendant possessed child pornography with intent to traffic,not with whether he was moved by an expectation to recoup a profit.the fact that congress made trafficking in child pornography a crime regardless of whether the defendant was moved by a commercial purpose is not inconsistent with the interpretation that c requires the government to show that the defendant specifically intended to traffic in child pornography.
thirdly,in my view,the majority misapplies the general considerations of criminal law when it relies on this court decision in united states tobin,cir to hold that c requires general intent.tobin,the majority argues,allows this court to rest on the default assumption or general consideration that intent in most crimes means general intent.i disagree.in pursuing this argument,the majority fails to ascertain that although general intent has been held sufficient to meet the mens rea requirement for most crimes,this general principle is ordinarily applied where the criminal statute is silent as to the mens rea required.see,carter united states,d concluding that the presumption in favor of scienter only required proof of general intent in federal bank robbery statute that was silent as to the mens rea requirement bailey,at.inferring a general intent requirement from federal statute criminalizing escape from federal custody in the absence of language or legislative history regarding the mens rea required for conviction.but where,as here,the plain language of the statutory text includes a mens rea requirement,we need not resort to the general considerations invoked by the majority.
although general intent may generally be sufficient in most crimes to support a conviction,bailey,at,we are dealing in this case with a narrow category of crimes that require a heightened level of mental culpability.therefore,the principle that ordinarily general intent suffices for most crimes does not control our inquiry in this case.
finally,the majority errs in its reliance on dicta from tobin to conclude that trafficking in child pornography is inherently bad conduct and therefore knowledge of the consequences of such action satisfies the guidelines mens rea requirement.in tobin,this court held that a statute which criminalized the making of repeated phone calls with intent to harass required specific intent to harass and further intimated that general intent could be required by a different section of said statute that criminalized obscene calls or calls that involved child pornography.at.the tobin court was only concerned with interpreting the statute section that criminalized the making of repeated phone calls with intent to harass.therefore,any expressions related to the making of obscene calls or calls involving child pornography constitute dicta that does not bind the court in the present case.in addition,the court in tobin reached its determination by interpreting the statute as a whole and differentiating between the harms posed by the types of conduct prohibited under it.the court,however,did not rule that when a statute criminalizes actions related to child pornography it should be interpreted to require knowledge as opposed to purpose.tobin is therefore scant authority for the majority interpretation that c only requires general intent.
in interpreting c i am guided by the principle that the statute plain language is the starting point of our interpretation.staples united states,d stating that the language of a criminal statute is the starting point of the court interpretation of a criminal statute carter,at.stating that the canons of statutory interpretation require courts to first examine the statutory text.as has been seen,by employing the words with intent to traffic,the commission chose language that has been interpreted to require specific intent and the structure and purposes of the guidelines support this conclusion.i would therefore hold that in order to sentence one convicted for possession of child pornography pursuant to c,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed child pornography with specific intent to traffic in said material.
ii.the facts are insufficient to conclude dyer exhibited specific intent to traffic 
although the term traffic is not defined in the guidelines,it encompasses both buying and selling commodities for money or exchanging commodities by barter.see united states paul,cir.evidence that a defendant traded pictures online or sent and received images via the internet has been found sufficient to constitute trafficking under c.united states bender,cir convicted defendant admitted that he had traded pictures online,and the evidence showed that he had sent child pornographic images to other users online united states johnson,cir finding that trafficking occurred where defendant admitted he sent and received child pornography over the internet.trafficking has also been found where the defendant not only downloaded child pornography onto his computer,but also uploaded child pornographic images in order to join a pornographic website,united states groenendal,cir,and where defendant admitted he traded pornography over the internet and the evidence showed he sent explicit photographs to another individual and agreed to exchange videos with an undercover agent,united states jordan,cir.
these cases show that in order to find that a defendant trafficked in child pornography,the government must prove that the defendant engaged in affirmative actions to exchange or barter in child pornography.these actions include,for example,receiving and sending child pornography.see united states parmelee,applying c to a defendant convicted for possession of child pornography where the evidence established that defendant stored pornographic images on recordable compact discs which he intended to barter with other people for programs or services.
the facts of this case show that dyer used the application limewire to download child pornography he knew that when files were downloaded from limewire the program automatically saved the files in a shared folder that was potentially available to other users and he failed to remove the files to make them unavailable for sharing.it is thus clear that dyer knowingly downloaded child pornography through limewire and that he understood that limewire automatically saves images in a shared folder.but these actions do not show he purposely sought to trade,exchange,or barter in child pornography or that he specifically intended to engage in the sort of activities that have been held to amount to trafficking in child pornography.
the critical factor to discern whether dyer intended to traffic child pornography via limewire is not whether he had knowledge of how limewire works in terms of,but rather whether by using limewire to download child pornography dyer intended to traffic in said items.we lack proof that dyer used limewire with the objective of offering the images for barter or exchange with others.we similarly lack evidence that dyer sought to engage in an active exchange of images of child pornography with the purpose to receive further images in return.moreover,the evidence actually established that dyer had not traded any images over the internet via,bulletin boards,or newsgroups.
absent proof that dyer allowed limewire to keep images in a shared folder with the purpose of engaging in an exchange of images,i can not partake in the majority conclusion that the sentencing court properly applied c.specific intent in this case is inextricably bound to affirmative actions to traffic in child pornography.in my view,use of limewire with knowledge of its automatic features and dyer failure to disable the sharing feature is insufficient to conclude that dyer exhibited specific intent to traffic absent evidence that he took additional actions to offer the images for exchange with the expectation that he would receive further commodities in return.
i also note my concern with the majority efforts to equate intent to share with intent to traffic.although the majority claims it is not holding that mere use of limewire amounts to trafficking in child pornography,its interpretation that the crucial acts separating possession from trafficking involve intent to share images of child pornography with others,threatens to do just that.while use of a program may provide circumstantial evidence of intent to traffic,a finding that there is specific intent to traffic requires more than knowing use of a program.it requires proof that the defendant intended to engage in an exchange of commodities or goods with the expectation to receive some type of commodity in return.the inference that sharing is tantamount to trafficking lowers the threshold of the actions that have been held to amount to trafficking and leads to the imposition of criminal liability for trafficking where the user has not exchanged commodities by barter.
for these reasons,i respectfully dissent from the determination that dyer was correctly sentenced under c.
iii.confrontation clause 
finally,i join the majority in rejecting dyer claim that the sentencing court relied on agent lechner grand jury testimony,thereby depriving dyer of his right to agent lechner regarding his grand jury testimony.we have to evaluate this claim under the plain error standard of review because dyer failed to raise the confrontation clause issue before the district court.united states,cir.as the majority states,there is no evidence in the record that the sentencing court relied on lechner grand jury testimony without allowing dyer to elucidate this testimony at sentencing.absent an obvious or clear error by the sentencing court,dyer claim that the sentencing court deprived him of his right to confront agent lechner regarding his grand jury testimony must therefore fail.
iv.conclusions 
i dissent from the majority conclusion that the district court properly sentenced dyer pursuant to c.i would hold that c requires specific intent to traffic and that the facts of this case fail to show that dyer exhibited specific intent to traffic in child pornography.i concur in the determination that the district court did not violate dyer sixth amendment right to confront the witnesses presented against him.
the government also charged dyer with transportation of child porn
