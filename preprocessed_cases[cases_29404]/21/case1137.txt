james lyle and michael van praagh appeal from judgments of the united states district court for the southern district of new york crotty,convicting them on charges relating to the distribution of methamphetamine.lyle challenges the admission at trial of evidence seized during a december,inventory search of a rental car and a january,search of his hotel room.he also challenges the admission at trial of certain and proffer statements.van praagh challenges the sufficiency of the evidence of his participation in a methamphetamine distribution conspiracy,the admission of lyle and proffer statements in their joint trial,and the reasonableness of his sentence.because we conclude that the evidence at trial was sufficient to support all convictions,the challenged searches and seizures did not violate the fourth amendment,the admission of lyle statements did not violate the fifth amendment,and van praagh sentence was reasonable,we affirm the judgments of the district court.
background 
i.the facts 
because van praagh and lyle appeal convictions following a jury trial,we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,crediting any inferences that the jury might have drawn in its favor.united states rosemond,cir.quoting united states dhinsa,cir.
throughout,van praagh regularly sold pound quantities of methamphetamine.these deals generally occurred once a week and often took place in manhattan hotels.van praagh also sold smaller quantities of methamphetamine out of his apartment in queens and through deliveries to his customers.brandon hodges,an methamphetamine supplier,sent van praagh methamphetamine on three or four occasions during this time,with the largest shipment containing four ounces of methamphetamine.van praagh regularly sold methamphetamine to lyle,who was also a methamphetamine dealer in the new york area.lyle regularly sold methamphetamine to anthony tarantino.tarantino initially purchased methamphetamine for personal use,but eventually starting selling small quantities of methamphetamine to his own clients.both hodges and tarantino cooperated with the government and testified at trial.
in january,lyle introduced tarantino to van praagh.tarantino accompanied lyle to van praagh apartment so that lyle could restock his methamphetamine supply.while at van praagh apartment,tarantino saw lyle purchase methamphetamine from van praagh,which lyle later sold to tarantino.in april,lyle took tarantino to van praagh apartment a second time,where tarantino again observed lyle,purchase methamphetamine,from van praagh.after this second visit,tarantino and van praagh became romantically involved,and eventually tarantino moved in with van praagh and began helping him sell methamphetamine.
b.the seizure of methamphetamine from van praagh hotel room 
on may,van praagh and tarantino checked into the out hotel in midtown manhattan.that night,they sold pound quantities of methamphetamine to several customers,including lyle.the next day,they checked out of the hotel but accidentally left approximately a pound of methamphetamine and cash in the hotel room safe.hotel staff found the drugs and money and called the new york city police department nypd,and officers arrived to seize the drugs and cash.after van praagh realized his mistake later that day,he returned to the hotel,where he was arrested by the nypd.during the arrest,the officers seized a cellular phone and over cash from van praagh pocket.the officers also searched van praagh vespa scooter parked outside the hotel,where they found part of and packaging for a digital scale.
soon thereafter,tarantino brought lyle money to give to van praagh father to bail van praagh out of jail.the day after van praagh got out of jail,he and tarantino flew to arizona to ensure that van praagh methamphetamine suppliers would continue to sell to him.van praagh and tarantino returned to new york and continued their sale of methamphetamine.
lyle arrests 
on december,nypd officers observed lyle park and exit a car in midtown manhattan.the officers noticed a knife clipped to lyle pants,which they later determined to be an illegal gravity knife.the officers approached lyle as he was closing the trunk of the car.lyle told the officers that he was legally permitted to carry a gravity knife because he was a member of the stagehands union and used the knife to perform his job.lyle initially said he had not driven the car but when the officers informed him that they had seen him driving it,lyle admitted as much.when asked for identification,lyle produced a new york state id with the expiration date scratched off.the officers confirmed that lyle driver license was suspended.the officers also determined that the vehicle lyle was driving was a rental car and that lyle was not an authorized driver under the rental agreement.lyle claimed that his girlfriend had rented the car and had given him permission to drive it.the officers arrested lyle for driving with a suspended license and for possessing an illegal knife.
before heading to the station for processing,lyle asked if the car could be left at the location and stated that his girlfriend would pick it up.the officers denied the request and impounded the vehicle.at the police precinct,an inventory search was conducted.over one pound of methamphetamine and approximately cash were found in the trunk of the car.
the following day december,lyle was brought to the district attorney office where he made certain statements in custody after being read his miranda rights.when asked about the methamphetamine that was in the trunk of the rental car,lyle stated that an individual had contacted him and asked him to hold something for him.tr.he stated that upon meeting with that individual and another individual,he stayed in the car and did not see what was placed in the trunk but presumed it to be drugs because the individual that he was meeting with was known to distribute large quantities of methamphetamine in the new york area.when asked about his relationship with these two individuals,lyle stated that he was friends with them,and had eventually begun working with one of them in delivering methamphetamine to the individual customers.
lyle stated that the person in charge had a source of supply in arizona named either brendan or brandon.lyle also provided a few names of other people in the new york area who distributed large quantities of methamphetamine.tr.
on january,police in east windsor,new jersey responded to an anonymous call that people were using methamphetamine in a hotel room.when they got to the hotel room,lyle opened the door and invited the officers inside.the officers heard the toilet flush and saw lyle girlfriend come out of the bathroom.the officers observed a torch lighter on the bathroom shelf,a small clear bag next to the trash can,and a partial clear straw wrapper containing white residue on the bathroom floor.additionally,they observed a towel under the bathroom doorway.in the bedroom,the officers noticed that a clear bag had been affixed to the smoke detector with rubber bands.
officers then performed a consent search of the room,and found approximately fourteen grams of methamphetamine,cash,a digital scale,and numerous plastic baggies.lyle and his girlfriend were both arrested.
ii.the proceedings below 
a.the indictment and van praagh arrest 
van praagh,lyle,and tarantino were indicted on march.on march,drug enforcement administration dea agents arrested van praagh at his apartment.after receiving consent to search the apartment,agents found tools used to sell drugs,including a,packaging materials,and multiple scales,and a note from hodges asking van praagh to have lyle call him.
on april,van praagh called his father from jail and told him,in a recorded call,they got nothing i sterilized the house like i told you.supp.app.he also told him,t hey got anthony tarantino,but i expecting that he be disappearing any day now i believe that he had been talking.supp.app.
lyle proffer session 
on april,lyle participated in a proffer session with the government in hope of reaching a cooperation agreement.a proffer agreement was executed,stipulating that the government would not use any of lyle statements made during the proffer sessions against him,except to rebut any evidence or arguments offered by or on behalf of lyle.lyle app.
during the proffer session,lyle admitted that around or,he sometimes stayed with van praagh while working on projects in new york city he observed van praagh smoking and using methamphetamine he occasionally delivered packages to van praagh clients he accompanied van praagh to deliver methamphetamine thirty to fifty times van praagh told lyle his supplier was in arizona and on one occasion,lyle accompanied van praagh to pick up methamphetamine from a library in new york city.
c.the superseding indictment and pretrial motions 
a superseding indictment was filed september,charging van praagh and lyle with conspiring to distribute grams or more of methamphetamine,in violation of and b a,from december to january van praagh with distributing and possessing with intent to distribute grams or more of methamphetamine,in violation of a and b b,on or about may,and lyle with distributing and possessing with intent to distribute grams or more of methamphetamine,in violation of a and b b,on or about december.
before trial,lyle moved to suppress the physical evidence recovered from the search of the automobile,as well as his subsequent statements.in an affidavit filed in support of the motion,lyle admitted that just prior to his arrest,he had been driving the car that had been rented by his girlfriend with her permission he possessed a gravity knife that day he initially told the police officers he had not been driving the car but later admitted to driving the car and his license was suspended at the time.
on september,the district court held an evidentiary hearing on the voluntariness of lyle statements and,on october,the court denied lyle motion to suppress.the court found there was probable cause for lyle arrest,based on his possession of a gravity knife.the court then concluded that the search of the rental car was justified on two independent bases.first,lyle had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental car because he was not an authorized driver under the rental agreement.second,the search of the rental car was a valid inventory search.the court also found that lyle statements were made voluntarily and pursuant to a valid miranda waiver.
d.the trial 
lyle and van praagh trial began on october,and ended on october.the government called nineteen witnesses,and introduced physical evidence consisting of drugs and drug processing materials,text messages between the defendants,testimony regarding lyle and proffer statements,and the recorded call van praagh made to his father while incarcerated.van praagh called one witness who testified about the circumstances of van praagh march,arrest.lyle did not put on a case.
during his opening statement,lyle counsel stated that lyle obtained,bought,borrowed,was given methamphetamine for his own use.where we dispute is the idea that he was a dealer.tr.later that day,the government submitted a letter brief,asserting that lyle counsel argument that lyle was not a dealer opened the door to lyle proffer statements about distributing drugs with van praagh.
lyle statements to law enforcement were admitted in two contexts.first,the district court allowed testimony regarding lyle december,statements to law enforcement to be admitted only as against him,prohibiting mention of van praagh.van praagh did not object to the redacted testimony.government witnesses testified that lyle admitted that an individual for whom he worked as a runner asked him to hold something for him in the trunk of the rental car,which lyle presumed to be drugs because lyle knew t hat individual along with another individual distributed large quantities of crystal meth in the new york area.tr.lyle was friends m ore so with the individual that had not placed the drugs in the trunk.he said that he began as friends,and eventually he began working with that individual the individual who was in charge assisting him in delivering methamphetamine to that individual customers.tr.lyle told law enforcement that the individuals for whom he was working as a runner had a source of supply in arizona named either brendan or brandon.lyle also gave law enforcement a few names of other people in the new york area who distributed methamphetamine,including the names of three competitor drug dealers.tr.on,lyle attorney elicited testimony that,during the interview,lyle gave names of people during the conversation,one of which was brandon or brendan.tr.
second,toward the close of the government case,the district court ruled over lyle objection that lyle proffer statements were admissible,but again prohibited mention of van praagh.van praagh did not object.the government witness then testified that lyle admitted he had first become involved in methamphetamine in through someone he knew from work.tr.lyle observed that person using and distributing crystal methamphetamine.tr.lyle began distributing small packages for that person and accompanying that person on deals as well as picking up crystal methamphetamine.id.lyle admitted that he accompanied this person on between to occasions.and that at one point they had gone to a library in the new york city area to pick up crystal methamphetamine.id.lyle said the methamphetamine supplier was in arizona.
on,lyle attorney elicited from the witness that lyle actually g a ve real names of people during his proffer session,and provided some names of people whose last names he did know.tr.these names included zaron,ted,bob,and joe.tr.at.
at the close of trial,the district court instructed the jury,in pertinent part there has been evidence that lyle made statements to law enforcement authorities i want to let you know that lyle statement about his own conduct may not be considered or discussed by you with regard to van praagh.tr.
on october,the jury found the defendants guilty on all counts.on march,the district court sentenced lyle principally to the statutory mandatory minimum of months imprisonment and,on april,the district court sentenced van praagh principally to months imprisonment.in imposing a higher sentence on van praagh,the district court concluded that van praagh had a higher role,more important role.he dealt in more drugs than did lyle.van praagh app.
these appeals followed.
discussion 
six issues are presented whether lyle had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental car the interpretation of lyle proffer agreement the sufficiency of the redactions to lyle proffer statements the admissibility of lyle new jersey arrest the sufficiency of the conspiracy evidence against van praagh and the reasonableness of van praagh sentence.we address each issue in turn.
reasonable expectation of privacy in rental car 
we review a district court ruling on a suppression motion for clear error as to factual findings,giving special deference to findings that are based on determinations of witness credibility,and de novo as to questions of law.united states hussain,cir.quoting united states lucky,cir.we conclude that lyle motion was properly denied.because we find that lyle had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental car,we do not need to address the legality of the inventory search.
applicable law 
the fourth amendment guarantees citizens the right to be secure in their effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures.const.amend.iv.to prove that a search violated the fourth amendment,an accused must show that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in a searched place or item.united states rahme,cir.citing rawlings kentucky.the person challenging the search must demonstrate a subjective expectation of privacy in the place searched,and that expectation must be objectively reasonable.united states paulino,cir.
we have not addressed the question of whether an unauthorized driver of a rental car has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the car.this question has divided the various circuit courts,resulting in at least three responses.
the majority of circuits that have considered this question have concluded that an unauthorized driver of a rental car lacks a legitimate expectation of privacy in the car absent extraordinary circumstances.see united states kennedy,cir.a s a general rule,the driver of a rental car who has been l ent the car by the renter,but who is not listed on the rental agreement as an authorized driver,lacks a legitimate expectation of privacy in the car unless there exist extraordinary circumstances suggesting an expectation of privacy.united states seeley,cir.per curiam finding no plain error in district court holding that defendant lacked standing to challenge the search of the rental car,as he the sole occupant of the car was not the renter or an authorized driver citing united states boruff,cir.united states wellons,cir.a ppellant,as an unauthorized driver of the rented car,had no legitimate privacy interest in the car and,therefore,the search of which he complains can not have violated his fourth amendment rights.united states obregon,cir.holding that district court was not clearly erroneous in finding that defendant did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the rental car he was driving,where defendant name was not on car rental contract.
the sixth circuit has taken a slightly different more approach.it has acknowledged that as a general rule,an unauthorized driver of a rental vehicle does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in the vehicle,and therefore does not have standing to contest the legality of a search of the vehicle,but it has refused to adopt a bright line test based solely on whether the driver of a rental vehicle is listed on the rental agreement as an authorized driver.united states smith,cir.rather,the sixth circuit considers whether the unauthorized driver had a legitimate expectation of privacy which was reasonable in light of all the surrounding circumstances.id.at.in smith,the court concluded that the unauthorized driver of a rental car had a legitimate expectation of privacy in a rented vehicle because he was married to authorized driver,had the renter permission to use the car,was himself a licensed driver,was able to present the rental agreement and provided the officer with sufficient information regarding the vehicle,and had himself paid for the rental car.id.
finally,the eighth and ninth circuits have held that an unauthorized driver has a reasonable expectation of privacy in a rental car if the authorized driver gave him or her permission to use the car.united states thomas,cir.w e can not base constitutional standing entirely on a rental agreement to which the unauthorized driver was not a party and may not capture the nature of the unauthorized driver use of the car.rather,an unauthorized driver who received permission to use a rental car and has joint authority over the car may challenge the search to the same extent as the authorized renter.internal citation omitted united states best,cir.if authorized driver had granted unauthorized driver permission to use the rented automobile,unauthorized driver would have a privacy interest giving rise to standing.
application 
we do not need to reach the question of whether an unauthorized driver of a rental car ever has a reasonable expectation of privacy in the car,because lyle was not just an unauthorized driver,but an unlicensed one.accordingly,lyle use of the rental car was both unauthorized and unlawful.see vehicle traffic law prohibiting operating a car without a valid license.lyle should not have been driving any car because his license was suspended,and a rental company with knowledge of the relevant facts certainly would not have given him permission to drive its car nor allowed a renter to do so.under these circumstances,lyle did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental car.see united states haywood,cir.declining to resolve circuit split over whether unauthorized driver had reasonable expectation of privacy in rental car,because unauthorized driver also had suspended license and the combination resulted in no reasonable expectation of privacy united states tropiano,cir.w e think it obvious that a defendant who knowingly possesses a stolen car has no legitimate expectation of privacy in the car.united states ponce,cir.to mount a challenge to a search of a vehicle,defendants must show,among other things,a legitimate basis for being in it,such as permission from the owner.
our decision in united states smith,cir,is instructive.there,we held that smith had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the trunk of a rental car,despite the fact that he was in the driver seat of the car when he was stopped by law enforcement.id.at.like lyle,smith had no driver license and the car was registered in another name.id.at.also like lyle,smith made no showing that he had any legitimate basis for being in the car at all.id.
lyle reliance on the sixth circuit decision in smith,at,is misplaced.smith presented unique facts.specifically,smith was not only the husband of the renter,but he also had a business relationship with the rental company because he had called the rental company to reserve the rental vehicle,was given a reservation number,and provided the company with his credit card number,and that credit card was subsequently billed for the rental of the vehicle.id.in light of these facts,the sixth circuit determined that smith was the de facto renter of the vehicle and that,therefore,he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the rental car.id.at.lyle was not the de facto renter of the car at issue here.moreover,the sixth circuit also noted that smith was a licensed driver.id.at smith was a licensed driver therefore,it was not illegal for smith to drive the vehicle.for these reasons,smith is distinguishable.
accordingly,lyle lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in the rental car,and the district court did not err in denying his motion to suppress.
ii.the proffer agreement waiver 
we review the district court interpretation of the scope of a proffer agreement waiver de novo and its evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.rosemond,at.
applicable law 
ordinarily,a statement made during plea discussions with an attorney for the prosecuting authority that does not result in a guilty plea is not admissible against the defendant who made the statement.fed.evid.a.the protections provided by rule,however,can be waived,including in a proffer agreement with the government,provided that such waiver is knowing and voluntary.rosemond,at united states velez,cir.
to determine whether a proffer agreement waiver provision applies,we ask first whether the defendant has offered any evidence or made a factual assertion that would trigger the rule waiver,and,if so,whether the proffer statement fairly rebut s the fact asserted or evidence offered or elicited.rosemond,at.if the waiver has been triggered and the proffer statement properly rebuts the assertion triggering the waiver,the government may offer the proffer statement.id.
in rosemond,we gave examples of factual assertions that will trigger the proffer waiver,including asserting,in an opening statement,that someone other than the defendant was the real perpetrator of the crime,id.at citing united states barrow,cir,and arguing that a shooting was an intended kidnapping gone wrong,when the defendant admitted in a proffer session that the shooting was an intentional murder,id.at quoting united states gomez,supp.
application 
the district court properly held that the waiver was triggered by lyle counsel statement during opening argument that we dispute the idea that lyle was a dealer.tr.lyle proffer agreement contained a waiver that allowed his statements to come in to rebut any evidence or arguments offered by or on behalf of lyle.lyle app.
as this court has recognized,a defense argument does not trigger a waiver if it simply challenge s the sufficiency of government proof on the elements.barrow,at.but a statement of fact in a defense opening,such as a statement unequivocally identifying someone other than defendant as the real perpetrator of the charged crimes,is a factual assertion that would trigger a waiver provision.id.here,defense counsel did not ascribe the charged crime to someone else,but he did more than challenge the sufficiency of the government proof.rather than argue that the government would not adduce credible evidence that lyle was a drug dealer,counsel disputed the very idea that lyle was a dealer.this is the functional equivalent of an affirmative statement that lyle,in fact,did not deal methamphetamine.this assertion was belied by lyle proffer admissions and,thus,triggered the waiver provision in the proffer agreement.
lyle proffer statements fairly rebut his counsel opening argument that lyle was not a dealer.the proffer statements at issue included that lyle repeatedly distributed small packages of methamphetamine lyle accompanied another person to obtain and deliver methamphetamine and lyle knew the location of the methamphetamine supplier.taken together,these statements imply participation in a drug distribution operation and thus fairly rebut lyle counsel argument in his opening statement that lyle was a mere user of methamphetamine and not a dealer.see barrow,at emphasizing that proper rebuttal is not limited to direct contradiction but encompasses any evidence that the trial judge concludes fairly counters and casts doubt on the truthfulness of factual assertions advanced,whether directly or implicitly,by an adversary.
hence,we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting lyle proffer statements.
iii.the admission of lyle redacted statements 
applicable law 
in bruton united states,the supreme court held that admission of a confession naming the defendant as a perpetrator at their joint trial violates the latter sixth amendment right to.the court later made clear that a redaction of a confession to eliminate any references to the defendant will eliminate any bruton problem.see gray maryland,richardson marsh.
we have consistently held that the introduction of a confession with the defendant name replaced by a neutral noun or pronoun does not violate bruton.see,united states jass,cir.noting that operative questions when evaluating bruton claim are did the redacted statement give any indication to the jury that the original statement contained actual names,and did the statement standing alone otherwise connect to the crimes internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.in united states tutino,cir,for example,we affirmed a conviction based in part on a statement that was redacted to reference others,other people,and another person.id.at.
to determine whether a redaction is sufficient under bruton,we view the redacted statement separate and apart from any other evidence admitted at trial.id.citing united states wilkinson,cir.see also united states williams,cir.t he appropriate analysis to be used when applying the bruton rule requires that we view the redacted confession in isolation from the other evidence introduced at trial.if the confession,when so viewed,does not incriminate the defendant,then it may be admitted with a proper limiting instruction even though other evidence in the case indicates that the neutral pronoun is in fact a reference to the defendant.
application 
van praagh contends that his constitutional rights were violated by the admission of lyle redacted proffer and statements.we ordinarily review evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion however,van praagh did not object to the introduction of the redacted statements at trial,and so we review the admission of this evidence for plain error.see united states pierce,cir,cert.denied,
the redacted statements did not violate bruton.the neutral terms individual and person,which were substituted for proper names with the exception of that of a supplier brendan or brandon,tr,were not so obvious as to indicate to the jury that the original statements contained actual names.this was an ongoing criminal enterprise where many people were involved and the government introduced evidence of methamphetamine dealing by several people.thus,the substitutions alone did not necessarily identify van praagh.further,lyle redacted statements sounded sufficiently natural.for instance,he admitted that he had first become involved in methamphetamine through someone he knew from work,tr,and that the individual for whom he worked as a runner asked him to hold something for him in the trunk of the rental car.tr.because such statements might actually have been said by a person admitting his own culpability in the charged conspiracy while shielding the specific identity of his confederate,they do not violate bruton.jass,at.nor did the redacted statements,viewed in isolation,contain any information indicating that van praagh was the individual in question,let alone information that would immediately inculpate him.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
van praagh relies on united states taylor,cir,to support his contention that the redactions violated bruton,but taylor is distinguishable.taylor involved a single robbery of a drug store by four people.id.at.one of the four,luana miller,became a cooperating witness,and another,curtis taylor,gave confessions.id.at the trial of taylor and the two other,the trial court admitted taylor confessions but required their redaction to omit identifications of his two.in the portions of the confessions that were admitted,miller name was mentioned but the names of the two were replaced with two other individuals,the person,and the driver.id.at.we determined that in this circumstance the redactions were so obvious as to violate bruton.our reasoning was as follows.first,miller name was used throughout and,i f taylor had been trying to avoid naming his confederates,he would not have identified one of them miller in the very phrase in which the names of the other confederates are omitted.id.second,the wording of the redacted statements,t he robbery was the idea of the person who waited with luana miller and taylor at the gas station,was stilted and unnatural.id.third,in this context,the reference to two other individuals was suspiciously closer to the speech of a prosecutor than that of a perpetrator.id.on the basis of these factors,we determined that it was obvious that names had been omitted from the statements and,therefore,the choice of implied identity was narrow.the unnamed persons correspond ed by number two and by role to the pair of and t he jury could immediately infer,on the evidence of the redacted confession alone,that taylor had likely named the.id.
this case is unlike taylor.first,lyle statements referred to multiple people not only one unnamed person to correspond to the one,van praagh.this did not present the necessary problem that left the jury choice of implied identity narrow as in taylor.id.second,in addition to van praagh methamphetamine dealing,the government introduced evidence of methamphetamine dealing by its two cooperating witnesses tarantino and hodges as well as several others.because lyle statements did not reference by name those cooperating witnesses,the jury could reasonably have inferred that they were the other persons lyle was referring to in his redacted statements.third,lyle statements referred to people involved in a conspiracy to engage in ongoing criminal conduct,not a single criminal act like in taylor.for all of these reasons,taylor is inapposite.
we also note that the district court here gave a limiting instruction.see taylor,at it matters that the district court gave limiting instructions because w e normally assume that jurors follow limiting instructions.the district court specifically instructed the jury that lyle statement about his own conduct may not be considered or discussed by you with regard to van praagh.tr.
finally,van praagh constitutional rights were not violated by lyle counsel eliciting testimony on that his client statements had been redacted for presentation at trial and that his client had indeed provided actual names in his proffer and statements.again,because van praagh did not object during lyle attorney,we review for plain error.in urging error,van praagh relies on gray maryland,holding that considered as a class,redactions that notify the jury that a name has been deleted violated the confrontation clause.but gray focus was on the inadequacy of the g
