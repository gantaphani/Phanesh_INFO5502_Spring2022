alan simmons appeals from a judgment convicting him on his pleas of guilty to knowingly transporting a minor in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual conduct count one,and to using a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing a videotape of the conduct count two,in violation of a and a,respectively.simmons was sentenced principally to consecutive prison terms totaling months,to be followed by three years of supervised release.he makes two arguments on appeal that the district court erred in upwardly departing to criminal history category iv based on simmons record of convictions in canada and that the district court erred by imposing,as a condition of supervised release,a prohibition on the possession or viewing of any pornographic material.
finding no merit in either of simmons arguments on appeal,we affirm.
a.the offenses 
in december of,simmons,who was then years old,took a ski trip from his home in ontario,canada to jay peak in vermont.he brought along his two sons,who were and years old,and,whom simmons had coached in a girls hockey league and whose mother simmons had dated.following an afternoon of skiing,the four ate dinner and retired to a hotel room to watch videos.simmons prepared soft drinks for the children,who did not wake up until approximately noon the next day.this was unusual for,who was an early riser.although she noticed that she was tired,she did not suspect anything out of the ordinary.
four years later,while executing a search warrant at simmons home in connection with an alcohol and tobacco smuggling case,canadian authorities seized a videotape of simmons sexually abusing an apparently unconscious adolescent female.the tape begins with the female lying prone on a bed,her sweatshirt pulled up to expose her breasts.then simmons is seen pulling down the girl sweatpants and manipulating her left leg several times to expose her genital area to the camera.the camera focuses in on the victim genital area,which simmons can be seen touching with his fingers,his lips and his penis.the videotape concludes with simmons masturbating and ejaculating onto the victim pubic hair.throughout the videotape,the victim appears to be unconscious.
subsequent investigation revealed that the videotape was made in the vermont hotel room in,and that the victim was another videotape seized by the canadian authorities from simmons home showed him engaging in various sexual acts with seemingly unconscious adult females.several women who dated simmons reported that they suffered blackouts after consuming drinks he prepared,and woke up hours later in sexually compromising positions.
on december,a federal grand jury in vermont returned an indictment charging simmons with transporting a minor in foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity,in violation of,and with sexual exploitation of a child,in violation of a.simmons pled guilty to both counts on september,and he was sentenced on march.
b.the sentencing 
the criminal history calculation and upward departure 
the presentence report psr placed simmons in criminal history category i despite his many prior convictions because they were all obtained in canadian courts.see h.according to the psr,simmons criminal history consisted of the following convictions and sentences 
in its presentencing memorandum,the government sought an upward departure to criminal history category v,asserting that category to be the one simmons would have been in had his convictions occurred in the united states.simmons countered that there was no justification for an upward departure,and even if there were,a correct tally of points based on the foreign convictions would place simmons in criminal history category iii.
at the sentencing hearing on march,the district court first observed as follows as i understand it from the circuit what i have to do is go through each category and consider whether that category adequately reflects the seriousness of the defendant record.tr.at.it further observed that the convictions of the defendant in canada are very similar to convictions here in this country.id.the appropriate criminal history category for sentencing,the court concluded,should be the category that would apply if the foreign convictions had occurred in the united states.
addressing each of simmons convictions separately,the district court chose not to consider the first three,which occurred in and,because they were too old and would not be counted even if they had occurred in the united states.see e.the court accorded one criminal history point to the april conviction for possessing an unregistered restricted weapon.it declined to consider the conviction for breach of recognizance.because there was no background information available for that charge,simmons was given the benefit of the doubt as to its underlying facts.tr.at.
the june convictions for assault and extortion,for which simmons received concurrent sentences,were counted by the district court despite the absence of explanatory information about them in the psr.reasoning that these seem to be offenses for which it not difficult to figure out what happened id.at,the court accorded a total of three criminal history points to them.
the court added one point for the conviction for uttering threats and two points for the may conviction for unlawful possession of imported goods.as for the conviction for possession of child pornography,no points were allocated because it was based on the same videotape on which simmons abuse of was recorded.the court did count,however,the convictions for sexual assault and possession of a prohibited weapon,according a total of two points to them in calculating the departure.
because the total points allocated to the canadian convictions was nine,the district court departed upward under to the corresponding category,criminal history category iv.it summarized its methodology as follows the case law says i supposed to pause at each category to consider which category reflects the seriousness of his record.but it seems to me what i done is gone through and pointed out the various offenses which would and do reflect the seriousness of the defendant record tr.at.
with a total offense level of and an upward departure to criminal history category iv,the applicable sentencing range was months.as stated above,simmons was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment totaling months.
the special condition prohibiting the possession or viewing of pornography 
the district court imposed a term of supervised release to follow the prison term,with the following special condition the defendant shall not possess or view any pornographic material,including videotapes,films,magazines,books and photographs,nor shall he subscribe to movie channels,sheet release.
discussion 
a.the upward departure 
section of the united states sentencing guidelines is a sentencing judge starting point for calculating the criminal history category of a defendant.the section prescribes,inter alia,the allocation of criminal history points to each prior sentence,with the number of points per sentence depending on the length of the prison term,if any,imposed as part of the sentence.a,b,c.the total number of criminal history points places the defendant in one of the six criminal history categories that comprise the horizontal axis of the guidelines sentencing table,ch,pt.
not all of a defendant prior sentences,however,constitute a prior sentence under the guidelines.for purposes of tallying criminal history points,sentences resulting from military offenses,tribal court convictions and foreign sentences are not counted.the exclusion of such sentences creates the obvious risk that a defendant criminal history category will fail to reflect the seriousness of his or her criminal history.thus,the guideline provision excluding foreign sentences explicitly adds that such sentences may be considered as a ground for departure under.h.section authorizes a departure upward or downward i f reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes the section specifically identifies prior sentences not used in calculating the defendant criminal history category,including foreign sentences,as the type of information on which a departure might be based.
simmons contends that the district court erred by upwardly departing to criminal history category iv.specifically,he contends that it was an error to consider the convictions for assault and extortion in calculating the degree of the upward departure because there was no information available about either offense.according to simmons,the district court violated the admonition in the commentary to that criminal history departures are authorized only in the limited circumstances where reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant criminal history,commentary at emphasis added.we disagree.
an appeals court reviews de novo whether a particular factor is a permissible basis for a departure.united states karro,cir citing koon united states,d.the inadequacy of a defendant criminal history category is not merely a permissible basis for an upward departure,it is what koon described as an encouraged basis for such a departure.see at.
at least until recently,it was the law in this circuit that the decision to depart as distinct from whether the ground cited is a permissible one was reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states carpenter,cir.congress recently changed that in the prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today act of protect act,d,stat,codified at e b iii,which mandates de novo review of whether a departure is justified by the facts of the case.the protect act is silent on its applicability to appeals that were pending when it was enacted.however,we need not address that issue here,as we would affirm the departure in this case even under the more stringent standard.
a sentencing court considering an upward departure under is not required by our cases to pause at each category above the applicable one to consider whether the higher category adequately reflects the seriousness of the defendant record.while such an obligation was suggested by united states tropiano,cir see also united states khalil,cir stating in dicta that tropiano required such a sequential method,we have made it clear on other occasions that,as long as the reasons for such a departure are fully explained,a mechanistic,procedure is not required.united states kassar,cir,abrogated on other grounds by spencer kemna,d see also united states franklyn,cir.indeed,this case illustrates the inappropriateness of requiring the analysis.the explanation for the departure was that the seriousness of simmons past criminal conduct was best measured by calculating criminal history points for his canada convictions as though they were united states convictions.this was an entirely sensible explanation.indeed,though simmons contends there was insufficient information to consider two of the convictions,he does not challenge the district court methodology for an upward departure based on foreign convictions.that methodology hinged on the total number of criminal history points attributed to the canada convictions,and it resulted in a departure to criminal history category iv.in light of the court explanation,it would be senseless formalism to pause at criminal history categories ii and iii to consider whether they would have adequately reflected the seriousness of simmons criminal past.thus,while it remains true that a sentencing court can meet its obligation to explain an upward departure by proceeding sequentially from the applicable category through each higher category until it settles on the one that fits the defendant,such a inquiry is not required in every case.
the requirement in,which is reiterated in its accompanying commentary,that a departure be based on reliable information was not disregarded in this case when the district court considered the convictions and sentences for assault and extortion.it is true that the background information for those convictions was unavailable due to the passage of time.on the other hand,the nature of those offenses is not obscure.as the district court stated,these seem to be offenses for which it not difficult to figure out what happened.tr.at.indeed,where it was difficult to figure out the nature of a prior conviction,as was true with respect to the breach of recognizance conviction,simmons was given the benefit of the doubt,and the sentence was not counted.moreover,the foreign convictions at issue here occurred in canada,and were considered by a district court sitting in vermont.the court expressly stated that canada convictions are very similar to convictions here in this country tr.at,and simmons does not suggest otherwise.simmons argument,if accepted,would result in a per se rule that foreign convictions could never form the basis for a departure if only the name of the offense of conviction and the length of sentence imposed were available.we decline to adopt such a rule.we acknowledge that some foreign convictions,particularly those occurring in nations with less familiar criminal justice systems than the one at issue here,may require further inquiry and development before they may properly support an upward departure.but we find no error in the failure to do so here.
finally,we take comfort in the knowledge that if simmons convictions for assault and extortion were something other than what they seem,something other than an assault and an extortion,he was in the best position to know it.implicit in his argument on appeal is that the label ascribed to the conduct may have led the sentencing court to an erroneous belief that simmons engaged in violent conduct.appellant br.at.we see no reason in this case why,if that were true,simmons counsel could not have pointed that out to the district court.
b.the special condition 
simmons contends that the imposition of the special condition prohibiting his possession or viewing of pornographic material was an abuse of discretion for two reasons.first,he asserts that the prohibition does not provide adequate notice of what is prohibited.second,simmons asserts that the condition is neither reasonably related to a legitimate sentencing purpose nor sufficiently tailored to serve only such a legitimate purpose.we follow our recent decision in united states cabot,cir,and conclude,accordingly,that it was not error to impose this condition.we also use this case as an opportunity to further explain our reasoning in cabot.
simmons did not object at sentencing to the imposition of the special condition of supervised release.generally,such a failure to object results in the application of plain error review,which precludes us from correcting an error unless it affects a defendant substantial rights.united states keigue,cir quoting.b united states zillgitt,cir reviewing sentencing error first raised on appeal for plain error united states miller,at same.however,in united states sofsky,we stated that in the sentencing context there are circumstances that permit us to relax the otherwise rigorous standards of plain error review to correct sentencing errors,cir,cert.denied,d.in sofsky,the challenged condition of supervised release was not recommended in the psr,and the defendant had no prior knowledge that it would be imposed.id.both because the alleged error relate d only to sentencing and because sofsky lacked prior notice,we found a departure from the strict application of plain error review warranted.id.at united states gordon,cir holding that sofsky did not apply because the government had notice in the presentence report of the court decision to group the defendant tax evasion and mail fraud counts under c.both justifications are present in this case.simmons challenge is limited to sentencing and he had no prior notice of the special condition that was imposed accordingly,while plain error review is required in this case,the circumstances permit us to entertain t his challenge without insisting on strict
