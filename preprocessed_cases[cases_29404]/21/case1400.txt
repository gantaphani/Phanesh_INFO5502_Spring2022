sanjay kumar and stephen richards appeal from separate judgments of conviction by the district court leo glasser,judge,pursuant to their guilty pleas to several counts of conspiracy,securities and wire fraud,obstruction of justice,and perjury.after accepting their pleas,the district court calculated defendants guidelines ranges for their fraud and obstruction offenses pursuant to the sentencing guidelines manual guidelines in effect at the time of their sentencings,and sentenced kumar and richards to sentences of imprisonment of months and months,respectively,and ordered restitution payments of million and million,respectively.
on appeal,richards challenges his conviction for obstruction of justice,arguing that the indictment failed to properly charge him with that offense.in addition,richards attacks his guilty plea to all counts as constitutionally infirm because it resulted from undue coercion by the government.both defendants argue that,by calculating their guidelines range according to the guidelines in effect at sentencing,instead of at the time the fraud offenses were committed,the district court sentenced them in violation of the ex post facto clause.they also claim that the district court improperly denied them acceptance of responsibility credit,and that its orders of restitution were based on erroneous loss calculations.
we find no infirmity in richards conviction,in the district court application of the version of the guidelines in the district court loss determination,or in the denial of kumar request for acceptance of responsibility credit at sentencing.we conclude,however,that the district court erroneously denied richards a reduction on the basis of his acceptance of responsibility and remand for resentencing on that basis.
background 
the following facts are material to this appeal.
kumar joined computer associates ca,a publicly traded corporation,in august and was elevated to ceo in august of and to chairman of the board of directors in.richards joined ca in and became head of north american sales in.during the tenure of both defendants,ca engaged in a fraudulent accounting practice known as the month,whereby ca backdated contracts executed in the first few days of a financial quarter to recognize that revenue in the prior quarter.the purpose of the month practice,which began in the under kumar predecessor,was to deceive investors into believing that the company had met or exceeded its quarterly earnings estimates.
in february,the united states attorney office usao and securities and exchange commission sec began a joint investigation into the month practice as contravening both accounting principles and federal securities law.as part of its investigation,government investigators sought witness statements from ca personnel.on june,the usao and sec requested that ca conduct its own internal investigation into the practice and give the usao and sec direct access to company employees.ca outside counsel advised ca to comply fully with the investigation.
on august,the sec subpoenaed the testimony of ten individuals associated with ca,including kumar and richards.the sec interviews were held at the usao office in central islip,new york.on september,prosecutors and sec staff told richards counsel that richards was a target of their criminal investigation,and the sec reiterated its demand that richards comply with the subpoena for his testimony.in early october,ca told richards that he would be terminated if he did comply with the subpoena.on october,ca outside counsel interviewed richards,and the following day,richards testified before the sec.richards falsely denied knowledge of the month practice during both meetings and in his testimony.
on september,ca entered into a deferred prosecution agreement with the usao and a civil settlement with the sec.the following day,an indictment charging richards and kumar was unsealed.a superceding indictment was filed on may.by this indictment,richards was charged with both conspiracy to commit,and substantive counts of,securities and wire fraud,as well as filing false public statements with the sec and perjury.richards was also charged under c with obstruction of justice arising out of his false exculpatory statements to ca counsel and the sec.
the superceding indictment charged kumar with both conspiracy to commit,and substantive counts of,securities and wire fraud,as well as filing false public statements with the sec and making false statements to the fbi.kumar was also charged with obstruction of justice.however,kumar obstruction charge also brought pursuant to c arose out of different conduct from that of richards.specifically,the government alleged that kumar,in an effort to cover up the existence of the month practice,lied to ca outside counsel,instructed ca general counsel to coach ca employees to lie,authorized ca general counsel to pay a million bribe to an individual to procure his silence,and lied to fbi agents and others during his interview at the usao office.
both richards and kumar made various motions to dismiss the charges against them.relevant to this appeal,first they unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the obstruction charges,arguing that their oral statements to government investigators were beyond the reach of c,which they claimed was confined to documentary evidence.
next,richards moved to suppress his false statements to ca outside counsel and the sec,claiming that they were coerced in violation of the fifth amendment.without addressing the merits,the district court denied the motion on the basis that richards had not shown good cause for failing to timely file the motion to suppress pursuant to the deadline.
in april,both defendants pled guilty to all charges and the probation department prepared a presentence report psr for each defendant.both psrs calculated defendants guidelines ranges based on the instructions provided in the sentencing guidelines,notwithstanding the fact that the month basis for the securities fraud in.richards psr arrived at an offense level of and a guidelines range of life imprisonment,and kumar psr recommended an offense level of and a guidelines range of life imprisonment.both psrs calculated losses to the public resulting from the month practice to exceed million.
in august,the defendants submitted objections to the guidelines calculations in the psr.the defendants argued that application of the sentencing guidelines effective november to the securities fraud offenses instead of the sentencing guidelines effective november would violate the ex post facto clause because the guidelines contained several significant enhancements for securities fraud that were not in effect when the fraud offenses were committed the defendants further objected to the million victim loss calculation as overinflated 
in november,the district court sentenced both defendants under the guidelines.at sentencing,the district court rejected both defendants objections to their psrs,finding that because the guidelines were advisory,the ex post facto clause was not implicated by sentencing decisions,and the million figure was not erroneous,as it was based on the persuasive testimony of the government expert witness.the district court also rejected an application by both defendants for a reduction to the guidelines base offense level for acceptance of responsibility.the district court found that kumar had not sufficiently accepted responsibility for his crimes to warrant the departure and that richards acceptance of responsibility was un timely because he pled guilty just two weeks before the trial was to begin.see richards sentencing tr,see also richards sentencing tr.noting that,in light of richards sentence,rejection of the reduction ma de very little difference insofar as what his sentence was going to be 
the district court then decided to impose sentences for both defendants,sentencing downwardly from the guidelines calculation of life imprisonment.the court found that t o impose th e sentence s recommended by the guidelines in this case would shock the conscience of this court and the conscience of the reasonable person.kumar sentencing tr,see also richards sentencing tr.accordingly,the court sentenced kumar and richards to imprisonment terms of twelve years and seven years,respectively.

discussion 
was richards properly convicted of obstruction of justice 
richards claims that he was erroneously convicted of obstruction of justice because c the statute under which he was charged,only covers the destruction of physical evidence,and not the charged conduct of providing false oral responses under oral questioning from ca outside counsel and the sec.richards br.the government argues that richards challenge is barred by his guilty plea,and that,in any event,c covers all obstructive conduct,not just destruction of physical evidence.while the government may be correct that c applies to testimonial evidence,we need not reach this issue of first impression in this circuit,because we find that any defect asserted is and was waived by the guilty plea.
a plea of guilty waive s any and all defects in the indictment.united states moloney,cir.to challenge the court jurisdiction,the defendant who has pleaded guilty must establish that the face of the indictment discloses that the count or counts to which he pleaded guilty failed to charge a federal offense.hayle united states,cir.thus,to attack a conviction,a defendant must establish that the district court lacked the power to entertain the prosecution.id.at see united states cotton,defining jurisdiction as the courts statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case.
richards claims that he has met this burden by showing that c does not proscribe false testimony,thereby establishing that he did not violate a federal statute.however,regardless of whether richards false testimony violated c,it plainly violated a,and the indictment charges at least that offense.because the indictment created federal jurisdiction under a,richards claim has no jurisdictional significance and thus is waived by his guilty plea.
section a provides,in relevant part,that w hoever corruptly influences,obstructs,or impedes,or endeavors to influence,obstruct,or impede,the due administration of justice is guilty of a criminal violation.a.in united states aguilar,the supreme court interpreted this subsection as a catchall intended to prohibit all obstructive behavior.see id.referring to subdivision four of a as far more general in scope than the remainder of the subsection.courts in this circuit have likewise given omnibus clause a generally reading.see,united states rosner,noting that the omnibus clause embraces the widest variety of conduct that impedes the judicial process see also united states solow,characterizing the omnibus provision as.other circuits readings of omnibus clause have been as broad as,or even broader than,the reading in this circuit 
however,a only prohibits false testimony that has a direct nexus to an official government proceeding.aguilar,at.in endorsing a nexus test,the supreme court stated that 
t he action taken by the accused must be with an intent to influence judicial or grand jury proceedings it is not enough that there be an intent to influence some ancillary proceeding,such as an investigation independent of the court or grand jury authority t he act must have a relationship in time,causation,or logic with the judicial proceedings.in other words,the endeavor must have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice i f the defendant lacks knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding,he lacks the requisite intent to obstruct.
id.at internal citations and quotation marks omitted.the nexus limitation is best understood as an articulation of the proof of wrongful intent that will satisfy the mens rea requirement of corruptly obstructing or endeavoring to obstruct.united states quattrone,cir.thus,statements made to investigating agents who might or might not testify before a grand jury are insufficient to violate a,because false testimony given in anticipation of a purely hypothetical judicial proceeding is not covered by a.see united states bruno,cir see also united states schwarz,cir.nevertheless,a defendant does not need to know with certainty that his conduct would affect judicial proceedings,nor does his conduct need to actually obstruct justice.instead,the defendant conduct must only have the natural and probable effect of interfering with the due administration of justice.aguilar,at internal quotation marks omitted.section a applies where a defendant inten ds to obstruct justice but is foiled in some way.id.at.
here,richards conduct easily falls within the ambit of a.richards lied to the sec in an attempt to impede the sec ongoing investigation,which richards knew was not simply an agency fishing expedition or an ancillary proceeding that might or might not result in criminal proceedings.id.at.richards concedes that he knew that criminal proceedings were not merely possible when he made his false statements,but that the government predicted that criminal charges would be brought against him prior to his sec interview.see richards br.see also letter from stephen richards to the court,dated,richards letter,at richards testified at the usao under the belief that admitting knowledge of the day month would incriminate him in securities fraud.richards thus plainly entertained expectations during his interview at the usao that his false statements to the sec would impede impending criminal proceedings brought against him.schwarz,at see united states cueto,cir finding nexus to exist where defendant conduct,which d the empaneling of the grand jury,corruptly endeavored to obstruct the due administration of justice i t is clear that if the representations made by richards had been believed,the grand jury would have been thrown completely off the trail that it was pursuing with respect to richards.united states jespersen,cir.therefore,there was a sufficiently close relationship in time,causation,and logic between richards conduct and likely judicial proceedings to satisfy a nexus requirement.united states reich,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
in addition,the indictment fully apprised richards of the elements of his offense under a.specifically,the indictment stated that 
richards well knew and believed that certain of the statements he made during the interviews were false and that he otherwise concealed during the interviews information which he knew to be material to the government investigations.richards further well knew,and in fact intended,that his false statements and concealment of material information would have the effect of obstructing and impeding the government investigations.
as the government correctly notes,t he citation of a statutory section number is not a part of the offense,and an allegedly erroneous statutory citation is not a jurisdictional defect.gov t br.see.c unless the defendant was misled and thereby prejudiced,neither an error in a citation nor a citation omission is a ground to reverse a conviction.the failure of the indictment to specify a,as opposed to c,is therefore not grounds for vacating richards guilty plea 
richards remaining arguments,the government also correctly notes,are mere corollaries of his claim that he pleaded to a.gov t br.for example,richards argues that his guilty plea should be vacated because he was misinformed of the elements of his crime,since,according to richards,c does not reach testimonial evidence.richards br.citing bousley united states.but richards argument rests on the flawed premise that the indictment charged him with a nonoffense.that is not the case here at most,the charge should have been brought under a instead of c,and the indictment fully stated the elements of an offense under that section.vacating richards plea is therefore unnecessary,as richards does not stand convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal.bousley,u.at internal quotation marks omitted.in any event,because there was no jurisdictional defect in richards obstruction charge,his guilty plea waived any ancillary claims based on that charge.
ii.does richards guilty plea bar his coercion claim 
next,richards argues that the government violated the fifth amendment prohibition on testimony by placing improper pressure on ca to cooperate in the government investigation that resulted in ca insistence that richards either testify before the sec or be terminated.the district court rejected richards motion to suppress his testimony,which was admittedly false and became the basis for the obstruction of justice charge to which richards pled guilty,as untimely in light of the district court schedule for motions.on appeal,richards argues that his guilty plea should not bar his coercion claim because review of his claim is necessary to preserve the integrity of the judicial process.richards br.richards coercion claim is easily resolved because the fifth amendment does not protect false testimony.
as previously noted,a plea of guilty waive s any and all defects in the indictment.moloney,at.however,this court may overturn a guilty plea on involuntariness grounds when the defendant shows that his plea was substantially motivated by a coerced confession.united states ex rel.ross mcmann,cir en banc,vacated on other grounds sub nom.mcmann richardson.in addition,a guilty plea that is otherwise voluntary and intelligent may be overturned if it contains constitutional violations that are logically inconsistent with the valid establishment of factual guilt.menna new york,per curiam.
richards coercion claim is not viable,because it is based on a fatally flawed premise that false or not made under coercive protected by the fifth amendment.to the contrary,the supreme court has repeatedly held that the fifth amendment does not confer a privilege to lie.brogan united states.p roper invocation of the fifth amendment privilege against compulsory allows a witness to remain silent,but not to swear falsely united states apfelbaum,see also united states wong,bryson united states.richards coercion claim is based entirely on perjured testimony,and thus,is unsupportable.see,scher ass of sec.dealers,d,finding plaintiff could not state a claim for supposed deprivation of her constitutional rights where she had perjured herself before the national association of securities dealers see also united states nanni,cir negative inferences may not be drawn from immunized exculpatory testimony except to the extent that the testimony amounts to perjury.
richards is attempting to turn the dilemma faced by individuals who are improperly coerced into incriminating themselves or who risk a negative inference from their silence,into a trilemma whereby an individual feels he must either testify truthfully,risk the inference,or lie under oath.see brogan,at.the supreme court rejected this trilemma,which is wholly of the guilty suspect own making,as insufficient to implicate the fifth amendment protection.id.the government may have been provided the leverage to secure richards guilty plea by richards lies,see richards reply br,but richards attempt to draw a sort of constitutional equivalency between a coerced confession and a coerced lie,see richards reply br.quoting higazy templeton,cir,is exactly the type of compassion inflation that the supreme court has declared outside the purview of the fifth amendment,brogan,at.thus,it was not ironic that the government used richards false statements in its obstruction charge against him,see richards reply br,but simply a predictable consequence of his mendacity.
richards argues that the rule denying constitutional protection to coerced false testimony does not apply to this case because the government acted covert ly in securing his testimony,by compell ing him to speak without disclosing its role in his dilemma to speak or be fired.richards letter at.but even assuming that the government engaged in such covert acts by not revealing its role in ca investigation,see curious claim given that richards was interviewed at the united states attorney office,and now concedes on appeal that he knew at his interview that he was a target of a securities fraud cites no case law supporting his argument,nor can he because,as he concedes,even o utside the immunity context,courts often have repeated that the fifth amendment grants no right to lie,id.at.
while circumstances may provide a duress defense due to improper government pressure,see,united states knox,nothing about the circumstances under which richards was interviewed rendered his false statements immune or otherwise afforded him fifth amendment protection,see united states jacobs,cir a constitutional claim may not be asserted as a defense to a perjury charge.thus,richards indictment was neither jurisdictionally deficient nor motivated by a coerced confession,mcmann,at,and his coercion claim is therefore barred by his guilty plea,see hayle united states,cir.
iii.do the defendants sentences violate the ex post facto clause 
next,kumar and richards contend that application of the guidelines to their fraud offenses,which were completed in,violated the ex post facto clause.see const.art.i,cl.see also art.i,cl.prohibiting states from passing any ex post facto law.we believe this claim is without merit.
a sentencing court must generally apply the version of the guidelines that is in effect at the time of sentencing,unless there is an ex post facto problem with such application.united states rodriguez,cir internal citation omitted see also a the court shall use the guidelines manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced.for a law to contravene the ex post facto clause,two critical elements must be present first,the law must be retrospective,that is,it must apply to events occurring before its enactment and second,it must disadvantage the offender affected by it.miller florida,internal quotation marks omitted see united states kilkenny,cir t he ex post facto clause enshrines in the constitution a basic presumption of our law,that is,legislation in the criminal law is not to be applied retroactively.internal quotation marks omitted.
the defendants contend that application of the guidelines to their fraud offenses was both disadvantage ous and retrospective.miller,at.they argue that their fraud offenses were completed in october,when the new business model brought an end to the month practice,kumar br,and therefore,that application of the guidelines to their securities fraud offenses,which substantially increased their sentences,violated the ex post facto clause.the government responds by citing the rule,in effect prior to the time of the defendants commission of fraud,which provides that i f the defendant is convicted of two offenses,the first committed before,and the second after,a revised edition of the guidelines manual became effective,the revised edition of the guidelines manual is to be applied to both offenses.see b.
here,there is no question that application of the guidelines disadvantaged the defendants by subjecting them to the higher ranges of the guidelines compared to the version of the guidelines in effect when the month practice was discontinued in october both kumar and richards were convicted of fraud and obstruction.in accordance with c,these crimes were grouped together for sentencing under the higher of the two applicable offense levels,which groups the separate offenses of fraud and obstruction into a single group because one of the counts,here,obstruction,embodies conduct that is treated as a n adjustment to the guideline applicable to the other count,here,fraud.see.the effect of the aforementioned revisions to the guidelines,see supra,resulted in a enhancement for both kumar and richards,from offense levels of,calling for a range of to months imprisonment,to offense levels of,calling for life imprisonment the differences between the application of the and the version of the guidelines is decidedly detrimental to the defendants.thus,our only inquiry is whether application of the guidelines to the defendants sentences was retrospective within the meaning of the ex post facto clause.see miller,at 
we previously reserved ruling on this question.see united states santopietro,cir,abrogated on other grounds,sabri united states.in santopietro,we noted that t he commission has issued a policy statement specifying that where some offenses occur before and some occur after a revised guidelines version,the later version is to be applied to all offenses.id.at accord b.however,the commission policy statement does not mark the end of the inquiry,because an agency interpretation of its own regulations is only given controlling weight where its interpretation does not violate the constitution or a federal statute.stinson united states,internal quotation marks omitted accord united states stephens,cir.thus,we must independently consider whether the rule violates the ex post facto clause.
a majority of circuit courts has held that the rule does not contravene the ex post facto clause,at least as applied to a series of similar offenses.santopietro,at.in united states vivit,the seventh circuit held that the enactment of the grouping rules under provides fair notice such that the application of b and does not violate the ex post facto clause,cir.according to the seventh circuit,the combination of the grouping rules and the rule puts a defendant on notice that the version of the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time he committed the last of a series of grouped offenses will apply to the entire group.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the fourth,fifth,eighth,tenth,and eleventh circuits agree.see united states bailey,cir t he one book rule,together with the guidelines grouping rules and relevant conduct,provide that related offenses committed in a series will be sentenced together under the manual in effect at the end of the series.footnotes omitted see also united states sullivan,cir united states lewis,cir united states kimler,cir united states cooper,cir,vacated,reinstated,cir per curiam,cert.denied,
the third and ninth circuits,however,have rejected the commission position as incompatible with the ex post facto clause.in united states ortland,the defendant was charged with five identical counts of mail fraud,cir.the offenses charged in four of the counts occurred prior to november,when the relevant guidelines section for calculating loss in a fraud case was amended,and the fifth count covered conduct that took place in december,after the amendment.id.at.the district court,finding no ex post facto problem,applied the amended guidelines section to all five counts resulting in an enhanced sentence for the first four counts.id.
the ninth circuit viewed each count as a completed offense,and concluded that a pplication of the commission policy statement in this case would violate the constitution its application would cause ortland sentence on earlier,completed counts to be increased by a later guideline.id.at.the ortland court further questioned the logic behind the rule,opining that 
t he harm caused by the earlier offenses can be counted in sentencing the later one.that does not mean that the punishment for the earlier offenses themselves can be increased,simply because the punishment for the later one can be.in fact,were the later count to fall at some time after sentencing,all that would remain would be the earlier sentences,which would be too long.there are,in fact,five separate crimes each carries its own punishment,even if the sentences are all run concurrently to the extent that they overlap.
id.emphasis in original internal citation omitted.the ortland court effectively found that application of the rule under the circumstances would be akin to the tail wagging the dog.see,united states bertoli,n cir concluding that,while the rule certainly can compel application of the earlier manual,the ex post facto clause may apply so as to prohibit the application of the later manual to all counts see also santopietro,at discussing the related problem,left by ortland and bertoli,of whether the grouping rules of the earlier or later versions are to be applied,after each version has been used to determine the adjusted base offense level for each count.
in santopietro we declined to reach this issue,in part because of the circuit conflict,and in part because it was possible that the defendant sentence in that case would not be affected by the difference in the two guidelines versions.id.at in this case,we must face the issue because the defendants guidelines calculations under the later version had an unequivocally negative impact on their recommended sentences.in addition,in the decade since santopietro was decided,courts within this circuit have repeatedly wrestled with,and are divided on,the issue.compare united states weisberg,wl,at june,finding no ex post facto problem where defendant was on notice that any tax offense committed after november would face the more stringent tax table,with united states johnson,wl,at june,concluding that the most appropriate way to handle multiple counts in light of the e x p ost f acto clause is to apply the earlier sentencing manual to those counts as to which the underlying conduct was completed before the later version became effective and apply the current version to counts involving subsequent conduct.thus,this case presents the appropriate opportunity to provide definitive instructions on how to handle such a situation.johnson,wl,at.
we conclude that the rule set forth in b does not violate the ex post facto clause when applied to the sentencing of offenses committed both before and after the publication of a revised version of the guidelines.c entral to the ex post facto prohibition is a concern for the lack of fair notice and governmental restraint when the legislature increases punishment beyond what was prescribed when the crime was consummated.miller,at quoting weaver graham.the existence of an ex post facto violation turns on whether an individual was deprived of fair notice,not on an individual right to less punishment.weaver,at.the framers intent in requiring such notice was to assure that legislative acts give fair warning of their effect and permit individuals to rely on their meaning until explicitly changed.id.at.
applying these principles to b,we hold that the adoption of the rule prior to the commission of the defendants obstruction offense had placed them on notice of the consequences of committing that second offense.that the consequences of the second offense included the application of the guidelines to all offenses considered at the defendants sentencing was fully apparent prior to the commission of the crimes that triggered those consequences.when the defendants committed their obstruction offenses,it was not the amendments to the sentencing guidelines that disadvantaged the defendants,it was their election to continue their criminal activity.cooper,at accord vivit,at.
our affirmance of the defendants sentences on this ground offends neither of the fundamental and governmental by the ex post facto clause.as to notice,we observe that prior to the commission of their obstruction offenses the defendants could have altered their conduct so as to avoid any heightened punishment imposed on the basis of the rule by choosing not to obstruct the government investigation of their prior fraud.as to governmental restraint,our holding continues to prevent the sentencing commission and congress from imposing a heightened punishment following the commission of the criminal conduct triggering that punishment.as the guidelines themselves recognize,application of the rule does not,and indeed may not,entail the application of a sentencing range devised after the commission of all of the offenses subject to sentencing.see cmt.background e ven in a complex case involving multiple counts that occurred under several different versions of the guidelines manual,it will not be necessary to compare more than two manuals to determine the applicable guideline manual in effect at the time the last offense of conviction was completed and the manual in effect at the time of sentencing.emphasis added 
the rule,when it leads to a higher sentencing range than would be applied to a single offense,operates in a manner similar to that of the recidivist statutes and three strikes laws upheld by the supreme court and our sister circuits in the past.the supreme court in gryger burke,rejected the defendant argument that the consideration of his past offenses in determining his sentence for a later offense was foreclosed by the ex post facto clause.id.at.w e do not think the fact that one of the convictions that entered into the calculations by which petitioner became a fourth offender occurred before the act was passed,makes the act invalidly retroactive.the ninth circuit has on several occasions upheld such laws.united states,cir per curiam upholding a repeat offender statute see also united states kaluna,cir en banc the supreme court and this court uniformly have held that recidivist statutes do not violate the ex post facto clause if they are on the books at the time the present offense was committed.alteration in original quoting.the fifth,seventh,eighth,and eleventh circuits have come to this same conclusion.see united states,cir united states rasco,cir united states washington,cir the law was enacted before washington committed the bank robberies,so he had fair warning of the consequences attached to new violent offenses.united states farmer,cir.
the fact that the impetus for enacting the recidivist statutes was to reflect the greater culpability associated with the latter offenses,whereas the impetus for the enactment of the rule is to avoid piecemeal sentencing,cmt.background,is of no relevance for purposes of determining the retroactivity of the legal consequences of a defendant actions.it might also be argued that the recidivist statutes impose punishment upon only a single crime,the prior offenses having already been committed and for which the defendant had been sentenced.of the seven cases cited above,however,six place no reliance on that potential distinction.only the eighth circuit,in farmer,implies that the sentencing of only the last crime that triggered the consequences of the recidivist statute was a factor supporting the constitutionality of the three strikes law.f d at s o long as the actual crime for which a defendant is being sentenced occurred after the effective date of the new statute,there is no ex post facto violation.quoting united states allen,cir internal quotation marks omitted.despite this statement in farmer,the distinction between the recidivist statutes and the rule makes neither a practical nor a logical difference for purposes of an analysis under the ex post facto clause.in both cases,prior conduct becomes the basis for imposing a heightened sentence only upon conviction for a later criminal act here,the defendants obstruction offense is the actual crime triggering the application of the rule,the defendants had prior notice of the consequences of that crime,and therefore the application of the rule is proper 
kumar offers a hypothetical situation that,he claims,demonstrates the incorrectness of our ruling.kumar br.in his hypothetical,he posits two defendants,a and b,and that the fraud penalties are increased,as here,between and in the event of a conviction for both fraud and obstruction of justice.defendant a is convicted of committing fraud in and is found at a fatico hearing to warrant a sentencing enhancement on the basis of obstruction of justice perpetrated in,although he is not tried or convicted of that crime.defendant b is convicted of both fraud committed in and of obstructing justice in.kumar notes that in such a situation,as a result of the rule,b offense level for the fraud would be higher than a even though their conduct was the same.kumar br.the error in kumar reasoning,of course,is that the hypothetical defendants face different consequences as a result of substantially different circumstances.defendant a could have received a higher sentence for the fraud if the prosecutor had obtained a conviction for both offenses because defendant a would have been on notice of the legal consequences of a conviction for the obstruction,which would have triggered the rule and,thus,would have included a higher sentence for fraud than would have been the case without the obstruction conviction.in this hypothetical,however,only defendant b conduct resulted in a conviction for obstruction.because the prosecutor in defendant a case did not obtain a conviction for the obstruction,the sentence for the fraud is necessarily lower.the difference is not the result of an inequity in the guidelines it is the result of a successful prosecution of defendant b for obstruction,which triggered the operation of the rule of which defendant b had notice,and which was absent in the case of defendant kumar hypothetical has no ex post facto implications.
in substance,the defendants propose a rule requiring notice before the first offense of the sentencing consequences flowing from subsequent offenses.the emptiness of the notice demanded by the defendants position is obvious.notice of the consequences of a subsequent offense,an offense presumably not even contemplated at the time the first offense is committed,would have no bearing on the commission of the first offense.the rule only becomes relevant to a defendant at the time of the commission of a subsequent offense,when it puts the defendant on notice that when he commits that subsequent offense the sentence for his first offense will be higher than it would have been otherwise.
in rejecting the holdings of the third and ninth circuits,we recognize the that applying the rule to offenses that straddle a guidelines revision could result in a defendant being sentenced for offenses according to the revised guidelines only to see the second offense,which enabled the application of the rule,fall out after sentencing.see ortland,at.the hypothetical posed in ortland is,of course,irrelevant on the facts of this case.kumar and richards were sentenced based on two proper convictions,and the application of the rule to their sentencings does not offend the constitution ex post facto clause.
iv.was the loss calculation clearly erroneous 
next,the defendants argue that the district court determination that their fraudulent conduct resulted in financial losses greater than million was clearly erroneous and,as a result,improperly enhanced their guidelines level by thirty points.the government responds that there was ample support for the district court calculation based on the testimony of the government expert at the fatico hearing.we agree with the government and affirm the district court loss calculation.
a sentencing court is not required to compute the loss resulting from a fraud offense with precision.united states jacobs,cir.instead,t he court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss,cmt.moreover,because the district court occupies a unique position to assess the evidence and estimate the loss based upon that evidence,the court loss determination is entitled to appropriate deference.see united states bennett,cir united states germosen,cir united states.rostoff,cir calculating the amount of loss for purposes of the sentencing guidelines is more an art than a science.courts can,and frequently do,deal with rough estimates.while l osses from causes other than the fraud must be excluded from the loss calculation,united states ebbers,cir,courts frequently calculate loss in securities fraud cases by relying on the change of market capitalization as a result of the disclosure of the fraud,gov t br,in order to prevent perpetrators of the fraud from get ting a windfall,ebbers,at.
the loss calculation in this case was sharply disputed.the most significant area of disagreement centered on how to properly frame the economic impact of the month practice.the government expert,mukesh bajaj,framed the loss resulting from the month practice as an earnings miss,which caused an estimated decline in ca stock price that translated into a loss of million for one quarter of fiscal year alone.conversely,the defendants expert,professor daniel fischel,denied that the month practice caused an earnings miss,whereby the earnings ca reported were completely fabricate d,but instead testified that the practice only caused an earnings shift,whereby earnings that were properly attributable to a future quarter were reported in the previous quarter.kumar br.internal quotation marks omitted.fischel did not submit his own loss calculation,but focused only on refuting bajaj analysis 
the district court held a fatico hearing in order to untangle this web.during the hearing,the district court questioned both bajaj and fischel on their respective analyses.specifically,the district court challenged bajaj analysis as based on only one quarter losses,which fischel argued resulted in an artificially inflated loss calculation.in turn,the district court questioned fischel analysis insofar as seeming to imply that the fraudulent conduct caused no economic loss whatsoever.fischel conceded,however,that,even if bajaj earnings miss nomenclature was inaccurate,there was still an investor loss to be ascertained based not only on the market impact of the month practice on earnings,but also on the real effect on cash flows resulting from th e disclosure of the practice,which led to a drop in confidence in ca management and market speculation about the extent of the fraudulent activity.see fatico hr g tr.
ultimately,the district court accepted bajaj calculation.the court found that a lthough the precise dollar amount of the loss is difficult if not impossible to fix,the testimony of bajaj was convincing that the loss was in the hundreds of millions of dollars.kumar sentencing tr.in rejecting fischel analysis,the court noted that fischel was unable to explain why ca executives would engage in the month practice if it did not,in fact,positively affect ca stock price.see kumar sentencing tr.characterizing fischel testimony during the fatico hearing as not enlightening.consequently,the defendants guidelines calculation was enhanced thirty levels under the guidelines for the financial loss.
on appeal,kumar and richards claim that the district court reliance on bajaj earnings miss analysis was clearly erroneous,because fischel showed that the month practice did not result in earnings misses but instead in earnings shifts whereby any earnings lost in one quarter were made up in the subsequent one.as an initial matter,the record reveals that fischel objection to the term earnings miss was partly semantic.as the defendants now concede,bajaj did not analyze the month practice as resulting in an earnings miss,but instead his analysis simply removed the earnings associated with each contract from the quarter in which it had been improperly booked and it in the proper quarter.kumar br.however,despite this concession,the defendants argue that bajaj calculation was nevertheless erroneous because he only calculated the miss part of the shift,and did not take into account that,had ca reported its earnings correctly,it would have reported higher earnings in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year than the earnings it actually reported.kumar br.emphasis in original,internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the defendants argue that bajaj calculation should have accounted for these higher earnings,which would have the earnings miss in the prior quarters.
we are not persuaded.taken to its logical conclusion,the defendants argument would also compel the conclusion that ca investors did not suffer any loss due to the month practice,since under fischel hypothesis,the false gains and the false losses should have effectively canceled each other out.fischel himself undermined this conclusion during the fatico hearing when he conceded that the month practice obviously had a real negative monetary effect on ca investors,not only by affecting ca cash flow,but by injecting speculation into the market and harming investor confidence in ca management.fatico hr g tr.accepting fischel testimony would cast doubt on the entire basis for the generally accepted accounting principles rule that earnings earned in one quarter must be reported in the same quarter if merely shifting earnings between quarters had no negative effect on investors,there would be no need for the rule in the first place.as bajaj noted in his report,m any firms that missed earnings in a given quarter could also have avoided announcing the miss if they could borrow sufficient earnings from the next quarter to cover their shortfall.supplemental report of mukesh bajaj,at.thus,the government properly characterizes fischel analysis as stretch ing credulity.gov t br.
in addition,during the fatico hearing,the government not only provided reasons why fischel analysis was wrong,but also provided reasons why bajaj analysis was sound.specifically,the government showed that false earnings in one quarter could indeed have caused ca stock price to decline,by,inter alia,causing loss to investors who purchased ca stock at inflated prices because of fraudulent disclosures and omissions flowing from the month,then sold after such inflation had seeped out of the stock,as well as losses to investors who sold at deflated prices,where the month caused ca to understate results.see fatico hr g tr.in other words,individual sales and purchases of ca stock were singular,even assuming ca came out even in the end a dubious contention,at best,ca individual investors did not go unharmed.instead,claims filed by individual investors with ca claims administrator for their losses resulting from the month practice reveal that those losses not only existed,but were significantly underestimated by bajaj,who calculated damages only to an artificially narrow subset of victims namely,those victims who filled out and submitted claims for restitution,which is often substantially fewer than all eligible victims.gov t br.this potential disconnect between the financial health of a corporation and that of individual investors is precisely why the type of event study undertaken by bajaj conforms to the most widely accepted practices of economists.id.at.
the defendants also claim that bajaj loss calculation was erroneous because the sample of earnings misses he used in his study involved firms that had experienced genuine adverse developments such that a stock price decline would be expected.kumar br.thus,the defendants argue that the sample firms bajaj used in his study were not appropriate comparators to ca.again,the defendants argument is unpersuasive.in estimating a loss calculation,a sentencing court should not analyze the impact of fraud in a vacuum,but instead should recognize that m any factors may cause a decline in share price between the time of the fraud and the revelation of the fraud,not all of which will be attributable to fraudulent activity.united states rutkoske,cir.
in this case,the district court properly focused on loss attributable to the defendants fraud.as previously established,the month practice did indeed cause a genuine adverse development to ca financial health.moreover,bajaj study took other causes for ca stock decline into account by comparing the earnings misses of ca to those of thirty other companies,and perform ing a comprehensive regression analysis in an effort to isolate the impact of the given firm disclosure on its stock price,while controlling for or factors.gov t br.the district court was fully entitled to credit bajaj assessment of the impact of external causes on ca stock and reject fischel,particularly in light of fischel inherently contradictory analysis.
finally,in reviewing the district court loss calculation,we find it particularly telling that ca stock closed below what would have been expected on october,two days after ca public disclosure of the month practice.multiplying that undisputed figure by the million affected shares would have brought the estimated loss to investors to more than billion,alone.even assuming that the losses of october and,were tied,not to the actual operation of the fraudulent month practice,but to the possibility of an criminal and regulatory investigation that could have disastrous effects for the company,kumar br.alteration in the original,financial loss caused by speculation that stems from the fraudulent practice and a loss of confidence in management is properly included in the loss calculation,see ebbers,at.thus,we affirm the district court loss calculation of greater than million as not clearly erroneous.
were the defendants properly denied acceptance of responsibility credit 
next,the defendants argue that,a lthough they pleaded guilty to all the charges against them,the district court abused its discretion in denying them any credit for acceptance of responsibility.kumar br.emphasis in original see richards br.
a defendant is entitled to a reduction under a if he clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.a defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment under this section as a matter of right,cmt.in particular,a defendant who engages in c onduct resulting in an enhancement under obstructing or impeding the administration of justice ordinarily would not be entitled to the reduction,as such conduct indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.id.at cmt.however,there may be extraordinary cases in which a defendant who obstructs justice in some way is also entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.id.
a district court determination is entitled to great deference because the sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant acceptance of responsibility.id.at cmt.a district court decision to deny credit for acceptance of responsibility,primarily a factual determination,will be upheld unless it is without foundation.united states harris,cir.
kumar acceptance of responsibility 
at sentencing,the district court denied kumar request for an acceptance of responsibility reduction under,concluding that kumar had not sufficiently accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct because he had obstructed justice,and because he had waited until the eve of trial to plead guilty.in addition,the district court noted that kumar plea allocation was phrased to mute the gravity of his complicity in the securities fraud offenses,sentencing tr,and kumar meritless objections to the and fraudulent transaction allegations in the psr revealed a lack of acceptance of responsibility,kumar sentencing tr.at.
on appeal,kumar claims that the district court rejection of his acceptance of responsibility request was erroneous.first,kumar claims that,although an acceptance of responsibility departure is generally unavailable when a defendant engages in obstructive behavior,that exception does not apply to him because his obstructive behavior occurred and the exception only applies to obstructive behavior.see,united states gregory,cir granting acceptance points where a ll of the defendant obstructive conduct predated the indictment see also united states teyer,d,were courts to hold that any obstructive conduct,however early in the investigation of a case forever disentitled a defendant to credit for later acceptance of responsibility,this incentive would be ill served.second,kumar argues that the district court placed too much reliance on the lateness of his plea in rejecting his request for an acceptance of responsibility reduction,which he argues is only a basis for denying him a third acceptance point,but not for denying the first two.kumar br.see united states sloley,cir a government motion is a necessary prerequisite to the additional decrease for a timely plea under guidelines b.see also kumar br.noting that this court has not directly addressed the relationship between the timeliness of a defendant guilty plea and his receipt of acceptance credit.
we need not resolve either of these alleged flaws in the district court reasoning with respect to kumar,however,because an examination of the record shows that he engaged in sufficient objectionable conduct to justify a rejection of his request for acceptance of responsibility credit.specifically,kumar,individually and separately from richards,acted in ways that the district court reasonably found to be inconsistent with a full acceptance of responsibility.for example,the district court found that kumar carefully worded plea allocution muted the gravity of his complicity in the securities fraud offenses when asked if he thought that his fraudulent conduct would have affected a prudent investor decision to buy or sell his company stock,his response was i could see the possibility where it could.kumar sentencing tr.moreover,the district court found it particularly telling that kumar objected to the psr on various grounds related to evidence tampering and fraudulent transactions during his tenure at ca,but then withdrew those objections during the course of the fatico hearing,implicitly acknowledging that his objections lacked merit.indeed,notwithstanding kumar withdrawal of his objection,the district court expressly found at sentencing that there was clear and convincing evidence that at least one of kumar objections was meritless.kumar sentencing tr.see,cmt.a a defendant who falsely denies,or frivolously contests,relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.
thus,kumar conduct provided a reasonable basis for rejecting his request for an acceptance of responsibility reduction.
richards acceptance of responsibility 
while the district court set forth several reasons why kumar did not deserve a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility,in denying richards same request,the court relied on a single factor the lateness of richards plea.according to the district court,the most significant factor in the acceptance of responsibility scale is the factor of time limits.richards sentencing tr.the district court concluded that,by pleading two weeks before trial,richards had exceeded those time limits,and therefore,was not entitled to acceptance of responsibility credit.on this point,we disagree.
timeliness of a defendant plea is an appropriate consideration in the acceptance of responsibility determination.cmt.h.however,while the reduction provided for in a is for demonstration of acceptance of responsibility,the sentencing guidelines specifically provide that timeliness of a plea is primarily relevant to the reduction of an additional point under b,ostensibly for helping the authorities save resources.united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.see united states eyler,cir while the key inquiry for purposes of a is whether the defendant has demonstrated contrition,once this has been determined,then the focus of the section b inquiry is on timeliness.emphasis in original.as judge lynch stated in teyer 
the guidelines specifically provide a sanction for belated guilty pleas that fail adequately to save the resources of the government and the court.defendants who plead at an early stage qualify for an additional reduction that is correspondingly unavailable for belated pleas.that a defendant can earn an additional reduction merely by notifying the authorities of his intention to plead early enough to permit the government to avoid preparing for trial strongly implies that defendants may qualify for the basic adjustment for acceptance of responsibility without doing so.
d at alteration,internal citations,and quotation marks omitted.
here,the lateness of richards plea on its own was not a sufficient foundation for denying him any acceptance of responsibility credit.while under certain circumstances the lateness of a plea might indeed weigh against the defendant,those circumstances are not present in this case.for example,richards plea came neither after the g overnment concluded presenting its case,during the jury deliberations,nor on the morning of trial,and the district court cited no other relevant factors that warranted a rejection of richards request.id.it is undisputed that richards obstruction and culpability was of a different order than that of kumar.richards sentencing tr.unlike kumar,richards appeared to fully accept responsibility both prior to and during sentencing.see richards sentencing tr.your honor,i fully accept responsibility for the actions that i have taken and regret those actions.also unlike kumar,who tampered with physical evidence,bribed witnesses,and lied repeatedly during the course of a federal investigation,richards obstructive conduct consisted entirely of a single,albeit false,denial of knowledge of the month practice during an interview and subsequent testimony that predated his guilty plea by three years and was accounted for in the indictment.indeed,denying richards acceptance of responsibility solely due to his charged obstructive conduct would effectively raise the guidelines level for such conduct by foreclosing the opportunity for acceptance of responsibility credit in obstruction cases.
because the paramount factor in determining eligibility for credit is whether the defendant truthfully admits the conduct comprising the offense or offenses of conviction,and because richards did so here in a sufficiently timely manner so as to avoid a lengthy trial and avert the risk of an irrational verdict,teyer,d at,his lateness in pleading guilty did not by itself provide a sufficient basis for the denial of more than a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.accordingly,because the district court erroneously failed to award richards a reduction for acceptance of responsibility that he should have received,richards sentence is vacated and the case remanded to the district court for resentencing on this additional basis.
vi.was richards sentence substantively unreasonable 
finally,richards contends that his sentence of seven years imprisonment was unreasonably long,despite the psr recommendation of a life sentence.however,because we vacate richards sentence as procedurally unsound and remand the case for resentencing,there is no need to entertain his substantive reasonableness argument at this time.see gall united states,assuming that the district court sentencing decision is procedurally sound,the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an standard.emphasis added accord united states cavera,cir en banc.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the district court judgment and sentence as to kumar is affirmed in all respects the district court judgment as to richards is affirmed,but richards sentence is vacated and remanded to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
i join in the majority conclusions regarding the sufficiency of evidence for richards conviction of obstruction of justice,the rejection of richards coercion claim,the applicability of c to richards conduct,the district court loss calculation,and the defendants acceptance of responsibility.i disagree,however,with the majority conclusion that the defendants sentencing on securities and wire fraud charges on the basis of the one book of the sentencing guidelines in effect in,long after those violations had been completed,does not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws.the defendants commission of subsequent obstruction of justice offenses,though related to the underlying securities and wire fraud charges and committed at a time when the guidelines would apply,does not,in my view,render those guidelines applicable to the securities and wire fraud charges because at the time the defendants committed the securities and wire fraud offenses,they did not have fair notice of the severity of the penalties to which they might be subjected for them under the later,harsher guidelines.to the extent that the majority conclude otherwise,i respectfully dissent.
ex post facto clause 
the ex post facto clause of article i,section,reads no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.const.art.i,cl.some eleven years after it was adopted as part of the original united states constitution,justice samuel chase,a president washington appointee,observed that this prohibition necessarily requires some explanation for,naked and without explanation,it is unintelligible,and means nothing.calder bull,dall.chase.he then established as black letter constitutional law that,inter alia,e very criminal law that changes the punishment,and inflicts a greater punishment,than the law annexed to the crime,when committed,violates the ex post facto clause.id emphasis omitted 
nearly two hundred years later,chief justice rehnquist,writing for the court,explained 
early opinions of the court portrayed the enumeration by justice chase in calder as an exclusive definition of ex post facto laws citing three nineteenth century supreme court decisions.so well accepted were these principles that the court in beazell ohio,was able to confidently summarize the meaning of the clause as follows 
it is settled,by decisions of this court so well known that their citation may be dispensed with,that any statute which punishes as a crime an act previously committed,which was innocent when done which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime,after its commission,or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed,is prohibited as ex post facto,at.
see also dobbert florida.
the beazell formulation is faithful to our best knowledge of the original understanding of the ex post facto clause legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.

section of the united states sentencing guidelines provides in pertinent part 
use of guidelines manual in effect on date of sentencing policy statement 
a the court shall use the guidelines manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced.
b if the court determines that use of the guidelines manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced would violate the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution,the court shall use the guidelines manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was committed.
the guidelines manual in effect on a particular date shall be applied in its entirety 
if the defendant is convicted of two offenses,the first committed before,and the second after,a revised edition of the guidelines manual became effective,the revised edition of the guidelines manual is to be applied to both offenses.
the notion that only one set of guidelines should be applied in imposing a single sentence,even where that sentence covers multiple crimes the commission of which straddles the effective dates of two sets of guidelines,appears to derive from the principle that each set of guidelines is meant to act as a cohesive whole.united states bailey,cir.a sentencing court has no authority to pick and choose,taking one provision from an earlier version of the guidelines and another from a later version the rule avoids twisting the guidelines,depriving them of uniformity and consistency.id.quoting united states keller,cir brackets and ellipsis in bailey.
consistent with that principle,application note to section provides,in relevant part,that 
the approach set forth in subsection b should be followed regardless of whether the offenses of conviction are the type in which the conduct is grouped under d.the ex post facto clause does not distinguish between groupable and nongroupable offenses,and unless that clause would be violated,congress directive to apply the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing must be followed.
relevant facts 
the facts relevant to the ex post facto issue before us are relatively simple and straightforward.
the defendants engaged in securities and wire fraud,and conspired to commit such fraud.the last overt act of the conspiracy was committed in may of,and the fraud use of a accounting month ended no later than october.at the time the defendants committed these crimes,the november,edition of the guidelines was in effect.
between and,the guidelines were revised so as to increase the punishment for crimes of the sort that the defendants had previously committed.the revisions resulted in an increase in the offense levels applicable to those crimes based upon the amount of money lost by the victims of the crime,and in an expansion of the loss table through the addition of new categories for losses of and million,with the latter calling for a enhancement compared to the enhancement that would have applied to a million loss under the version of the guidelines.the revised guidelines also created a new enhancement for fraud involving or more victims,and a enhancement for violations of securities laws by defendants who were officers or directors of public companies.see b b.
under the guidelines in effect at the time of the defendants commission of the fraud and conspiracy crimes,the applicable offense level was,which translated into a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.as a result of the subsequent revisions,the offense level was raised to,resulting in a recommended sentence of life imprisonment.see op.at.
beginning in september and continuing until april,the defendants engaged in various acts designed to cover up their previously committed conspiracy and fraud.in a superseding original indictment had been handed down in defendants were charged with committing fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud over a period of time ending in but the superseding indictment also charged richards with committing perjury thereafter,kumar with making false statements to a special agent of the fbi thereafter,and both defendants with filing false sec filings,obstructing justice and conspiring to obstruct justice thereafter.both defendants pled guilty to all of these charges in april,and were sentenced on all of them in november of that year.no relevant changes in the guidelines were made between the time of the commission of the coverup crimes and the filing of the superseding indictment,the plea,and the sentencing.
relying on the rule,the district court sentenced the defendants on all of the charges to which they pled guilty under the guidelines.the court decided that no ex post facto issue was presented by the fact that this version of the guidelines was not in effect at the time the defendants committed the fraud and conspiracy crimes it therefore did not apply the exception set forth in subsection b that instructs a court not to apply the guidelines manual in effect on the date of sentencing if so doing would violate the ex post facto clause.using the guidelines,the district court sentenced each defendant to what would appear to be depending on the actual longevity of each defendant well below his life sentence kumar to months incarceration,followed by three years of supervised release richards to months incarceration,followed by three years of supervised release.
the majority opinion 
there is an inherent tension between the rule and the ex post facto a rule prescribing the application of guidelines that are current as of the day of sentencing with respect to crimes that were committed before those guidelines went into effect,and a constitutional requirement that l egislatures not retroactively increase the punishment for criminal acts.collins,at.indeed,that tension is explicitly acknowledged in subsection b of the rule,quoted above.judge easterbrook once remarked on the gymnastics performed by the seventh circuit in the case there on appeal in resolving that tension in order to show that a n increase in the defendant offense level was compatible with the ex post facto clause united states vivit,cir easterbrook,concurring see also id.opining that such gymnastics were unnecessary,because the sentencing guidelines are not laws within the scope of the ex post facto clause.that might be said of similar attempts by federal courts nationwide since the guidelines regime began.i fear,though,that in the case at bar,the majority have turned from gymnastics to contortions.
the majority and i begin on common ground.we first assume that the ex post facto doctrine applies to the sentencing guidelines after the supreme court decided,in united states booker,that the guidelines are advisory we then agree that f or a law to contravene the ex post facto clause,two critical elements must be present first,the law must be retrospective,that is,it must apply to events occurring before its enactment and second,it must disadvantage the offender affected by it.op.at quoting miller florida.we also agree that the second element is present here t here is no question that application of the guidelines disadvantaged the defendants by subjecting them to the higher ranges of the guidelines compared to the version of the guidelines in effect when the month practice was discontinued in october.op.at footnote omitted.the use of the guidelines raised the recommended guidelines range from to months incarceration to life imprisonment.
where i depart from the majority view is on the question of retroactivity.the majority recognize that 
central to the ex post facto prohibition is a concern for the lack of fair notice and governmental restraint when the legislature increases punishment beyond what was prescribed when the crime was consummated.miller,at quoting weaver graham.the existence of an ex post facto violation thus turns on whether an individual was deprived of fair notice 
id.at.they find sufficient notice to the defendants by concluding that 
the adoption of the rule prior to the commission of the defendants obstruction offense had placed them on notice of the consequences of committing that second offense.that the consequences of the second offense included the application of the guidelines to all offenses considered at the defendants sentencing was fully apparent prior to the commission of the crimes that triggered those consequences.
id.at emphasis added.
but it seems to me that the notice that the defendants received here was notice as to punishment for the wrong crime not as to the fraud and conspiracy crimes for which punishment was revised markedly upward,but the subsequent obstruction offenses for which the guidelines have not changed.this notice was inconsequential because the defendants were not subjected to an increased sentence for obstruction they were subjected to an increased sentence for already completed frauds.and i think that the majority give insufficient attention to the quality of notice that ex post facto jurisprudence requires.it is not notice simpliciter,but notice that is fair.as the supreme court said in miller,the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws can not be avoided merely by adding to a law notice that it might be changed in that case the court found an ex post facto violation because the defendant was not aware of the prescribed range of punishment for his offense at the time he committed it.miller at.ex post facto is as much a doctrine of retroactivity as it is a doctrine of notice,sash,at,and the inherent injustice associated with retroactivity itself must guide our analysis,id.at.
what we said in the related context of the change of rules regarding supervised release bears repeating here 
we are unpersuaded by the government argument that the ex post facto clause is not implicated so long as the penalty for a violation is enhanced before the defendant engages in his conduct because the violator then has notice and fair warning that that conduct will result in the enhanced penalty.while it is true that a defendant would have notice of that enhancement before he committed his violation of supervised release,it is equally true that he would have had no such notice before he committed the original offense.indeed,the enhanced punishment of revocation simply would not be applicable to him had he not committed his original offense and been sentenced,for that offense,to supervised release.thus,the government notice argument is not helpful to resolving the issue presented by this appeal.
united states meeks,cir,abrogated on other grounds by johnson united states,while it may be true that,in the case at hand,the rule provided richards and kumar constructive notice of the enhancement in sentencing before they obstructed justice,it is equally true that they would have had no such notice before they committed the original offense s of fraud and conspiracy.see also,united states zagari,cir finding,where the government sought to apply a revised version of the guidelines to a fraud committed before the revision based upon charged but later dismissed conduct that the government alleged to amount to a continuation of the fraud after the revision,that use of the revised guidelines violated the ex post facto clause where the alleged frauds before and after the revision were not properly subsumed into one huge scheme to defraud,but rather should be thought of as separate schemes.
six of our sister circuits that have addressed this issue have limited their conclusion of constitutionality either to cases that involve a continuing course of conduct or to cases in which the offenses are sufficiently similar to be subject to grouping under the guidelines.see united states duane,cir concluding the better argument in favor of b constitutionality to be that a guidelines revision,b itself,and the d grouping rules provide a criminal fair warning that committing future similar crimes may subject him to increased penalties for similar prior offenses united states sullivan,cir t he grouping rules and the relevant conduct provisions gave the defendant notice that his three consecutive failures to file would be considered part of the same course of conduct and would collectively determine his sentence.vivit,at deciding that the guidelines,including in particular the grouping rules,succeed in provid ing notice to criminals that engaging in ongoing fraudulent behavior involving the same type of harm risks grouping of convictions,which because of the rule,will all be sentenced according to the guidelines in effect when the latest conduct occurred.united states kimler,cir the defendant had proper notice that,if he continued to commit related offenses that would be grouped under d,he would be sentenced under the guidelines in use when he committed the last offense in the grouped series.bailey,at t he one book rule,together with the guidelines grouping rules and relevant conduct,provide that related offenses committed in a series will be sentenced together under the sentencing guidelines manual in effect at the end of the series.thus,a defendant knows,when he continues to commit related crimes,that he risks sentencing for all of his offenses under the latest,amended sentencing guidelines manual.united states regan,cir deciding,before the establishment of the rule,that it was not an ex post facto violation to use revised guidelines where offenses committed prior to revision had been grouped with offenses committed after the revision and were manifestly part of the same ongoing scheme of embezzlements.
two other circuits have found the rule to be constitutional even in cases not involving continuing courses of conduct or grouped offenses.these circuits only reached a conclusion of constitutionality,however,in cases that involved repeated commission of the same offense before and after the revision of the guidelines.see united states lewis,cir finding the application of the rule to be constitutional in a case involving multiple acts of tax evasion before and after a revision of the guidelines united states cooper,cir concluding that the ex post facto clause was not violated where a series of firearms offenses straddled a revision of the guidelines,and comparing series of offenses to a conspiracy that straddles the sentencing guidelines effective date.
the two remaining circuits that have addressed this have unequivocally concluded,to the contrary,that the rule is unconstitutional in these circumstances,even where the convictions that straddle a revision of the guidelines are grouped for sentencing purposes.see united states ortland,cir united states bertoli,cir.
so,it seems,we now stand alone the panel concludes that any offense that has been committed by a defendant after a revision of the guidelines may be used as a basis to apply the revised guidelines to crimes committed before the revision so long as the pre and crimes are prosecuted together but irrespective of the relationship,if any,between them the majority take this position in a case in which the two sets of crimes,the substantive crimes and the coverup offenses,are in fact,they have been grouped together for sentencing no such broad holding is required for resolution of this appeal as discussed in more detail below,i do not think the relationship of these offenses to be sufficiently close to conceive of them as groupable continuing offenses and therefore to overcome the ex post facto problem,but such a holding would at least acknowledge that there is a notice problem inherent in allowing a guideline revised after a crime was committed to be used to sentence for that crime.
the majority seek to find in the rule a form of constructive notice to defendants as to the consequences of their crimes because they knew at the time they committed any successive crime that the sentence for all prior completed crimes indicted together with the successor crime would be increased as a consequence of that successive crime.but the ex post facto clause requires not only notice,but also that the notice be fair.in the case of kumar and richards,it was not.
i agree with the sentiments of judge kelly,of the tenth circuit,dissenting under somewhat similar circumstances t he only notice provide d to the defendants at the time of commission of the offenses is that the sentence could be determined in accordance with guideline provisions that may or may not be amended.even if the notice is sufficient to inform a defendant that the last offense could determine the sentence,only a defendant with the prescience of a clairvoyant could anticipate an actual sentence based upon a amended guideline.united states sullivan,cir kelly,dissenting.
the majority and i agree that grouping is not determinative of whether the sentences here comport with the due process clause.we reach this conclusion for different reasons,however.the issue of grouping of offenses affects the ex post facto inquiry,it seems to me,in at least two relevant to the case at bar,and only one of which is acknowledged in the majority opinion.
first,there is considerable support for the argument that when offenses are grouped for sentencing purposes because the behavior is ongoing or continuous in nature and the offense guideline is written to cover such behavior,d,ex post facto concerns are met.according to the eighth circuit,for example,it has been held that applying the sentencing guidelines to a conspiracy that straddles the sentencing guidelines effective date is not violative of the ex post facto clause.courts have noted that with conspiracy and other continuing offenses it is the completion date of the offense that controls the version of the sentencing guidelines to be applied.cooper,at emphasis added citations omitted.this argument would support a finding of constitutionality despite the fact that the penalty prescribed for the crime is made harsher during the course of the criminal behavior because the defendants at least theoretically made a choice to continue their unlawful activity while the penalties for it were being increased 
this is precisely the argument the government makes here,contending that the obstruction offenses are part of a continuing course of conduct with the fraud and conspiracy offenses.appellee br.at.while i do not think this argument persuasive in this particular case i recognize that the argument at least attempts to address the ex post facto problems inherent in applying a revised version of the guidelines to the sentence of an act completed before the revision.had this been the basis of the majority decision today,our disagreement on the law would seem to me to be a narrow one.
but the majority appear to view the impact of grouping in a second fashion instead,one that has indeed been endorsed by several of our sister circuits.it was expressed explicitly by the seventh circuit in vivit t he adoption of the rule and the grouping rules put s criminals on notice that the version of the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time he committed the last series of grouped offences will apply to the entire group.vivit,at quoting kimler,at.before they violated the securities fraud and conspiracy laws,the defendants knew the guidelines sentence at the time,but they also knew that it could be increased if they later committed an this case obstruction of would be grouped with it.
the majority base their unique holding on the rule rather than the grouping theory described here,but the two analyses bear similarities the rule as applied here is constitutional because the guidelines provide notice that the law is subject to change.even if they do not provide notice of what that change will be at the time an act is committed,they provide such notice before a subsequent act.whether this analysis is conducted under the grouping rules or the rule seems largely beside the point to me.in either event it permits notice that is insufficient under the observation in miller that t he constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws can not be avoided merely by adding to a law notice that it might be changed.miller at.
this sort of compound,abstract notice hardly seems to me to be fair notice at the time the fraud and conspiracy crimes were committed of what punishment the defendants might receive if they misbehaved in that notice only that if they did what they did,and later committed another potentially groupable crime,their sentence could be increased by some unknown amount.i am reminded again of judge kelly reference to the defendant with the prescience of a clairvoyant who alone could anticipate an actual sentence based upon a amended guideline.sullivan,at kelly,dissenting.it is,in short,speculative and incomplete notice and therefore not fair.
recidivism cases 
the majority reason by analogy to decisions,including those of the supreme court,upholding recidivism that punish crimes committed by a person with a specified level of criminal record more harshly than those committed by a person without such a record.the rule,the majority say,when it leads to a higher sentencing range than would be applied to a single offense,operates in a manner similar to that of the recidivist statutes and three strikes laws upheld by the supreme court and our sister circuits in the past.op.at.they cite gryger burke,as having rejected the defendant argument that the consideration of his past offenses in determining his sentence for a later offense was foreclosed by the ex post facto clause.id.at.op.at.
the majority then assert that t he fact that the impetus for enacting the recidivist statutes was to reflect the greater culpability associated with the latter offenses,whereas the impetus for the enactment of the rule is to avoid piecemeal sentencing is of no relevance for the purposes of determining the retroactivity of the legal consequences of the defendant actions.op.at citation omitted.the majority therefore conclude that the distinction between the recidivist statutes and the rule makes neither a practical nor a logical difference for purposes of an analysis under the ex post facto clause,because the defendants obstruction offense is the actual crime triggering the application of the rule,the defendants had prior notice of the consequences of that crime,and therefore the application of the rule is proper.op.at.
i think,to the contrary,that there is a crucial difference between the legislative branch deciding that a particular crime is more serious when committed that the public is in need of more protection person who has a specified level of past criminal behavior than someone who does not,and increasing a penalty for a completed crime triggered by the commission of a subsequent,irrespective,in the majority view,of whether there is a connection between those crimes committed before the change and those committed afterward.justice jackson,writing for the court in gryger,put it thus 
nor do we think the fact that one of the convictions that entered into the calculations by which petitioner became a fourth offender occurred before the act was passed,makes the act invalidly retroactive or subjects the petitioner to double jeopardy.the sentence as a fourth offender or habitual criminal is not to be viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crimes.it is a stiffened penalty for the latest crime,which is considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one.
gryger,at emphasis added.
the later crime may,as the majority say,trigger the change in the sentence for the earlier crimes,but what it triggers is what the gryger court said was improper an additional penalty for the ir earlier crimes.whatever the trigger,the revisions increased the offense levels applicable to the earlier fraud and conspiracy crimes,not the later obstruction of justice offenses.the revisions added an increase based upon the amount of money lost by the victims of the fraud and conspiracy crimes they expanded the loss table for the fraud and conspiracy offenses,not the obstruction of justice offenses,by adding new categories for losses of and million and they created a new enhancement for fraud,not obstruction of justice,involving or more victims and added a enhancement for violations of securities laws,not the obstruction of justice laws,by defendants who were officers or directors of public companies.see b b cooper,cir it is well settled that habitual offender statutes do not offend the ex post facto clause,even though such statutes impact imposition of an instant sentence in consideration of past criminal conduct.citing gryger,at.the enhanced sentence is considered to impose a stiffer penalty for the latest crime,which is considered to be an aggravated offense due to its repetitive nature.emphasis added.this is,of course,the critical difference between recidivist statutes and the circumstances we are faced with here that while,as the majority point out and as gryger makes clear,the consideration of past offenses in determining the sentence for a later offense may be permissible for ex post facto purposes,op.at,it is the consideration of a later offense in determining the sentence for past offenses,as we do here,that runs afoul of ex post facto considerations.
as a practical matter,to be sure,congress,or perhaps the sentencing commission,might may a permissible recidivism statute to cover a circumstance very much like the present one a person who commits an obstruction of justice in order to cover up a fraud in which the losses inflicted by the fraud are x will receive a y level increase in offense level.it does not follow,logically or otherwise,that reaching a similar result by the present retroactively increasing the punishment for constitutional.the hypothetical law would provide punishment for behavior of which the potential violator would be fully and fairly warned before engaging in that behavior.it would reflect the perceived seriousness of future obstruction offenses,publically disseminated before any such offense is committed,and not an attempt to completed past acts.to increase the punishment for fraud and conspiracy after they are completed provides no fair notice and evokes the inherent injustice associated with retroactivity itself.sash,at.
conclusion 
we have been instructed for more than years that a law that changes the punishment,and inflicts a greater punishment,than the law annexed to the crime,when committed violates the ex post facto clause.calder,at.that seems to me to describe the change in the guidelines that was applied to the defendants fraud and conspiracy crimes upon sentencing long after those crimes had ended.
again,i have no reason to doubt that the guidelines commission may promulgate obstruction of justice guidelines that take into account the gravity,as it then views the gravity to be in the context of the crime for which punishment is being evaded,so as prospectively to prescribe harsher sanctions for the obstruction.but then it must prescribe those sanctions to the obstruction itself and not to crimes that are over.i think that to be a violation of the ex post facto clause.
for the foregoing reasons and to the extent indicated,i respectfully dissent.
judge sack dissents as to this portion of our opinion.
according to kumar,the month practice ended in october,when ca new business model brought it to an end.kumar br.the government does not dispute that the month practice ended in october,and the indictment cites no overt acts of securities fraud by either defendant after may.accordingly,the guidelines manual,which was effective between november,and november,was the version of the manual in effect at the time the defendants fraud offenses were completed.
individually,and unlike richards,kumar also objected to the psr recitation of his offense conduct,insofar as it alleged that he had erased data from his computer and engaged in fraudulent transactions as ca ceo.on october,the district court held a separate fatico hearing to consider kumar individual objections.after two days of testimony,kumar withdrew all of his individual objections to the psr before the district court could rule on them although he maintained objections that he held jointly with richards and the government agreed to withdraw one contested allegation in the psr.
the district court also rejected a enhancement for obstruction of justice,concluding that the defendants had pl ed guilty to that crime in other counts and this enhancement is superfluous and may even be regarded as double counting.see kumar sentencing tr,see also richards sentencing tr.it appears that the court erred in not adding two points for obstruction,see,united states fiore,cir kumar even concedes the error.however,the government has not this issue and,thus,has waived the issue on appeal.see norton sam club,cir.
section c provides whoever corruptly alters,destroys,mutilates,or conceals a record,document,or other object,or attempts to do so,with the intent to impair the object integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding or otherwise obstructs,influences,or impedes any official proceeding,or attempts to do so,shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
the government brief repeatedly refers to defendants statutory argument,thus implying that both kumar and richards challenge their convictions for obstruction of justice.however,only richards challenges his conviction on this basis.

although application typically begins after the commencement of formal judicial proceedings,united states,cir internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted,in this case,richards concedes that,when he lied,he knew that formal judicial proceedings were not only possible or likely,but that the government intended to bring them.such obstructive behavior during a federal that investigation is conducted by a grand jury,or by a federal agency like the sec where there is also a quite strong,perhaps inescapable inference that the witness statements would be presented to a grand jury is covered by a.see united states triumph capital group,cir see,united states giovanelli,cir per curiam obstructive behavior during a grand jury investigation but before indictment sufficient to trigger application of a see also united states macari,cir noting that the aguilar court did not draw a line between subpoenaed or actual and or potential witnesses,but instead focused on the defendant intent when he performed the alleged act of lying to investigating fbi agents united states davis,cir nexus requirement satisfied where conspirators knew of or anticipated a grand jury investigation emphasis added united states vaghela,cir holding that a conviction for conspiracy to obstruct justice under does not require a judicial proceeding to exist at the time of the offense,but only that the defendant directly intended to prevent or otherwise obstruct the processes of a specific judicial proceeding in a way that is more than merely speculative quoting aguilar,at cueto,at it is well established that investigations undertaken with the intention of presenting evidence before a grand jury are sufficientt constitute the due administration of justice under.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.united states brenson,cir section employs the term due administration of justice to provide a protective cloak over all judicial proceedings,irrespective of at what stage in the judicial process the improper activity occurs.
the government may have charged richards with violating c instead of a due to its concern that a a charge would raise a masterpol issue.see gov t br.citing united states masterpol,cir.in masterpol,we held that witness tampering is prohibited only by,and is not covered by omnibus clause.at.the government concern with respect to richards obstruction charge was misplaced.while masterpol might have presented an obstacle for indicting kumar,who attempted to bribe a witness,as previously noted,kumar is not appealing his obstruction of justice conviction.unlike kumar,richards did not engage in witness tampering.thus,masterpol is not implicated here.
the relevant changes to the guidelines occurred in,and.in november,the sentencing commission the commission revised the fraud guidelines to provide for an increase based upon the loss for most loss amounts.kumar br.quoting thomas hutchinson,highlights of the amendments,federal sentencing guidelines manual,edition,xii west ed.internal quotation marks omitted.in january of,in response to the act,the commission further expanded the loss table by adding two new than million and more than the latter calling for a enhancement in sentence under the guidelines.see b supp.in january of,the commission also created enhancements for the number of victims,so that a increase is now required for frauds involving or more victims.see id.b.at the same time,the commission added a new enhancement if the offense involved a violation of the securities laws and the defendant was an officer or director of a publicly traded company.see id.b.
regardless of whether the or the guidelines are applied to the defendants fraud offense,the grouping rules would require the sentencing court to impose the highest offense level of the counts in the group.a.as the defendants recognize,the offense level attributed to the defendants fraud counts would be higher than that attributed to the obstruction count irrespective of the guidelines version applied.therefore,the government assertion that the sentences do not violate the ex post facto clause because the counts were properly grouped pursuant to is misplaced.if the sentences do not offend the ex post facto clause,it is only because the application of the rule is not retrospective.see cmt.background moreover,the approach set forth in subsection b should be followed regardless of whether the offenses of conviction are the type in which the conduct is grouped under d.cmt.background.
the district court found that the rule did not raise an ex post facto issue in this case,based on its conclusion that,after united states booker,the ex post facto clause does not apply to the previously mandatory,now advisory,guidelines.the government has disclaimed reliance on the district court analysis in its opening brief,see gov t br.see also kumar reply br.noting that the government abandoned the argument it had advanced to the district court that the ex post facto clause does not apply to sentences,and we therefore proceed with consideration of this appeal on the assumption that the ex post facto clause applies to the advisory guidelines.
in its recent opinion in united states anderson,cir,the eighth circuit applied the rule to overcome an ex post facto challenge in the case of a defendant convictions for wire fraud and failure to appear for trial.although the crimes at issue were potentially subject to grouping under guidelines section and c,anderson ex post facto analysis makes no mention of the guidelines grouping rules and bases its holding entirely on the application of the rule.id.
