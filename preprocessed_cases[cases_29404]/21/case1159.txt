defendant corey jones appeals from a sentence entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york garaufis,following a jury trial convicting him of assaulting a federal officer in violation of.he was sentenced as a career offender principally to months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release.he argues on appeal that,in light of the supreme court holding in johnson united states,new york robbery is no longer necessarily a crime of violence within the meaning of a and a and that the district court therefore erred in concluding that his prior conviction for robbery could automatically serve as one of the predicate offenses for a career offender designation.he also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.we conclude that,after johnson,a conviction for robbery in new york is not in every instance a conviction for a crime of violence and therefore vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.
background 
on june,corey jones was in a halfway house,finishing a federal sentence for unlawful gun possession.after jones allegedly verbally threatened a staff member,two deputy marshals came to take jones to prison.jones resisted the marshals efforts to take him into custody and,during the ensuing altercation,jones bit the finger of one of the marshals,who suffered puncture wounds and received antibiotics and a tetanus vaccine at a hospital.
a jury convicted jones of assaulting a federal officer in violation of.in the report,the probation officer calculated an offense level of for the assault.however,the probation officer determined that jones was a career offender pursuant to a and a the career offender guideline because,in addition to being over years of age when he had committed the assault and the instant offense being a crime of violence,he had at least two prior felony convictions of a crime of violence.the probation officer concluded that jones previous convictions in new york for robbery and assault satisfied the third element of the test.as a result of the career offender designation,the probation officer increased the offense level to,which,combined with jones criminal history category of vi,resulted in a guidelines range of to months in prison.because the statutory maximum for assault is years,the probation officer adjusted the top of the range down to months.
the district court adopted the findings contained in the report and sentenced jones to months in prison to be followed by three years of supervised release.
jones now appeals his sentence,arguing first that the district court erred in sentencing him as a career offender and second that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.
discussion 
we must resolve the question of whether a robbery conviction in new york is necessarily a conviction for a crime of violence such that it will always be a predicate offense for a sentencing enhancement under the career offender guideline.at first glance the answer to this question might appear to be a straightforward yes,as we held in united states spencer,cir.however,jones argues that our holding in spencer can not survive the supreme court analysis in johnson united states.we conclude that he is correct.the supreme court analysis in johnson compels us to overrule our holding in spencer and to hold that a robbery conviction in new york is no longer necessarily a conviction for a crime of violence as that term is used in the career offender guideline.
because jones did not raise his argument about johnson applicability to new york robbery statute before the district court,we review for plain error.united states gamez,cir.per curiam.to meet this standard,jones must establish the existence of an error that is plain that affects substantial rights and that seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.we apply this standard less stringently in the sentencing context,where the cost of correcting an unpreserved error is not as great as in the trial context.id.we first turn to whether the district court committed error before addressing the remaining plain error requirements.
i.the legal provisions at issue in this appeal 
this appeal involves the interplay between three legal provisions the armed career criminal act acca,the career offender guideline,and new york robbery statute.we must determine whether robbery in new york,defined in new york penal law and,is necessarily a crime of violence under the career offender guideline.to do so,we must address the relationship between the term crime of violence in the guideline and the term violent felony in the acca,as explicated in johnson.
the acca requires sentencing judges to impose a sentence of at least years imprisonment on offenders who are convicted of illegally possessing a firearm or ammunition and who have three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.e.the acca defines violent felony as a felony that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.id.e b i.
the career offender guideline enhances sentences for defendants who are career offenders.a.a defendant is a career offender if he is at least eighteen years old at the time he committed the instant offense of conviction his instant offense of conviction is a felony that is a crime of violence and he has at least two prior felony convictions of a crime of violence.a.in defining crime of violence,a uses language identical to that in the acca definition of violent felony.a crime of violence is a felony that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.a.
a defendant commits robbery in new york when he forcibly steals property,which the statute defines as a larceny involving the use or threatened immediate use of physical force upon another person.penal law.the various degrees of robbery,which carry differing penalties,turn on the presence or absence of particular aggravating factors.compare id.defining robbery,with id.defining robbery,and with id.defining robbery.a defendant commits robbery in new york when he commits robbery and during the course of the crime or his immediate flight either c auses serious physical injury to any other person who is not a participant in the crime or i s armed with a deadly weapon or u ses or threatens the immediate use of a dangerous instrument or d isplays what appears to be a firearm.id.
ii.the interpretation of violent felony under the acca in johnson 
in johnson,the supreme court held that the florida felony offense of battery by actually and intentionally touching another person does not have as an element the use of physical force against the person of another,and thus does not constitute a violent felony under the acca.at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.the court reached this conclusion after considering the ordinary definition of force,which suggest s a degree of power that would not be satisfied by the merest touching,and its common law definition,which encompasses even the slightest offensive touching.id.at.the court determined that the term ordinary meaning made more sense in the context of the definition of a violent felony because by itself,the word violent connotes a substantial degree of force but w hen the adjective violent is attached to the noun felony,its connotation of strong physical force is even clearer.id.at.therefore,in the context of a statutory definition of violent felony,the phrase physical force means violent force that is,force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another.id.emphasis in original.correspondingly,force that is not capable of causing physical pain or injury to another,violent,can not qualify a crime as a violent felony for use as an acca predicate.
in johnson the supreme court interpreted the acca use of violent felony,whereas here we are called on to interpret the career offender guideline use of crime of violence.however,we have previously applied the supreme court analysis in johnson to determine what constitutes a crime of violence within the meaning of the career offender guideline,united states reyes,cir.per curiam,and for good reason.because of the substantial similarity between the acca definition of violent felony and the career offender guidelines definition of crime of violence,authority interpreting one phrase frequently is found to be persuasive in interpreting the other phrase.united states walker,cir.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.we see no reason to depart from our previous approach and we therefore apply johnson analysis of violent felony to the career offender guideline use of crime of violence.
iii.the categorical and modified categorical approaches 
the supreme court has recognized two approaches to determining whether a state crime qualifies as a predicate crime under the acca the categorical approach and the modified categorical approach.descamps united states.the categorical approach is confined to an examination of the text of the state criminal prohibition to determine whether it is identical to or narrower than the generic crime under the acca.id.if so,a conviction under the state statute qualifies as an acca predicate.id.the modified categorical approach permits a court to look to a limited class of documents for example,the indictment,jury instructions,or plea agreement and colloquy to determine what crime,with what elements,a defendant was convicted of.mathis united states.
the supreme court has made clear in descamps and mathis that the modified categorical approach is only available in a very limited circumstance to achieve a very limited purpose.where the state statute is divisible it proscribes multiple crimes with different elements the modified categorical approach can be employed to determine which crime pertains to the defendant actual conduct.mathis,at.once that determination is made,the purpose of the modified categorical approach is at an end.id.the court must then use the categorical approach to determine whether the statutory elements of the crime of conviction so determined are equal to or narrower than the acca generic crime.id.if the statutory elements permit a conviction for a crime that is not within the scope of the acca generic crime then it can not be used as an acca predicate and that is true even if the modified categorical approach would demonstrate that in fact the actual conduct of the defendant was fully consistent with the generic crime.id.at.
when analyzing statutes using the categorical approach,we focus on the elements of the crime of conviction and not the facts underlying the crime for two reasons.first,the text of the career offender guideline,like the text of the acca,explicitly refers to convictions and not conduct.id.at.the career offender guideline directs the sentencing court to consider whether the offender has at least two prior felony convictions of a crime of violence,a,which indicates that the sentencer should ask only about whether the defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories,and not about what the defendant had actually done.see mathis,at internal quotation marks omitted.
second,a focus on the elements of the crime of conviction,rather than the facts of what the defendant did avoids unfairness to defendants.see id.at.statements of fact in the records of prior convictions are prone to error precisely because their proof is unnecessary,see,so defendants may have little incentive to ensure the correctness of records of earlier convictions that could later trigger the career offender enhancement.
whether we apply the categorical or modified categorical approach to a state statute depends on whether the statute is indivisible or divisible.see flores holder,cir.a statute is indivisible if it sets out a single set of elements to define a single crime,while a statute is divisible if it list s elements in the alternative,and thereby define s multiple crimes.mathis,at.
new york robbery statute is divisible,and thus eligible for the modified categorical approach,because it lists four categories of robbery forcibly stea ling property while either causing serious physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime or armed with a deadly weapon or using or threatening the immediate use of a dangerous instrument or displaying what appears to be a firearm.penal law see flores,at analyzing the divisibility of new york sexual abuse statute.
in this case,however,we are unable to employ the modified categorical approach to determine which of the four subparts of the statute provided the basis for jones robbery conviction because the facts underlying his conviction are not in the record before us.where this occurs we must determine whether the least of the acts described in the robbery statute can serve as a predicate offense for the career offender enhancement.see johnson,at.if so,then jones robbery conviction can serve as a predicate offense for the enhancement,regardless of which subpart provided the basis for his conviction.if not,then his conviction can not serve as a predicate offense unless the district court later determines under the modified categorical approach,with the benefit of further evidence and argument,that jones was convicted under a subpart of the robbery statute that constitutes a violent felony.
jones identifies the act of forcibly stealing property while armed with a deadly weapon as being the least of the acts in the statute,and we agree.penal law.therefore,the question we must answer in this appeal is whether a defendant who forcibly steals property while armed with a deadly weapon necessarily commits a crime of violence within the meaning of the career offender guideline.see johnson,at.
iv.applying johnson to new york robbery statute 
in applying johnson definition of physical force to new york penal law,we would normally be bound by how the new york court of appeals has interpreted and.see johnson,at.if the new york court of appeals has not ruled on a particular question,however,the decisions of new york state appellate division are helpful indicators for ascertaining how the court would rule,and we can not disregard such decisions unless we are convinced by other persuasive data that the new york court of appeals would decide otherwise.michalski home depot,cir.
the new york court of appeals has not ruled on whether the force supporting a robbery conviction can be less than violent.decisions of the lower courts,however,have made clear that forcible stealing alone does not necessarily involve the use of violent force.appellate division decisions have held that the requisite force can be established by evidence that the defendant and three others formed a human wall that blocked the victim path as the victim attempted to pursue someone who had picked his pocket,allowing the robber to get away,people bennett,app.div.dep t evidence that the defendant bumped his unidentified victim,took money,and fled while another forcibly blocked the victim pursuit,people lee,app.div.dep t or evidence that the store clerk grabbed the hand in which defendant was holding the money and the two tugged at each other until defendant hand slipped out of the glove holding the money,people safon,app.div.dep t.
it is immaterial that the defendants in bennett,lee,and safon were convicted of second and robbery rather than robbery.in new york,all degrees of robbery involve forcible stealing and are distinguished by the presence of other aggravating factors.compare penal law describing the force required for robbery in general,with id.listing the elements that make forcible stealing robbery.
because appellate division decisions have interpreted forcible stealing,so that it does not always involve force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another,johnson,at,and because we have no persuasive data that the new york court of appeals would decide otherwise,michalski,at,we are compelled to conclude in the wake of johnson that a new york robbery conviction involving forcible stealing,absent other aggravating factors,is no longer necessarily a conviction for a crime of violence within the meaning of the career offender guideline.
the question remains whether th
