in early,federal and local authorities commenced operation brickhouse to combat drug trafficking in the housing project located in jamaica plain,massachusetts.the investigation snared the appellants amos carrasquillo and nathan garrasteguy through a series of controlled drug purchases executed by a cooperating witness.faced with unshakable evidence of their illicit activities,the appellants pleaded guilty to several counts of distributing cocaine base,in violation of,and to conspiracy to distribute cocaine base,in violation of.the issue of the drug weights involved in the offenses,however,was reserved and tried to a jury 
after a trial,at which the appellants presented no evidence,the jury determined that the conspiracy involved between five and twenty grams of cocaine base.at sentencing,the judge accepted the government sentencing recommendation,declined to give carrasquillo any credit for acceptance of responsibility,and sentenced him to months of imprisonment followed by eight years of supervised release.garrasteguy received a sentence of ten years followed by twelve years of supervised release as a special condition of supervised release,the sentencing court prohibited the appellants from entering suffolk county,massachusetts during the term of his supervised release,without prejudice to their right to return to the sentencing court to seek revision or rescission of this special condition.see e.
carrasquillo appeals the denial of his acceptance of responsibility credit,and both appellants challenge the special condition of supervised release.we affirm.
acceptance of responsibility 
we begin with carrasquillo acceptance of responsibility argument,which,stripped to its essentials,is a request that he be permitted to run with the hares and hunt with the hounds.in concrete terms,carrasquillo believes that he is entitled to a two point reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to a despite having gone to trial regarding drug he pleaded guilty to the rest of the indictment.this claim fails.
during the rule plea colloquy,the district court advised both defendants of the possibility that if a jury concluded that they were responsible for drug weights sufficient to trigger enhanced penalties,it might not grant either of them any reduction for acceptance of responsibility.the court stated 
the court now,again,i do mean this in any way as a threat,you must understand that if we go to trial and if you lose,it more than five grams,and the government is put to the expense and time of the trial,there are situations,your lawyers will argue them to me,where i should still give some discount.and i have no hard and fast rule.but you understand that i be keeping in mind that we spent all the time and expense on a trial and you been found guilty of more than five grams.and i will take that into account.i think under the law i required to.
both defendants indicated that they understood the court warning.despite the court statement,the defendants proceeded to try to a jury the issue of drug weight.during the course of this trial,the defendants did nothing more than witnesses the defense rested at the close of the government case.within two hours of receiving the case,the jury returned a verdict finding the defendants responsible for at least five grams of cocaine base.
after trial,the probation department,in its report psr,included a recommendation that carrasquillo be given a reduction in the offense level pursuant to section a of the sentencing guidelines,bringing carrasquillo total offense level to.the government objected,arguing that carrasquillo demand for a jury trial on drug weight not only demonstrated a failure to accept responsibility for the full extent of his conduct,but also falsely denied the extent and nature of the relevant conduct.
at the sentencing hearing,carrasquillo reiterated his desire for the acceptance of responsibility reduction the sentencing court considered carrasquillo argument,but decided not to credit carrasquillo with any reduction of the total offense level based on acceptance of responsibility.the court rested its decision primarily on the fact that carrasquillo did not spare the government from the time and expense of a trial.in reaching this conclusion,the district court remarked that the acceptance of responsibility provision is an empty sophistry,that should be viewed as a discretionary reduction in the total offense level to reward defendants who spare the government the expense of a trial.what the acceptance of responsibility reduction is is a discount that is usually granted,it in my discretion for sparing the government expense.carrasquillo argument on appeal is that the sentencing court comments constitute a misinterpretation of the sentencing guidelines,and thus the sentencing court misapplied the guidelines.
we review a sentencing court determination of whether a defendant accepted responsibility for clear error.united states glaum,cir united states deppe,cir recognizing the special difficulty of discerning,on a cold record,whether a defendant expressions of remorse were in earnest,we review a sentencing court judgment about acceptance of responsibility for clear error.citing united states dethlefs,cir united states royer,cir,cmt.nevertheless,we continue to conduct a plenary review of any related legal questions,including the interpretation of the sentencing guidelines.deppe,at citing united states talladino,cir.
the sentencing guidelines recognize the legitimate societal interests in acceptance of responsibility and therefore allow sentencing judges to provide a measure of leniency to those defendants who accept responsibility for their actions.cmt.backg.the guidelines therefore dispense credit for acceptance of responsibility in two flavors a reduction at the discretion of the sentencing court if the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.a.and,if,in a serious offense,a defendant accepts responsibility at an early stage of the investigation,a defendant may be eligible for an additional one point reduction in the offense level.b.this second reduction is available only to defendants who accept responsibility early enough to save the government the time and expense of preparing for trial,and consequently,this further reduction is only available upon motion of the government.id.
defendants are not,however,automatically entitled to even the acceptance of responsibility reduction.united states,cir.the onus of proving acceptance of responsibility is on the defendant.id.defendant must demonstrate that he has taken full responsibility for his actions and he must do so candidly and with genuine contrition quoting united states saxena,cir.to prove acceptance of responsibility,a defendant must truthfully admit or not falsely deny the conduct comprising the conviction,as well as any additional relevant conduct for which he is accountable.glaum,at citing,cmt.a 
we have further held that defendants who proceed to trial and put the government to its proof normally do not qualify for any reduction for acceptance of responsibility.deppe,at see also,cmt.proceeding to trial,however,does not constitute a per se bar to credit for acceptance of responsibility.instead,proceeding to trial creates a rebuttable presumption that no credit is available.deppe,at.
carrasquillo argument is that his guilty than the in his conviction and that his testing of the government proof regarding drug weight should not alter the fact that in his guilty plea,he accepted responsibility for his actions.accordingly,he argues that the sentencing court description of the acceptance of responsibility credit as an empty sophistry and the court further characterization of the credit as an expense calculation demonstrates that the sentencing court misapplied the guidelines.
the government responds that carrasquillo challenge to the drug weight required it to introduce evidence regarding all of the elements of the crimes to which carrasquillo pleaded guilty.moreover,the government claims that the defendant rigorous challenge to the drug weight does not evince the candid acceptance of responsibility with genuine contrition that is a prerequisite to receiving a reduction.see,at.
in the circumstances of this case,we agree with the government and with the sentencing court implicit finding that carrasquillo failed to demonstrate acceptance of responsibility.he went to trial,and yet,he has adduced no evidence to rebut the presumption that his trial with respect to drug weight rendered him ineligible for any acceptance of reduction,nor has he so much as argued against the presumption.furthermore,his actions in requesting a trial regarding drug weight were not consistent with acceptance of responsibility for relevant conduct.see glaum,at sentencing court did not clearly err where it denied acceptance of responsibility reduction to defendant who offered to plead guilty to conspiracy involving lesser quantum of drugs.see also,united states acosta,cir affirming district court denial of acceptance of responsibility reduction where defendant who pleaded guilty challenged certain factual assertions in psr united states annis,cir affirming district court denial of acceptance of responsibility reduction where defendant pleaded guilty to offense but refused to admit to any drug quantity and challenged reliability of prior statement to authorities.
in a final attempt to gain traction,carrasquillo argues that the sentencing court characterizations of the acceptance of responsibility reduction suggest that the court did not properly apply this provision of the guidelines.
the acceptance of responsibility reduction acknowledges legitimate societal interests,backg.the provision also recognizes the longstanding judicial practice of more leniently sentencing defendants who evidence contrition and cooperate with law enforcement.see united states frazier,cir.as has been said,acceptance of responsibility provisions recognize and support varied societal interests including the reduction of crime,restitution,early withdrawal from criminal activity,the increased potential for rehabilitation among those who feel and show true remorse for their act,as well as encouraging judicial and law enforcement economy.id.at citing united states belgard.thus,the acceptance of responsibility determination does not necessarily reduce to merely an expense calculation,but rather can serve several important societal interests.
as we have noted,the sentencing court did consider the fact that carrasquillo pleaded guilty,but also balanced that plea against carrasquillo pressing of the drug weight issue at trial,in which he challenged the evidence against him.based on this balancing,the court concluded that carrasquillo was not entitled to any credit for acceptance of responsibility regardless of whether the sentencing court acknowledged all of the varied interests recognized by the acceptance of responsibility credit,the court nevertheless properly denied the credit to carrasquillo.
ii.exclusion from suffolk county 
we now turn to the issue whether the sentencing court could impose a condition of supervised release that prohibited the defendants from entering an entire county during the full term of supervised release.the breadth and duration of this condition give us pause,but on this record we are unable to conclude that the district court plainly erred in imposing the special condition.
we review a sentencing court decision to impose special conditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion.united states riccio,cir.if,however,a defendant has an opportunity to object to a special condition at sentencing,and stays silent,we review the imposition of a supervised release condition for plain error only.united states padilla,cir en banc united states,cir riccio,at.
carrasquillo claims that he properly preserved his objection to the special condition of supervised release the government originally requested,in its sentencing memorandum,a special condition of supervised release ordering both defendants to stay outside the city of boston in his sentencing memorandum,carrasquillo objected to the government proposed condition primarily on constitutional grounds,claiming that the condition would impermissibly impinge on unspecified rights protected under the first,fifth,and eighth amendments to the constitution,and that the condition would preclude carrasquillo from being fully involved in raising his young son.
at sentencing,however,the district court appeared far more interested in the special condition of supervised release than carrasquillo.the district court sua sponte noted that it was not familiar with such conditions,and engaged in a dialogue regarding the condition with not only the prosecutor,but also a representative of the probation department to satisfy itself that the condition was reasonable and enforceable.
by contrast,at sentencing,carrasquillo mentioned the special condition only in passing,and when he did discuss it he noted that the condition was unimportant 
the other thing i would just comment on very briefly is this issue of whether or not to be in boston or not be in boston.winning that from our standpoint and not getting what we looking for in terms of the length of incarceration would be a pyrrhic victory.it unimportant compared to the amount of time 
carrasquillo counsel specifically termed the condition unimportant and remained focused on seeking a reduction in his sentence.this amounted to at least a forfeiture of the objection,if not an outright abandonment of it.see united states walker,cir describing difference between waiver and forfeiture.carrasquillo made a strategic decision in making his presentation to the sentencing judge he focused his efforts on obtaining a lower sentence.in so doing,he essentially left his objections regarding this condition of supervised release by the wayside.
moreover,even though the defendants now argue that the special condition geographic scope all of suffolk county was impermissibly broad,neither of them advanced a narrower area of exclusion to the sentencing court.similarly,the defendants were entirely silent regarding the particulars of this condition,including the availability of exceptions,as well as the scope and breadth of the condition.consequently,the sentencing court did not have the opportunity to evaluate alternatives that might make the exclusion more acceptable.it would be both unfair and an inappropriate deployment of limited judicial resources to permit the defendants to raise such specific concerns on appeal.united states dietz,cir holding that defendant can not challenge a district court ruling at sentencing with an argument not raised below in the papers or at sentencing.consequently,we review the condition for plain error only.
district courts have significant flexibility to impose special conditions of supervised release.a district court may impose as a condition of supervised release most discretionary conditions identified in b or any other condition the court deems appropriate.all such conditions,however,must be reasonably related to the factors set forth in a may involve no greater deprivation of liberty than reasonably necessary to achieve the purposes of a c,a d,viz.to protect the public and promote the rehabilitation of the defendant,and must be consistent with any pertinent policy statement of the united states sentencing commission.d see also united states york,cir.
any conditions of supervised release that a sentencing court chooses to impose must,of course,be supported by the record.united states scherrer,cir en banc.but this requirement can be satisfied without a written or oral explanation of the reasons supporting the condition if we can infer the court reasoning by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the report with what the court did.united states,cir en banc.
the government advanced several reasons for excluding the defendants from the city of boston.the government noted that the project is a refuge of affordable housing for families of modest means,and that it has been beset with an exceedingly high level of gun and drug crimes.the government argues that the sentencing court,pursuant to sections a and a c,properly took into account the effects of the defen
