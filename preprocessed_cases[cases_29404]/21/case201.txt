in this sentencing appeal,jean fernández garay complains that his month sentence is both procedurally and substantively flawed.finding his complaints untenable,we affirm.
the events culminating in this appeal are embedded in a indictment returned by a federal grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico,which alleged that the defendant had possessed with intent to distribute various controlled substances near a public housing facility,see a,a,and had possessed a firearm during and in relation to those crimes,see c a.on the cusp of trial,the defendant negotiated a plea agreement the agreement with the government.in pursuance of the agreement,he entered a guilty plea to a single count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime an offense that carries a mandatory minimum sentence of months imprisonment.see id.c a i.the other charges were later dismissed.
in the agreement,the defendant acceded to the government version of the facts.according to that account,federal agents and officers from the puerto rico police department prpd were patrolling a known drug point located in the sabana abajo public housing project in carolina,puerto rico.at one point,an officer engaged in a chase encountered the defendant,who was masked and holding a caliber glock pistol in one hand and a backpack in the other.the defendant ditched the gun and tried to flee,but he was soon apprehended.
upon inspection,the gun was found to be loaded with an extended magazine.the backpack was found to contain an additional extended magazine,varying quantities of assorted drugs,and in cash.
the presentence investigation report psi report augmented the government version of the facts.pertinently,the psi report noted that,before fleeing,the defendant pointed his gun at the prpd officer and threw the backpack at him.the report also more fully inventoried the contents of the backpack in addition to the extended magazine and cash previously mentioned,the backpack contained small baggies of marijuana,small baggies of cocaine,packages of heroin,packages of crack,and three pills of indeterminate origin.
at the disposition hearing and in conformity with the agreement,the parties jointly recommended a month sentence.the district court proceeded to chronicle the relevant facts,relying mainly on the psi report.the court added that the defendant,at the time of his arrest,had in his possession a notebook that memorialized various drug sales.when all was said and done,the court sentenced the defendant to a month term of immurement double the mandatory minimum.
after the district court handed down the sentence,defense counsel began to object to the court reliance on the fact that the defendant had pointed his weapon at an officer.the court cut off counsel argument and then denied his request to complete the record.this timely appeal ensued 
in sentencing appeals,we first determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally reasonable and then determine whether it is substantively reasonable.united states clogston,cir.with respect to claims of procedural error,we afford de novo review to the interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines,evaluate the sentencing court factfinding for clear error,and assay its judgment calls for abuse of discretion.see gall united states,united states flores machicote,cir.when assessing the substantive reasonableness of a sentence,our review is for abuse of discretion and takes into account the totality of the circumstances.see gall,at united states martin,cir.
these standards of review may be altered by a party failure to preserve claims of error in the district court.with respect to unpreserved claims,appellate review is normally for plain error.see united states duarte,cir.
here,however,there is a wrinkle.a party failure to spell out a claim in the district court may be excused if he had no reasonable opportunity to do so.see.b.this makes good sense a court should not require a lawyer to persist stubbornly when the judge has made it perfectly clear that he does not wish to hear what the lawyer has to say.united states toribio lugo,cir.
this exception is applicable here.at the conclusion of the disposition hearing,defense counsel attempted to object to the court reliance on a particular fact.the court cut defense counsel argument short,precluded further argument,and did not allow the lawyer to complete the record.we do not condone a district court acting in so peremptory a manner.as a result of the court action,we can not tell whether defense counsel would have sought to interpose further objections.what is transparently clear,however,is that the court abrupt termination of the sentencing proceeding foreclosed defense counsel from doing so.we therefore treat all the defendant claims of error as preserved.
having clarified our standard of review,we move to the issues on appeal.the defendant couches his assault on his sentence as a challenge to its substantive reasonableness.it is plain,however,that his argument is more nuanced.read carefully,he advances four claims of procedural error as well as an overall plaint about the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.we subdivide our analysis accordingly.
two of the defendant procedural claims are related he argues that the sentencing court erroneously took into account two facts that lacked adequate footing in the record.the first fact is that the defendant had pointed his gun at an officer.the second fact is the court reference to a notebook,which it said contained a record of drug sales.
the first of these claims is hopeless.although the government version of the facts did not contain a description of the defendant pointing his gun at a prpd officer,the psi report did contain such a description.generally,a psi report bears sufficient indicia of reliability to permit the district court to rely on it at sentencing.united states cyr,cir internal quotation marks omitted.it follows that a sentencing court may base a finding on a fact asserted in a psi report as long as no objection has seasonably been made to that assertion.see united states gallant,cir united states diaz villafane,cir see also.i a.
objections to a psi report ordinarily must be made before the commencement of the disposition hearing.see.f requiring parties to object within days of receipt of the psi report.in this case,the defendant did not file a timely objection to the psi report assertion that he pointed his gun at a police officer.consequently,the sentencing court could properly find this fact based on the account contained in the psi report.
the sentencing court reference to the notebook is a horse of a different hue.the genesis of the court comment is uncertain the only record reference to such a notebook is contained in a cryptic notice of intent to use evidence filed during the period of skirmishing that preceded the defendant change of plea.see.b.the notebook itself is not part of the record its contents are nowhere described and both the agreement and the psi report are mute on the subject.
it is common ground that a defendant must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to respond to the facts used against him at sentencing.see united states millán isaac,cir see also ussg a.to ensure that opportunity,a judge should refrain from pulling sentencing facts like so many rabbits out of so many hats from beyond the sentencing record.
here,the sentencing court palpably erred by alluding to a purported fact the notebook and its content as to which the defendant had no notice.still,not every error demands vacation of a sentence an error is deemed harmless if a reviewing court can say with fair assurance that the sentencing court would have imposed the same sentence even without the error.united states tavares,cir internal quotation mark omitted citing williams united states,see.a.
in this instance,the notebook seems little more than an afterthought in the court explication of the sentence.and given the varieties and quantities of drugs contained in the defendant backpack,any mention of drug sales in a notebook was obviously cumulative.see,united states anderson,cir.because the record gives us complete confidence that the
