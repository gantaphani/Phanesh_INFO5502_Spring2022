background 
bennett pled guilty to an information charging him with one count of possession of child pornography under a b.investigators with the department of homeland security dhs identified bennett as part of a larger investigation into the distribution of child pornography via the internet.in particular,dhs was investigating services,which allow users to download files stored on other users computers via the internet.on november,an undercover agent contacted bennett through the network gigatribe and requested access to the files stored on 
bennett computer.bennett provided the password which was fun,and the agent downloaded six videos from bennett computer that contained child pornography.the undercover officer used software to determine the internet protocol address of bennett computer,which was then used to identify bennett residence.
the offense conduct.on february,dhs agents executed a warrant to search bennett manhattan apartment for child pornography.the agents seized bennett computer,which was later found to contain still images of child pornography and approximately videos of child pornography.these images and videos included graphic depictions of adult men engaging in oral and anal intercourse with prepubescent boys.forensic analysis of bennett computer also established that he had shared his password approximately times with approximately different users on gigatribe.
in many cases,bennett shared his password with other users in exchange for their passwords,or exchanges.for instance,bennett engaged in one such exchange with another user

bennett was arrested and charged with the receipt and distribution of child pornography,in violation of a,in addition to possession of child pornography,in violation of a b.on march,however,bennett waived indictment and consented to the filing of an information that charged him solely with the possession count.and,on september,bennett pled guilty before the district court sullivan,to the possession count of the information.
the psr.the presentence report psr prepared by the probation office determined the guidelines range to be months to months imprisonment.in calculating this range,the psr found that the base offense level was and applied the following sentencing enhancements a increase because bennett possessed pornography that involved a prepubescent minor or a minor who had not attained the age of years a increase because the offense involved distribution other than distribution described in subsections a through e of b a four level increase because bennett possessed pornography that involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence a increase because the offense involved the use of a computer or an interactive computer service and a increase because the offense involved or more images.psr.this resulted in an adjusted offense level of,which was reduced by three levels for acceptance of responsibility for a total offense level of.
the total offense level of,together with bennett criminal history category of i,resulted in a guidelines range of months to months imprisonment.but,because the maximum was limited by the statutory maximum of months imprisonment,the probation office found that the guidelines counseled a term of imprisonment of to months.
the psr also detailed bennett difficult upbringing.his father physically abused his mother and frequently took bennett,from about the age of five,to brothels,strip clubs and sex shops in baltimore.although bennett mother left his father when bennett was five years old,bennett continued to see his father after the divorce.this typically occurred while his father was in the company of women or consuming alcohol.moreover,when he was seven years old,bennett was sexually molested by a male babysitter.these experiences led him to be focused on and engage in sexual behavior from an extremely early age.such behavior continued throughout high school and college.
after finishing law school,during a period of depression,he began to use gigatribe to view a broad range of pornography,including bestiality,group sex,and child pornography.on this basis,bennett psychiatric expert concluded that his interest in child pornography was not a product of a real predilection for minors but rather was borne out of his own experiences with childhood sexual behavior and represents an unresolved psychological matter that can be addressed through psychotherapy.psr.
despite this troubled and,specifically,sexually troubled background,bennett was tremendously successful.after high school,bennett attended morehouse college,from which he graduated as valedictorian.he then went to the harvard law school,graduating in as a class marshal.bennett was,however,unable to find a legal job after graduating from law school and became severely depressed as a result.he briefly sought treatment at harlem hospital,where he was diagnosed with depression and bipolar disorder with manic depression and schizophrenia and was prescribed seroquel for insomnia.bennett did find a job as an adjunct professor of criminal justice at asa college in brooklyn,where he worked from early until late.he then began work as a substitute and adjunct professor at borough of manhattan community college.this job continued until his sentencing.
the psr ultimately recommended a guidelines sentence of months imprisonment.this was based,in part,on skepticism toward the conclusions of bennett psychiatric expert that bennett was not sexually attracted to minors and should not be diagnosed with pedophilia.the recommendation also demonstrated the serious concerns of the probation office about bennett risk to and his ability to be safely managed in the community.id.at.
the sentencing submissions.on december,bennett submitted a sentencing letter that requested a sentence of three years probation.the submission argued that this sentence was appropriate given bennett unusual promise and success,especially in light of his childhood,bennett traumatic sexual history,which suggested that bennett did not pose any danger to the community,and bennett abstention from viewing child pornography after his computer had been seized by agents in february.on this basis,bennett,and the expert who supported his submission,argued that he was an excellent candidate for supervision,treatment and rehabilitation.app.bennett did not challenge the psr calculation of his guidelines range.
on december,the government,in its own sentencing submission,agreed that a sentence was appropriate for essentially the same reasons advanced by bennett,but asked for a significant incarceratory sentence given the seriousness of the offense conduct.app.moreover,as to the calculation of the guidelines range,the government argued that a enhancement under b b,instead of the enhancement under b f,applied.this was because distribution for the receipt,or expectation of receipt,of a thing of value,but not for pecuniary gain,instead of simple distribution,was involved.the more significant enhancement was appropriate,the government contended,because bennett gave his password to others in anticipation of receiving their passwords in turn,so that bennett could gain access to other user shared folders and the child pornography contained therein.app.
the sentencing.bennett was sentenced by the district court on december.after summarizing the materials received and confirming that there were no objections to the facts presented in the psr,the district court turned to the calculation of the guidelines range.in particular,the district court found that bennett interactions with users on the site where there was an exchange of passwords,after a brief exchange as to the interests of the users,app.warranted the imposition of the enhancement under b b.this resulted in a total offense level of and,based on this,the district court found 
there no dispute that bennett is in criminal history category i,so according to the guidelines,the range is to.that about years to years or so.so to years,which is a long time.
after hearing argument from bennett and the government,the district court went on to impose sentence 
the maximum here is ten,the guidelines are to.i not moved by that.i think it worth noting just because i required to note it,but from the moment i read the facts of this case,it seemed to me that eight to ten is not inappropriate,to is not inappropriate.it not that i callous,it not that i have no sense as to what that time means to a young man like you who has so much promise,but it that the penalty has to send a message of moral outrage and a message of conviction that children matter.
so,look,i have to credit the goodness in you.the fact that i do think you a predator,you are distinguishable from many other defendants who are charged with crimes like this,i prepared to come down below the guidelines,down below the statutory maximum of ten,which would be within the guidelines range,but it seems to me that a sentence of seven years is as low as i can go without insulting the victims in this crime.
app.the district court then imposed a sentence of seven years incarceration,to be followed by five years of supervised release.the district court also ordered special assessment of.
bennett appealed.
discussion 
bennett principal contention on appeal is that the district court erred in applying a enhancement for distribution for the receipt,or expectation of receipt,of a thing of value under b b.we ultimately conclude that this enhancement was warranted in bennett case.but we also hold that the district court incorrectly calculated the applicable guidelines range by failing to recognize that the guidelines range was reduced to the statutory maximum under a.
we review sentences using a deferential standard.united states cavera,cir.en banc internal quotation marks omitted.this review has both procedural and substantive components.id.first,we scrutinize whether the district court has committed significant procedural error,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence gall united states.an error applying the guidelines is a legal error and,as a result,is reviewed de novo.united states broxmeyer.cir.then,if there are no such procedural errors,we proceed to assess whether the sentence was substantively reasonable.gall,at.
bennett did not challenge the calculation of the guidelines range under a at the district court.accordingly,we review any such challenges for plain error.united states.this requires there to be an error,that is plain that is to say,clear or obvious,and which affected substantial rights.id.in turn,for an error to affect substantial rights,there must be a reasonable probability that,but for the error,the outcome of the proceeding would be different.id.internal quotation marks omitted.we then exercise our discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.internal quotation marks omitted.that said,the standard is applied less stringently in the sentencing context,where the cost of correcting an unpreserved error is not as great as in the trial context.united states gamez,cir.per curiam.
bennett contends that the district court erred in applying the increase under b b because bennett conduct did not amount to anything more than simple fire sharing,and therefore did not constitute any particular exchange.appellant br.we disagree.
section b b requires the application of a increase if a defendant offense involved d istribution for the receipt,or expectation of receipt,of a thing of value,but not for pecuniary gain.application note to that guideline clarifies that this type of distribution encompasses any transaction,including bartering or other transaction,that is conducted for a thing of value,but not for profit.cmt.the note defines a thing of value,in turn,as anything of valuable consideration,including child pornographic material received in exchange for other child pornographic material bartered in consideration for the material received.id.
if a defendant conduct involves distribution not for the receipt,or expectation of receipt,of a thing of value,and does not otherwise implicate any of the other forms of aggravated distribution enumerated in b a,c,d,or e,a increase is applied for simple distribution under b f.the government does not contend that bennett conduct implicates any of these other forms of aggravated distribution.accordingly,the question before us is whether bennett use of software involves distribution for the receipt,or expectation of receipt,of other child pornography.if so,the district court correctly applied a increase if not,a increase was appropriate.
we have not addressed whether the use of technology can trigger the enhancement under section b b,and if so,in what circumstances it is triggered the fifth and eighth circuits have held that an agreement to distribute child pornography in exchange for other child pornography is inherent in the knowing use of programs to obtain and make available child pornography.united states groce,cir.united states griffin,cir.we now hold that b b enhancement applies to a defendant who downloads and shares child pornography files via an internet network,as these networks exist for users to share,swap,barter,or trade files between one another.other circuits have rejected such a per se rule,and instead have looked to the defendant particular use of file sharing to determine whether an expectation of receipt existed.united states hernandez,cir.united states mcmanus,cir.united states spriggs,cir.united states geiner,cir.
we decline to adopt the reasoning of those courts that have found that any use of file sharing triggers the enhancement.some individuals undo
