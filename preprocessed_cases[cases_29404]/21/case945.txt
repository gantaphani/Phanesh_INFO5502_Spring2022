john meada was arrested and indicted on weapons possession charges after police discovered firearms and ammunition in his home during a warrantless search.before trial,meada moved to suppress all of the evidence that police had discovered in his apartment.after several evidentiary hearings,the trial court granted meada motion with regard to grenades found in an ammunition can but ruled that other firearms and ammunition were admissible because they were either in a location meada girlfriend consented to be searched or were in a container in plain sight that betrayed its contents.meada entered a conditional guilty plea but preserved the right to challenge the suppression ruling on appeal,which he now does.he also challenges his sentence.we affirm the denial of meada motion to suppress but vacate his sentence in light of united states booker,d,and remand for the limited purpose of resentencing.
we take the following facts from the district court findings,drawing on the record for additional facts as necessary.on january,carol bowering went to the hanover,massachusetts police department to inquire about obtaining a restraining order against john meada,her boyfriend,who she claimed had recently been violent toward her.bowering sought to collect personal belongings that she brought to meada apartment while living there with him since november.a police officer instructed her to apply for a restraining order at the hingham district court,and she did so.
bowering returned to the hanover police department with her restraining order later that afternoon.she told the officer on duty,stephen moar,that she had lived with meada for approximately two months and that she kept clothing and a cat at his apartment.moar inquired for purposes whether there were any weapons in the apartment.bowering answered that meada had two long guns and one handgun,specifying their locations in the apartment.upon running a criminal history check on meada,moar discovered that he had a criminal record and did not have a license to carry a firearm.moar and another officer,gregg nihan,then accompanied bowering to meada apartment to collect her belongings.
meada was not home when bowering and the officers reached the apartment.bowering led the officers into the unit that meada shared with his relative,barbara valentonis,and through the unlocked door to meada apartment.she indicated a bb gun and pellet rifle in plain view in the entryway and living room,and then pointed to a kitchen cabinet where she said meada kept another gun.upon opening the cabinet,nihan found a caliber wooden handled handgun,several boxes of ammunition,and what he and moar recognized as an ammunition can,a metal container commonly used to store ammunition.nihan opened the can without asking bowering permission to do so.he discovered two grenades inside.
moar then accompanied bowering into the bedroom where her personal belongings were stored.a case labeled gun guard stood upright in the bedroom in plain view it was fastened but not locked.without asking bowering for permission,moar placed the case on the bed and opened it.he discovered three guns inside one shotgun,one caliber handgun and one caliber winchester rifle.meada returned home soon thereafter.moar served him with the restraining order outside the apartment,placed him under arrest for weapons violations,and instructed him to wait in a police car while the officers finished their search and bowering collected the rest of her possessions.
meada was subsequently indicted on three weapons charges.count one of the indictment charged him with being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition,g.counts two and three charged him with possession of an unregistered firearm,d,with count two based on the shotgun,and count three based on the grenades in response,meada moved to suppress all of the evidence seized from his apartment,contending that the warrantless search violated his fourth amendment rights.
at a suppression hearing on february,the government presented several witnesses including bowering,moar,and nihan.bowering testified about her relationship with meada and her activities on the day of the search.moar and nihan testified about the search itself,including the basis for their belief that bowering lived in the apartment and had authority to consent to a search of it.first,bowering appeared to be more than a casual visitor because she kept clothing and her cat at the apartment and because she asserted that she would be able to enter the apartment in meada absence without a key.moar also testified that he had driven by meada apartment numerous times between and midnight during november and december because meada was a suspect in an unrelated investigation,and that bowering red firebird was regularly parked there.meada then presented valentonis,his sole witness.she testified that bowering visited the apartment several times a week but that she had never seen bowering there without meada.
following the testimony,the court denied meada motion with regard to the handgun and ammunition discovered in the kitchen cabinet,finding that the officers reasonably believed bowering had authority to consent,and that she had actual authority to consent,to a search of the apartment that included the cabinet.the court reserved judgment on items found in the ammunition can and gun case,allowing additional briefing on the admissibility of items seized from closed containers.
on june,the court held another hearing at which meada and his friend daniel marshalsea testified pursuant to a motion to reopen.meada claimed that bowering had never lived with him,that he always locked his apartment door but that the lock had been jimmied open on the day of the search,that the weapons were not his but rather belonged to another man who had briefly stayed in his apartment,and that he did not store the guns or the gun guard case in plain sight.marshalsea testified that bowering had come to meada apartment only once or twice a week and that her relationship with meada was not sexual.the court rejected both meada and marshalsea testimony,which conflicted with that offered by bowering,the police,and even meada own witness,valentonis,and found that meada had taken this occasion to commit perjury.the court then repeated its earlier ruling that the handgun and ammunition discovered in the kitchen cabinet were admissible.
at a third hearing on june,the court granted in part and denied in part meada motion to suppress the weapons found in the ammunition can and the gun case that ruling was reflected in a written order issued on august.distinguishing between the areas of the apartment to which bowering had access,and these containers,to which she did not,the court noted that c onsent to search a dwelling is not necessarily coterminous with consent to search closed containers within it.nonetheless,the court concluded that the firearms found in the gun case were admissible.it reasoned that the gun guard case constructively constituted at least one gun in plain view in the bedroom because the label betrayed the container contents.meada thus had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the case and could not challenge that aspect of the search.
by contrast,the court concluded that meada did have a privacy expectation in the ammunition can because its outward appearance did not reveal that it contained grenades.the court found that bowering did not consent to a search of the can,nor could the police reasonably have believed she had authority to consent to such a search in light of her initial indication that she did not own any of the weapons in the apartment.because the court also found that the inevitable discovery doctrine did not apply,it granted meada motion to suppress the grenades 
following the court evidentiary rulings,meada entered a conditional guilty plea to counts one and two of the indictment.count three of the indictment,involving the grenades,was dismissed.the court then sentenced meada to months imprisonment.this sentence reflected a guidelines calculation that included a enhancement for obstruction of justice,because of the court finding that meada committed perjury at the june suppression hearing.the court rejected meada argument that a reduction for acceptance of responsibility was appropriate under,concluding that in light of meada ongoing insistence that the weapons found in the apartment were not his,t his is not a case where meada attempted to obstruct justice and has reformed.this is a case in which he continuing the misconduct that caused me to find in june that he had committed perjury.
meada now appeals,exercising the right he preserved below to challenge the court evidentiary rulings.first,he argues that bowering did not have actual authority to consent to a search of the apartment,nor was it reasonable for the police to believe that she had such authority.he further asserts that the court should have suppressed the three firearms found in the gun case for the same reasons that it suppressed the grenades discovered in the ammunition can.meada also appeals his sentence,challenging both the obstruction of justice enhancement and the court refusal to adjust the sentence downward for acceptance of responsibility.finally,he contends that he is entitled to be resentenced in light of united states booker,d.
a.the fourth amendment 
this court reviews a district court legal conclusions involved in denying a motion to suppress the evidence de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.united states marshall,cir.our deferential review of the court factual findings reflects our awareness that the trial judge,who hears the testimony,observes the witnesses demeanor and evaluates the facts first hand,sits in the best position to determine what actually happened.united states charles,cir quoting united states young,cir.
the fourth amendment generally requires the police to obtain a warrant before entering and searching a person home.see united states beaudoin,cir,cert.denied,d a warrantless search involving an intrusion into someone home is presumptively unreasonable under the fourth amendment.however,this rule is not absolute the supreme court has recognized that warrantless searches do not offend the fourth amendment under certain circumstances.for example,police need not seek a warrant where voluntary consent has been obtained,either from the individual whose property is searched,or from a third party who possesses common authority over the premises.illinois rodriguez,d internal citations omitted.
bowering consent to search the apartment 
the district court held that the search of meada apartment was constitutional under the consent exception to the fourth amendment warrant requirement.specifically,the court found that bowering consented to the search and that she had authority to do so by virtue of having lived with meada for two months.although meada disputes whether any actual authority bowering had extended to admitting third parties to the apartment,we need not address that question here rather,we affirm solely on the alternate basis offered by the district court e ven if bowering did not actually have the authority to consent to the search,it was objectively reasonable for the law enforcement officials to believe that she did.this apparent authority rationale is sufficient to immunize the search from constitutional attack regardless of whether bowering had actual authority to consent.rodriguez,at.the constitution is no more violated when officers enter without a warrant because they reasonably though erroneously believe that the person who has consented to their entry is a resident of the premises,than it is violated when they enter without a warrant because they reasonably though erroneously believe they are in pursuit of a violent felon who is about to escape.
as the supreme court has explained,the consent of one who possesses common authority over premises or effects is valid as against the absent,nonconsenting person with whom that authority is shared.united states matlock,d.common authority rests on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes id.at.even if a person does not in fact have such authority,police may rely on her consent if they reasonably believe that she has such authority.the court set forth the standard for this reasonable belief in illinois rodriguez 
l aw enforcement officers may not always accept a person invitation to enter premises.even when the invitation is accompanied by an explicit assertion that the person lives there,the surrounding circumstances could conceivably be such that a reasonable person would doubt its truth and not act upon it without further inquiry.as with other factual determinations bearing upon search and seizure,determination of consent to enter must be judged against an objective standard would the facts available to the officer at the moment warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the consenting party had authority over the premises

here,the district court pointed to numerous circumstances supporting a reasonable belief by the officers that bowering had joint access to the apartment such that she could consent to a search.bowering told the officers that she kept personal possessions,including several changes of clothing,a photograph of her daughter,and her cat,at the apartment.she asserted that she could enter the apartment in meada absence.her claim to have lived with meada was also consistent with moar independent knowledge that her car had been parked in front of the apartment several evenings a week during the relevant time frame.thus,the officers were not merely acting on an unsubstantiated assertion that bowering had joint access to the apartment,but rather on the totality of the circumstances that supported such an assertion.
meada contends that,to the contrary,the circumstances did not support the officer belief that bowering had common authority over the apartment.he analogizes this case to rodriguez,in which the supreme court found that a woman who had previously lived with the defendant but later moved out did not have the authority to consent to a search of his apartment.at.there,the court noted that gail fischer,the consenting party,no longer lived in the apartment at the time of the search,that her name was not on the lease,and that she did not pay rent.although fischer had a key to the apartment,she had obtained it without the defendant permission.meada stresses that bowering,like fischer,had another residence and had not been given a key by the apartment owner.
in rejecting meada argument,we note that rodriguez factual inquiry was limited to the issue of actual authority.the lower court in rodriguez did not reach the question of whether the officers had an objectively reasonable belief that the person granting access to the premises had authority over those premises because it erroneously ruled that,as a matter of law,reasonable belief could not validate entry.at.the supreme court remanded so that the lower court could determine whether the officers had such a reasonable belief.id.because we affirm the district court denial of the suppression motion on the grounds that,in the officers perception,bowering had apparent authority to invite them into the apartment,it makes no difference whether in fact she possessed any more legitimate claim of authority than fischer in the rodriguez case.what matters is whether,based on the information in the officers possession,they reasonably believed that bowering had authority to invite them into the apartment.
focusing on bowering authority as it appeared to the officers,meada contends that because they knew she was seeking a restraining order against meada and intended to move out,the officers could not have reasonably believed she still had authority to invite them into the apartment.we disagree.so far as the officers knew,bowering had not told meada of the restraining order.she told them she had been living at the apartment for two months and still had her personal belongings including her cat there.under the totality of the circumstances,it was objectively reasonable for the police to believe that bowering retained mutual use of the property and thus could consent to a
