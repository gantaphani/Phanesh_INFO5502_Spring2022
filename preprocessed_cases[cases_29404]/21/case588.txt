this sentencing appeal primarily raises the question of what evidence is sufficient to establish that the defendant held a position of trust for purposes of to support the imposition of a sentencing enhancement.
defendant karen sicher,who was the sole employee of a surgeon and the charitable foundation for children medical care he started,pled guilty to ten counts of uttering forged securities,in violation of,ten counts of health care program theft,in violation of,and six counts of income tax evasion,in violation of.the district court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment on each count to be served concurrently,followed by months of supervised release,and restitution in the amount of.
sicher challenges her sentence on two grounds.first,she contends that the district erred in imposing a sentencing enhancement for abuse of a position of trust.that enhancement increased her guidelines sentencing range from to months to to months.second,she argues the district court failed to consider evidence of her mental health,which she claims merits a downward variance.finding no error,we affirm.
the following evidence was part of the record before the district court at sentencing.the district court at sentencing is entitled to draw fair inference s,united states,cir,from the evidence before it united states marceau,cir a sentencing court is entitled to rely on circumstantial evidence and draw plausible inferences therefrom.internal citations omitted.
for ten years,sicher worked as an administrative assistant and secretary to david walton,a surgeon in ophthalmology specializing in children glaucoma,a leading cause of blindness for infants and toddlers.walton was a busy and focused surgeon who had a heavy load of clinical duties and significant teaching responsibilities at harvard medical school,where he was a professor of ophthalmology.he spent long hours tending to his medical responsibilities 
walton relied heavily upon the defendant,his sole employee and trusted representative,to run his medical office while he focused on these other demands.indeed,sicher perceived herself as having essential managerial responsibilities.she told the government in interviews that she took care of walton on a basis and that,for example,walton did not know how to use an atm.utilizing her position as his assistant,sicher stole at least from payments to his medical practice.
in addition,sicher played a second role which is particularly significant to the question of whether the enhancement was correctly applied.for seven of those ten years,for an additional monthly payment,she also handled all administrative tasks for the children glaucoma foundation cgf.cgf was a organized by walton initially and dedicated to supporting programs for children glaucoma sufferers.the organization raises money and provides grants in support of programs to increase awareness of children glaucoma,two university based research studies on childhood glaucoma,and support of physician training in the care of affected children.the record before us does not show how many funds were raised for cgf,but the records show sicher stole approximately of those funds.many families whose children were treated by walton also devoted their financial and personal energies to supporting cgf.
the foundation had only two functions fundraising and distributing the funds it raised through grants.only two people were involved in the management of cgf walton and sicher.as said,walton spent almost all of his time and energies in providing medical treatment to his patients,as well as fulfilling his academic and teaching responsibilities.this meant that the other responsibilities for cgf,particularly the management of fundraisers,fell largely on sicher.
sicher dual job responsibilities 
hired in,sicher was walton sole employee and was responsible for managing his medical practice.her job responsibilities in walton practice included welcoming patients,scheduling appointments,doing the bookkeeping,accepting and depositing and medical reimbursement checks,and receiving the practice bank account statements.while he was busy providing medical services,walton relied on the defendant,his trusted representative in the office environment,to manage all the financial and administrative functions of the office.through her position,she became personally close with many of the families of walton patients.
in,upon the founding of cgf,walton asked sicher to take on all administrative responsibilities for cgf.her formal duties included accepting and depositing donations for cgf,informing walton of any donations,and opening and reviewing cgf monthly bank statements.in practice,sicher activities went well beyond her formal duties.her duties were essential to the management of cgf she effectively acted as the director of cgf.as said,walton did not perform these tasks.she was the face of cgf,together with walton,because of her active role at fundraisers and personal relationships with members of the foundation.the psr also makes clear that she was very visible and took an active role in certain fundraising events by selling tickets,playing host during the events and performing a meet and greet.she also acted as the point person for the cgf annual charity golf tournament,working closely with a sports celebrity.this very visible role she played over a number of years was not that of a person performing ordinary clerical duties.
she did not merely accept monies raised by the foundation and act as the keeper of the accounts and books.there is evidence she was engaged with persons who did fundraising activities for cgf and then stole the money they had raised.she was installed in a position in which she developed significant relationships with the families and was the point of contact for fundraising events.for example,a former cgf board member and parent of two patients testified that it was sicher who gave her two daughters,then and years old,wrist bands to sell in their neighborhood in connecticut as a fundraising effort.the girls went,raising in cash,which they gave to the defendant in a plastic bag.the defendant then took the money.
moreover,in at least one instance sicher was engaged with a family having a fundraising event about which walton knew nothing.a former cgf board member testified that she had held a fundraising birthday party for cgf at her house,working with sicher,who never told walton about the event.sicher received the money from the event but pocketed it for herself.the district court was certainly rational in not inferring that money raising drives originated and were managed sua sponte without any involvement by a representative of the charity.
sicher thefts 
in these two roles,in which sicher admittedly received minimal supervision,the defendant was able to steal from both walton and cgf.
thefts from walton practice 
beginning no later than september,the defendant began to steal from walton medical practice.she stole reimbursement checks sent to walton from public and private health insurance programs for medical services by indorsing them with the forged signature of walton and depositing them into her personal bank account.she took patient payments made by check to walton as well as patient made in cash.she told one patient he owed an additional not covered by the insurance payment received and then,when the patient paid,pocketed the money.walton did not monitor sicher representations to patients about the sums owed or himself review the deposits to see that the accounts were correct.
over the course of five years of thefts from walton practice,sicher stole more than checks from more than different insurers,totaling over.to carry out her thefts,the defendant made,without walton authorization or knowledge,a signature stamp,which she used to forge walton signature in indorsing the checks.walton did not review the checks,and so did not observe this.the defendant also deleted various records of the surgeries walton had performed for which payments were still due from the practice computer files.
thefts from cgf 
sicher was also able to use her position to encourage fundraising for cgf,to steal from cgf bank account,and to steal funds meant to be deposited to the accounts.she took blank,unsigned checks for cgf,which were intended for funding research grants and for which walton was the sole authorized signatory.sicher made of those checks payable to herself from cgf and deposited them into her personal bank account,taking a total of from the cgf account.she also stole at least seven donations made by check from third parties for a total of.she used the signature stamp she had made of walton signature to indorse the checks in order to carry out these thefts.she also took cash donations made to cgf,which the defendant told the government totaled approximately.these actions were admittedly taken without the authorization of walton.they were also taken without his knowledge or permission.but it is not the formal job description which is at issue but the actual responsibilities of her job.
sicher was able to conceal these actions because of the scope of her duties.for example,she,not walton,was responsible for opening and reviewing cgf monthly bank statements,and presumably reconciling accounts.for at least five years,she showed walton only the first page of the statements which show the balance for the cgf account.she destroyed the remaining pages that showed the cleared,forged checks.walton deferred to sicher representations about the finances of both his practice and cgf after seeing only the first page of the bank statements and did not conduct a supervisory review of her accounting.
sicher was given increased responsibilities over the years because,walton said,he trusted her and had confidence in her.his office essentially had no checks and balances on the discretion she had in both of her roles.
walton discovery of sicher thefts 
in november,walton discovered the first evidence of sicher thefts totally by chance.he was in the office on a saturday and received and opened the office mail,which included a bank statement showing that a check from cgf to a university of georgia professor had been returned for insufficient funds.walton knew that there should have been enough money in the cgf account for the check to clear also he had been surprised not to have received an acknowledgment of the check from the professor.when walton asked sicher about the check,she stated that the check had been sent and that the professor had called to thank walton.walton then confronted sicher about the check discrepancy,and she admitted to stealing from the cgf account.investigation established that the defendant had stolen at least.
district court proceedings 
on january,defendant pled guilty to the information.
the report psr submitted to the district court calculated an offense level of under the guidelines.the psr recommended a enhancement for abuse of a position of trust,a enhancement for a misrepresentation that the defendant was acting on behalf of a charitable organization,and a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.sicher criminal history was calculated at category 
the psr recommendation that the abuse of trust enhancement should be applied was based on the discretion the defendant exercised in administering the medical practice and in managing cgf activities.the relevant facts included that the defendant had an extremely high level of trust based upon her professional relationship with walton that she was given substantial professional discretion to manage the financial and administrative functions of the office that walton gave the defendant considerable deference and relied upon her to conduct his daily affairs that sicher regularly attended and hosted fundraisers by the cgf and was the face of cgf along with walton and that she had strong personal relationships with patients and families who visited walton office in hopes of finding a cure.the psr concluded that the defendant was insulated from scrutiny,which contributed significantly to her ability to facilitate the theft and conceal it on an ongoing basis thereafter.defendant filed an objection to the psr conclusion that the enhancement applied,but did not dispute the underlying factual assertions 
sicher chose not to present any contrary facts with respect to her role at cgf and the medical practice to the district court.she only submitted evidence regarding her mental health disorders.in the mental health evidence,she told reade,who evaluated her,that she knew what records walton scrutinized and which he ignored.sicher knew precisely how to take advantage of the discretion and minimal supervision she received.
during the hearing on july,defendant again objected that she did not hold a position of trust.importantly,sicher conceded that in fact she was not supervised.she attempted to blame walton for this,saying he was too busy and should have hired more staff.
before hearing the witnesses at the sentencing hearing,on august,the district court stated it had given considerable time and thought to what the sentences would be during the sentencing hearing and before defense counsel argued,defense counsel asked the judge how he had resolved the disputed guidelines issue,as it would affect her argument.the court responded that i find that the defendant did violate a position of trust.defense counsel did not ask for a greater explanation,nor did defense counsel present any evidence or any oral argument at the sentencing hearing that the position sicher held was not a position of trust.
the district court found that both walton and cgf were victims.the court heard statements from walton as well as four current and former cgf board members,all of whom had children who were patients of walton,and all of whom described their views that she was trusted by them,and that they took actions in reliance on that trust,and she had abused the trust.sicher did not testify.
at sentencing,the district court also rejected defendant requested downward departure or variance based on the evidence she had submitted of her mental health conditions and announced the sentence.
defendant now appeals her sentence.
sicher first argument is that the district court erred in applying the enhancement for abuse of a position of trust under because she did not hold a position of trust.defendant contends that on the factual record presented in the district court,there was insufficient evidence for the court to conclude that defendant exercised the kind of substantial professional or managerial discretion necessary to support the enhancement we disagree.the government burden is to show the facts supporting the enhancement by a preponderance of the evidence.united states connell,cir.
our caselaw has reviewed the propriety of a enhancement under different standards.see united states,cir giving due deference to the district court application of to the facts.in other cases,we have described the standard of review as de novo.united states,cir see also united states parrilla roman,cir.to the extent that determination depends upon findings of fact,we review the district court factual determinations for clear error,at.these determinations may be made by drawing reasonable inferences from the evidence.marceau,at.
certainly,questions about interpretation of a guideline are reviewed de novo.marceau,at.questions of application of a guideline tend more to be on a sliding scale for the present case,it makes no difference.even if our review were purely de novo,we would affirm.
to apply the enhancement,the district court must first decide that the defendant occupied a position of trust and then find that she used that position to facilitate or conceal the offense.united states gill,cir.these steps are distinct.parrilla roman,at.
the district court did not specify the precise basis for the application of the enhancement,nor did it need to do so.w e note once more that a sentencing court reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the report with what the judge did.united states hoey.cir quoting united states,cir en banc.indeed,in rita united states,d,the supreme court affirmed where there was cursory reasoning by the trial judge,on the basis of inferences as to the sentencing judge likely reasoning where context and the record make clear that this,or similar,reasoning underlies the judge conclusion.
in reviewing the district court conclusion,we review all of the information before the court.that evidence must be viewed as a whole and not atomized.united states,cir examining district court evidence including the psr to evaluate whether the sentencing enhancement applied.special weight is given to those portions of the psr to which no countervailing proof is offered.united states prochner,cir the defendant may object to facts in the psr,but if his objections to the psr are merely rhetorical and unsupported by countervailing proof,the district court is entitled to rely on the facts in the psr.alteration in original quoting united states cyr,cir.
guidelines requirement 
we begin with whether the government has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that sicher occupied a position of trust.the guideline states if the defendant abused a position of public or private trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense,increase by levels.commentary illuminates the meaning of the guidelines.the commentary states that a position of public or private trust is characterized by professional or managerial discretion.cmt.persons holding such positions ordinarily are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose responsibilities are primarily in nature.id.the guidelines commentary further explains that the enhancement would apply to a bank executive fraudulent loan scheme,but does not apply in the case of an embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller or hotel clerk because such positions lack the required discretion id.the plain language of the guideline thus covers a spectrum of positions.at one end,the enhancement applies to a supervisor to whom substantial discretion is delegated at the other end,an ordinary bank teller with no discretion is excluded.
in evaluating the first step of the enhancement analysis,the relevant inquiry is whether a person in fact occupied a position of trust,rather than whether the person title or official job description contained a discretionary element.united states chanthaseng,cir emphasis in original see also united states allen,cir an employee need not have a fancy title or be a big shot in an organization to qualify for an enhancement for abuse of a position of trust.united states barrett,cir noting that enhancement has been applied to police officers,security guards,babysitters,custodians,and truck drivers.the fact that sicher title was only that of secretary and administrative assistant is beside the point.
under our precedent,the district court implicit conclusion that sicher held a position of trust characterized by managerial discretion can not be reversed.the record shows that sicher,through her roles in the medical practice and at cgf,in fact exercised a great deal of discretion and had little supervision.these roles must be considered together for purposes of the enhancement.what is conclusive for us is her role in cgf.
were the enhancement based on sicher secretarial role in walton medical practice alone,this might be considered a more difficult issue.united states tann,no enhancement where office manager responsibilities limited to payroll and entering checks into ledger.whether sicher secretarial role alone in the medical practice is enough to support the enhancement is a question we do not need to reach.in light of the additional role sicher performed at cgf,the evidence firmly supports the district court conclusion that she occupied a position of trust.
the record is clear that sicher in fact exercised considerable authority and discretion as to cgf this is necessarily so,as she was unsupervised in a number of tasks as to receipt and disbursement of funds.first,sicher opened and reviewed cgf monthly bank statements and then selectively gave information to walton,who was only shown the bottom line of the account only the first page,which only showed the total account balance.indeed,she exercised autonomy over incoming donations,the payments of grants to researchers as evidenced by the to one researcher,and maintenance of the accounting logs.she was essentially unsupervised by walton as to these responsibilities and has never claimed otherwise.
second,as the public face of cgf,she was entrusted to host cgf fundraisers and to take steps to facilitate the fundraisers such as dealing with celebrities and distributing items for sale.she also exercised discretion as to what fundraisers would be held in cgf name,not even disclosing them to walton.regardless of the defendant title,she essentially took over as the de facto manager and director of cgf.
where a supervisor fails to review the financial transactions carried out by an employee,as here,effectively giving the employee significant discretion,we have held that the enhancement applies.chanthaseng,at although it was against bank regulations for appellant to countersign rapid deposit tickets at will,the bank manager laxity effectively made that a central element of defendant position.
other courts have applied the enhancement to employees who,despite their title,were in fact entrusted with substantial discretion.for example,in united states laljie,cir,the second circuit upheld an abuse of trust enhancement for a personal secretary who altered checks made payable to cash and tricked her employer into signing checks made payable to her personal accounts.there,the court explained that the proper characterization of the secretarial position for purpose s will depend on the responsibilities the employer delegates to the employee and the discretion the employer confers.id.at see also united states tiojanco,cir enhancement applies to hotel clerk in accounts receivable department who was responsible for handling telephone calls from hotel guests who disputed charges made to their credit card account.
we recognize that testimony by individuals that they trusted someone who betrayed their trust does not itself establish that the position was a position of trust.the testimony,however,is not irrelevant.with growing trust by the employer victim,an employee may be in fact given increasing levels of responsibility and discretion over time such that the position becomes one characterized by professional or managerial discretion without any change in title.that is true here.our caselaw recognizes this as grounds to sustain a enhancement.in united states,this court concluded that the closeness of the relationship between the defendant and the victim supported the district court finding that the defendant occupied a position of trust.applied the enhancement to a bookkeeper who had forged the business owner name to the checks.at.in upholding the enhancement,stated that mere access to the business checkbook and accounting software was insufficient to trigger the application of the enhancement.id.rather,two other aspects of employment enabled his thefts authority to transfer funds from the line of credit to the checking account and his close,personal relationship with the business owners.id.at.this is a very different point than saying no more than the defendant lacked supervision.
the testimony at sicher sentencing hearing repeatedly emphasized the high level of trust walton and others had in the defendant,which resulted in her having an even more important role in cgf 
although sicher is correct to argue that trust has a special meaning under the guidelines,united states reccko,cir,it is also evident from the testimony that the particular level of trust walton and the patients and families had in sicher result ed in less supervision of and more autonomy for her,at.and whatever the reason sicher was given such a significant role,she was in fact in a position of trust as defined in the guideline.
the cases upon which sicher relies to argue that she does not occupy a position of trust,reccko and parrilla roman,are easily distinguished.in reccko,this court rejected the application of the enhancement to a police station operator who possessed no discernable discretion.reccko,at.there,the defendant was closely supervised her telephone lines were continuously monitored and although she announced visitors,she did not have discretion either to screen them or to admit them to the areas of the stationhouse.id.in parrilla roman,at,we rejected an enhancement for airport baggage handlers where there was no evidence of discretion or that defendants toiled under minimal supervision.sicher did not have a menial position,on par with the closely supervised operator or baggage handler.
as to the second step,the record clearly shows that defendant used her position of trust to conceal her offenses there is no dispute that sicher was able to carry out her offenses for at least five years by showing walton only the first page of the monthly bank statements and deleting the remaining pages showing her illegal activity.the trusted,familial role that defendant held in walton practice and cgf facilitated the thefts.in addition,she used her vast array of responsibilities with cgf to perform and to conceal her thefts from the foundation.
finally,we reject sicher second claim of error that the district court failed to consider and to grant a downward variance on the basis of evidence of her mental health problems,including diagnoses of borderline personality disorder,major depression,and compulsive gambling disorder.
the record demonstrates that the district court in fact did consider the defendant mental health evidence,but simply did not find it persuasive.the district court stated,frankly,while i understand that,i regard it as an explanation rather than a justification not the kind of mental state to excuse this criminal behavior.further,the district court did recommend that defendant receive mental health treatment in prison.the record thus refutes defendant second claim of error.
the sentence is affirmed.
dissenting opinion follows 
the majority opinion is a curious blend of intimations and unjustified inferences.with its invocation of our authority to infer the reasoning of the able and experienced district court judge,who said that he had given considerable time and thought to what the sentences would be,the majority intimates that we should defer to the decision of the judge even in the absence of any explanation of his decision that appellant occupied a position of trust within the meaning of the guidelines.with its repeated invocation of the conclusory assertion of the psr that sicher exercised managerial discretion in carrying out her work for the cgf,an essential characteristic of a position of trust,the majority intimates that there is evidence in the record to support that assertion.yet when the majority tries to identify specific instances of the exercise of such discretion,there is only an empty record.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
in part i of the dissent,i set forth the law that applies to the position of trust enhancement.in part ii,i apply the law to the facts of this case,first addressing appellant work as a secretary for walton medical office and then her work for the children glaucoma foundation cgf.although the majority chooses not to discuss appellant work as secretary to the medical office,i must do so because of my view that the position of trust enhancement was improperly applied.in my discussion of the application of the law to sicher work with the cgf,i focus on the errors in the majority analysis 
united states sentencing guidelines section calls for a upward adjustment when the defendant abused a position of public or private trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.the application notes to this provision explain that a position of public or private trust refers to one characterized by professional or managerial discretion,substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference.cmt.the notes further explain that 
persons holding such positions ordinarily are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose responsibilities are primarily in nature.for this adjustment to apply,the position of public or private trust must have contributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense,by making the detection of the offense or the defendant responsibility for the offense more difficult.this adjustment,for example,applies in the case of an embezzlement of a client funds by an attorney serving as a guardian,a bank executive fraudulent loan scheme,or the criminal sexual abuse of a patient by a physician under the guise of an examination.this adjustment does not apply in the case of an embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller or hotel clerk because such positions are not characterized by the factors.
we require sentencing courts to conduct a inquiry to determine whether the section enhancement applies to a particular defendant.see united states reccko,cir.first,a court must determine whether a defendant occupied a position of trust within the meaning of the guideline.we have called this the status question.united states,cir.if the defendant job does not meet that description,the inquiry ends and the enhancement does not apply.if,however,a court answers the status question affirmatively,it should proceed to the second step of the inquiry and ask whether the defendant used her position of trust to facilitate or conceal her offense.reccko,at,at.it is error to conflate these two steps by determining that a defendant held a position of trust precisely because her job enabled her to commit the crime.reccko,at see also,at i t does not follow that,merely because a defendant position enables him to commit an offense,the position must have been unsupervised and,thus,a position of trust.
with respect to the status inquiry,our the guideline that the requirement of managerial or professional discretion is paramount.united states chanthaseng,cir.labels do not matter it is the defendant actual degree of discretion,not his or her job title,that controls the applicability of section.united states gill,cir.although positions of trust exist in many different settings,they all involve 
decisionmaking that is given considerable deference precisely because it can not be dictated entirely by established protocol.all of these individuals are charged with exercising their judgment in the best interest of another person or entity this is the essence of the professional or managerial discretion to which the guideline refers.
united states tiojanco,cir see also id.at describing positions of trust as falling into two categories people like doctors,lawyers,and investment advisors who have or hold themselves out as having specialized expertise that leaves the average layman to monitor their job performance,and employees in organizational settings who are charged with deciding,on a basis,whether a particular expenditure or transfer of company funds or other valuables is necessary or beneficial to the organization.
this focus on the presence of managerial or professional discretion is necessarily,and the fact patterns will vary widely from case to case.nevertheless,our precedent provides useful guidance.for example,in chanthaseng,at,we found that a bank manager occupied a position of trust when she stole from the bank through a scheme of making false rapid deposit tickets for fictional large cash deposits.the defendant supervisor gave her the authority against corporate rules to countersign her own deposit tickets and failed to review her tickets,essentially making her the branch sole for those transactions.id.at.the same supervisor had also asked the defendant to look into an odd entry in the bank which the defendant in fact created to conceal her providing any oversight for the defendant subsequent investigation.id.at.
we also found the position of trust enhancement applicable in united states,cir,where the defendant was an office manager with access to an line of credit that he could use to transfer funds into his employer checking account.we concluded that the authority to draw off the account suggests significant managerial discretion.id.
by contrast,we were not able to identify the presence of professional or managerial discretion in other cases.in reccko,at,we found that the section enhancement was inappropriately applied to a police station receptionist and switchboard operator who was closely supervised and whose phone calls were monitored,even though her position made her privy to secret police information that she used to tip a friend to a planned drug bust.although the defendant job at the station afforded her access to information,it reposed in her no discernable discretion.id.at.
we also rejected the application of the enhancement in,at,where we found that defendants had not occupied positions of trust as baggage handlers for an airline even though they had received special security clearance in connection with their employment.we noted that the defendants positions did not afford them discretion.id.as our cases demonstrate,mere access to finances,secure space,or secret information does not amount to a position of trust unless the access is accompanied by the exercise of professional or managerial discretion.
distinguishing positions with managerial authority from those without it can be difficult in the office setting,where employees often have a wide range of duties that must be scrutinized carefully to determine if they truly encompass managerial discretion.the difficult that may be necessary in the office setting is illustrated by united states tann.the defendant there was an office manager who was convicted of fraud for embezzling from three successive employers.id.at.her duties over the course of the three jobs included ordering equipment,scheduling travel,maintaining a check ledger she was not authorized to sign checks,ensuring that monthly bank statements matched the ledger,making out payroll checks,handling cost records,and preparing checks to be signed by her supervisors.id.at.although the district court had found that tann was trusted to handle the finances of the organization s,it failed to identify any specific tasks requiring managerial discretion.id.at modification in original internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in the absence of proof of such tasks,the enhancement was not applicable id.
in united states edwards,cir,the enhancement did not apply to an administrative assistant who handled accounts receivable,received customer checks in the mail and prepared them for deposit,calculated the balance of customer accounts,posted payments to customer accounts,and prepared cash receipts reports that were incorporated into the company ledgers and financial statements.the tenth circuit stated that the adjustment under is not intended to be routinely applied to every employee fraud or embezzlement case t he fact is that in every successful fraud the defendant will have created confidence and trust in the victim,but the sentencing enhancement is not intended to apply to every case of fraud.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.because edwards job was purely ministerial and did not entail substantial discretionary judgment,the section enhancement was inappropriate.id.
in imposing the abuse of trust enhancement in this case,the district court made no factual findings on the record concerning the nature of appellant position and whether it required the exercise of professional or managerial discretion.the court had before it,however,the charging document to which appellant pled guilty,victim impact letters written by walton on behalf of himself and the cgf,the victim impact testimony of walton and parents of some of his patients,appellant psychiatric and compulsive gambling evaluations and,most importantly,the psr.appellant did not contest the objective facts set forth in any of these sources.the district court was entitled to accept those uncontested facts as true.united states prochner,cir.
in contrast to the objective facts which include,for example,the specific tasks sicher performed,the descriptions of events occurring during the course of her fraud,and the amount of money she stole,appellant did contest a critical conclusion drawn from those facts that would,if true,support the imposition of the position of trust enhancement.namely,she contested the psr assertion that she was given substantial professional discretion to manage the financial and administrative functions of the office,arguing in her sentencing memorandum that her job was not one that was characterized by professional or managerial discretion.defendant sentencing memorandum at quoting.unlike the majority,i do not merely accept the psr conclusion that appellant was given substantial discretion,or the district court unexplained finding that the defendant did violate a position of trust.the district court made no subsidiary findings of fact about whether appellant position afforded her managerial discretion.in a case such as this one,in which the district court announced its decision to adjust upward without any subsidiary findings of fact,we review the evidence and the result,but not the reasoning by which the result was reached by the district court.chanthaseng,at quoting united states tracy,cir.
the majority invokes the ability of the district court to make factual determinations by drawing reasonable inferences from the evidence,and our ability to infer a sentencing court reasoning under certain circumstances.those propositions,while unquestionably correct,are irrelevant to this case.whatever the intricacies of the review process here my conclusion is that any inferences fairly drawn from the record simply do not support the conclusion that appellant occupied a position of trust.
administrative assistant to walton medical office 
the psr states that walton relied on appellant to conduct his daily affairs,giving her substantial professional discretion to manage the financial and administrative functions of the office.these generalities,repeated by the government in its brief,draw no support from the specific responsibilities attributed to sicher.her specific duties,as set forth in the psr,included ministerial tasks such as opening mail,welcoming patients,scheduling appointments,bookkeeping,and collecting and depositing payments.these kinds of ministerial tasks do not normally require substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference,cmt,and the record gives us no reason to conclude that they did in this situation.notably,the record does not reveal that appellant had authority to make spending decisions for the medical office,prepare a budget,approve or deny spending requests,or conduct any other discretionary task with respect to the financial and administrative functions of the office.while is true that appellant responsibilities gave her the opportunity to commit her crimes,they reposed in her no discernable discretion.reccko,at see also united states spear,cir the fact that the defendant was trusted by her employer with significant responsibility is not determinative.alterations in original quoting edwards,at.
administrative assistant to the children glaucoma foundation 
the following two paragraphs are the core of the majority erroneous reasoning about the significance of appellant work for the cgf 
the record is clear that sicher in fact exercised considerable authority and discretion as to cgf this is necessarily so,as she was unsupervised in a number of tasks as to receipt and disbursement of funds.first,sicher opened and reviewed cgf monthly bank statements and then selectively gave information to walton,who was only shown the bottom line of the account only the first page,which only showed the total account balance.indeed,she exercised autonomy over incoming donations,the payments of grants to researchers as evidenced by the to one researcher,and maintenance of the accounting logs.she was essentially unsupervised by walton as to these responsibilities and has never claimed otherwise.
second,as the public face of cgf,she was entrusted to host cgf fundraisers and to take steps to facilitate the fundraisers such as dealing with celebrities and distributing items for sale.she also exercised discretion as to what fundraisers would be held in cgf name,not even disclosing them to walton.regardless of the defendant title,she essentially took over as the de facto manager and director of cgf.
these paragraphs contain both factual and legal errors.i will deal with the factual errors first,setting forth the assertions at issue in bold print.
factual errors 
sicher opened and reviewed cgf monthly bank statements and then selectively gave information to walton,who was only shown the bottom line of the account only the first page,which only showed the total account balance.
this statement only describes the technique of sicher crime her concealment of illicit transactions does not show that she was authorized to exercise managerial discretion on behalf of the cgf.while sicher,as a bookkeeper,may have been the only one to review the itemized record of the bank account activity,that fact does not indicate that she was authorized to exercise discretion over the transactions reported there.
sicher exercised autonomy over incoming donations 
sicher exercised autonomy over incoming donations only to the extent that she was the sole person responsible for depositing them in the cgf bank account she exercised no authority over the funds in that account,however,because she was not permitted to choose where they should be deposited or how they should be spent.she had no authority to write checks from the cgf bank account 
sicher exercised autonomy over the payments of grants to researchers.
if this statement were example,if sicher had the authority to decide which researchers were to be paid,how much,or even fact would indeed support the majority position that she exercised discretion in her role.however,there is no evidence to support that proposition.certainly,the episode on which the majority relies to make the assertion when walton discovered appellant thefts because a check to a researcher was returned for insufficient funds does not support the contention.walton discovered the theft when,to his surprise,he saw that the check to the researcher had bounced he knew that there should have been enough money in the account to cover it.that episode only supports the conclusion that sicher,without the authorization or knowledge of walton,drained the account of money.it can not support the inference that sicher had complete autonomy over research grant payments.while she might possibly have prepared the check to the researcher a fact the record does not provide,she was,without question,unauthorized to sign it on her own.
sicher exercised autonomy over maintenance of the accounting logs.
this statement is probably true.sicher was the bookkeeper for the cgf as well as the medical office.as we indicated in,at,however,that ministerial task does not indicate the use of discretionary judgment.see id.noting that t here is some support for argument that his position as a bookkeeper did not place him within the guideline definition of a position of a trust,but finding support for the imposition of the enhancement in other aspects of the defendant job.
a s the public face of cgf,sicher was entrusted to host cgf fundraisers and to take steps to facilitate the fundraisers such as dealing with celebrities and distributing items for sale.
sicher was a host of cgf events only in the sense that she was a greeter and a face of the charity.the record shows that she was called on to use her social skills on behalf of the organization,not her managerial discretion.for example,the majority focuses on an episode,described at sentencing by the mother of a patient,when sicher gave wristbands to two girls who sold them to raise money for the charity.the disbursement of a fundraising item,and the subsequent theft of the money raised,does not reflect the use,especially not the authorized use,of managerial discretion.nothing in the record indicates that sicher planned,designed,or developed the bracelet fundraiser.
sicher also exercised discretion as to what fundraisers would be held in cgf name,not even disclosing them to walton.
nowhere does the record support the contention that sicher exercised discretion about what fundraisers would be held.the majority apparently draws this conclusion from the testimony about a birthday party held by a former member of the cgf board of directors,who said at sentencing 
m y husband and i had a birthday party in our home and every guest there donated money to the foundation,directly to the foundation.but,walton never heard of this.because,the defendant decided rather than to give this money to research and to study,she would put it in her own pocket.she would steal from my children,from all of these children.
this testimony describes sicher use of the birthday party to steal money,not her exercise of discretion in planning and implementing the party.nor does the testimony support the more general conclusion that anything about sicher or her authority to use discretion about what fundraisers to hold.
regardless of defendant title,she essentially acted as the director of the cgf.
as i have indicated,the facts belie this wishful characterization.strikingly,sicher was paid only an additional per month for her work on behalf of the cgf.that modest increment is not surprising.contrary to the majority suggestions,the record does not indicate that appellant made any decisions on behalf of the cgf,such as determining how to fundraise,setting financial goals,or choosing how to spend its money.she did not have authority to write checks,prepare the budget,or supervise employees.appellant position at the cgf afforded her access to the funds she ultimately stole,but it did not require the exercise of managerial discretion.
legal errors 
the majority opinion attempts to draw too certain a connection between the lack of supervision and the exercise of discretion.the government makes the same error in its brief,suggesting that the section enhancement was appropriate because of sicher lack of supervision and her close relationship with walton and the families who visited his office.it is true that lack of supervision often characterizes positions that require the exercise of managerial discretion.the guideline commentary makes that very point p ersons holding such positions ordinarily are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose responsibilities are primarily in nature.cmt.it does not follow from that observation,however,that lack of supervision of an employee means that the employee is necessarily authorized or expected to exercise professional or managerial discretion.in some circumstances,the ministerial nature of the task may not justify much supervision.although the guideline requires the exercise of managerial or professional discretion to apply the enhancement,it only suggests that lack of supervision is one way to detect whether that discretion exists.the majority asserts the opposite,concluding that sicher in fact exercised considerable authority and discretion as to cgf this is necessarily so,as she was unsupervised in a number of tasks as to receipt and disbursement of funds.
likewise,the majority makes the error of equating simple trust with a section position of trust,a link long rejected by this circuit.see reccko,at.the majority states that,w ith growing trust by an employer,victim,an employee may be in fact given increasing levels of responsibility and discretion over time such that the position becomes one characterized by professional or managerial discretion without any change in title.that observation may be apt in some circumstances,but the record does not support it here.sicher had access to the finances of the cgf and the medical office because she was trusted,but she was not permitted to exercise her discretion over those finances 
the majority also embraces the government argument that our decision in,supports its contention that sicher close relationships with walton and the families of his patients transformed her role into a position of trust within the meaning of section.the majority describes as holding that the closeness of the relationship between the defendant and the victim supported the district court finding that the defendant occupied a position of trust.while that is true,our decision in that case critically depended on the trusted
