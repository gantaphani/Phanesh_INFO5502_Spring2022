invoking,george sepulveda,a federal prisoner,mounted a collateral attack on his conviction and sentence for witness intimidation.the district court repulsed the attack.the petitioner ensuing appeal presents two questions of first impression within this circuit.the first asks whether the rule announced in apprendi new jersey,d,applies retroactively to cases on collateral review.the second,relevant only if apprendi lacks such retroactivity,asks whether the enactment of the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,rendered the doctrine of teague lane,d,inapplicable to initial petitions for relief under section.concluding,as we do,that apprendi has no retroactive effect and that teague is not a dead letter in the aedpa context,we affirm the denial of the petitioner habeas corpus application.
background 
the petitioner,known in some circles as king paradise,was convicted of multiple crimes arising out of his activities as the leader of the providence chapter of the almighty latin king nation.we affirmed those convictions in united states lara,cir.here,we reconstruct only the factual terrain pertinent to the issues before us,referring those who seek a more detailed topographic model to our earlier opinion.see id.at.
a grand jury empaneled in the district of rhode island returned a indictment against the petitioner and several others.after a lengthy trial,a petit jury convicted the petitioner of racketeering,conspiracy to commit racketeering,murder in aid of racketeering,witness intimidation,and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.see c,d,a,b,g.the district court imposed three concurrent life sentences,a concurrent incarcerative term,and a concurrent incarcerative term.we affirmed the convictions and sentences,lara,at,and the supreme court eschewed further review,d.
a federal criminal conviction becomes final when the supreme court denies certiorari.see clay united states,d.approximately five months after the denial of certiorari in the petitioner case,the court decided apprendi.the central holding of apprendi is that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.at.this clarion call arguably conflicted with the procedure employed by the district court in sentencing the petitioner on the witness intimidation count.we explain briefly.
the witness intimidation count arose from an incident wherein the petitioner ordered the termination of manuel pacheco,a state prisoner who was assisting the authorities in their investigation of the latin kings lara,at.the petitioner order passed through various channels to henchmen incarcerated latin king members within the penitentiary in which pacheco was housed.id.at the first opportunity,these acolytes beat pacheco savagely.id.at.
a defendant convicted of witness intimidation typically faces a maximum prison term of ten years.see b.at sentencing,however,the government asked the lower court to enhance the petitioner sentence pursuant to the criminal street gangs act,which authorizes a bump in the sentence of an individual convicted of certain witness it is determined that the individual committed the offense intend ing to promote or further the felonious activities of a criminal street gang or maintain or increase his or her position in the gang.id.d.the sentencing court found that the petitioner conviction fit within these confines and,accordingly,imposed a sentence double the maximum otherwise authorized under the statute of conviction.
on december,the petitioner filed a federal habeas,an application to vacate,set aside,or correct his section.see ellis united states,cir observing that,as to federal prisoners,section is in essence a surrogate for the historic writ of habeas corpus.in it,he argued that he had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment above the default statutory maximum for the crime of conviction based on a judge factual finding that the circumstances attendant to his commission of that crime warranted the enhancement,and that the resultant sentence violated the apprendi rule.the district court denied the application,holding that apprendi could not be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review.
the petitioner moved for a certificate of appealability coa.see.we granted the request with respect to the effect,if any,that the apprendi decision might have on the petitioner conviction for witness intimidation.this appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
it is beyond cavil that the petitioner sentence for witness intimidation exceeds the default statutory maximum for that crime,and that this overage rests on the sentencing court finding that the petitioner had acted with the intention of furthering the felonious activities of a criminal street gang maintaining his leadership position in such a gang.thus,the petitioner has made at least a prima facie showing of a violation of the apprendi rule but the petitioner conviction had already become final before apprendi was handed down,and the threshold question is whether the new rule applies to his case.see derman united states,cir.the petitioner advances two theories in support of the retroactive application of the apprendi rule.we address these theories sequentially.
a.the teague exceptions.
the supreme court decision in teague lane constitutes a general bar to the retroactive application of newly announced rules of criminal procedure.tyler cain,d citing teague,at.the teague bar admits of two exceptions.the first allows retroactive application of new rules that either a prohibit criminal punishment for certain types of primary conduct,or b forbid the imposition of certain categories of punishment for particular classes of defendants.netherland,d.this exception is patently inapposite here apprendi neither places any particular type of conduct beyond the reach of the criminal law nor pretermits any particular type of punishment for a specific class of defendants.accord mccoy united states,cir.thus,the petitioner challenge necessarily stands or falls on the strength of the second exception.
the second teague exception allows retroactive application of watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.graham collins,d internal quotation marks omitted.for this exception to flourish,the new rule must pass two tests.first,i nfringement of the rule must seriously diminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction.tyler,at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.second,the new rule must itself alter the accepted understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the integrity and fairness of a criminal proceeding.id.
nothing in the apprendi decision indicates to us that infringements of its rule will seriously diminish the accuracy of convictions which,by definition,must take place before any such infringement occurs.the case before us provides a practical illustration of why this is so.the petitioner was tried before a jury and convicted of witness intimidation upon proof of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.there is no indication that,in the course of his trial,he received less than the process that was due.the procedural error to which the petitioner adverts may raise questions as to the length of his sentence,but inaccuracies of this nature,occurring after a defendant has been duly convicted,are matters of degree and do not trump what the justices have termed the general rule of nonretroactivity.tyler,at.
we add,moreover,that the length of the petitioner sentence was not plucked out of thin air,but,rather,was determined by a federal judge based upon discrete findings of fact established by a fair preponderance of the evidence.we agree with the seventh circuit that findings by federal judges,though now rendered insufficient in certain instances by apprendi,nonetheless are adequate to make reliable decisions about punishment.curtis united states,cir.after all,even in the era,findings of fact made by the sentencing judge,under a preponderance standard,remain an important part of the sentencing regimen.see,united states caba,cir a fter apprendi,sentencing factors that boost a defendant sentence but do not trip a new statutory maximum remain grist for the district judge mill under a standard.see also united states robinson,cir rejecting the argument that when facts found by the judge trigger or increase a mandatory minimum sentence,an apprendi violation occurs.consequently,apprendi new rule not only fails to impugn the accuracy of convictions that became final beforehand but also falls short of rendering sentences imposed under the regime seriously inaccurate.see goode united states,cir united states,cir we do not believe that requiring the jury to make drug quantity determinations beyond a reasonable doubt will greatly affect the accuracy of convictions.
by the same token,we do not believe that the apprendi rule can be characterized as a watershed rule of criminal procedure.without in any way denigrating either the importance or the impact of apprendi,that decision can not plausibly be said to have altered the commonly accepted understanding of the bedrock procedural elements of our criminal justice system.accord united states sanders,cir rejecting the notion that,the country criminal justice system malfunctioned fundamentally.watershed rules affecting bedrock procedural elements are few and far between.the quintessential example of such a only example specifically mentioned by the supreme the landmark decision in gideon wainwright,d.the sweeping rule of gideon established an affirmative right to counsel in all felony cases,at.it protected each accused,though he be not guilty,from the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence.gideon,at.citation omitted.this representation by counsel is fundamental to a fair the legal landscape and dramatically revised the common understanding of what the due process clause demands in a criminal case.
other concrete examples of watershed rules are hen teeth rare.see graham,at.w e operate from the premise that such procedures would be so central to an accurate determination of innocence or guilt that it is unlikely that many such components of basic due process have yet to emerge.one reason for this phenomenon is that the supreme court has exhibited reluctance to showcase prototypes of rules that might enjoy this venerated status.that is understandable because the teague exception is clearly meant to apply only to a small core of rules requiring observance of those procedures that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,at.
apprendi is not within this small core of cases.the rule that it announces merely assures a previously convicted defendant that increased punishment,over and above the default statutory maximum,can only be imposed if the factual predicate for the than a prior criminal confirmed by a jury to a higher quantum of proof.see apprendi,at.if a defendant faces punishment beyond that provided by statute when an offense is committed under certain circumstances but not others,it necessarily follows that the defendant should not be deprived of protections that have,until that point,unquestionably attached.emphasis supplied.although the apprendi rule is important as a means of clarifying the proper factfinding roles of judge and jury,it affords an innocent defendant no additional shield from wrongful conviction.refined to bare essence,the rule merely limits the potential penalty to be imposed on an undoubtedly guilty defendant to that designated by statute.goode,at.
in sum,a decision by a judge on the preponderance standard rather than a jury on the standard is not the sort of error that necessarily undermines the fairness of judicial proceedings.curtis,at.applying apprendi procedural mandate retroactively would create an unacceptably high risk that those found guilty of criminal conduct might escape condign sentences.hence,we join every court of appeals that thus far has decided the question and hold that the apprendi rule fails to qualify as a watershed rule within the meaning of the second teague exception.see coleman united states,cir goode,at united states brown,cir per curiam curtis,at united states mora,cir,at mccoy,at united states moss,cir sanders,at.
in an effort to turn aside the combined force of reasoning and precedent,the petitioner offers several diversions.none is persuasive,but three of his sallies merit brief comment.
in the first place,the petitioner emphasizes that no less an authority than justice has characterized the majority opinion in apprendi as one that announces a watershed change in constitutional law.apprendi,at,dissenting.the petitioner reliance on this statement demonstrates the verity that a single word often has the capacity to convey multiple shades of meaning.see hanover ins.united states,cir explaining that words can be like chameleons,which reflect the color of their environment citation and internal quotation marks omitted.justice warned that the most significant impact of the court decision in apprendi was that it threaten ed to unleash a flood of petitions by convicted felons seeking to invalidate their sentences.at.her concern was a practical one,prompting her to chastise the majority for not say ing whether schemes are constitutional.id.at.she did not advert to teague,and her use of the word watershed,taken in this context,can not plausibly be interpreted as a definitive conclusion that anyone hold the apprendi rule to be a watershed rule for teague purposes.
next,the petitioner posits that the apprendi rule is not strictly a rule of criminal procedure,but,rather,possesses a substantive component,requiring those facts that warrant sentence enhancement to be considered elements of an aggravated crime.this formulation contains more cry than wool.
the apprendi decision is about criminal procedure,pure and simple.accord curtis,at.long before the court decided apprendi,basic principles of criminal and constitutional jurisprudence protected defendants from being convicted on less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each and every element of a charged crime.see in re winship,d holding that the due process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the charged crime.notwithstanding the prevalence of this principle,courts routinely approved the practice of enhancing sentences based on a judge factual determinations.see,united states thomas,cir united states grimaldo,cir united states lindia,cir.the apprendi rule limited that widespread practice the fact that the apprendi rule implements certain underlying constitutional protections makes it no less a rule of criminal procedure.see sanders,at.the supreme court has instructed us that the distinction between substance and procedure is an important one in the habeas context,bousley united states,d,and we can not disregard that distinction in applying the teague screen.
in the last analysis,t he teague doctrine is founded on the notion that one of the principal functions of habeas corpus is to assure that no man has been incarcerated under a procedure which creates an impermissibly large risk that the innocent will be convicted.id.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.practice,though incorrect,created no such risk.while the apprendi rule may improve the correlation between crime and punishment in future prosecutions,it does not render the correlation for past convictions completely or even seriously unreliable.thus,the procedure required by apprendi has the capacity to improve it is not substance in and of itself.
the petitioner third line of attack attempts to compare apprendi to the supreme court decisions in bailey united states,d,and richardson united states,d.based on these comparisons,the petitioner asserts that the rationale for applying the bailey and richardson doctrines retroactively supports giving apprendi retroactive effect.we reject this attempted analogy for the most basic of reasons the cases are not fair congeners.
bailey involved a determination of what conduct congress criminalized in enacting c.the bailey court determined that possession was not use and vaca
