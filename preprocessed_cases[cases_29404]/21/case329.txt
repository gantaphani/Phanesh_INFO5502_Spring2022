dawn zehrung appeals her month sentence after pleading guilty to violating the federal statute.she raises one issue should the district judge have enhanced her sentence under for abusing a position of trust in what follows,we explain why a remand for supplemental fact finding is required.
because there was no trial,we draw the facts primarily from the presentence report and from the transcript and submissions.see,united states anonymous defendant,cir.zehrung worked in a doctor office in maine,first as a billing clerk and then as a billing manager these are descriptive labels rather than formal titles,apparently.her former boss,robert grover,and former colleague,renee harding,sketched out the office billing procedure this way after a patient visit,either grover or a nurse would take a document called a super bill and circle an alphanumeric code to indicate the service provided.zehrung would get the super bill,enter the code into a software program,and,with a click of the button,generate a bill that she would then send to payers like mainecare,medicare,and anthem.entering the codes was pretty easy.i t a fairly simple system,nurse harding said.
when zehrung first came on board,an office manager watched what she did,comparing what she had inputted into the system with what was on the super bill,for example.eventually,though,the office manager left and was not replaced,so zehrung got to run the billing process on her own.not only that,according to grover,she got unsupervised control over the practice checkbook and accounts payable,too.she also had access to the office cashbox,which contained the copayments from patients.s he was the financial person,grover stressed,which freed him up to care for his patients.
everything seemed to be going swimmingly with zehrung at the financial helm.monthly revenues shot up a whopping.an obviously ecstatic grover asked her what was going on,and she said she had been going through the old accounts,working the accounts.for a while,that explanation worked,though grover also knew that part of the reason why revenues had jumped was because his office had started doing some aesthetics procedures,like laser hair removal.
of course appearances can be deceiving,and that was the case here.you see,zehrung had been carrying out an upcode scam on the sly,bilking money out of mainecare and the other payers by changing the codes to overstate what services had been provided and thus fetch higher payments.and she profited from the con,because she got paid bonuses based on the practice increased revenues.bad enough,but she also had been submitting bills for services not rendered and destroying super bills to cover her tracks.also,she ended up with other bonuses that were not authorize d.
zehrung crooked scheme began to unravel when a nurse spotted the billing problem and went straight to grover.dawn,how do you explain this he asked zehrung.hoping to talk her way out of a trip to the police station,zehrung floated two theories first,that a computer glitch had caused the upcoding and second,that she had been billing what should have been done whatever that means.grover bought none of it,and all of this led to zehrung arrest and conviction for healthcare fraud.
which brings us to sentencing.there the parties sparred over whether zehrung should get a adjustment one that is appropriate if she used a position of trust in such a way that made the crime easier to carry out or cover up.they did,however,agree that the government had the burden of proving the enhancement by the preponderance of the evidence,see united states sicher,cir,which is a standard,see united states morgan,cir.
consistent with this guideline,we ask sentencing judges faced with this type of issue to follow a process.first they must see if the defendant held a position of trust.and,if the answer is yes,then and only then they must see if the defendant used that position in some significant way to facilitate or conceal the offense.see united states parrilla román,cir emphasizing that t he two steps are separate and that care must be taken not to conflate them.
trust positions are ones of professional or managerial discretion,a phrase that means substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference.cmt.not surprisingly,then,people holding trust positions are usually subject to significantly less supervision than those holding positions with responsibilities.id.examples of abusers include attorneys serving as guardians who fleece their clients,bank executives who perpetrate schemes,and doctors who sexually abuse patients during exams.id.but not ordinary bank tellers who embezzle sure,they have access to all kinds of valuable things,yet nothing they typically do adding and taking cash from a till,for example involves the type of complicated,judgment calls that are given special deference,with little if any supervision.see id.
figuring out where a particular position falls on this spectrum can be tricky,and the cases present an array of circumstances turning back to our case,the distinguished judge found the evidence more than sufficient to support the enhancement.as i understand it,the judge said,grover picked codes on a super bill,and zehrung,when she received those codes,deliberately and consciously upcoded them to bill for services that no one had actually performed.she did the billing with no supervision,the judge added t here was no direct oversight,no review,he repeated again and she assumed complete financial control within the office.and,the judge suggested,her position made it significantly easier for her to commit the crime charged.
our standard of review is familiar.we assess a judge guidelines interpretation de novo,united states cannon,cir.we check his fact findings for clear error.id.at.and we review his application of the guidelines to a particular case on a sliding scale,with the intensity increasing the more as opposed to the judge conclusion is.see sicher,at accord united states gerhard,cir.the parties bicker about where on the scale our judge decision falls.but we need not referee their dispute,because regardless of who is right,we are not quite sure what to make of the judge decision.
for starters,the judge did not say what discretionary authority grover had entrusted zehrung with.true,the judge did mention her role in the billing process.but the discretion evidence there points in a couple of directions.the doctor testimony about picking codes for zehrung to enter into the computer seemingly suggests that her position was more like a typical bank teller,who has access needed to commit the crime charged but has little if any professional or managerial discretion in performing her tasks.parrilla román,at stressing that o pportunity and access do not equate with substantial discretionary judgment quoting united states edwards,cir.yet the presentence report whispers hints that zehrung may have had discretion to change codes that is one way though not the only way to interpret her comment to grover,made after he had heard about the billing mess,that she was billing for what should have been done which might put her in the category of discretionary decisionmakers covered by.on this we are left to speculate,however.
the same is true about the judge she assumed complete financial control within the office statement.grover did say that zehrung had control of the checkbook and accounts payable.but he did not elaborate.so was the judge inferring that the doctor had charged her with exercising her own judgment over these which might suggest she held a trust position and if yes,on what did the judge base this inference if only the presentence report could straighten this all out.see.i a noting that judges at sentencing may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact.alas,the report is no help,because it based its enhancement recommendation exclusively on her coding and billing duties.
do not get us wrong we know that sentencing judges need not explain their reasoning in exquisite detail,especially when the reasons are evident from the record.united states stella,cir citing,among other cases,sicher
