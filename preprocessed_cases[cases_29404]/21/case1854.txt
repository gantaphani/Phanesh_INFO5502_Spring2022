the united states appeals the sentence imposed on steven berg in the united states district court for the western district of new york larimer,on april.the sentencing court declined to impose a sentence enhancement on berg sentence for a violation of judicial process under sentencing guidelines manual b b after defendant pleaded guilty to one count of bankruptcy fraud,in violation of.
the district court denied the enhancement on the grounds that the enhancement was contrary to our dicta in united states carrozzella,cir,and that even if not barred by carrozzella,the enhancement was nonetheless unjustified given the lack of evidence of aggravated criminal intent.using carrozzella as a basis for denying enhancement has since been foreclosed by our intervening decision in united states kennedy,cir.but enhancement of a sentence has heretofore only been held appropriate in those cases where a debtor either conceals property from the estate creditors or makes a misrepresentation that works a fraud on the bankruptcy court.it would be an illusion of reason to impose a sentence enhancement where neither of those circumstances is present.since they are not present here,we affirm.
background 
on january,independent tool and mold,filed a petition for chapter bankruptcy in the bankruptcy court for the western district of new york.the petition was signed by defendant steven berg,as president of the company,and listed assets of and liabilities of.schedule b of the bankruptcy petition,which identified the personal property of the debtor corporation,listed a checking account with m t bank having a balance of.
at a hearing on march,berg confirmed the existence of certain outstanding accounts receivable owed to the debtor and said he would collect them and deposit the proceeds in the m t bank checking account.he further represented that he would use the money in that account to pay the internal revenue service irs,which was an unsecured priority creditor of the debtor company.berg was told at the hearing that the checking account was the property of the bankruptcy estate,and that he was not entitled to remove funds from it.
during the following year,berg collected approximately of accounts receivable and deposited these proceeds in the m t bank account,bringing the total balance to.at the same time,defendant also wrote three separate checks in january and february,drawing from the account as follows to bradley bennett for on january for mileage,school,to bradley bennett on february for and to cash on february for.as a result,the unsecured priority creditors of the bankrupt debtor did not timely receive the full amounts to which they were entitled.
while winding up the case in the late summer of,the bankruptcy trustee attempted to verify that the m t bank account had been closed and that the money in the account had been turned over to the irs.on october,the trustee received a copy of bank statements reflecting the withdrawal of funds by the three checks drawn on the account by berg.in response to the inquiries from the trustee,berg returned of the in missing funds on january.after repeated attempts to retrieve the remaining proved fruitless,the trustee referred the matter to the united states attorney office for criminal prosecution.
on december,the united states filed a felony information in the district court for the western district of new york.the information charged that berg did knowingly and fraudulently conceal from the bankruptcy trustee monies taken from the bank account belonging to independent tool and mold,a debtor,in violation of.section provides,in pertinent part,that a person who knowingly and fraudulently conceals from a custodian,trustee,marshal,or other officer of the court charged with the control or custody of property,any property belonging to the estate of a debtor shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than years,or both.two days later,berg waived indictment and entered a plea of guilty to this count.
on april,the district court held a hearing to resolve,among other issues,whether a sentence enhancement should be imposed on defendant for violation of judicial process pursuant to b b.the government conceded that berg had violated no specific court order,but insisted that defendant concealment of assets amounted to an abuse of the bankruptcy process under the standards adopted by other courts of appeals.berg countered the government contention by asserting that its position ran contrary to dicta in carrozzella.berg also maintained that he had used the initial drawn on the account to move the debtor company machinery in order to prevent its disposal by a new landlord who had purchased the building where it was housed.berg added that he had repaid the remaining in missing funds from the checking account prior to the imposition of his sentence.
the district court declined to impose the enhancement for the two reasons already noted.first,it believed the carrozzella decision had expressed grave doubts about the application of b b to the concealment of assets in bankruptcy.the sentencing judge further stated,second,that even if the provision applied to the concealment of assets 
this case is different because it was not the case where berg had an asset and hid it or otherwise lied,but instead he utilized assets that we know should not have been utilized once the petition has been filed because they did belong to him technically because they belonged to the estate that was in the process of bankruptcy.
the district court accordingly sentenced berg to three years of probation,including six months of home confinement,and imposed a fine of and a mandatory penalty assessment of.the united states now appeals the denial of the enhancement pursuant to b b.
discussion 
i standard of review 
on appeal from a sentence,we uphold the sentencing court factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous,and review its legal determinations de novo,while giving due deference to its application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts.e united states cassiliano,cir united states lewis,cir.
ii the carrozzella dicta 
turning to the merits,the version of the sentencing guidelines required that a criminal defendant offense level be enhanced by two levels i f the offense involved violation of any judicial or administrative order,injunction,decree,or process not addressed elsewhere in the guidelines.b b.section addresses a number of offenses involving fraud and deceit,and the background commentary indicates that subsection b b accounts for the aggravated criminal intent of a defendant who refuses to conform with the requirements of judicial process or orders issued by federal,state,or local administrative agencies.id.background.
in carrozzella,we intimated that the phrase violation of any judicial process did not extend to the concealment of assets in bankruptcy.at.our reasoning was that the phrase violation of process was aimed at a defendant who disobeys an existing judicial command or warning.we thought that if the sentencing guideline was intended to encompass a general misuse of judicial or administrative proceedings,such as the concealment of a debtor assets from the bankruptcy court,it would have been more appropriate for the commission to have used the phrase abuse of process.id.at.in support of this reading we cited the canon of ejusdem generis for the proposition that the term process should be construed narrowly to place it within the same class as the preceding terms order,injunction,and decree.id.but,we declined to resolve the issue conclusively since the offense in carrozzella entailed fraud by a probate trustee,and therefore involved an abuse of trust separately governed by.id.
more recently,in a case that entailed the failure to list assets in a bankruptcy petition,we rejected the discussion set out in carrozzella as dicta,and adopted the majority view among the circuits that the concealment of assets in a bankruptcy proceeding constitutes a violation of judicial process within the meaning of b b.kennedy,at.in kennedy,we first noted that the phrase judicial process has been used elsewhere both in the guidelines and in our precedents to
