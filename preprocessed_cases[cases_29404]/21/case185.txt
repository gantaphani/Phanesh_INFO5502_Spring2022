josé pantojas cruz pantojas pleaded guilty to being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm in violation of g and a.he challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his upwardly variant sentence.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
because this appeal follows a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the colloquy,the plea agreement,the presentence investigation report psr,and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.see united states king,cir.
on august,puerto rico police department prpd officers responded to a murder scene at the bellavista sector in bayamón,puerto rico.while at the scene,officers received information that a gray vehicle fled the area at a high rate of speed after gunshots were heard.shortly after,a prpd officer observed a gray vehicle driving slowly in the vicinity of the scene,and after noting that neither the driver nor the passenger was wearing a seatbelt in violation of a puerto rico vehicle and traffic law the officer proceeded to initiate a traffic stop.during the stop,the officer noticed the passenger,later identified to be pantojas,attempting to conceal what appeared to be a firearm in his groin area.after ordering both individuals out of the vehicle,a search of pantojas revealed a model glock pistol modified to fire in full automatic capacity loaded with eight rounds of caliber ammunition hidden in his groin area and a caliber kahr pistol concealed in his waistband.a subsequent search of the vehicle revealed three glock magazines loaded with rounds of caliber ammunition.later on that same date,pantojas admitted to homeland security investigations agents that he had smoked marijuana on a daily basis for many years and that both weapons belonged to him.
on august,pantojas was charged in a indictment.count one,the count of conviction,charged pantojas with being a prohibited person in possession of a firearm in violation of g and a.count two charged him with the illegal possession of a machinegun in violation of o and a.
pantojas pleaded guilty to count one on october,pursuant to a plea agreement.in the plea agreement,the parties calculated a total offense level of seventeen,which resulted from a base offense level of twenty pursuant to a b and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to a,b.the parties agreed that pantojas could request a sentence at the lower end of the applicable guidelines sentencing range gsr,while the government would request a sentence within the gsr.the psr,which was disclosed to the parties on january,calculated the same total offense level and,based on pantojas criminal history category i,yielded a gsr of to thirty months of imprisonment,a fine range of to,and a supervised release term between one and three years.the psr also stated that the maximum term of imprisonment for the offense that pantojas pleaded guilty to was ten years.
the sentencing hearing took place on may.at the hearing,pantojas stated that he had no objections to the psr,and noted that he had filed a sentencing memorandum detailing certain sentencing factors he wanted the court to consider,including his upbringing,which was not one of the most favorable,the lack of a positive father figure in his life,and his susceptibility to peer pressure.pantojas argued for a sentence,while the government recommended that pantojas be sentenced at the high end of the gsr,to thirty months of imprisonment.
after hearing the parties arguments and pantojas allocution,the district court began its consideration of the sentence.it calculated the same total offense level and gsr as the psr and the parties.the district court then stated that it had considered the factors set forth in a.it noted that although pantojas had no prior convictions,he was arrested previously for possession of marijuana,had smoked marijuana since he was twenty years old and a recent voluntary sample provided by pantojas yielded positive results to marijuana and percocet.the district court also noted that pantojas was investigated for murder using one of the firearms for which he was charged in this case and that a commonwealth of puerto rico court had found probable cause against him for the murder,for the illegal possession of the weapon,and for pointing and firing the weapon.the court further stated 
this is one of those cases of a young man with a pistol.the case is different from others because in this case pantojas has been accused of murder using that pistol.it but an example of how puerto rico has a homicide rate four times the national rate and two times that of virtually every other state.
violent crimes and murders are occurring at all hours of the day,at any place on the island,on congested public highways.we have shootings just about every day,in shopping centers,on public basketball courts and even at cultural events like the fiesta de san sebastián.firearms like the one pantojas possessed are present everywhere,obtained by youngsters,like pantojas,who have absolutely no training in the proper use of them and who appear not to have the means to purchase them.
thanks to the firearms initiative which the department of justice of puerto rico and the attorney office have implemented,the number of murders has gone down since 
i have to consider puerto rico high firearms and violent crime rate to impose a sentence in this case,just like i have to consider the fact that probable cause was found against pantojas for murder and weapons violations.
this is not a case of a gun crime being aberrational,as perhaps it would be in a community relatively free of that type of crime.gun crimes are,unfortunately,pervasive throughout the island.this is one of them.
the district court ultimately sentenced pantojas to sixty months of imprisonment two times the top of his be served consecutively with any sentence imposed on pantojas by the court of the commonwealth of puerto rico in his murder case if found guilty,followed by a term of supervised release of three years this appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
pantojas challenges both the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.procedurally,he argues that the district court improperly considered,and relied too heavily on,puerto rico violent crime rate.pantojas also asserts that,pursuant to rule h of the federal rules of criminal procedure,the district court was required to give him notice of the grounds on which it was contemplating a departure from the applicable gsr,and that it failed to do so by not including puerto rico violent crime rate either in the psr or in the proceedings prior to the sentencing hearing.furthermore,pantojas argues that the district court justification for the sentence it imposed was not proportionate to the degree of variance above the gsr.
substantively,pantojas alleges that his sentence was greater than necessary and that the district court abused its discretion by not sentencing him to the plea range.he also claims that the district court gave too much weight to the circumstances of the offense and not enough weight to his personal history and characteristics.finally,pantojas claims that because the district court took into consideration the circumstances of the offense in imposing a sentence consecutive to any sentence that may be imposed by the state court for murder,the district court abused its discretion in further punishing him with an sentence.
reviewing the record as a whole,each of pantojas claims fails,as his sentence is both procedurally sound and substantively reasonable.
we review sentencing decisions imposed under the advisory guidelines,whether outside or inside the applicable gsr,for reasonableness.united states turbides leonardo,cir.generally,we apply the deferential abuse of discretion standard in evaluating the reasonableness of a sentence.gall united states,see also united states del valle rodríguez,cir.if a defendant,however,fails to preserve an objection below,the plain error standard supplants the customary standard of review.united states dávila gonzález,cir.review for plain error entails four showings that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states medina villegas,cir quoting united states duarte,cir.we will not reverse a district court sentence under this standard unless there is a reasonable probability that,but for the error,the district court would have imposed a different,more favorable sentence.id.citing united states mangual garcía,cir.
our review of sentences imposed under the advisory guidelines is a process w e first examine whether the district court committed any procedural missteps and,if the sentence is procedurally sound,we then ask whether the sentence is substantively reasonable.united states rossignol,cir.examples of procedural errors include failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the section a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence including an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.united states trinidad acosta,cir quoting united states rivera moreno,cir.
if we determine that the sentence imposed is procedurally sound,we evaluate its substantive dimension,which focuses on the duration of the sentence in light of the totality of the circumstances.del valle rodríguez,at citing united states martin,cir.there is no one reasonable sentence in any given case but,rather,a universe of reasonable sentencing outcomes.united states clogston,cir citing martin,at.moreover,a sentencing court is under a mandate to consider a myriad of relevant factors,but the weighting of those factors is largely within the court informed discretion.id.at see also united states flores machicote,cir there is no pat formula dictating how these factors interrelate.a sentencing court has broad discretion to assay them and need not afford equal weight to each factor in a given case.ultimately,the linchpin of a reasonable sentence is a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible result.united states narváez soto,cir quoting martin,at.
puerto rico violent crime rate 
pantojas challenges the district court consideration of puerto rico violent crime rate as a factor in sentencing.specifically,he argues that the district court focused too much on statistics of puerto rico violent crime rate,and too little on his personal circumstances.pantojas ultimately alleges that the district court reliance on such considerations amounted to an abuse of discretion.
because pantojas failed to preserve this argument below,we review it for plain error.united states fernándezhernández,cir.however,we find no error,plain or otherwise.
contrary to pantojas contentions,in making sentencing determinations,district courts may consider and geographic factors,including the incidence and trend lines of particular types of crime in the affected community.flores machicote,at see also narváez soto,at in weighing the impact associated with a particular crime,a sentencing court may consider the pervasiveness of that type of crime in the relevant community.indeed,this court has noted the important role of deterrence in the sentencing calculus,and explained that c considerations are inextricably intertwined with deterrence,which aims to prevent criminal behavior by the population at large and,therefore,incorporates some consideration of persons beyond the defendant.flores machicote,at citing united states politano,cir.
although we have stated that i t is possible for a sentencing judge to focus too much on the community and too little on the individual and,thus,impose a sentence that can not withstand the test of procedural reasonableness,id.at,that did not happen here.though the district court considered factors at some length,it is clear from the record that its primary consideration in imposing a sentence above the applicable gsr was the fact that a commonwealth of puerto rico court had found probable cause against pantojas for a murder committed with the weapon he was charged with possessing.this is evident from the following district court statement 
c onsidering that probable cause was determined that pantojas committed a murder using the weapon for which he is charged in this case,the court will impose a sentence above the guideline range.that sentence above the guideline range is the sentence that would reflect the seriousness of the offense,would promote respect for the law,would protect the public from further crimes by pantojas and would address the issue of deterrence and punishment.
the record shows that the district court also gave serious consideration to pantojas history and characteristics,emphasizing his drug use and prior arrest for drug possession.thus,it is clear that the district court sentencing rationale was neither dominated nor improperly influenced by considerations.see narváez soto,at the analytic centerpiece of the court sentencing rationale was the crime of conviction,and there is no satisfactory footing for a conclusion that considerations either dominated or improperly influenced the fashioning of the sentence.
pantojas argument that the district court erred by relying on crime statistics because crime has been decreasing nationwide,as well as in puerto rico,fares no better.see id.at even if certain types of violent crime are more prevalent in other places than the court realized,that does not detract from the court reasoned determination,predicated on its experience,that the incidence of violent crime and,particularly,violent crime is an acute problem in puerto rico.
accordingly,the district court committed no procedural error let alone a plain one in considering factors and the prevalence of gun violence in sentencing pantojas.
lack of notice 
pantojas next procedural challenge that the district court erred by failing to give him advance notice of its reliance on puerto rico violent crime rate as a basis for a departure from the applicable as well.rule h of the federal rules of criminal procedure states as follows 
before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party prehearing submission,the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure.the notice must specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure.
however,rule h does not apply to variances by its terms.irizarry united states,see also united states adorno molina,cir t he rule applies only to authorized departures under the sentencing guidelines and not to variances,sentences that result from the sentencing judge considerations of factors under.here,the district court sentence was based explicitly on the a sentencing factors,and was therefore a variance rather than a departure.regarding the need for notice before imposing a variant sentence,we have held that a judge must provide advance notice or grant a continuance only in those cases where the district court proposed to adopt a variance sentence relying on some ground or fact that would unfairly surprise competent and reasonably prepared counsel.politano,at quoting united states vega santiago,cir en banc alteration and emphasis in the original.
as described above,the district court in this case relied primarily on three grounds for varying from the gsr the seriousness of the crime,the history and characteristics of the defendant,and the need for deterrence these grounds fall within the garden variety considerations which should not generally come as a surprise to trial lawyers who have prepared for sentencing.id.thus,the district court did not have to give pantojas any notice of its consideration of puerto rico violent crime rate and did not commit any procedural error by failing to do so.
sufficiency of the explanation for the chosen sentence 
pantojas also challenges the district court justification for imposing an sentence,claiming that its explanation of the sentence is insufficient and not proportionate to the magnitude of the variance from the gsr.under c,a sentencing court must state in open court the reasons for the particular sentence it
