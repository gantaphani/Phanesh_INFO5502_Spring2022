yamil and jorge alberto each pled guilty to one count of carjacking with intent to cause death or serious bodily harm,resulting in death.the victim was a sailor in the united states navy,stationed in puerto rico.the district court sentenced both defendants to life imprisonment.the defendants now claim that the district court misunderstood and failed to explain the intent element of.they argue that,given a proper understanding of that intent element,the district court would not have found a rational basis for their pleas.they also contend that if the district court had explained the intent element of the carjacking charge as the supreme court explained it in holloway united states,d,they would not have pleaded guilty.defendant alleges an additional error that the government violated its plea agreement with him by urging the judge to impose a life sentence rather than a term of years.we affirm.
we draw the facts from the change of plea hearing,the report,and the factual stipulation agreed to by the government and defendant.see united states,cir.we leave some details for discussion in connection with the defendants allegations of error.
on a mission for their colleagues in the illegal drug business,the defendants were looking for a sports utility vehicle to steal.they saw a toyota they liked outside a video rental store in fajardo,puerto rico.when the toyota owner emerged from the store,the defendants approached him.both defendants brandished handguns.defendant pressed his handgun against the victim back and said,according to the fbi agent who investigated the crime,get in the car if you want to live.the defendants seized the keys to the toyota and ordered the victim,at gunpoint,to lie down in the rear of the vehicle.they then drove the stolen toyota towards rio grande.
while driving,the defendants asked the victim where he lived.he said that he was a native of north carolina but was living at the navy base in ceiba.once realized that the victim was a sailor,he decided to kill him.several minutes later,the defendants stopped in a wooded area.when the victim attempted to escape,hit him with his handgun.the defendants then led the victim into the nearby woods.removed a piece of jewelry from the victim person as the victim pleaded for his life.then shot the victim in the back of the head.
the defendants soon were apprehended and confessed essentially to the facts outlined above.initially,told investigators that attempted to shoot the victim but that his gun had jammed.however,denied either attempting to shoot the victim or intending that he be killed.federal authorities charged each defendant with aiding and abetting the other in one count of carjacking with intent to cause death or serious bodily injury,and two counts of firearms violations.after consultation with counsel,the defendants agreed to plead guilty to the carjacking count.in exchange,the government pledged not to seek the death penalty,to dismiss the firearms charges,to recommend a sentencing guideline level of for both defendants,and to stipulate that was not the shooter of the victim and did not at any time intend that the victim be killed.
this case involves the relatively complex intent element of,the federal carjacking statute,which the parties interpret differently.the arguments also reveal some confusion as to whether indictment as an aider and abettor somehow changes that intent element.we provide some preliminary explanations before addressing the defendants arguments.
a.the carjacking statute 
the statute to which the defendants pled guilty,reads 
whoever,with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm takes a motor vehicle that has been transported,shipped,or received in interstate or foreign commerce from the person or presence of another by force and violence or by intimidation,or attempts to do so,shall 
if death results,be fined under this title or imprisoned for any number of years up to life,or both,or sentenced to death.
contrary to the suggestion of the government,this statute is not a felony murder analog see united states,cir c arjacking is a specialized offense,requiring a specific criminal act and a narrow mens rea.even if death results,the statute requires intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.a felony murder statute is defined by the absence of any such intent element consequently,the carjacking charges against the defendants required the government to prove not only that the defendants committed a carjacking and that they killed the victim,but also that they acted with intent to cause death or serious bodily harm.
conditional intent 
in holloway,the supreme court confronted the meaning of the phrase with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm in the carjacking statute.the question in holloway was whether that phrase requires the government to prove that the defendant had an unconditional intent to kill or harm in all events,or whether it merely requires proof of an intent to kill or harm if necessary to effect a carjacking.at.the court answered that question as follows 
the specific issue in this case is what sort of evil motive congress intended to describe when it used the words with the intent to cause death or serious bodily harm more precisely,the question is whether a person who points a gun at a driver,having decided to pull the trigger if the driver does not comply with the demand for the car keys,possesses the intent,at that moment,to seriously harm the driver.in our view,the answer to that question does not depend on whether the driver immediately hands over the keys or what the offender decides to do after he gains control over the car.at the relevant moment,the offender plainly does have the forbidden intent.
id.at.in short,if this case had gone to trial,the government would have had to prove that the defendants a took or attempted to take the victim car through force and violence or by intimidation,b that they acted with conditional or unconditional intent to cause death or serious bodily harm,and c that death resulted.
the relevant moment for conditional intent 
we have encountered cases,including this case,where a carjacking defendant is accused of stealing a car,taking its driver as a hostage,and later killing or harming the driver even though the defendant already was in control of the car.see,united states,cir concerning a defendant who argued that his intent to seriously harm or kill the victim had not developed until after he had seized control of the victim car and realized that the victim was a police officer united states,cir same.in these cases,defendants have suggested that they were not guilty of carjacking because their intent to harm or kill the victim did not exist at the beginning of the carjacking.see id.at.in other words,these defendants contend that they could not be found guilty of carjacking if a jury finds that their intent to kill or seriously harm the driver developed only after the car had been taken.this interpretation of the carjacking statute stems from the several references in holloway,as in the quotation above,to the carjacking defendant intent as of the moment of a carjacking.the court summarized its holding as follows 
the intent requirement of is satisfied when the government proves that at the moment the defendant demanded or took control over the driver automobile the defendant possessed the intent to seriously harm or kill the driver if necessary to steal the car or,alternatively,if unnecessary to steal the car.
holloway,at.emphasis added.
the defendants contend that we have interpreted the language in holloway to mean that a defendant is not guilty of carjacking if his intent to kill or seriously harm the driver develops only after he has stolen the driver car and taken the driver as a hostage.see,at t he mental state required by the statute intent to cause death or serious bodily harm is measured at the moment that the defendant demands or takes control of the vehicle.other circuits addressing this issue have decided that intent in a carjacking case must be measured at the precise moment the defendant demanded or took control over the car.united states harris,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also united states applewhaite,cir t he statute directs the factfinder attention to the defendant state of mind at the precise moment he demanded or took control over the car.see also hornby,pattern criminal jury instructions for the district courts of the first circuit,revisions,available at http last visited july,citing,at for the requirement that the carjacking defendant intended to cause death or serious bodily harm at the time demanded or took control of the motor vehicle.
the government takes a different view,arguing that the statute applies as long as the proscribed intent existed at any time while the defendants had control over the victim and his car.to that end,the government urges us to adopt a position set forth in a concurring opinion by a member of our court that holloway should not be read to limit the jury focus to the commencement of the carjacking in cases like this one,which involve takings of hostages that occur over some period of time,at howard,concurring internal quotation marks omitted 
as we will explain,the facts of this case,like those in,do not require us to resolve the question whether the intent element for carjacking must be measured at the commencement of a prolonged carjacking.accordingly,we will simply assume without deciding that the defendants view of the issue is correct.
liability as an accomplice in a carjacking case 
the indictment reads that aiding and abetting each other with the intent to cause death and serious bodily injury,the defendants did take a motor vehicle from the victim,by force and violence this charge indicted both defendants as principals and as aiders and abettors.see,united states bennett,cir analyzing a similar indictment.as it turns out,both defendants pled guilty as principals.there was,as we will explain,an ample factual basis for those pleas.
however,unwilling to fully acknowledge his culpability as a principal,argues that the stipulation that he was not the shooter of the victim and did not at any time intend that the victim be killed means that he did not share criminal intent and could not be found guilty as accomplice.it is true that an aider and abettor must share in the principal essential criminal intent.united states tarr,cir quoting united states sanborn,cir.see also,lafave,substantive criminal law,b ed.an accomplice is liable only when he shares the requisite mental state for the principal crime,at the aider and abetter must have shared the principal criminal intent.united states loder,cir if required proof of intent to kill,who did not at any time intend that the victim be killed,could no more be guilty as an aider and abettor than he could as a principal however,the carjacking statute makes proof of an intent to seriously harm the driver sufficient to impose liability.holloway,at.intent to inflict serious bodily harm on the victim was not the subject of any stipulation,and he could be guilty as a principal or as an aider and abettor on the basis of such intent.
we first address the overlapping issues common to both defendants whether there was a factual basis for the intent element of the carjacking charge and whether any errors in the plea colloquy prevented a knowing and voluntary plea.we then address claim that the government violated its plea agreement with him.
a.the plea colloquy 
standard of review 
neither defendant objected to the district court plea colloquy before taking this appeal.indeed,while more than a year and a half passed between the guilty pleas and the sentencing hearings,neither defendant sought to withdraw his plea during that period.accordingly,we review only for plain error.united states morrisette,cir to earn relief,the defendants must show that an error occurred,and that the error was clear or obvious,affected their substantial rights,and seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.to meet prong three,each defendant is obliged to show a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.united states dominguez benitez,d.
basis in fact for the pleas 
the defendants contend that the district court violated.by accepting their guilty pleas in the absence of a factual basis for the intent element of the carjacking charge.their claim is that they did not have any intent to harm or kill the victim until after they had seized his car and learned while driving towards rio grande that he was a sailor.hence,they argue,their intent to harm or kill did not meet the at the moment requirement of holloway.as we indicated above,we will assume the validity of the defendants reading of holloway.
rule requires that b efore entering judgment on a guilty plea,the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.b.we have explained that the district court has a duty,in plea proceedings,to ascertain whether the record permits a conclusion that the plea has a rational basis in fact.united states,cir.however,rule does not require a test of guilt versus innocence,much less proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is in fact guilty,id.quoting united states webb,cir.the idea is for the district court to ensure that there is,on the record as it stands at the time of the plea,a reasoned basis to believe that the defendant actually committed the crime to which he is admitting guilt.see united states cheal,cir.the facts relevant to this inquiry may come either from the defendant admissions and concessions or from credible evidence proffered by the government and not contradicted by the defendant,at.
first,as to,the evidence proffered by the government easily met the requisite standard,even under his interpretation of the law.to take the victim car,pressed a loaded handgun against the victim body and threatened the victim with death.the presence of ammunition,the death threats,and the fact that he eventually did kill the victim,provide a rational basis to believe that was willing to fire his gun if necessary to steal the car.see,at cir holding that conditional intent to kill could be inferred as to two defendants from fact that one of the defendants placed a loaded and cocked revolver against the victim head and verbally threatened him.see also united states jones,cir holding that conditional intent could be inferred from brandishing of handgun and death threats.
the stipulation between the government and precludes any rational basis to believe that he,too,had a conditional intent to kill the victim.however,as we indicated above,the intent element of the carjacking statute requires that at the moment the defendant demanded or took control over the driver automobile the defendant possessed the intent to seriously harm or kill the driver if necessary to steal the car.holloway,at.emphasis added.the record provides a factual basis that had the requisite intent to seriously harm.like,he threatened the victim with a handgun at the moment of the carjacking.he later demonstrated his willingness to inflict violent harm when he struck the victim with his handgun.
in short,the record provided an adequate basis for the district court to conclude that both defendants were guilty as principals in the carjacking death of the victim.both defendants participated in taking by force and intimidation a vehicle subject to the jurisdiction of the federal government.both defendants possessed at the moment they demanded or took control over the driver automobile the intent to seriously harm or kill the driver if necessary to steal the car.the victim death resulted.these are the elements that the statute requires.see.
a knowing and voluntary plea 
rule requires that the district court ensure that a defendant guilty plea is knowing and voluntary.the due process clause requires the same.see,at.b ecause a guilty plea is an admission of all of the elements of a formal criminal charge,it can not be truly voluntary unless the defendant possesses an understanding of the law in relation to the facts.mccarthy united states,d.accordingly,rule explicitly requires that the district court inform the defendant of,and determine that the defendant understands the natur
