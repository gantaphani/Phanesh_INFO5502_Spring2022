this appeal presents the narrow question of whether,under the circumstances here presented,eduardo rosa new york guilty plea to a charge of robbery in the first degree qualifies as a violent felony conviction under the armed career criminal act,e the acca.the district court decided that it did,and that,therefore,it was bound to impose on rosa a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years months imprisonment under the acca.
we disagree.under shepard united states,d,decided shortly before the district court handed down this sentence,the district court was required to determine whether rosa earlier guilty plea necessarily admitted,and supported a conviction for,id.at,an act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or carrying of a firearm that would be punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year if committed by an adult,e b.in doing so,the court was limited to the terms of the charging document,the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant,or to some comparable judicial record of this information.shepard,at.no such document,at least none submitted to the district court,established that rosa guilty plea necessarily admitted,and supported a conviction for,id.at,an act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or carrying of a firearm that would be punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year if committed by an adult,e b.we therefore vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.
background 
on january,new york state police officers,acting on a tip from a confidential informant,executed a search warrant for the basement of eduardo rosa home.there,they discovered two caliber handguns rounds of ammunition,and a vest.rosa was arrested on the same day.he was indicted on february.he was charged with two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g counts one and two,and one count of possession of body armor after having been convicted of a felony that is a crime of violence in violation of count three.
a superseding indictment the superseding indictment was returned on january,less than one week before trial was scheduled to begin in the united states district court for the southern district of new york charles brieant,judge.it contained the same three charges as the original indictment but added allegations in counts one and two that rosa had three prior convictions for either violent felony or serious drug offenses,as those terms are defined in the acca,e.superseding indictment,united states rosa,no.clb,at.
on the morning of january,the day on which the trial was scheduled to begin,rosa pleaded guilty,without a formal plea agreement,to all three counts of the superseding indictment.
according to the presentence investigation report federal psr,rosa previously had been convicted of eight other offenses.the probation office and the government classified three of his prior convictions as violent felonies within the meaning of the acca 
on may,rosa was convicted in new york,after a guilty plea,of robbery in the first degree,a class b felony,in westchester county court.he received an adjudication as a youthful offender and was sentenced to probation.
on october,rosa was convicted in a north carolina state court of the felony of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill or inflicting serious injury.
on october,rosa was convicted of assault in the second degree,a class d felony,in westchester county court.
rosa concedes that the second and third convictions qualify as violent felonies for acca purposes.he denies,however,that the first conviction,for robbery in the first degree,also qualifies as a violent felony under the acca.if it did,rosa would be subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment.e.the narrow question of whether it was properly so classified is the focus of this appeal.
robbery conviction 
on november,at age fifteen,rosa and one or more of his acquaintances robbed another person of his jacket.
on march,in an indictment in westchester county supreme court,rosa,along with steven warren,was charged on four counts.the first count accused rosa and warren of robbery in the first degree pursuant to new york penal law 
the defendants,in the county of westchester and state of new york,on or about november,each aiding and abetting the other and acting in concert,did forcibly steal property from another person,and in the course of the commission of the crime and in immediate flight therefrom,displayed what appeared to be a pistol,revolver and other firearm,to wit,a handgun.this is an armed felony offense.
indictment of steven warren and edwardo sic rosa,supreme court,westchester,filed,the indictment at.
on march,some two weeks later,the state prosecutor filed a bill of particulars in a list of evidence subject to discovery and inspection,the bill of particulars referred to a small cal.type gun that was not recovered and therefore would not be submitted as physical evidence at trial as a w eapon used in the crime.people rosa,indictment,consent order dated,bill of particulars,at.the bill of particulars set forth the substance of the defendant conduct encompassed by the charges set forth in the indictment which the people intend to prove upon trial,id.at the group did place a gun in the stomach area of the victim while stealing his jacket,id.unpaginated attachment.
rosa pleaded guilty to robbery in the first degree.the other three charges were apparently thereafter discontinued.during the plea colloquy,rosa admitted that he aided and abetted other people who forcibly stole property from another while display ing what appeared to be a pistol,revolver or other firearm,to wit,a handgun.but rosa denied that he ever carried a handgun.although his counsel referred to a pistol during the colloquy,throughout the plea allocution the judge consistently adhered to the terminology of the someone other than rosa displayed what appeared to be a handgun.
in accepting the plea,the judge and the defendant engaged in the following colloquy 
judge q rosa,do you admit to the crime of robbery in the first degree 
rosa a yes.
q do you admit at that time and place,while aiding and abetting and acting in concert with other individuals,you did forcibly steal property from another person,that person being romeo

the state presentence report relating to rosa conviction state psr included several references to a black handgun.it cited a statement by the victim that he felt and observed a black handgun pressed into his stomach.it also noted that a bus driver said he saw one of the perpetrators holding what appeared to be a black automatic handgun.but the state psr also described rosa as saying that a apparently had in his possession a bb gun.
the state trial judge made no direct findings pertaining to the state psr or the actual use of a firearm.the judge only mention of a than what appeared to be a made during the sentencing hearing to acknowledge that one of the circumstances supporting a more lenient sentence was that rosa was not the one who wielded the gun.people rosa,indictment,westchester county,tr.of sentencing,may,sentencing at.rosa attorney,seeking to minimize the sentence,also referred to a gun at that hearing i t was not eduardo rosa who had the gun in this particular incident.id.at.as noted,he also referred to a pistol during the plea allocution in explaining what rosa was not pleading to.see plea tr.at your honor,rosa ca admit to displaying a pistol he can admit to aiding and abetting of displaying a pistol but not that he did it himself.
district court sentencing 
the federal psr provided no explanation for its characterization of the robbery conviction as a conviction of a violent felony.in describing this prior conviction,it referenced the state psr,including the passage where the victim of the robbery stated that he felt a black handgun pressed against him.the probation office sentencing recommendation corresponded to what the government had set forth in a pimentel letter dated january.see united states pimentel,cir.rosa made no objection to the probation office regarding the federal psr.he did,however,submit a letter to the district court on may,objecting to the psr assertion that rosa qualified as an armed career criminal under the acca.
at sentencing in the district court,the government acknowledged that unless the putative weapon was in fact a real gun,the robbery conviction would count as a violent felony under the acca.united states rosa,clb june,sentencing tr.sentencing tr.at see e b defining violent felony.but the government maintained that the object used must be inferred to have been a firearm,and,therefore,that rosa qualified as an armed career criminal under the statute.united states rosa,clb,letter from government to the district court dated june,sentencing mem.at.
in its sentencing memorandum,the government asserted that rosa conviction satisfied the statutory requirements for three reasons 
first,the government argued,the defendant admitted that a firearm was used by pleading guilty to robbery in the first degree,thereby waiving an affirmative defense that the firearm was not a loaded weapon from which a shot could be discharged.penal law.because the availability of this affirmative defense is the only relevant distinction here between first and second degree robbery,the government asserted,the defendant plea to first degree robbery waived the affirmative defense and logically required the conclusion that the offense involved a gun.sentencing mem.at.
second,the government asserted,the records from the state court proceeding,including the state psr,the bill of particulars,and the sentencing transcript,establish that the perpetrator wielded a firearm.because rosa need not be the one who carried the gun as long as the crime involv ed its use,united states king,cir,the offense qualified as a violent felony.sentencing mem.at.
finally,the government argued,by failing to object to the federal psr,which included language from the state psr in which the victim referred to a gun,rosa waived any objection to this characterization of the state offense.id.at.
the district court accepted the government arguments,concluding that rosa was a career criminal under the united states sentencing guidelines or the guidelines.sentencing tr.at.after applying the guidelines enhancement for an armed career criminal pursuant to,and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility the defendant net offense level was.with a criminal history category of vi,his guidelines sentencing range was to months the court then imposed a sentence of the mandatory counts one and two,and months imprisonment for count three,all to be served concurrently.
rosa appeals his sentence.
discussion 
issue presented 
the armed career criminal act,e,mandates a minimum prison sentence for anyone possessing a firearm after three prior convictions for serious drug offenses or violent felonies.shepard united states,d as relevant here,the term violent felony includes any act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or carrying of a firearm,knife,or destructive device that would be punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year if committed by an adult.e b rosa does not dispute that his conviction for first degree robbery,a class b felony,would have been punishable in new york by a term of imprisonment of more than one year.see penal law robbery in the first degree is a class b felony.id.b maximum sentence for a class b felony is years.
new york law defines first degree robbery,in pertinent part,as follows 
a person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when he forcibly steals property and when,in the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom,he or another participant in the crime 
displays what appears to be a pistol,revolver,rifle,shotgun,machine gun or other firearm except that in any prosecution under this subdivision,it is an affirmative defense that such pistol,revolver,rifle,shotgun,machine gun or other firearm was not a loaded weapon from which a shot,readily capable of producing death or other serious physical injury,could be discharged.nothing contained in this subdivision shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for,or preclude a conviction of,robbery in the second degree,robbery in the third degree or any other crime.
id.emphasis added see also people padua,dep t describing the state burden when charging a defendant under section.count one of the indictment against rosa and his codefendant tracked the statute.see indictment at.
during his plea colloquy in state court,as to count one,the only count to which he pleaded,rosa admitted that he had aided and abetted another in forcibly steal ing property from another person and that what appeared to be a handgun was displayed by the people with whom he was acting in concert and aiding and abetting.plea tr.at.these admissions regarding what appeared to be a handgun satisfied the elements of the first degree robbery crime with which he was charged.see penal law.but,standing alone,they do not satisfy the elements of a violent felony as defined by the acca.to be a violent felony,the crime of conviction must involv e the use or carrying of a firearm.e b emphasis added.because,as the government concedes,the conviction is a violent felony only if the crime involved a firearm,sentencing tr.at,the district court was confronted with the question of whether the crime involved a firearm.adopting the government arguments,the district court determined that it did.
the sole question for us on appeal is did the district court properly determine that rosa conviction involv ed the use or carrying of a firearm,as opposed to the use of a bb gun,or something else other than a firearm,thereby making it a violent felony for acca purposes to answer this question we must consider whether the district court looked to appropriate sources in determining the nature of rosa conviction for acca purposes.see shepard,at.addressing whether a sentencing court can look to police reports or complaint applications to determine whether an earlier guilty plea necessarily admitted,and supported a conviction for,generic burglary,which is a violent felony under the acca.
rosa argues that the district court erred in applying the mandatory minimum under the acca because the state court record does not necessarily demonstrate that the conviction for robbery involved a firearm,and,therefore,the government did not prove the robbery conviction was for a violent felony under the acca the government arguments are essentially the same as those rehearsed above that it made to,and were accepted by,the district court.
ii.standard of review 
t he government bears the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence,the existence of prior violent felony convictions when seeking a sentence enhancement pursuant to e.united states brown,cir.the questions of what documents a district court may rely on to determine the nature of a prior conviction and of the scope of a district court authority to make factual findings are questions of law,shepard,at.id.at.opinion of souter,which we review de novo 
iii.determining the character of a prior guilty plea 
in taylor united states,d,the court endorsed a categorical approach to determining whether a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the acca.the sentencing court generally must look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.id.at.where,as in taylor and here,the statutory definition of the state crime of conviction encompasses both crimes that would qualify as a violent felony and crimes that would not,however,the taylor court concluded that a broader inquiry is permissible.id.if,as in taylor but not here,guilt of the prior offense was determined at trial,that broader inquiry may include the charging document and jury instructions,which define the offense of conviction.id 
shepard and taylor both addressed the question whether a burglary conviction in a state whose law defined burglary more broadly than the generic definition of example,a state that defined burglary as including breaking and entry into a building or a boat,in contrast to generic burglary,which is limited to breaking and entry into based on facts that could support a conviction for generic burglary,and thus could fit the definition of violent felony under the acca shepard addressed a question left open by taylor what may a district court consider to determine whether the offense of conviction following a guilty plea,rather than trial,qualifies as a violent felony shepard,at.
in shepard,the district court had not applied the acca mandatory minimum sentence because it had declined to look to police reports or complaint applications to determine whether an earlier guilty plea necessarily admitted,and supported a conviction for,generic burglary.id.without this evidence,the district court found that the government had failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that shepard had pleaded to three generic burglaries.id.at.the first circuit vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing a fter observing that shepard had never seriously disputed that he did in fact commit the acts described in the police reports and complaint applications.id.at.citation omitted.
the supreme court reversed.it concluded that enquiry under the acca to determine whether a plea of guilty to burglary defined by a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging document,the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant,or to some comparable judicial record of this information.id.at.
like jury instructions in a jury case,or the details of a generically limited charging document in any sort of case,documents stating the facts to which the defendant admitted in entering the plea will generally inform a later court on the crucial question whether the plea had necessarily rested on the fact identifying the burglary as generic.id.at.the court rejected the government argument for a wider evidentiary cast,going beyond conclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt and looking to documents submitted to lower courts even prior to charges,because such an approach would ease away from the taylor conclusion,that respect for congressional intent and avoidance of collateral trials require that evidence of generic conviction be confined to records of the convicting court approaching the certainty of the record of conviction in a generic crime state,id.at.
a plurality of the court was of the view that developments since jones united states,d,and apprendi new jersey,d further justify adher ing to the demanding requirement that any sentence under the acca rest on a showing that a prior conviction necessarily involved and a prior plea necessarily admitted facts equating to generic burglary.shepard,at.opinion of souter,emphasis added.jones and apprendi established the rule that for the sake of preserving the sixth amendment right,any fact other than a prior conviction sufficient to raise the limit of the possible federal sentence must be found by a jury,in the absence of any waiver of rights by the defendant.id.at.citing jones and apprendi.where t he state statute requires no finding of generic burglary,and without a charging document that narrows the charge to generic limits,the only certainty of a generic finding lies in a pleaded case in the defendant own admissions or accepted findings of fact confirming the factual basis for a valid plea.id.at.were the sentencing judge,in considering the acca enhancement,to make a disputed finding of fact about what the defendant and state judge must have understood as the factual basis of the prior plea,the factfinding would raise the constitutional concern underlying jones and apprendi.id.
in shepard,the court concluded that the fact in shepard had broken into the buildings described in the police reports or complaint though it was undisputed by the defendant,was too far removed from the conclusive significance of a prior judicial record,and too much like the findings subject to jones and apprendi.id.the plurality therefore would have limited the permissible sources of judicial factfinding to exclude police reports and complaint applications in order,in part,to avoid the risk of unconstitutionality.id.at.
shepard teaches that the sentencing court can not make its own finding of fact regarding whether a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony or serious drug offense under the acca.id.at.majority opinion noting,and later rejecting,the government argument for allowing a sentencing court to rely on documents beyond conclusive records made or used in adjudicating guilt.the sentencing court must rely on evidence from the record of conviction to determine whether the earlier guilty plea in question necessarily admitted,and supported a conviction for,a violent felony,id.at.if such evidence is not available,then the government has not met its burden to demonstrate that the prior conviction was a violent felony.speculation based on inferences is misplaced in light of the supreme court concern about establishing with certainty that a prior conviction is a predicate crime under the acca.see id.at.discussing taylor demand for certainty.
the shepard court indicated that documents relating to the plea itself a transcript of a plea colloquy or written plea agreement presented to the court,or a record of comparable findings of fact adopted by the defendant upon entering the plea would be the closest analogs to the judicial record evidence approved in taylor.id.at.these analogs were different from the reports and complaint the government had urged the shepard district court to consider.
here,the government urged the district court to look to one document,the bill of particulars,and to other documents,documents relating not to the taking of rosa plea in state supreme court,but to his sentencing there.the district court relied upon the bill of particulars filed in the state case,the state psr,the state sentencing transcript,and the federal psr prepared in this case in determining the factual basis of rosa conviction.it also drew logical inferences about facts underlying an affirmative defense that rosa waived by virtue of his plea.sentencing tr.at see also sentencing mem.at.
we pause to note that the shepard court was apparently concerned about the prospect of a sentencing court making any factual finding not necessarily implied by the prior of how clearly the factual finding was established.the state psr here reveals a disputed assertion of fact whether the gun was a firearm.but shepard,by concluding that it did not matter whether the defendant in that case disputed that he had broken into the buildings in question and thereby committed a generic burglary,shepard,at,implies that it does not matter here whether the assertion that the crime of conviction involved a firearm was disputed or not.
for us to affirm the district court conclusion that the gun was a firearm,then,the documents and inferences that the district court used to reach this conclusion must qualify as shepard evidence,in this case,documents that show that the earlier guilty plea necessarily admitted,and supported a conviction for,id.at,an offense involving the use or carrying of a firearm,e b.we conclude that they do not.
a.the bill of particulars 
the bill of particulars filed by the people in support of the indictment included the statement that a small cal.type gun,which the government intended to prove at trial was used in the crime,was not recovered and therefore would not be submitted as physical evidence at trial,and described the conduct that the people intended to prove at trial as involving a gun.the district court,in sentencing rosa,incorporated by reference the government sentencing memorandum which made reference to the bill of particulars.but since no mention of it was made in the government presentation to us,we asked the parties for,and received,supplemental briefing on whether the bill of particulars is a charging document under shepard from which the district court might have concluded that what appeared to be a pistol was in fact a firearm under the acca.we conclude that,assuming that the issue has not been waived by the government the bill of particulars does not satisfy the requirements of shepard.
we assume for purposes of this discussion that the bill of particulars may best be characterized as a charging document.we are not convinced,notwithstanding the shepard court reference to charging document s as potentially reliable indicia of the nature of prior convictions,that the bill is therefore shepard evidence for our purposes.see shepard,at.rosa did not stand trial.the bill of particulars did not help define the crime of which he was convicted,see taylor,at,or serve to limit the charges that he could have pleaded guilty to,see shepard,at.at most,the bill of particulars limited only what the state would have been allowed to prove against rosa had the case gone to trial.see,people greaves,dep t reversing rape conviction because of violation of the defendant fundamental and nonwaivable right to be tried on only those crimes charged in the indictment as limited by the bill of particulars.
rosa admitted at his plea allocution to having acted in concert with and aided and abetted people who had displayed what appeared to be a handgun.plea tr.at emphasis added.his plea of guilty to count one was an admission of that with which he was and abetting and acting in concert with others in forcibly steal ing property from another person in the course of which one of the perpetrators display ed what appeared to be a handgun.id.emphasis added.but nothing he said constituted an admission of the use by anyone in any way of a firearm in connection with the crime.
to be sure,the bill of particulars referred to a small cal.type gun that was not therefore would not be submitted as physical evidence at trial as a w eapon used in the crime but that the people intended to demonstrate had been used by the during the course of the robbery.perhaps the people would have established such use had a trial taken place.but there was no trial.and rosa,in pleading guilty,pleaded only to participating in a robbery involving what appeared to be a handgun.during the state probation office interview,he expressly stated that a bb gun,which is not a firearm,was used.we therefore can not conclude that rosa necessarily pleaded to a crime involving the use of a firearm,regardless of the allegations in the bill of particulars.
our conclusion may be in tension with those of two of our sister circuits.in united states simms,cir,cert.denied,d,the fourth circuit approved a district court reliance on a victim statement because it was later explicitly incorporated into maryland statement of charges against simms.id.at.taylor and shepard specifically allow district courts to consider charging documents in determining the nature of prior convictions.id.we do not disagree.but we do not think,nor did the fourth circuit say or imply,that the characterization of evidence as a charging document concludes the inquiry.on the facts before us,even accepting that the bill of particulars was a charging document,as we do for these purposes,we do not think that rosa pleaded guilty to,or otherwise admitted the allegations contained in the bill thus,he did not necessarily plead to a charge involving a firearm.it may well be that simms,in pleading guilty to the charges against him,did,by contrast,allocute to the factual elements that the witness described and that were later incorporated by the state in its statement of charges.
in united states jones,cir,cert.denied,d,the sixth circuit concluded that 
an affidavit of complaint is a type of record that a district court can properly rely on in determining the nature of predicate offenses,consistent with the standards of shepard.complaints are judicial documents,filed under oath and submitted in furtherance of formal prosecution.they bear,accordingly,substantially greater indicia of reliability than mere police reports,which are not filed in court,are not sworn to,and are developed for an investigatory purpose.
id.at citation omitted.as we have said,we do not think that every document properly classified as a charging document in a state case to which a defendant pleads guilty is ipso facto probative on the issue of whether the defendant necessarily pleaded guilty to a violent felony.and we do not think,as the jones court seemed to indicate,that the question before us is whether the unsworn bill of particulars bear s indicia of reliability.the dispositive question is whether the plea necessarily rested on the fact,shepard,at,that the crime to which rosa pleaded involv ed the use or carrying of a firearm.we do not think that it did.
we conclude that the bill of particulars,even if a charging document,was not one upon which the district court could rely in concluding that the defendant pleaded guilty in state court in to a felony involving a firearm.it therefore could not support the district court application of the acca to rosa.
federal psr 
the federal psr can not satisfy shepard either.see united states,cir a presentence report in a subsequent case ordinarily may not be used to prove the details of the offense conduct that underlies a prior conviction.united states,cir u nder shepard,a district court is not permitted to rely on a psr characterization of a defendant prior offense for enhancement purposes.that the federal psr relies entirely on the state psr for the fact of the involvement of a firearm further undermines the ability of the district court to use it to establish the nature of the crime to which rosa pleaded guilty.see shepard,at.
some circuits have held that a sentencing court may look to a psr prepared for that case to determine the underlying facts of a previous conviction when the defendant fails to object to the psr findings,and thereby assents to those facts.see,united states siegel,cir concluding that the defendant failure to object in the sentencing court and on appeal to the factual description of his prior conviction in the psr amounts to an adoption of the factual record included therein,and that the facts averred in the psr acceded to by siegel avoid the collateral trial,and judicial factfinding preempted by the court holding in shepard united states cullen,cir by not objecting to the psr factual allegations,the defendant has admitted them.citation omitted.we need not decide whether we would adopt such a rule.although rosa failed to lodge any objection to the psr directly with the probation office,he submitted a sentencing memorandum to the district court dated may,specifically objecting to the psr findings regarding the conviction.we therefore can not conclude that rosa admitted the findings in the federal psr by failing to object to them.
c.the state psr 
as discussed,the state psr prepared following rosa conviction cited conflicting evidence about the nature of the object used during the robbery.it contained a victim statement that during the robbery the victim felt and observed a black handgun pressed into his stomach,and a witness statement that one of the perpetrators was holding what appeared to be a black automatic handgun.but it also contained a statement by rosa that rosa apparently had in his possession a bb gun which is not a firearm under the acca.the state psr itself,then,seems to reflect a disputed issue of fact as to the nature of the object used during the robbery.
we have not yet addressed whether,in light of shepard,a district court may look to facts about the nature of the offense presented in a state presentence report in determining whether a prior conviction constitutes a violent felony under the acca.the fact that the state psr quotes the victim or a witness making references to a handgun does not establish,the government agrees,that rosa necessarily pleaded to an offense involving a firearm,as shepard requires this is especially so where,as here,the state psr also describes a statement disputing the victim assertions.see shepard,at.see also united states grier,cir en banc sloviter,dissenting i submit that after shepard,a presentence report without more can not be the basis for a finding of an offense that is the predicate for a sentence enhancement.the government relies on the state psr,instead,to prove those facts described in the state psr that were explicitly adopted by the trial judge to which rosa assented.gov t br.at.as we discuss in the next section,however,we disagree with the government view that the relevant facts in the state psr were explicitly adopted by the trial judge or assented to by rosa 
the state psr here does not provide a basis for determining the nature of the defendant conduct any better than does a police report,which,the shepard court ruled,do es not define the conduct to which a defendant eventually pleads guilty.united states green,cir applying shepard.to begin with,it appears that the state psr drew its descriptions of statements by the victim and witness directly from the police reports rather than an independent investigation.see state psr at noting dependence of descriptions on city of new rochelle police department records.like the police reports in shepard,neither the police reports from which the state psr drew support nor the accounts of the nature of the object used in the offense were mentioned at rosa pleas or read by the judge to rosa during the plea colloquy.shepard,at.rosa was never asked if the information contained in the psr w as true.id.first brackets added see id.shepard stated that none of the details in th e police reports w as ever mentioned at his pleas,that the reports themselves were never read by the judge to him during the plea colloquy,and that at no time was he ever asked if the information contained in the police r eports w as true.third brackets added citation to district court opinion omitted.to the extent that the district court relied on the state psr itself to support its conclusion that a firearm was used in the robbery,such reliance was misplaced.
d.the state trial sentencing transcript 
the government concedes that the state psr,without more,is unlikely to satisfy shepard.it argues,however,that where a state trial court adopts the factual findings of a state presentence report,a defendant failure to object to those factual findings amounts to an assent by the defendant to those facts.extending this argument to the state sentencing transcript,the government also does not contend that the transcript,alone,is shepard evidence.it asserts that in this case,it satisfies the shepard requirements because rosa assented to that court statements suggesting that a firearm was used in the robbery.
the shepard court ruled that in determining whether a prior plea of guilty admitted a particular fact,a district court is generally limited to examining the statutory definition,charging document,written plea agreement,transcript of plea colloquy,and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.shepard,at.emphasis added.the government here points to the state judge statement at sentencing that rosa was not the one who wielded the gun,and contends that this constituted a factual finding by the judge that the wielded object was in fact a gun.it further argues that rosa assented to this finding,both because he did not dispute the characterization of the object as a gun and because his lawyer stated that it was not eduardo who had the gun in this particular incident.we disagree.
in shepard,the court stated that the most appropriate sources for the district court to consult to determine whether a given fact was necessarily established in pleaded cases are the statement of factual basis for the charge,fed.rule crim.proc.a,shown by a transcript of plea colloquy or by written plea agreement presented to the court,or by a record of comparable findings of fact adopted by the defendant upon entering the plea.with such material in a pleaded case,a later court could generally tell whether the plea had necessarily rested on the fact at issue.shepard,at.emphases added.the court repeated reference to the plea stage reflects both the conclusive effect of a plea as an adjudication of the defendant guilt and the judicial care that goes into the court acceptance of a plea.see generally von moltke gillies.a plea of guilty differs in purpose and effect from a mere admission or an extrajudicial confession it is itself a conviction out of just consideration for persons accused of crime,courts are careful that a plea of guilty shall not be accepted unless made voluntarily after proper advice and with full understanding of the consequences.quoting kercheval united states.
at the joint plea hearing for rosa and warren,with both defendants placed under oath,the court was indeed careful to determine that they understood what it was they were admitting.no question was raised as to whether the object with which the defendants had threatened the victim was in fact a gun,because a conviction of first degree robbery required only that the object appeared to be a gun.instead,the questioning at the plea hearing focused on who held the object and the object was unvaryingly referred to by the court as what appeared to be a gun.thus,the court asked,rosa,do you freely and voluntarily admit that you did display what appeared to be a pistol,revolver,or other firearm plea tr.at emphasis added.after rosa counsel interposed that rosa could admit only to aiding and abetting,not to displaying,the court asked rosa,and do you admit that while aiding and abetting you did display what appeared to be a pistol,revolver,or other firearm id.at emphasis added.when rosa responded not me,the court asked,so while you yourself may not have possessed what appeared to be a handgun,was one displayed by the people with whom you were acting in concert and aiding and abetting id.emphasis added.the court had used this same careful term for the displayed object in conducting the allocution of warren.see id.at warren,do you freely and voluntarily admit that you did display what appeared to be a pistol,revolver,or other firearm emphasis added.the court never asked either rosa or warren whether what was displayed was in fact a gun.and after it had concluded its questioning of rosa and warren,the court noted that they have been asked very specific questions.id.at.
in light of the state court punctilious framing of the very specific questions to be answered before he accepted the pleas of guilty,inquiring not whether the object displayed was a gun but only whether it appeared to be a gun,it would be unreasonable to infer that his statement at sentencing that he was imposing a lenient sentence on rosa because rosa was not the one who wielded the gun,was intended to constitute a finding that what had been wielded was in fact a gun.such an offhand,or shorthand,reference is not the manner in which careful judges make findings,and we can not conclude that this reference falls within the scope of what shepard meant by an explicit factual finding by the trial judge.
put another way,we do not think that rosa failure to object when the state court said that rosa was not the one who wielded the gun qualifies as an admission by silence.we have said that an admission by silence is admissible as evidence if there are circumstances which render it more reasonably probable that a man would answer the charge made against him than that he would not.united states aponte,cir citations omitted.the state court made its statement in the course of giving rosa a lesser sentence because he was not the one holding the gun.we hardly think that the statement charged rosa.id.a person ordinarily will respond to an incriminatory or defamatory statement with a denial citation omitted.and we do not think it more reasonably probab
