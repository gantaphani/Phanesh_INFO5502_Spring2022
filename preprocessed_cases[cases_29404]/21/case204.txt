federal law mandates a minimum prison sentence for a convicted member of a drug conspiracy responsible for more than grams of crack.b a iii.so far as it matters to this appeal,the district court made a finding of drug quantity,by a preponderance of the evidence that the admitted conspirator ryan morris was personally responsible for grams of crack.the court consequently imposed the mandatory sentence.while judicial of drug quantities sufficient by statute to trigger mandatory minimum sentences was permissible at the time of the sentencing hearing,during the pendency of morris appeal the supreme court held that the sixth amendment guarantees that such qualifying fact issues are subject to jury findings beyond a reasonable doubt.alleyne united states.
the question here is whether the minimum sentence imposed under the district court judgment may nevertheless be affirmed as resting on harmless constitutional error falling short of affecting the defendant substantial rights.we conclude that the error is ultimately harmless,in light of concessions made by morris counsel and overwhelming evidence that morris was responsible for at least grams of crack,and thus affirm.
in december,after investigating the activities of a drug ring operating in dorchester,massachusetts,the government charged nineteen individuals,including ryan morris,with conspiracy to distribute more than grams of cocaine and more than grams of crack,as well as offenses stated in fifteen additional counts.shortly before the indictment was returned,investigators legally searched morris apartment,which yielded up grams of crack.in october,morris pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count but he did not admit that the conspiracy collectively or he individually was responsible for a particular quantity of either form of drug,the questions of quantity being expressly left for later determination by the sentencing judge.
in advance of morris sentencing hearing,the probation office prepared a presentence report concluding,based on the government investigation,that morris himself was responsible for kilograms of cocaine,and grams of crack.because responsibility for kilograms of cocaine triggers a mandatory minimum sentence,see b a ii,the report recommended that morris be sentenced accordingly.he objected to the conclusion about the cocaine quantity and the ensuing recommendation.
at the hearing,morris took the stand and disputed that he had ever dealt in kilograms of cocaine.he said that he bought cocaine in quantities never greater than grams,which he would cook into crack and then sell.between direct and,morris admitted to four specific transactions between may and july involving grams of cocaine each,for a total of grams.when pressed on to state the total number of transactions,he acknowledged more,albeit less exactly 
q about how many times do you think you purchased cocaine from michael williams another member of the conspiracy 
a probably twelve times.
q twelve times 
a tops,probably twelve.
q starting in at some point twelve times 
a twelve times from when i started dealing with mike.i ca remember when i first started dealing with mike,but i know it was about twelve times total.
q okay.well,you said you first started dealing with mike in,so we say in you dealt with michael williams twelve times is that your testimony that what you telling the court 
a precisely,i guess,yeah,about twelve.
q and it was always grams 
a no.sometimes it would be smaller than that.
q what was the smallest amount you ever purchased from michael williams 
q an ounce 
q how many times did you purchase an ounce from michael williams 
a i ca remember.
q well,why do you give it your best guess 
a probably like three times.
q so,three times you purchased an ounce,and the other times was a 
the district court found that morris was not responsible for any kilogram transactions of cocaine,but because he had disputed being a cocaine dealer by admitting to being a crack dealer,the judge proceeded to consider what crack quantity he should be found responsible for.
morris argued that he should be responsible only for the amounts converted from four specifically identified cocaine purchases,that is,a total of grams of crack.he argued that the details of the remaining transactions were speculative guesses,and he suggested that the grams of crack found in the search might be a leftover portion of the grams.
the district court rejected morris position,and found by a preponderance of the evidence that he was responsible for crack cooked from the quantities of cocaine procured in at least twelve transactions,nine of grams and three of.to this,the court added the stash of grams of crack,which the district court found was not derived from the admitted transactions,given the time frame between between the purchases may july and the seizure december.the court thus calculated that morris was responsible for grams of crack,calling that conclusion conservative.because this exceeded the gram threshold,the judge imposed a mandatory minimum sentence,although he said that he would impose a lower one if that were open to him.
while morris appeal was pending,the supreme court handed down alleyne,which held that the sixth amendment requires any fact mandating the imposition or an increase of a particular minimum sentence to be treated as an element of the crime.at.accordingly,under the principle of apprendi new jersey,the sixth amendment provides defendants with the right to have a jury find those facts beyond a reasonable doubt,in the absence of a defendant admission.alleyne.at.
because morris preserved no sixth amendment claim in the trial court,we review for plain error,the burden being on morris to show an error that is clear and obvious,affecting his substantial rights,and seriously impairing the integrity of judicial proceedings.united states santiago,cir.the government concedes the first two prongs of plain error in imposing the mandatory minimum based on the judge finding of crack quantity by a preponderance,rather than a jury finding beyond a reasonable doubt or morris specific admission 
as for the third prong of plain error review,in substance it is harmless error analysis,except that the defendant bears the burden of persuasion.ramirez burgos united states,cir.an alleyne error is harmless when it can fairly be said beyond any reasonable doubt that the assigned error did not contribute to the result of which the appellant complains.united states harakaly,cir quoting united states pérez ruiz,cir.in drug cases,overwhelming evidence of the requisite drug types and quantities generally serves as a proxy for determining whether the alleyne error contributed to the result.harakaly,at quoting pérez ruiz,at preserved alleyne error see also united states razo,wl,at cir,same united states paladin,cir third prong of plain error,substantial united states delgado marrero,cir fourth prong of plain error,integrity of proceedings.by overwhelming evidence,we mean here a corpus of evidence such that no reasonable jury could find,based on the record,that the crack quantity was less than that required for the mandatory minimum to apply.

morris nonetheless contends that this court should apply a test,which asks whether the district court might have imposed a lower sentence if it had complied with the sixth amendment restrictions on judicial factfinding.appellant reply br.but morris presents a false choice.on the assumption that this issue had been entrusted to a properly instructed,rational jury,the district court could not have imposed a lower sentence,given overwhelming evidence that morris was responsible for at least grams of crack.thus it comes as no surprise that
