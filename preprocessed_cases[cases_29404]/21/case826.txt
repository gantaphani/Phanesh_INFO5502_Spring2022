on july,a jury convicted rafael gonzález and josé ramos of one count of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance in violation of.in addition,ramos was convicted of distribution of a controlled substance in violation of a.ramos and gonzález now appeal their convictions and their sentences.
background 
between and,a drug point known as las malvinas was operated in the luis lloréns torres housing project in puerto rico.josé luis rivera gonzález rivera headed the drug point until his death in.between the summer of and october,the fbi and the police of puerto rico conducted an investigation of the drug point.this investigation culminated in a grand jury indictment on february,against nine persons including gonzález and ramos.the indictment charged gonzález and ramos with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances including cocaine,crack cocaine,heroin and marijuana in violation of.the indictment also charged ramos with distribution of a controlled substance in violation of a.five of the seven other defendants charged in the indictment pleaded guilty two others were tried separately.gonzález and ramos proceeded to trial on june.
jury selection 
jurors were summoned and appeared for trial.during voir dire,gonzález requested and the district court agreed to ask potential jurors whether they lived or had lived in a public housing project.no juror answered affirmatively.after voir dire concluded and the jury was announced,ramos objected to the composition of the jury,arguing that it had probably no poor class or anybody relating to the public housing residence and that public housing residents formed a distinct class gonzález concurred in ramos objection.the court overruled the defendants objection to jury composition.
b.the trial 
at trial,the government presented testimony from fbi agent william ortiz regarding his surveillance of the malvinas drug point.the government also presented four hours and minutes of videotapes from a surveillance camera placed near the drug point that showed numerous drug transactions.police of puerto rico officer felipe casiano caraballo casiano testified that he had observed both ramos and gonzález near the drug point and had intervened with ramos on a number of occasions.on,casiano admitted that he had never observed gonzález committing a crime.jesús matías cruz matías,a cooperating witness,testified that he had observed drug sales at the drug point and had observed ramos with two weapons while in the company of rivera.matías also testified that he and ramos cut a rock of crack for packaging,during which ramos told him that the rock had been provided by gonzález.matías further testified that he had overheard rivera asking gonzález for pepper,which was purportedly a for cocaine,and that he later observed gonzález providing rivera with a large plastic bag with stones or bricks inside.matías also made a recording of a conversation between rivera and gonzález about the packaging,processing,and payment for cocaine.in addition,angel obregón fontánez obregón,one of the defendants charged in the indictment who pleaded guilty,testified that he had observed gonzález selling between and kilogram of cocaine on credit to rivera obregón also testified that ramos was a processor of drugs and a triggerman for the enterprise.lastly,the government offered physical evidence,including a notebook the ledger containing records of cocaine transactions involving a person named junito,which was gonzález nickname.at the conclusion of the government case,gonzález and ramos moved for judgments of acquittal under.a.the court denied the motions.
gonzález presented four character witnesses on his behalf,all of whom testified that gonzález was and had good character.gonzález and ramos again moved for judgments of acquittal under.a after the defense case concluded the motions were denied.
c.the jury charge and verdict form 
at the conclusion of the trial,all parties attended a jury charge conference.at the conference,ramos objected to the verdict form and requested a bifurcated verdict which would have required the jury to find the specific amount of drugs attributable to each defendant.the court denied the request.the court gave the jury,in part,the following charge 
count one of the indictment charges that the defendants conspired with one another to distribute controlled substances,that is to say,five kilograms or more of cocaine and a detectable amount of cocaine base,both schedule ii narcotic drug controlled substances to find any defendant guilty of conspiracy to distribute controlled sic you must be convinced that the government has proven each of the following things beyond a reasonable doubt first,that the agreement specified in the indictment,and not some other agreement or agreements,existed between at least two people to distribute controlled substances and second,that the defendants knowingly and willfully joined in that agreement to find a defendant guilty of the offense charged in the indictment,you do not have to find that the defendant conspired to distribute the specific amount of controlled substances alleged in the indictment.to find a defendant guilty,you need only find that he conspired to distribute some quantity of controlled substances as alleged in count one.if you find that a defendant conspired to distribute some quantity of controlled substance,you will be asked to make a special finding as to the quantity of controlled substance that he conspired to distribute both defendants are named in count one of the indictment.the evidence pertaining to each defendant should be considered separately and individually.the fact that you may find of sic the defendants guilty or not guilty,should not control your verdict as to the other defendant.
neither party objected to the jury charge.the jury was given a verdict form which asked the jury to determine the guilt of each defendant and included a special interrogatory which asked the jury to find if the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy was five kilograms or more at the request of the government,the verdict form was read to the jury.
on july,the jury returned a verdict finding both defendants guilty of the charged offenses and a special verdict finding that the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy was five kilograms or more.after the verdict,gonzález made a renewed motion for a judgment of acquittal under.c which was denied.ramos filed a motion to vacate the conviction and for a new trial under.a the court denied the motion.
sentencing 
reports were transmitted to both defendants.on december,the court held a sentencing hearing for gonzález.during the hearing,gonzález argued that the court needed to make an individualized finding of drug quantity.the court responded that this was a matter reserved to the jury,and that the jury had already rendered a sufficient finding.the court determined an offense level of based on the minimum of five kilograms of cocaine involved in the conspiracy and a criminal history category of i.the sentencing guidelines recommended a range of to months of imprisonment gonzález was sentenced to months in prison.
on april,the court held a sentencing hearing for ramos.the court determined that ramos was a career offender under,which gave him a criminal history category of vi.for the conspiracy charge,the court determined an offense level of based on the minimum of five kilograms of cocaine involved in the conspiracy and the fact that ramos was a career offender.the sentencing guidelines recommended a range of months to life imprisonment ramos was sentenced to months of imprisonment on the conspiracy charge.on the distribution charge,ramos was sentenced to sixty months of imprisonment to be served consecutively with the sentence for conspiracy.gonzález and ramos now present various challenges to their convictions and sentences on appeal.
ii.discussion 
we will first address the claims made jointly by gonzález and ramos regarding the jury instructions and special verdict form,and then proceed to gonzález and ramos individual claims.
a.the jury instructions and special verdict form 
the essence of gonzález and ramos appeals as to the jury instructions and special verdict form can be boiled down to two arguments.first,gonzález and ramos argue that to be found guilty of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance,the jury instructions and the special verdict form should have required the jury to make individualized findings of the amount of cocaine attributable to each defendant rather than to the conspiracy as a whole.second,gonzález and ramos argue that the supreme court holdings in apprendi new jersey,d,and blakely washington,d,required individualized findings as to drug quantity for the purposes of sentencing.we find both claims to be meritless.
in order to determine whether all factual issues essential to the judgment were fairly presented to the jury,we review properly preserved objections to the trial court jury instructions and verdict forms de novo,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.if the objection to jury instructions or verdict forms has not been properly preserved by the defendants,we review newly raised objections using a plain error standard id.to satisfy the plain error standard,a criminal defendant must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.this standard is exceedingly difficult to satisfy in jury instruction cases t he plain error hurdle,high in all events,nowhere looms larger than in the context of alleged instructional errors.united states,cir.
the jury instructions 
neither gonzález nor ramos entered any objections to the jury instructions.thus,we will look to see if the instructions constituted plain error.our examination of jury instructions focuses on whether they adequately explained the law or whether they tended to confuse or mislead the jury on the controlling issues.federico order of saint benedict,cir.
gonzález and ramos were charged with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances under.the elements of a conspiracy are the existence of a conspiracy,the defendant knowledge of the conspiracy,and the defendant voluntary participation in the conspiracy.united states,cir.the quantity of drugs is not an element of conspiracy under,nor is it an element of the underlying controlled substances offense under a.see united states lindia,cir the district court instructions plainly instructed the jury to consider the aforementioned elements of conspiracy for each defendant,explicitly stating that,t he evidence pertaining to each defendant should be considered separately and individually.it was only after each defendant culpability was determined individually that the jury was asked to find the drug finding that the court would need for sentencing.as we have stated,the maximum statutory penalty available to the district court at sentencing for a defendant convicted of a drug conspiracy is based on the drug quantity and amount reflected in the jury verdict attributable to the conspiracy as a whole.united states irizarry,cir because the jury was instructed to consider the charges against each defendant individually,the instructions did not constitute error as to the finding of guilt.
furthermore,the jury instructions did not constitute error under apprendi or blakely,which require a jury to make a factual finding for any element which increases a defendant sentence beyond the statutory maximum penalty.at,at.the district court instructed the jury to find the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy as a whole the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy sets the statutory maximum penalty for.irizarry,at.thus,the instructions to determine only the amount of cocaine posed no risk that the jury would fail to find an element of the offense that increased the statutory maximum penalty.accordingly,the jury instructions did not constitute error as to sentencing.
the special verdict form 
because ramos made a timely objection to the verdict form,we will review the verdict form de novo as to his claims.gonzález made no such objection his claims will be reviewed for plain error.the purpose of a special verdict form is to allow juries to specifically identify the predicates for the general verdict.united states cianci,cir.in the present case,the verdict form asked the jury to make a finding of guilty or not guilty as to each defendant for each charge and then,if either defendant was found guilty,asked the jury to determine the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy.as we have already stated,neither the offense of conspiracy,lindia,at,nor the determination of the maximum penalty for conspiracy,irizarry,at,requires an individualized finding of the amount of drugs attributable to a specific defendant.rather,the amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy as a whole is a predicate for sentencing purposes.see id.because the special verdict form provided for individualized findings of guilt on each charge,the special verdict form would not have misled or confused the jury as to their determination of guilt.thus,the special verdict form did not constitute error as to the finding of guilt.
furthermore,there were no apprendi or blakely errors in the special verdict form.the jury used the special verdict form to make a finding of drug quantity.the quantity of drugs in the conspiracy determines the statutory maximum sentence see irizarry,at.thus,because the statutory maximum was determined by the drug quantity,there was no need under apprendi or blakely for the special verdict form to allow jurors to make an individualized determination of drug quantity for each defendant.accordingly,the special verdict form did not constitute error as to sentencing.
claims raised by gonzález 
gonzález raises two claims that there was insufficient evidence to find him guilty of conspiracy to commit drug trafficking under and that the sentence he received was not issued in accordance with our decisions in united states,cir,united states,cir,or the supreme court decision in united states booker,d.
insufficiency of evidence 
gonzález argues that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient for a jury to find him guilty of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.we will review de novo a district court denial of a defendant motion for acquittal under.united states,cir.the standard is whether the evidence,taken in the light most amicable to the prosecution,together with all reasonable inferences favorable to it,would allow a rational to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty as charged.united states maraj,cir.the government need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence,provided the record as a whole supports a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states,cir.
gonzález was charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine under.to prove that gonzález was guilty of conspiracy to distribute cocaine,the government needed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an agreement existed to commit the underlying substantive offense here,the distribution of drugs,that the defendant knew of the agreement,and that he opted to join in it,intending to commit the substantive offense.united states gómez,cir.during the trial,the government offered testimony from an fbi agent,a police of puerto rico officer,two cooperating witnesses,as well as hours of videotape that,taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution,shows that rivera and others agreed to distribute cocaine and other drugs at the malvinas drug point.a jury could reasonably infer from the testimony of the two cooperating witnesses regarding the sales of cocaine by gonzález to rivera,the audiotape recordings of gonzález conversations,and the presence of gonzález name in the ledger,that gonzález was aware of the conspiracy to distribute controlled substances.see united states ortiz,cir f actfinders may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence based on shared perceptions and understandings of the habits,practices,and inclinations of human beings.a jury could further infer from the testimony about gonzález regular sales of cocaine to rivera that gonzález joined the agreement for the purpose of and with the intent to distribute cocaine.in light of the substantial amount of evidence presented,the fact that one witness could not explain the difference between an eighth and a half kilogram of cocaine or that another witness described the drugs as stones or bricks does not make irrational the jury conclusion that gonzález was guilty of conspiracy.see united states nishnianidze,cir t he jury duty is to assess credibility,and it may accept or reject,in whole or in part,any testimony.accordingly,we believe that the court was correct to deny gonzález motion for acquittal.
sentencing errors 
gonzález challenges his sentence on the ground that the district court refused to make an individualized finding of the quantity of drugs that could be attributed to his participation in the conspiracy.since gonzález challenges the sentencing court conclusion of law that such a finding was unnecessary,we will review it de novo.united states brennick,cir.
in,we held that when a district court determines drug quantity for the purpose of sentencing a defendant convicted of participating in a conspiracy,the court is required to make an individualized finding as to drug amounts attributable to,or foreseeable by,that defendant.at.a defendant can only be sentenced on the basis of drugs he handled,anticipated handling,or for drugs he could reasonably foresee being used in the conspiracy all of the drugs in a conspiracy may not be automatically assigned to an individual defendant.united states sepúlveda,cir.
both gonzález and the government agree that the sentencing court failed to make such an individualized finding and that this constitutes error.their only difference is remedy gonzález believes that the jury needed to determine drug quantity and thus a new trial is merited,whereas the government believes that a judge could make the determination without the jury and resentencing would be sufficient.on this subject,we have been quite clear o nce the jury has determined that the conspiracy involved a type and quantity of drugs sufficient to justify a sentence above the default statutory maximum and has found a particular defendant guilty of participation in the conspiracy,the judge lawfully may determine the drug quantity attributable to that defendant and sentence him accordingly.derman united states,cir.the principal enunciated in derman survives the supreme court subsequent decisions in blakely and booker.see united states malouf,wl cir.consequently,we remand gonzález case for resentencing in accordance with our decisions.because we have remanded gonzález case for resentencing on this ground,we do not need to decide now the merits of gonzález other sentencing claims.
claims raised by ramos 
ramos makes two claims.first,ramos argues that the trial was flawed because jury selection violated the sixth amendment and the supreme court decisions in taylor louisiana,d,and duren missouri,d,requiring that juries be selected from a pool representative of the community at large.ramos argues that the jury pool was flawed because it did not include persons who lived in public housing.second,ramos argues that his sentence was flawed under apprendi,and united states vaughn,cir,because the jury did not find that ramos was individually involved in the distribution of five kilograms of cocaine and thus the court could not sentence him using the maximum penalty set by b a.
jury selection 
we review de novo a district court rulings of law.united states royal,cir.the district court denied ramos motion for a new trial on the ground that the jury pool was unfairly composed.in order to establish a claim that the jury selection process violates the constitutional requirement that the jury be selected from a pool representative of the community at large,the challenging party must establish that the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community and that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the process.united states benjamin,cir citing duren,at.the burden is on the challenging party to establish a case of unconstitutional underrepresentation.united states pion,cir.
ramos has presented no evidence that would establish any one of the three prongs of the duren test.as for the first prong,ramos admits that there is no case law supporting the argument that public housing residents are a distinctive group.ramos argues that public housing residents form a distinctive group because the department of housing and urban development restricts eligibility for public housing.this argument is clearly would allow a defendant to make a constitutional claim out of the fact that a jury pool lacked a person from any group that limits its membership.see united states lynch,cir i f this grouping qualifies as a cognizable group for purposes of duren missouri analysis,it is hard to see what grouping will not similarly qualify.the result could soon be that any defendant showing that the venire deviated statistically from a perfect community would have established a prima facie violation of the sixth amendment.
furthermore,ramos has presented no evidence that the representation of public housing residents in the jury pool is unfairly or unreasonably disproportionate.counsel for ramos told the court that he estimated that public housing residents formed between and of puerto rico population but offered no support for this contention.ramos now uses the population of just one of ten public housing projects in caguas,a town of residents,to conclude that is a fair estimate of the proportion of the population of puerto rico living in public housing.no reasonable person would find this evidence sufficient to establish that,because a jury pool of persons had no public housing residents,they are unfairly or unreasonably underrepresented in juries.
lastly,ramos presents no evidence that there has been a systematic exclusion of public housing residents.to the contrary,as the government points out,the jury plan for the united states district court for the district of puerto rico forms its jury pool from voter registration lists,a method previously upheld by this court.see united states butera,cir it has become that voter registration lists are appropriate for use in jury selection systems.jurors are also required to be united states citizens,at least eighteen years old,and residents of puerto rico for at least one year,none of which would suggest systematic exclusion of public housing residents.last,jurors are required to be proficient in english,a requirement we have held to be justified by the overwhelming national interest served by the use of english in a united states court.united states,cir.accordingly,we do not find that ramos has sustained his sixth amendment claim regarding jury selection.
sentencing error 
we review the legal conclusions of a sentencing court de novo but apply a clear error standard to the factual determinations of the court.united states mateo,cir.ramos argues that his sentence violates the supreme court decision in apprendi,as interpreted by united states vaughn,cir,because the jury did not make an individualized finding that he was involved with more than five kilograms of cocaine specifically,ramos argues that,because the jury did not find that he was individually involved with all five kilograms of cocaine,the maximum sentence should be dictated by b c,which provides a maximum sentence of twenty years for the distribution of any amount of a controlled substance.
in apprendi,the supreme court stated that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury.at.a jury found ramos guilty of conspiracy to distribute cocaine under.section provides that a person found guilty of conspiracy to distribute cocaine shall be subject to the penalties for the offense that was the subject of the conspiracy.thus,regardless of the amount
