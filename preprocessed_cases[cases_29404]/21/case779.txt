tomás,josé,and reynaldo were convicted of multiple counts involving the possession of drugs and firearms.on appeal,and challenge the sufficiency of the evidence against them,and challenges various aspects of his sentence.after careful consideration,we affirm and convictions,but we vacate sentence and remand for due to the inadequacy of the district court explanation for selecting the sentence imposed.
background 
a.the scene of the crime 
on may,at approximately,agents héctor valentín and nelson of the puerto rico police department special arrests and extraditions division established surveillance of a residence in the río grande area of northeastern puerto rico,in relation to two local felony arrest warrants for and a fugitive arrest warrant for the house consisted of the main residence on the upper level,and a small apartment accessed by a door under a carport at the front of the house.the carport stood over a driveway that led to a gate and then out to the road in front of the house.the agents parked their unmarked car on the road approximately meters up a hill from the house,where they could observe activity around the house with binoculars.from their vantage point,they could see a ford bronco parked under the carport at the front of the house.they could not see the door to the apartment located behind the bronco,nor could they see a short staircase on the left side of the carport they could,however,see the staircase leading to the main entrance on the upper level of the house.
around two hours later,a stolen mazda protegé pulled up and parked on the road in front of the house,outside a gate across the driveway.and exited the vehicle and entered the carport,presumably to enter the apartment at the rear of the carport,though it is unclear whether the agents actually saw the men enter,or later exit,through the door to the apartment fifteen minutes later,walked out from under the carport carrying an assault rifle,which he placed in the trunk of the mazda protegé.he then returned to the carport.
at this point,the agents notified their supervisor,lieutenant herminio díaz,of the situation.lieutenant díaz mobilized the swat team and posted two agents,josé nevárez ortiz and richard carrera,at the back of the house.as the swat team approached the house,josé david,the owner of the house,who was somewhere outside the gate across the driveway in front of the house ran through the gate toward the house shouting that the police were there.the three in the case,and,then ran out of the apartment and joined in fleeing towards the back of the house.
at the back of the house,the four men jumped over a fence and continued to run.agent nevárez shouted for the men to stop and told them they were under arrest.the fleeing men and the officers then exchanged gunfire was shot in the leg.the men continued to run and exchange gunfire with the pursuing police until the four men fell into a large hole in the ground where they were apprehended and arrested.the three were each found with loaded firearms on their persons however,no drugs or paraphernalia were found on any of the defendants at the time of their arrest.
meanwhile,back at the house,the swat team,lieutenant díaz,and agent valentín searched the apartment,where they found a large amount of cocaine and cocaine base crack cocaine,a small amount of marijuana,and assorted drug paraphernalia,including a stove for cooking crack cocaine and items used to break up cocaine rocks.the cocaine base was packaged in approximately vials,which were placed in plastic bags labeled by drug distribution point.the mazda protegé was taken to the police station after the arrest when the police opened the trunk,they found an rifle along with the that the agents had seen put there during their surveillance.the police did not take any fingerprints from the drugs,paraphernalia,or firearms recovered from the apartment or the vehicle,nor from the firearms found on the defendants at the time of their arrest.
legal proceedings 
on may,the defendants were taken before a local magistrate judge for a probable cause hearing.after the judge advised the defendants of their right to remain silent,voluntarily disclosed that all of the drugs and firearms seized the previous day belonged to him.
on december,a grand jury returned a superseding indictment against the defendants counts one and two charged that all three defendants,aiding and abetting each other,knowingly possessed with the intent to distribute grams of cocaine base and grams of cocaine,respectively,in violation of a.count three charged with knowingly possessing certain firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of c.count four charged all three defendants with knowingly using,carrying,and discharging certain firearms in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of c a iii,c i.counts five and six charged and,respectively,with being a felon in possession of certain firearms in violation of g.count seven charged with being a fugitive in possession of certain firearms,also in violation of g.
the defendants were tried over nine days in march and april of.at the close of the government case,the defendants moved for judgments of acquittal on the ground of insufficient evidence the district court denied the motions.the court also denied the defendants renewed motions for judgment of acquittal the following day.on april,a jury acquitted all three defendants of count four,and also acquitted of count six,but found the three defendants guilty on all other counts as charged.
on april and,the district court sentenced the three defendants.only challenges his sentence,and therefore his is the only sentence we will discuss in detail presentence report psr calculated an initial base offense level of pursuant to,after converting the quantities of cocaine base and cocaine powder into an equivalent quantity of marijuana using the drug equivalency table.the psr also recommended a enhancement for possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking offense,b,and another increase for recklessly creat ing a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer,id.utilizing criminal history category of iv,the psr calculated an advisory guideline range of to months imprisonment.
objected to the psr on two grounds that the two recommended enhancements were inapplicable because the jury acquitted him of all firearms charges,and therefore application of the enhancements would violate his sixth amendment right under blakely washington,d requiring that facts used to increase a defendant sentence beyond the statutory maximum set by state sentencing guidelines be found by a jury and that if the court applied the increase for possession of a firearm,the sentencing guidelines prohibited imposition of the second enhancement for obstruction of justice because the same conduct was the basis of both adjustments,see cmt.
the government responded by arguing that blakely did not apply to the federal sentencing guidelines.the probation officer also responded to the defendant objections,arguing that even though had been acquitted of the firearms charges,the corresponding enhancement could still be applied pursuant to because he aided and abetted others who were convicted of possessing firearms during the commission of the same offense.the probation officer also argued that the obstruction of justice enhancement applied because created a substantial risk of injury to others in the course of fleeing from the police,by acting with the other defendants who were in possession of firearms.
at sentencing hearing,defense counsel first presented mitigating factors,including the terrible devastation suffered by when his brother,working in the united states,shot and killed his work supervisor and dramatic spiritual awakening,evidenced by the fact that he is now serving as a pastor at his correctional facility.counsel then reiterated his objections to the psr,and requested a sentence of months,which was the low end of the to months guidelines range without application of the two recommended enhancements.
the government argued that the court should apply the two enhancements and impose a sentence at the top of the guidelines range due to the large amounts of drugs and guns seized and the defendant attempt to flee the scene.the government also noted criminal history,which indicated that he lived a life of crime from to,and his lack of a repentant statement with respect to the instant crime.
after hearing the two sides arguments,the district court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment for each count,to run concurrently,followed by supervised release for five years as to count one and three years as to count two,to run concurrently the district court explained 
the court has considered all the applicable adjustments under the now advisory federal sentencing guidelines,as well as the other sentencing factors set forth in a,namely the nature and circumstances of the offenses and defendant history and characteristics,the need to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment in light of the seriousness of the offense,deterrence,the protection of the public from further crimes of the defendant,rehabilitation,and the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.
ii.sufficiency of the evidence 
and both appeal their convictions on the ground that there was insufficient evidence linking them to the drugs and paraphernalia found in the house from which they fled before being arrested.see.t he court on the defendant motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.we review sufficiency of the evidence challenges de novo,affirming the conviction if,after viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and indulging all reasonable inferences in the government favor,a rational factfinder could conclude that the prosecution proved all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.united states boulerice,cir.
in order to prove possession with intent to distribute,the government must show that the defendants knowingly and intentionally possessed,either actually or constructively,a controlled substance with the specific intent to distribute.united states,cir.constructive possession exists when a person knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object either directly or through others.united states mclean,cir internal quotation marks omitted.while mere presence on the property,proximity to the drugs,or association with the possessor is not sufficient,united states barnes,cir,the government may rely entirely on circumstantial evidence to show constructive possession.united states echeverri,cir the attendant circumstances tell the tale,and the culpability of a defendant presence hinges upon whether the circumstances fairly imply participatory involvement.
in order to prove aiding and abetting,the government must first establish the commission of the offense by the principal,and then prove that the defendant consciously shared the principal knowledge of the underlying criminal act,and intended to help the principal.united states henderson,cir see also united states rodríguez alvarado,cir requiring that the government show that the defendant associated himself with the commission of the offense,participated in it as something that he wished to bring about,and sought by his actions to make it succeed.again,mere association with the principal or presence at the scene of the crime is insufficient,even with knowledge that the crime is to be committed.united states hyson,cir.
we can quickly dispose of claim that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction for possession.the day after the defendants were arrested,they were taken before a state magistrate judge for a probable cause hearing.although there was no written record of that hearing,agent valentín testified at trial that after the magistrate advised the defendants of their right to remain silent,voluntarily admitted that all the weapons and drugs seized from the house were his his admission is unquestionably sufficient to support his conviction 
the sufficiency of the evidence against is a much closer question.he argues that there was insufficient evidence of his constructive possession because there was no evidence that he had dominion or control over the drugs.he also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence of aiding and abetting,arguing that there was no evidence that he willfully intended to help in the crime of possession with intent to distribute.asserts that the evidence proves,at most,that he was merely present at the scene.
having affirmed the sufficiency of the evidence that was the principal,we need only satisfy ourselves that there was evidence presented from which a rational juror could infer that intended to aid in his crime of possession with intent to distribute.if the government successfully proves aiding and abetting,it does not need to prove that himself actually or constructively possessed the drugs,since either theory of guilt alone would sustain his conviction.see a whoever commits an offense against the united states or aids,abets,counsels,commands,induces or procures its commission,is punishable as a principal.see also united states fuller,cir w e find the evidence presented was more than sufficient to support the jury verdict based on either theory,aiding and abetting or constructive possession.
the evidence fairly demonstrates that was in hiding with his uncle,and traveled with him in a stolen car to the house where kept a large quantity of individually packaged drugs that he remained in the apartment with his uncle and the drugs for a couple of hours before the swat team arrived and that he then attempted to flee from the police,exchanging gunfire with them when they pursued.from this evidence,a rational juror could reasonably infer that accompanied his uncle to the house filled with drugs because trusted his nephew enough to enlist his help in committing the crime charged.united states rincón,cir allowing inference that drug dealer trusted defendant based on evidence that dealer left drugs with defendant,in part to support conviction for aiding and abetting in drug sale.the jury could further infer that was in fact so aiding his uncle,especially given that he knowingly ran from and shot at the police when they attempted to apprehend them.see,at the defendant ran when he saw the police and hid in a field,which suggests awareness of guilt.
correctly points out that there is another,more plausible explanation for his presence at the scene and his attempt to flee he was an armed fugitive in hiding with a wanted family member,and he ran in order to avoid capture by the police.while this could be true,the government need not exclude every possible explanation.see united states ortiz,cir t he possibility of innocuous explanations for a defendant behavior does not foreclose the jury contrary inferences.hence,there was circumstantial and not particularly that presence at the scene and association with his uncle were not just mere presence and association,see echeverri,at a defendant mere presence argument will fail in situations where the mere is lacking,but rather that he was a culpable participant in crime of possession with intent to distribute,see united states lema,cir p resence on a single occasion may support a conviction for aiding and abetting if the surrounding circumstances lead to a reasonable inference that the defendant must have been a knowing participant.therefore,we must affirm conviction as well.
iii.sentence 
makes three claims of error with respect to his sentence that the district court failed to adequately explain the reasons for choosing the sentence imposed that the district court violated his fourteenth amendment right to equal protection when it applied the disparate equivalency ratio between crack and powder cocaine and that the sentence violates his fifth amendment right to due process and the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment because it is based on the crack to powder cocaine disparity.we review these legal challenges de novo.united states rivera,cir.if an issue is not raised below,however,we review only for plain error.united states carvell,cir.
explanation for sentence imposed 
in united states,cir en banc,we outlined the appropriate approach to sentencing under the federal guidelines to aid us in reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence.we directed trial courts to engage in a sequential determination of the guideline range,including any proposed departures,followed by the further determination whether other factors identified by either side warrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.id.an important prerequisite to our reasonableness analysis is the district court reasoned explanation for the sentence imposed,as required by c.id.at.this is true even if the sentence is within the guidelines range.see united states,cir.we are,however,prepared to read a district court explanation in light of the record.united states,cir.the more obvious the reasons for a sentencing choice,the less that needs to be explained.id.
although at times we have been willing to go to great lengths to infer the district court reasoning from the record,there are limits.united states gilman,cir.this case exceeds those limits.the district judge gave a explanation of her choice of sentence,which conclusorily stated that she had considered the appropriate adjustments and the a factors.she did not explain her guidelines calculation,nor did she include any reasoned analysis or reference any evidence that influenced her decision.she merely stated the sentence and paraphrased three of the seven enumerated factors,which she apparently considered important.
furthermore,we are unable to discern the court reasoning by looking to the record of the parties arguments.the government argued for a sentence at the top of the guidelines range considering two enhancements,whereas the defendant requested a sentence at the bottom of the range without the enhancements,citing mitigating factors.the district judge did not explain whether she applied one or both recommended enhancements,what the applicable guidelines range was,whether she thought the defendant deserved a sentence at any point within a particular range,or whether she was influenced by either sides arguments enough to depart from one of the two ranges under consideration.
consequently,this case differs from other cases in which we were able to understand with a modicum of certitude the reasons behind the district court choice of sentence by reviewing the sentencing record.see,united states,cir affirming a sentence where the judge made clear findings on the record,referenced the sentencing factors,and made an explicit statement of the factual basis of the sentence,at in this case,the district court explicit concerns were the scope of the crime and the potential for dangerousness.beyond that,the district court referred generally to the evidence presented during the trial as justifying a sentence at the upper end of the advisory guidelines.united states scherrer,cir taken at face value,these mitigating factors do at first seem to have weight but the government gave some effective answers in the district court and it is fair to infer that the district court found them persuasive.that the district court did not elaborate on said only that it took them into not preclude the inference where the record explains it.united states alli,cir where the district court simply stated,t his is one of those cases where i think the guidelines produce a sentence that is reasonable and perfectly consistent with the factors enumerated in the statute,a,we do not fault the judge for not speaking further about the a factors,given that none were raised for his consideration and,in his independent judgment,none were worthy of further discussion.second and third alterations in original.
the government argues that it is obvious that the district court chose not to apply the two recommended enhancements and that it then adopted the government arguments for a sentence at the top of the resultant guidelines range.while this is certainly a plausible reading of the record,even if it were true,the district court explanation would be insufficient as a matter of law.section c requires that the trial judge identify its reason for selecting a sentence at a particular point within a range exceeding months.see gilman,at t he statement here does not identify the reason that the district court imposed a sentence in the middle of the guideline range rather than elsewhere within that range which spans more than months,in direct violation of section c.if the court below rejected the enhancements,which is by no means clear,the guidelines range of to months would exceed months,and the court would have to explain why it chose the top of the range.
because the court did not even approximate our approach nor provide any reasoned explanation for its determination,we will not infer several degrees of reasoning,including a specific explanation explicitly required by law,and guess what the district court was thinking.therefore,on this ground we vacate sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion and prior precedent.id.at i f we are in fact unable to discern from the record the reasoning behind the district court sentence,appellate review is frustrated and it is incumbent upon us to vacate the decision below to provide the district court an opportunity to explain its reasoning at resentencing.
crack and powder cocaine equivalency ratios 
the remainder of arguments,none of which he raised below,involve the equivalency ratio of crack to powder cocaine used to calculate his sentence.see united states pho,cir describing the history of the disparate treatment of crack and powdered cocaine embedded in the federal sentencing guidelines commonly referred to as the ratio.in,we upheld the sentencing distinction between crack and powder cocaine against both due process and equal protection challenges under the fifth amendment.united states singleterry,cir.we said that congress had sufficient reasons for treating crack more harshly than powder cocaine,and that there are racially neutral grounds for the classification that more plausibly explain its disparate impact on minorities.id.internal quotation marks and alteration omitted.offers no arguments that we have not consistently rejected before,see pho,at rejecting a variety of arguments against the ratio,including those based on the sentencing commission effort to ease the discrepancy,and even so,based on our clear precedent,there was obviously no plain error on the part of the district court in applying the equivalency ratios.
also challenges the equivalency ratio as so disproportional as to be unconstitutional under the eighth amendment.the first circuit has not squarely decided this issue,but every other circuit has rejected the argument that the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.see united states brooks,cir united states brazel,cir united states fraiser,wl,at cir unpublished opinion citing united states harding,cir united states jackson,cir united states smith,cir united states fisher,cir united states frazier,cir united states levy,cir united states thomas,cir united states buckner,cir united states cyrus.moreover,we have stated many times before that t he decision to employ a ratio is a policy judgment,pure and simple,and therefore it is up to the adopt rational drug equivalency ratios.pho,at.
although this is enough to defeat argument under a plain error standard,we also point out that a defendant seeking proportionality review under the eighth amendment must demonstrate,at the threshold,an initial inference of gross disproportionality between the gravity of the criminal conduct and the severity of the penalty imposed.united states cardoza,cir internal citation omitted alterations in original.we have previously upheld a sentence for the distribution of grams of crack cocaine against an eighth amendment challenge.united states graciani,cir.here,sentence was seventy months less for a conviction involving over ten gr
