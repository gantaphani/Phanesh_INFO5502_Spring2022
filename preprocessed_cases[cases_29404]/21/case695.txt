in united states,cir,a panel of this court held that sentencing disparity attributable to the selective inauguration of programs for the processing of immigration crimes could not form the basis for a variant sentence.id.at.this appeal requires us to gauge the continued validity of in light of the supreme court subsequent decisions in gall united states,d,and kimbrough united states,d.
after careful evaluation of the effect of those decisions on a sentencing court discretion,we conclude that they undermine the interpretive approach followed in a number of earlier cases in this and other circuits,including.in fidelity to the supreme court new gloss,we abrogate to the extent that it is inconsistent with this opinion,vacate the sentence appealed from,and remand for resentencing.
background 
we rehearse here only those facts that are necessary to place this appeal in perspective.on april,local authorities arrested yonathan rodríguez as he tried to enter the united states without inspection.shortly thereafter,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico charged him with attempting illegally to reenter the country after having been removed following a felony conviction.see a,b.
in due course,the appellant pleaded guilty to the sole count of the indictment.the presentence investigation report psi report recorded his base offense level at,applied a enhancement for a prior crime of violence felony conviction,ussg b a,and recommended a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,id.the appellant had three prior convictions,placing him in criminal history category chc iv.assuming an adjusted offense level of and a chc of iv,the guideline sentencing range gsr would have spanned months.
the appellant objected to the psi report,asserting that his chc overrepresented the gravity of his prior offenses.see id.b.he also advanced two arguments in favor of a variant,sentence first,that the nature and circumstances of his prior crime of violence conviction for assaulting a federal officer some six years earlier did not warrant a enhancement and second,that the absence of an early disposition program for immigration offenses in the district of puerto rico created an unacceptable disparity.importantly,he premised this last request for a variant sentence not only on a,but also on section a overarching provision and sentencing goals.
this argument requires a few words of explanation.early disposition programs,also known as programs,date back to the.they popped up spontaneously in federal district courts along the border between the united states and mexico as part of an effort to manage burgeoning immigration caseloads.see,united states,cir.typically,prosecutors would use or techniques to hold out the prospect of shorter sentences in return for prompt guilty pleas and waivers of appellate rights.see id.
congress placed its imprimatur on this paradigm in,authorizing the attorney general to create early disposition programs on a basis throughout the country and directing the sentencing commission to promulgate a policy statement allowing downward departures in affected cases.see prosecutorial remedies and other tools to end the exploitation of children today protect act,m b,stat.
following the passage of the protect act,the attorney general established programs in a handful of judicial districts.the district of puerto rico was not among them.
seizing upon this selectivity,the appellant argued below that the absence of an early disposition program in the district of puerto rico resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity.he embellished this argument with a claim that,in some districts that lacked formal programs,prosecutors engaged in rogue practices for immigration offenses,generating similar disparities.given this predicate,the appellant posited,among other things,that sentencing him within the gsr would be inconsistent with the overall thrust of a.in particular,he asserted that a guidelines sentence would corrode respect for the law and result in a sentence that is greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of sentencing.id.a a.
the district court agreed that the appellant chc overrepresented the seriousness of his past crimes and departed downward to a reduced chc of iii.united states rodríguez,wl,at.this,in turn,shrank the gsr to months.id.but the court refused to grant a sentence below the reconfigured gsr.
the court reasons were twofold.first,it analyzed the record of the appellant assault conviction and found that the assault was sufficiently serious to justify the recommended enhancement.id.second,it anticipated not yet decided and refused to inquire into the existence of a disparity.it indicated that it had no authority to disregard the advisory guideline sentencing range on this ground.id.to that end,it referred to case law holding that such a disparity was not unwarranted within the meaning of a and stated that,in any event,the absence of a program in a particular district was a battle that must be fought with the attorney general,and not in the courts.id.
the court proceeded to impose a incarcerative sentence at the bottom of the reconfigured gsr.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
before us,the appellant mounts both procedural and substantive challenges to his sentence.procedurally,he alleges that the district court erred in concluding that a sentencing disparity attributable to the absence of a program in the district of puerto rico could not constitute a permissible factor in the complex of factors upon which a variant sentence might be premised.substantively,he alleges that his sentence is unreasonable.
given a properly calculated gsr we review a sentence for abuse of discretion.gall.at united states martin,cir.in this endeavor,we first probe for procedural error,including the sentencing court refusal to consider factors falling within the purview of a.gall.at martin,at.if a sentence is procedurally sound,we then proceed to assess its substantive reasonableness.gall.at martin,at.
in reviewing the appellant claim of procedural error,we do not write on a pristine page a panel of this court heretofore has held that disparity resulting from the selective placement of programs is not unwarranted within the meaning of section a and that,therefore,any such disparity may not be considered by a district judge in sentencing as a basis for a variance from a guidelines sentence,at.the panel reasoned that by authorizing the institution of programs in the protect act,congress gave implicit sanction to any disparity that might arise from the institution of such programs in some districts but not in others.id.at.
as a general rule,newly constituted panels in a circuit are bound by prior panel decisions closely on point.see eulitt ex rel.eulitt me.dep t of,cir united states rodríguez,cir.this law of the circuit doctrine is a corollary of the principle of stare decisis.it preserves and protects the judiciary commitment to finality,stability,and certainty in the law.but the law of the circuit doctrine has soft edges it is neither a straightjacket nor an immutable rule.carpenters local union fid.guar,cir.
in this spirit,courts have recognized that the doctrine admits of exceptions.the most obvious exception applies when the holding of a previous panel is contradicted by controlling authority,subsequently announced say,a decision of the authoring court en banc,a supreme court opinion directly on point,or a legislative overruling.see eulitt,at williams ashland eng g,cir.a second,less obvious exception,comes into play in those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision,although not directly controlling,nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel,in light of fresh developments,would change its collective mind.williams,at.the situation here possesses elements of both of these exceptions.
shortly after this court decided,the supreme court decided gall and kimbrough.these decisions,announced on the same day,shed new light on the scope of a sentencing court discretion under an advisory guidelines regime.collectively,they called into question a number of our earlier decisions by emphasizing the breadth of a district court discretion to deviate from a defendant gsr based on the compendium of sentencing factors mentioned in a.see gall.at kimbrough.at.concerned that this new jurisprudence might animate an exception to the law of the circuit doctrine and undermine the rationale for excluding any consideration of disparity,we asked the parties for supplemental briefs.after painstaking study,we are now persuaded that the gloss added by the supreme court militates in favor of a new approach that requires,inter alia,abrogating our holding in.we elaborate below.
in gall,the court affirmed the imposition of a probationary sentence that represented a downward variance from the bottom of the applicable gsr.at.in so ruling,the justices expounded further on a district court authority to vary from the guidelines,emphasizing that district courts have wide latitude in making individualized sentencing determinations.id.at.given kimbrough particular pertinence to the inquiry at hand,we take some pains to delineate the contours of the case.
in the,congress enacted a statute that,for certain sentencing purposes,treated every gram of crack cocaine as the equivalent of grams of powder cocaine.id.at see abuse act of,stat,codified in b.following congress lead,the sentencing commission incorporated this ratio into the sentencing guidelines.see ussg c see also kimbrough.at as a result,crack cocaine offenses yielded sentences three to six times longer than those for powder cocaine offenses involving equal amount of drugs.kimbrough.at.
virtually from the start,this sentencing scheme drew heavy fire for,among other things,resting on unfounded assumptions about the harmfulness of crack relative to powder cocaine.the sentencing commission itself concluded that the disparity created by the ratio was unwarranted.united states sentencing commission,report to congress cocaine and federal sentencing policy may.in,it proposed amendments to the sentencing guidelines to replace the ratio with a ratio.kimbrough.at.but congress rejected this proffer and has shown no enthusiasm for subsequent ameliorative proposals.
against this backdrop,a jury convicted kimbrough on various counts related to the possession and distribution of crack cocaine.at sentencing,the judge commented upon the disproportionate and unjust effect that crack cocaine guidelines have in sentencing and concluded that a sentence within the gsr would be greater than necessary to accomplish the objectives set out in a.id.at.the judge determined that a sentence was clearly long enough to achieve those objectives.id.
the fourth circuit vacated the sentence.it took the position that a sentence outside the guideline range was per se unreasonable when premised on a disagreement with the stipulated ratio.united states kimbrough,cir.
on certiorari review,the question was whether a sentencing court could ground a variant sentence based on its disagreement,as a matter of sentencing policy,with the ratio.the supreme court answered this query affirmatively,holding that it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the disparity yields a sentence greater than necessary to achieve a purposes.kimbrough.at.speaking more broadly,the court indicated that,as a general matter,courts may vary from guidelines ranges based solely on policy considerations,including disagreements with the guidelines.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.in making this pronouncement,the court rejected the government contention that congress had made the lopsided ratio mandatory and decline d to read any implicit directive into congressional silence.id.at.
having in mind the court new approach,we turn to the case at hand.in the first instance,this requires that we mull the continued vitality of.of course,that decision is,strictly speaking,limited to the question of whether disparity can be considered by a sentencing court under a.see,at.but the appellant in this case has cast a wider net he argues not only for consideration of that datum under section a but also for its consideration as part of the broader constellation of factors covered by section a.because can fairly be interpreted as establishing a rule,we disregard semantics and treat the decision in as standing in the way of the appellant argument.
several considerations lead us to conclude that,when viewed through the prism of kimbrough,the appellant argument has merit.although kimbrough involved the ratio,its approach plainly has wider implications arguably affecting a number of our earlier cases,including but not limited to,how we have treated disparities arising out of the selective institution of programs.as to those cases not now before us are better left for another analogy is compelling 
like the ratio,departure authority has been both blessed by congress and openly criticized by the sentencing commission.see united states sentencing commission,report to the congress downward departures from the federal sentencing guidelines criticizing programs for creating a type of geographical disparity.like the ratio,the departure scheme does not exemplify the sentencing commission exercise of its characteristic institutional role.kimbrough.at.in other words,the commission has not take n account of empirical data and national experience in formulating them.id.citations omitted.thus,guidelines and policy statements embodying these judgments deserve less deference than the sentencing guidelines normally attract.see id.
given this pedigree,a sentence that is partially the product of a departure might or might not reflect a rough approximation of sentences that might achieve a objectives.rita united states,d.if raised,the sentencing court will have to answer this question in a particular case.and where that answer is favorable to the defendant,a variant sentence premised on perceived inequities attributable to the availability elsewhere of departures would,given the supreme court new gloss,seem to be entitled to deference even in a case.kimbrough.at.
beyond these parallels between the ratio and the authorization for the selective institution of programs,emergent case law signals that,under an advisory guideline regime,sentencing has become a steadily more enterprise.see,gall.at discussing a sentencing court superior coign of vantage to find facts and judge their import under a.recent decisions of this court have noted this reality.see,martin,at united states,cir en banc.
building on the foundation laid in united states booker,d,kimbrough lends a new flexibility to the scope of the district courts sentencing authority and,in the bargain,removes a formidable obstacle to the consideration of matters such as disparity.we refer specifically to the kimbrough court enlargement of a sentencing court capacity to factor into the sentencing calculus its policy disagreements with the guidelines.kimbrough.at.this makes plain that a sentencing court can deviate from the guidelines based on general policy considerations.id.in so ruling,the court effectively displaced our holding in united states pho,cir,in which we had held that district courts could not base sentencing decisions on general,policy disagreements with a guideline provision or policy statement there,the ratio.
importantly,kimbrough counsels a new and different approach to section a.illustrates this point.there,as in some other cases,the court evaluated only the isthmian question of whether a particular item there,disparity could be considered under the aegis of a specific provision of section a there,section a.see,at.but as we explain below,the kimbrough court organic reading of section a suggests that a sentencing judge should engage in a more holistic inquiry.
the court emphasized that section a is more than a laundry list of discrete sentencing factors it is,rather,a tapestry of factors,through which runs the thread of an overarching principle.see kimbrough.at.that tenet sometimes referred to as the parsimony principle instructs district courts to impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing.id.quoting a.this overarching principle necessarily informs a sentencing court consideration of the entire constellation of section a factors,including the need to avoid unwarranted disparity.similarly,judicial interpretation of section a should be guided by the broadly worded goals of sentencing spelled out in section a,to which kimbrough pays homage.id.
in the final analysis,then,the gloss supplied by kimbrough signifies that a district court should not evaluate a request for a variant sentence piecemeal,examining each section a factor in isolation,but should instead consider all the relevant factors as a group and strive to construct a sentence that is minimally sufficient to achieve the broad goals of sentencing.this inquiry should be guided by,but not made unflinchingly subservient to,the concerns expressed in the statute various.
seen in light of the supreme court neoteric teachings,a narrow focus on a particular factor in isolation,such as a fixation on whether disparity can fit within the confines of section a,seems too cramped.after all,each enumerates only one of several factors that must be weighed and balanced by the sentencing judge.united states fernandez,cir.so,whether or not the disparity of which the appellant complains is the type of disparity to which section a is addressed,kimbrough,properly applied,teaches that a sentencing court should not rebuff such a complaint out of hand.
that does not mean that the court should swallow such an allegation hook,line,and sinker,nor does it mean that it is foreclosed from determining that any disparity,when viewed through the prism of section a,is insufficient to warrant a sentence.it does mean,however,that when confronted with an allegation of disparity,the court should at that point undertake a further inquiry.for example,it should probe whether and to what extent a relevant disparity exists at all and then,if it finds one,engage in a comprehensive evaluation of whether this and other items in the constellation of section a factors,viewed as a whole,cast doubt on the suitability of a sentence.in the course of this assessment,the court would have to ask whether such a sentence,if imposed,would encourage respect for the law,a a provide just punishment for the offense,and afford adequate,but not excessive,deterrence,id.a b.ultimately,the court depending on how it views the case could ground a variant sentence in the parsimony principle rather than in section a alone.see kimbrough.at see also,at recognizing,that a variant sentence may be constructed based on a complex of factors whose interplay and precise weight can not even be precisely described united states verkhoglyad,cir stating,that no particular a sentencing factor should be given determinative or dispositive weight quoting fernandez,at.
this result is consistent with our case law suggesting that even if a specific sentencing rationale can not be considered under the aegis of a particular of section a,such a proscription does not bar consideration of that factor in the course of a more holistic review of the full panoply of section a factors.see,martin,at indicating that section a instruction to consider unwarranted sentencing disparities was not intended to encompass disparate coconspirator sentences but that such disparities nonetheless could be considered under the totality of the section a.
for these reasons,we conclude that consideration of disparity is not categorically barred as a datum within the overall ambit of a.to the extent necessary to effectuate this holding,we abrogate our earlier opinion in.
the government labors mightily to stave off this holding.its most loudly bruited claim is that,in contradistinction to the legislative actions at issue in kimbrough,the protect act contains an unequivocal congressional mandate that bans consideration of any disparity arising from the selective implementation of programs.this argument finds support in the fifth circuit recent opinion in united states,cir,in which the court,on materially identical facts,determined that kimbrough did not alter prior case law restricting a sentencing court authority to include disparity in the sentencing mix.id.at.
we reject the government importunings and in the process,respectfully disagree with the conclusion reached by the panel.while the kimbrough court acknowledged that a sentencing court can be constrained by express congressional directives,such as statutory mandatory maximum and minimum prison terms.at,the protect the fifth circuit would have to no such express imperative.the act,by its terms,neither forbids nor discourages the use of a particular sentencing rationale,and it says nothing about a district court discretion to deviate from the guidelines based on disparity.the statute simply authorizes the sentencing commission to issue a policy statement and,in the wake of kimbrough,such a directive,whether or not suggestive,is not decisive as to what may constitute a permissible ground for a variant sentence.martin,at.
by the same token,the protect act authorization for the selective deployment of programs bears scant resemblance to a congressional directive instituting statutory minimum and maximum sentences.although the latter directive necessarily cabins a sentencing court discretion,the former authorization says nothing about the court capacity to craft a variant sentence within the maximum and minimum limits.
refined to bare essence,the government is urging us to read into the protect act an implicit restriction on a district court sentencing discretion.but that can be done,as illustrates,only by heavy reliance on inference and implication about congressional practice that runs directly contrary to the court newly glossed approach.see kimbrough.at declining,despite congress implicit acquiescence in,or even its endorsement of,the ratio,to treat that ratio as beyond the reach of section a.in refusing to read a bar on policy disagreements into either congress original formulation of the ratio in the abuse act or its later rejection of the sentencing commission attempted softening of the ratio,id.at,kimbrough made pellucid that when congress exercises its power to bar district courts from using a particular sentencing rationale,it does so by the use of unequivocal terminology.
our decision in martin hammers home this point.there,the district court deviated dramatically downward from the gsr applicable to a career criminal and sentenced him within the range that would have obtained had he not been a recidivist.martin,at.the government appealed,arguing that the variance was insupportable because congress had indicated its desire that the guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized for recidivist offenders.h.we rejected the argument,concluding that kimbrough had opened the door for sentencing courts to deviate from the guidelines in individual cases notwithstanding congress competing policy pronouncements.martin,at.
another example of this phenomenon is our recent decision in united states politano,cir.in that case,we concluded that community characteristics could be factored into the sentencing calculus,notwithstanding congress and the sentencing commission expressed policy preferences to the contrary.id.at.in so holding,we jettisoned a decision of this court.see id.at effectively overriding united states,cir.
if these holdings are to be given more than mere lip service,they must mean that absent an unambiguous congressional directive barring sentencing courts from considering disparity created by the implementation of programs,a sentencing court can include that datum in its sentencing calculus,as long as the court grounds its rationale in the complex of factors enumerated in a.
in a effort to persuade us to bar consideration of disparity,the government thunders that upholding variant sentences premised in whole or in part on this ground will be tantamount to a judicial attempt to exercise prosecutorial discretion an action that supposedly would impinge upon executive branch authority and,thus,violate principles.this tirade elevates hope over reason.
while the decision to institute a program in a pa
