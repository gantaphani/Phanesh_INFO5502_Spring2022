background 
in the summer of,nadav dagan dagan,a ecstasy dealer turned government cooperator,contacted an individual named eliase eli shtoukhamer shtoukhamer,with whom dagan previously had conducted ecstasy deals,to learn about what was going on in the business.on august,in a meeting recorded on audiotape by the drug enforcement agency dea,shtoukhamer told dagan that he and a man identified as shlomo,defendant shlomo cohen were planning to smuggle ecstasy pills from belgium into the united states by commercial airplane.speaking in hebrew,shtoukhamer referred to the pills as wheels and asked dagan to provide a mare,or female drug courier,to help smuggle the pills on a flight in which the courier would be joined,without her direct knowledge,by both shtoukhamer and his partner.under the proposed transaction,the courier would receive for her efforts,shlomo would invest in of the pills for resale,and dagan would invest in the remaining pills at a cost of each,or.
thereafter,dagan,shtoukhamer,and cohen met on three occasions,all recorded and observed by law enforcement,in which they negotiated the terms of the smuggling operation and discussed the possible distribution of the pills in the united states.at these meetings,cohen stated that the pills would come packaged as a gift in the courier suitcase,and he actively discussed issues such as the costs and timing of the deal,the status of preparations in belgium,and the need for dagan to provide a courier.after subsequent changes in the deal allowing dagan to distribute pills in the united states on a consignment basis,and additional videotaped meetings,shtoukhamer gave dagan to pay for the courier airplane ticket.a few weeks later,however,shtoukhamer and cohen,who had learned of a big bust in belgium,called the deal off for fear of getting caught.on november,after cohen had spoken separately with dagan and shtoukhamer by telephone,dagan returned the to shtoukhamer.
in november,cohen was arrested by the dea and subsequently charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute approximately ecstasy pills in violation of conspiracy to import ecstasy into the united states in violation of and possessing ecstasy with intent to distribute in violation of and,a,and b c.shtoukhamer,who had been charged with one count of conspiracy to distribute ecstasy,pleaded guilty in may and was sentenced principally to months imprisonment by the district court.cohen then proceeded to a trial by jury,which convicted him of both conspiracy charges under counts one and two but acquitted him on the substantive offense of possession with intent to distribute under count three.on february,the district court sentenced cohen to two concurrent terms of months imprisonment,followed by three years supervised release.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,cohen contends that his conspiracy convictions were the result of ineffective assistance of counsel because his trial counsel failed to object to the government argument in summation that cohen may have included,in addition to shtoukhamer,other unnamed people overseas and the district court charge instructing the jury to determine whether cohen had conspired with eli shtoukhamer others who were not acting as agents of law enforcement.we consider each claim in turn.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
we may review a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal where,as here,the factual record is fully developed and resolution of the sixth amendment claim on direct appeal is beyond any doubt or in the interest of justice.united states gaskin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a defendant claiming ineffective assistance must demonstrate that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of prevailing professional norms,strickland washington,d and affirmatively prove prejudice arising from counsel allegedly deficient representation,id.at.see gaskin,at noting that a defendant bears a heavy burden of showing both that counsel performance was so unreasonable under prevailing professional norms that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed the defendant by the sixth amendment,and that counsel ineffectiveness prejudiced the defendant such that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different internal quotation marks and citation omitted.in applying this standard,a reviewing court must make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight and indulge a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance and might be considered sound trial strategy.strickland,at.internal quotation marks omitted.paramount to any such review is whether counsel conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial can not be relied on as having produced a just result.gaskin,at quoting strickland,at.
failure to object to government summation 
defendant argues that he was deprived of effective assistance of counsel,first,because his trial counsel failed to object to part of the government argument in summation regarding the identity of defendant alleged s.referring to shtoukhamer,who already had pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute ecstacy in a companion case,the government argued to the jury 
you have to find that the defendant conspired with at least one person other than nadav dagan,a government cooperator who,by law,would not have qualified as a member of the alleged conspiracy,see,united states medina,cir.now,clearly you have eli shtoukhamer here.the defendant is conspiring or agreeing to commit these crimes with eli.and we submit to you there are also other people overseas,but,of course,we do know what their names are,who they are.but at the very least you have the defendant conspiring or agreeing with eli to commit the crimes charged in the indictment.
trial tr.emphasis added.
defendant contends that his counsel failure to object to the italicized statement above,and to request a curative instruction in response,constituted ineffective assistance because o n the only facts elicited at this trial,there was no legal basis for the jury to convict defendant of conspiring with anyone in belgium to import ecstasy pills into the united states,let alone to possess those pills in the united states with intent to distribute those pills in the united states.appellant br.in support of the assertion that there was no legal basis for his conspiracy convictions,defendant argues that there may be due process clause,other constitutional,or international law limitations on what congress can make a crime regarding conduct outside the territorial jurisdiction of the united states,id.at and even assuming jurisdiction was appropriate in this case,there was no evidence that anyone in belgium had any intent to be involved,let alone have a stake,in the charged distribution and importation scheme,id.at.
defendant arguments fail for several reasons.first,we are aware of no principle,and none has been brought to our attention,that supports defendant casual invocation of constitutional or international law limitations on the extraterritorial application of federal laws designed to
