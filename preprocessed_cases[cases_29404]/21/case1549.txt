defendants aref elfgeeh aref and abad elfgeeh abad collectively the elfgeehs or defendants appeal from judgments entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york following a jury trial before sterling johnson,judge,convicting them of operating an unlicensed business,in violation of a,and conspiring to do so,in violation of and convicting abad of structuring financial transactions,in violation of a.aref was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release,and was ordered to pay a fine and to forfeit.abad was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release,and was ordered to pay a fine and to forfeit.on appeal,defendants contend principally that they received an unfair trial due to newspaper publicity and trial testimony relating to terrorism and violence,and that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the mens rea element of the statute.aref also contends that his postarrest statements were improperly admitted at trial.in addition,defendants challenge their sentences,contending,inter alia,that the prison terms imposed on them are unreasonable,both substantively and on various procedural grounds and abad contends that the amount of his fine is unreasonable.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the convictions and most aspects of the sentences,but we vacate and remand for reconsideration of the fine imposed on abad and one of the sentencing enhancements applied to aref.
background 
the present prosecution arose out of the operation by abad and his nephew aref of a hawala,or operation,at abad carnival french ice cream or carnival shop in brooklyn,new york.abad was arrested in january an arrest warrant was issued for aref,who was arrested in december of that year.in june,the elfgeehs were indicted on charges of operating an unlicensed business,in violation of a,and conspiring to do so,in violation of.as discussed in greater detail in part.below,was amended in october.counts one and two of the indictment charged abad with conspiring to violate,and violating,prior to october counts three and four charged both abad and aref with conspiring to violate,and violating,the version of that section.a subsequent superseding indictment added a charge count five that abad had engaged in structuring monetary transactions from january to january,in violation of a.section a provides that n o person shall,for the purpose of evading the reporting requirements of section a or or any regulation prescribed under any such section,structure or assist in structuring,or attempt to structure or assist in structuring,any transaction with one or more domestic financial institutions.the pertinent regulation under a generally requires financial institutions,other than casinos,to file a report of any deposit,withdrawal,exchange of currency or other payment or transfer,by,through,or to such financial institution which involves a transaction in currency of more than.b.
a.the trial 
the government evidence of unlicensed money transfers and structuring 
at trial,special agent brian murphy of the federal bureau of investigation fbi explained for the jury what a hawala is 
a hawala operates in a similar fashion to a western union business.it a money transfer operation.the word hawala translated from arabic into english means transfer a hawala business is used to send money from one location to another.
trial transcript tr.fbi special agent daniel gill described the benefits of using a hawala instead of using an official business such as western union 
one,it conducted outside the realm of licensed banking activity.there is no regulatory oversight.therefore,the transactions are basically conducted without any sort of legal review of how the transactions are conducted.
a continuing it also enables the transactions to occur without any review by banking officials that they are conducted in accordance with procedures and laws which govern banking activity.
q are there any other advantages to the use of a hawala as opposed to licensed money transfer 
a the true originator of the funds and the true beneficiary of the funds are not identifiable in the banking transactions.
id.at see also id.at one of the advantages of such a system is that it keeps the beneficiary and the originator of the transactions essentially anonymous in the transaction.
the government documentary evidence at trial,including several hundred exhibits,described and explained to the jury by murphy,consisted in large part of account statements from a carnival french ice cream account maintained by abad at morgan chase bank chase,as well as account statements from feeder accounts at chase and other banks.these statements showed large totals of money deposited into the carnival account in small amounts as transfers from feeder accounts,and large sums of money wired out of the carnival account to accounts in other countries.see tr.for example,in a period during the fall of,more than was deposited into the carnival account and more than was wired out.see id.at.between and,the total amount deposited into the carnival account was,and the total amount withdrawn was.see id.at.
murphy described the overall flow of money in this case as follows 
m oney was deposited into these feeder accounts,these different feeder accounts.after it was deposited,it was transferred to the jp morgan chase account and then after it reached the jp morgan chase account it was then wired out to one of these countries,ultimately making its way back to yemen.
tr.the money arrived in the feeder accounts by various means,including check deposits,cash deposits,and wire transfers.see id.then,
m oney got from the feeder accounts to the carnival account in generally one of two ways.most often there were checks written from one of the feeder accounts,pay able to the order of carnival french ice cream account and then it is deposited into the carnival french ice cream account.on some occasions the feeder accounts would wire money over to the carnival french ice cream account.
id.at.murphy testified that there were hundreds of checks from the feeder accounts made out to the carnival account.see id.at.
the government also offered as evidence the documents for the feeder accounts,including another chase bank account in the name of the prospect deli that was opened by aref and listed the home address and telephone number of abad.see tr.see also id.at same information used for another feeder account at astoria federal bank.the prospect deli was a business a few blocks away from the carnival french ice cream shop the prospect deli was in operation only from to,but activity in the prospect deli bank account continued until.see id.at.for example,bank records showed that in approximately was deposited into the prospect deli account and about was transferred out to the carnival account.see id.at.
a representative of the new york state banking department testified that neither abad nor aref,nor any of their various entities including carnival french ice cream,had a new york state license to transmit money.see tr.the government offered evidence that abad was aware of the licensing requirement.it introduced a letter from the new york state banking department dated march,found in abad files,stating that a new york state license was required before commencement of activities.see id.at.an application form for such a license was attached to the letter but was not filled out.see id.at.in addition,murphy testified that he had been informed by abad attorney that abad was told he needed to get a license to remit money and that he had to apply for it and that he never did apply for that.id.at.
murphy testified that after aref was arrested in december and given miranda warnings miranda arizona,d see part.below,murphy asked aref about his involvement in the business.
q what did he say 
a he stated that he worked for other people in a money transfer or hawala business in the united states.
q did he say what his responsibilities were 
a he had two responsibilities,the first was to open up several bank accounts to further the hawala business and the second responsibility was to make deposits of cash,generally between three and into various bank accounts.
q did he say he did that at another individual request 
q did he say whether he received any compensation for his involvement in the hawala 
a he stated he got room and board and a salary or small salary for that,for his work.
with respect to the structuring count against abad,murphy testified that the bank records obtained by the fbi for the feeder accounts showed cash deposits only one of them was a cash deposit for more than triggering a reporting requirement for the bank.see id.at.however,on each of several hundred days,an aggregate of more than was deposited into the feeder accounts.see id.at.murphy explained the significance of the threshold 
what happens is,when you enter a bank,if you have an amount of cash over,you are required to give information to the bank and bank generates what called a ctr,or currency transaction report.that then is filed with the internal revenue service,and that information is tracked by the government.
a former customer of abad hawala,abdul hizam,testified that abad helped him purchase a house in yemen by sending the money to yemen on his behalf.see id.at.hizam testified that abad asked him to write several checks,each for less than,and to date the checks differently,though he gave abad all of the checks at once.see id.at.the checks were variously made out to cash or the carnival french ice cream store,and were deposited into several different feeder accounts.see id.at.hizam testified that,in exchange for abad sending hizam money to yemen,he paid abad,which he understood was compensation for abad and abad contact in yemen.see id.at.another customer,a cousin of abad,testified that abad charged a commission for each money transmittal,to for every thousand dollars sent.see id.at.
the government also presented the testimony of a handwriting expert who gave his opinion that abad handwriting was on several documents that related to the carnival account and the feeder accounts.see tr.the expert testified that although the name on some of the documents was that of abad cousin,nasser elfgeeh,the documents had been signed by abad.see id.at see also id.at opining that on some checks,abad signed nasser elfgeeh name id.at opining that on some checks and deposit tickets,abad signed the name saleh aljahmi id.at opining that on some checks,abad signed the name mahmood elfgeeh.
in addition,the expert testified that on several checks written on the prospect deli account payable to the carnival french ice cream account and signed in the name of aref,aref name was in the handwriting of abad,indicating that abad had signed those checks using his nephew name.see id.at see also id.at same.other checks appeared to have been filled out by abad but actually signed by aref.see id.at.the handwriting expert also identified writing on many of the deposit tickets for the prospect deli account as the handwriting of aref.see id.at.
the defense case 
abad and aref testified in their own defense.as to the counts,abad primary defense was that the hawala was a service to the yemeni community in brooklyn tr.and was not intended to make a profit see id.at,and hence abad did not consider it a business within the meaning of a.abad testified that the hawala service was for only see tr,that he transmitted money only for individuals,not for businesses see id.at,and that he charged individuals for his service only in order to cover the banking fees charged by commercial banks for the transmissions and to cover the costs of delivering the money on the receiving end see id.at see also id.at i was in a business,it was a service.
abad had adverted to this defense in his of special agents murphy and gill,eliciting that murphy,in his investigations,had not come across any advertisements for the hawala see,tr,and eliciting from gill that the books of the hawala did not show a profit see id.at.the government had countered this defense with testimony by the new york state banking department representative,who testified that a business need not take in revenue,and need not be profitable,to trigger the licensing requirement.see id.at.
abad also testified that he was unaware of the licensing requirement when he began transmitting money for yemeni community members in,and only learned in that he might need a license.see tr.abad testified that at that time he determined that the licensing requirement did not apply to his business because the application appeared to apply to banks and because new york state wanted on deposit.id.at.
with regard to the structuring count,abad offered the following testimony 
q you heard testimony here there was,i think was described as feeder accounts in various banks throughout the area.
would you please explain,did you make deposit s in various bank accounts 
q why did you do that 
a these accounts,most of them or half of them had either my name individually or with the joint account with any other member of the family or partner and for the safety of this money that the people bring,i have to bring different accounts in order to have it safe.additionally,to save some money because chase bank charges a lot of money because it a business account,these savings and checking accounts i put the money in,it free.they do charge you anything.
tr.abad also stated that he did not instruct abdul hizam to divide his money into checks for less than.see id.at.
on,the government elicited testimony from abad that he was aware of numerous other licensing requirements for carnival french ice cream,including requirements for a fire permit,an illuminated sign permit,and a health certificate to sell frozen food.see id.at.the government also questioned abad about the fact that he incurred more fees by depositing money in small amounts into several different accounts than he would have had he deposited a larger amount into the carnival account abad acknowledged this but nonetheless maintained that he divided the money among the feeder accounts to save money.see id.at.abad stated that since all the accounts were his,i put the money in any account i choose.it does matter to me,make a difference to me.id.at.abad admitted on that he signed various checks and deposit tickets in the names of five or six of his relatives.see id.at.
abad also admitted that after his arrest,he failed to disclose to the magistrate judge that he had access to the prospect deli account,and he instructed aref to withdraw from that account and send it to yemen.see id.at.of aref revealed that the checks sent to yemen were backdated to a date prior to abad arrest.see id.at.
abad also testified that aref ha d no role in the service tr,and never made deposits for the service see id.at.on,when shown copies of deposit tickets and checks that he admitted were not in his handwriting,abad stated that he was not sure whether aref made deposits for the hawala into any feeder accounts.id.at.
aref testified,through an interpreter,that he did not deposit money or write checks for his uncle business.see id.at.when presented with numerous deposit tickets and checks that the expert witness had opined were in his handwriting,aref denied that he had written the checks or made the deposits.see id.at.
mentions of a terrorism investigation and violence 
prior to trial,counsel for abad had expressed concern that special agent murphy would testify that he was assigned to the fbi counterterrorism task force,and that the indictments of the defendants stemmed from a terrorism investigation,assigned to a terrorism investigative unit.tr.the government responded that it would not ask murphy what unit he assigned to and that it planned to keep that off the table unless the defendants open the door.id.the government stated we mindful of that,have taken precautions to make sure that not injected here at all.id.
in abad opening statement,his attorney told the jury that 
e very bit of this money was earned by people who paid their taxes on it and gave it to elfgeeh in trust,not to keep,to transfer for them.he had no tax obligation to pay for any of this money.every bit of this money came from a decent source,not criminal activity.
id.at.outside the presence of the jury,the government argued that that statement constituted an argument that there no proof the money came from terrorists or terrorism or anything like that that rather it was immigrants money being sent home to family and friends.id.at.the government contended that that statement open ed the door to getting into evidence the fact there was actually money transmitted,the government believes,to known terrorist organizations,checks that say for the jihad from the defendant himself.id.the district court,noting that opening statements do not constitute evidence at trial,ruled that this did not open the door because only a witness can open the door to related testimony.see id.
later that day,during of murphy,counsel for abad asked numerous questions about murphy visits to or surveillance of abad carnival french ice cream shop,inquired whether murphy had visited alone or with other agents,and elicited that the fbi had sent a confidential informant ci into abad shop.counsel then asked what murphy purpose had been in going there.murphy responded 
at some point,the first time i went there,i had a cooperating witness or a person that was working on behalf of the government.i wired that person up and the purpose to go there was to have that person gain information about abad elfgeeh on another matter.that was the first time.
tr.emphasis added.counsel for abad then continued to probe into murphy purpose,and received two answers that mentioned the terrorism investigation 
q actually you wanted this person to go in there,do a transaction,did you 
a i wanted that person to go in.at that time i was investigating a case that had to do with terrorism with a person in yemen by the name of mohamed 
hancock counsel for abad i move for mistrial.
the court no,we strike that.you asked him about what the investigation was.this case is not about terrorism,ladies and gentlemen.
q did you ask that person to go there and attempt to have,in excess,wired to him 
a no,i had that person go in there to try to attempt to move money from the united states to yemen for terrorist causes.
q was he successful 
friedman counsel for aref might i have a side bar,please 
friedman i most respectfully ask for a mistrial,just for my client,who has been indelibly prejudiced now.i did ask any questions.your honor gave a ruling with respect to the witness s answer.then the witness on the very next question,without any prompting stuck it to abad sic elfgeeh for no reason other than to do it.it was not called for.
chen counsel for the government quite the opposite.hancock is going down a road,eliciting information that will clearly go into the other investigation.as the court is aware,the reason the ci was there was because he was investigating the al mo a yad case.that why he went there.when hancock keeps baiting the agent,the agent will give the response that he did which is entirely responsive,appropriate.hancock could stop going down this road unless he wants to open it wide.
the court i deny this application for mistrial.you will proceed on this road at your own risk.
hancock i happened to say he went into that place for two reasons he needed a license,did he see any other licenses on the wall there to show he complied with other requirements like the health code requirement,sales tax,capitalization.he looked for this opportunity,not responsive to my question.
chen entirely responsive.
the court my ruling is no mistrial and be very careful how you approach this subject.you asking him questions,he reading it one way where you have another motive,but you got to be very careful.he does know what you talking about.be careful.
when this is over,you speak to your witness,stay away from that terrorism,please.
tr.the following morning,on a renewed motion for a mistrial by counsel for abad,the court stated that it would reiterate to the jury that this is not a terrorism trial.this is a banking violation trial.id.at.when the jury entered the courtroom,the court stated 
i going to advise you this is a case,as i said when i read to you the indictment,it a case about banking and hawalas not getting licenses.that what the allegations are,has nothing to do with terrorism.
id.at.this instruction was combined with a warning to the jurors not to read the newspapers see part.below.
the subject of violence arose again on the third day of testimony,during the testimony of abad.on direct examination,abad stated that the fees he charged to customers covered certain charges the operation incurred 
the bank charges,and the services that they do in the other side where they deliver the money,they have messengers to go to a village,to someone who is in a hospital,to other parts of the city,to different cities.they will have messengers to take it to other parts of the country.
tr.on,in an attempt to counter the testimony that money was sent to individuals in yemen,some of whom were hospitalized,the government asked abad,h ave you ever sent money to support violence abad answered absolutely not before his attorney objected,an objection that was sustained by the district court.id.at.the government approached the subject again in reference to a list of customers who had given abad money to send to yemen 
q and,in fact is it money they gave you to support a blood feud between your tribe and another tribe 
hancock objection,your honor.
the court i will allow that.
a what was the question 
q is it money that these people on this list sent to yemen to support a blood feud between your tribe and another tribe 
a we sent money not to blood,you talking about,it have lawyers go to the government and fight a dispute.
q i see.it was a legal dispute that you were sending money for 
q it was a legal dispute you say you were sending money for 
a the tribes have problems in the villages and we help the tribe,our side tribe.
q this money was going to pay for lawyers,is that what you saying 
a it part for the government,for the lawyers and the expenses.
q is it in fact true the money went to buy weapons and ammunition for this fight 
hancock objection,your honor.
the court i will allow it,if he knows.
a i do know.
q you do know 
q do you recognize this as another note in arabic 
do you recognize that document 
q in fact,elfgeeh,does it say a letter to you actually,a note to you from your brother yahaya,and it says basically,the weapons and ammunition are more than three million,and then it goes on to explain that abdullah and his family are our guests now.i recommend that you take from each of his children and mahmood money is with you.i see that you also take from him.as for their father,he not giving anything,neither now nor later.
is it in fact true that the money that they are referring to is money to buy weapons and ammunition 
hancock objection.
the court i will allow it.
a this is a letter and he said how much money they deposited to secure for the government side,the government take as a bail from each tribe in order to have this thing discussed.
q elfgeeh,when your brother sent you this note and you read the weapons and the ammunition is more than three million,did you know what he was talking about 
q you had no idea that there was this feud going on that involved weapons and ammunition between your tribe and another tribe 
a i know what he said,but 
q you knew that the money you were sending over was going to be used for that purpose,did you,based on this note 
a when what this note came,i knew it this note came.
q and you sent the money,is that right 
a i do know if i sent the money for this purposes.i do know that.
q is it true that you actually got a number of correspondences from your brother on this particular issue about collecting money for this particular purpose,to fuel the feud between your tribe and another tribe 
a there was some money,yes,sent for this.
on redirect examination of abad,his attorney elicited further testimony about the tribal feud 
q you were asked a question,there was a tribal dispute in yemen in which your family was involved or somebody was involved 
q explain that a little bit,please.
a tribes are fighting each other,have problems all the time.
q to your knowledge did the united states of america,the united states government have a position in that dispute 
a no,i do think so.
tr.finally,on,the government addressed the issue again 
q elfgeeh,you were just asked about this feud between your family and another family in yemen.do you recall testifying about that 
q this is actually your family,right you referred to them as your tribe,right 
a not just my family,but the whole tribe.
q when you use the word tribe,you actually referring to people who come from the same region basically and have some blood connection 
a you could say that.
q in fact,did your brother fax you various correspondence about this feud that was ongoing 
q in fact did he send you a fax that basically referred to various court cases that involved violence 
q were not there two or three cases that involved grenades and other explosive devices that were part of this big dispute 
a that what happened in the village,yes.
q is it in fact the money that you sent was supposed to help your family defend this dispute involving grenades and other ammunition 
a to help fight the case.
q was it actually used though to buy weapons or other grenades 
hancock objection.there is no proof of that.
the court i allow it.he can answer yes or no.
a i do know.
publicity during trial 
the jurors had been sworn in on september,on september,counsel opening statements were made,apparently with the press in attendance,and the presentation of testimony was begun.on the morning of september,three new york city metropolitan area newspapers carried four articles relating to the trial.the new york daily news carried an article on page that stated in part 
nowhere in assistant attorney pamela chen opening argument,though,was the word terrorism mentioned,even though the arrest of defendant abad elfgeeh,was an offshoot of a government crackdown on the financing of terrorist organizations abroad.
federal judge sterling johnson has barred any mention of elfgeeh reputed ties to yemeni cleric mohammed ali hassan,who was recently convicted of conspiring to provide material support to hamas and al qaeda and referred to himself as osama bin laden personal sheik.
a government witness,fbi agent brian murphy,was not allowed to testify he is assigned to a squad that investigates terrorism.
chen argued unsuccessfully yesterday that the jury should see checks seized from elfgeeh with the words for the jihad and mujahidin written on them.
john marzulli,jury hears charges yemen man,new york daily news,september,at emphases added.the article also included information about the carnival french ice cream shop,a definition of hawala,and a quote from abad counsel.
another article,with an associated press byline,appeared on page of newsday and was entitled jury wo hear about alleged links.it stated,in pertinent part 
prosecutors have said abad elfgeeh business was used by a yemeni cleric convicted earlier this year of a scheme to fund and the palestinian militant group hamas.but prosecutors can not raise the topic of terrorism at elfgeeh trial unless the defense does first because they did not have enough evidence to charge elfgeeh with a crime.
assistant attorney pamela chen made her first attempt to bring up terrorism after an opening statement by defense attorney frank hancock,who called elfgeeh a citizen who sent money overseas for yemeni immigrants innocently seeking to support their families and invest in their native country.
after the jury left the courtroom,chen asked district judge sterling johnson of brooklyn to let her refute hancock claims by introducing what she called suspicious checks confiscated from elfgeeh,some bearing the words jihad and mujahidin.others were made out to the charitable society for social welfare,which the fbi has described as a terrorist front.
johnson rejected her request but is expected to revisit the issue as the trial moves forward.
elfgeeh first came to the attention of fbi agents as they investigated sheik mohammed ali hassan,whom they eventually accused of funneling money from the united states to and hamas.was convicted of supporting and conspiring to support terrorism and sentenced to years in prison in july.
witnesses at trial said he kept elfgeeh number in his phone book and called elfgeeh someone he trusted to transfer money from the united states to yemen.
the associated press,jury wo hear about alleged links,newsday,september,at emphases added.
the new york post contained two articles about the case.a news article entitled terror charges melt away appeared on page.it reiterated allegations about abad links to yemeni sheik mohammed ali hassan and the district court ruling that prohibited mention of terrorism.it also stated abad elfgeeh had pleaded guilty to the charges in,but was allowed to withdraw the guilty plea after stating his lawyer at the time had not made him fully aware of the sentence that came with the deal.zach haberman,terror charges melt away,new york post,september,at emphasis added.a column on page by andrea peyser entitled trial serves up some real nutty buddies stated in part 
when elfgeeh was arrested,attorney general john ashcroft went so far as to say that this case proves the fbi can better prevent terrorism and save american lives.
was abad elfgeeh,upstanding american citizen,financing terror through ice cream you may never know because federal jurors may never hear the t word spoken aloud.
elfgeeh is standing trial on charges he illegally transferred money to could put him away for years.but prosecutors agreed that mentioning terror might prejudice the jury,a source told me.this surreal trial gets even stranger,when you learn how it all came about.
on elfgeeh s legal team in brooklyn federal court is one burton pugach.he is a jolly paralegal and former lawyer who was disbarred more than years ago after he was convicted of hiring three men to throw lye in the face of a girlfriend who tried to leave him.she was blinded permanently.then he married her.
then,eight years ago,he was accused of threatening to maim a second woman.
i only asked someone to beat her up,pugach,said about his wife,who for some reason remains wed to him.
so now he wants to fight for fellow victims of the system.
elfgeeh actually pleaded guilty to the charges against him two years ago.but then he met pugach.he pleaded not guilty and now faces up to years in prison if convicted.pugach is convinced his client sic will walk.these two deserve each other.
andrea peyser,trial serves up some real nutty buddies,new york post,september,at.
on the morning that these articles appeared,assistant united states attorney ausa pamela chen notified the district judge,before the jury was called into the courtroom,that publicity about the elfgeehs trial had appeared in the media.she pointed out that the judge had not,either during his preliminary instructions to the jury or in the previous day proceedings,instructed the jurors to avoid media reports about the trial.the ausa asked,
c ould the court admonish the jury as the standard not to read the paper and all that i think perhaps yesterday that did happen.i want to make sure since i have seen 
the court this case was in the paper 
chen this morning.
the court which paper 
chen the new york post.there were reporters here yesterday.i think it also made the ap wire.i think it worth reminding sic them.
hancock i did see it.i join in the application.
chen just cautionary.
tr.emphases added.after calling the jury into the courtroom,the district court offered the following warning 
the other thing i have to admonish you,this case is going to be decided by the evidence or lack of evidence.evidence is sworn testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits that i allow in therefore anything that anybody else says,whether defense counsel or the prosecutor or it me is not evidence in the case.
also,if you read anything in the newspapers about this do think there will be anything in the newspapers sic you not to concern yourselves.do read that.
id.at.this admonition was followed by a warning that the trial was not related to terrorism see part.above.
that afternoon,after the lunch break,there was further discussion about the trial publicity outside the presence of the jury.counsel for aref stated 
your honor,you been most scrupulous,have done a herculean job in this case to instruct the jury to keep their focus on this case,that the issues are basically a banking issue,as you described it this morning.
unfortunately,there have been some articles in the major daily newspapers of new york,and i talking about the post,newsday and the news which have contained very deleterious statements concerning the material that your honor wanted to keep from the jury knowledge.
in particular,the article speaks about the defendants ties to terrorists.the articles mention how your honor prevented the government from including checks,which bear words like jihad and what the fbi describes as a terrorist front.
the articles similarly refer to evidence linking these defendants to the defendant al mo a yad,who was tried before your honor and convicted and al mo a yad is identified as being convicted and with links to hamas and al qaeda.
the article further prejudices the defendant abad elfgeeh by disclosing the fact he had pled guilty before and withdrew his plea.
i would like your honor to read the articles,the two i have in front of me and afterwards,i would like to move,most respectfully,for a mistrial,or in the alternative,have your honor speak to the jurors individually and i do mean minutes see,one,that they have not read the articles to ensure they wo read any more articles and,secondly,i make this application because i not sure whether your honor specifically instructed the jurors before not to read articles about this case.
the court i did this morning.
friedman may have done it on the train.
the court i speak to them again.
you wanted to say something,chen 
chen no,i was going to say that why we raised this issue this morning,your honor,because we were aware of articles.
the court i was not aware of it,but i have already seen it over the lunch break.
chen i thought you perfectly dealt with it by admonishing them.if the court would like to inquire of them when they return,if anybody has read any articles,we have no objection to that.individual voir dires are not necessary,your honor.your standard way of dealing with it would be fine.
hancock i do know what the standard way is.i join in cocounsel application.sometimes when you have a situation like this,you make it worse.
the court i agree with you.
hancock i do know what the remedy is.
the court generally in a situation like this,rather than call attention to it,because those who have not read it,maybe now they want to read it.i reiterate anything in the papers you not to read.if you come across it,put it down.again,i reiterate it,this case will be decided solely on the evidence.
friedman would your honor as a group then ask the jury if they read any article dealing with this case if you get a positive,we take care of it.
the court there might be some who have not read it,you call their attention to it.i did not know anything about articles when i came here this morning.chen happened to mention it.i still did see it.
when i went back during the lunch hour,i was reading the newspaper and i came across it.in fact,my paper did have it.i got the queens news that somebody else gave me,which is the brooklyn news.that the way i going to handle it.
chen may i note for the record when you spoke to the jury this morning about this issue,none of the jurors indicated verbally or in my observation in any other way that they actually had read anything when you mentioned the press issue.
the court it going to be kind of delicate for me to mention this again.i think what i should do at the end of the day,when we get ready to go home,to mention it again as opposed to right after lunch.
friedman again,i have made my request.my request is on the record.
the court i understand.i sensitive to it.
tr.emphasis added.accordingly,at the end of the day,the district court again instructed the jurors that they should avoid media reports about the trial 
have a nice weekend.do discuss the case.keep an open mind.if you read anything in the paper about this case,put it down,do not read it.
i will admonish you again that this case is going to be determined based solely upon the evidence,sworn testimony of witnesses and the exhibits that i have allowed in evidence.
further discussion about the trial publicity occurred on the next day of trial,september,after a weekend break.this time,it was counsel for abad who raised the issue 
one other issue,elfgeeh came to my office saturday.for the first time i saw this article,an article in the post,apparently went out in the morning edition.from what i been able to discern,the editor came in,pulled it,but the first issue went out.this is,of course,the issue that jurors would get on their way to court in the morning.part of it deals with abad elfgeeh,shows elfgeeh next to al mo a yad,the two,making a link.apparently andrea pizer ph,a columnist for the post talked to puga c h,went into his history,indicated he was a nut and basically my client is a nut article is as it is.
i concerned the jury is going to see this.i have to put elfgeeh on the stand after this.there are two allegations under direct testimony with the government stating my client is a terrorist,an allegation there overwhelming evidence against aref elfgeeh because of the conspiracy,i suppose,would and could come back and touch on abad elfgeeh.i would like to put him on the stand to testify.i so afraid they going to come up with information about terrorist activity,islamic charities,things of that nature.
for instance,there was a charity that elfgeeh has given money to in the past,called islamic relief,pledged million to the gulf region victims.he given maybe,to various agencies such as this,charitable agencies.he gets on the witness stand,starts talking about this charity versus that charity,whether this is a terrorist front or not,i ca put him on.on the other hand,i forced to put him on because of articles like this.i would ask for a motion in limine if he testifies,he does not go near any of these issues about charities that the government not be allowed under some guise,character,some other reason to bring it up under.
the court when you put a person on the stand,he can be cross examined as far as his story is concerned,issues of credibility.i not going to do that.i do know what he going to testify to,what his is going to be.
i have seen that article.let me see it now.i am again going to caution the jurors.
tr.when the jury entered the courtroom,the district judge stated 
i want to admonish you,again,keep an open mind that you are not to read anything in the newspapers and that this case will be decided solely on the evidence,as i told you before,sworn testimony of the witness es and it the answers,not the questions,and whatever exhibits i choose to admit.
the final discussion about the trial publicity occurred during a break on the same day,september.it consisted principally of the following exchange 
the court did you say you spoke to the editor of the new york post 
hancock no,sir.
i first received that saturday morning,about noon,from elfgeeh.it is my understanding that they pulled that article when the editor came in that morning and replaced it with another article without piser sic column.
chen to clarify the record,when he says that article,i think he is referring only to the one about pugach.
hancock yes.
the court it is an article from the new york post dated september.it refers top article is terror case melts and beneath it says trial serves up some real nutty buddies.
this portion of the article,nutty buddies.
hancock that bothers me.
the court that was pulled 
hancock yes,sir.
the court okay.all right.
recess taken.
hancock you asked before we broke about my taking umbrage to the article in the post.i also take umbrage to the two photographs 
the court i assuming that you took exception to the whole article,but i wanted to clarify which one the editor withdrew.i understand that.
hancock thank you.
the record does not indicate that any articles other than the september articles were published about the defendants during the course of the trial.
the jury verdicts and forfeiture findings 
the jury found aref and abad guilty on all of the counts with which they were charged.after the jury returned its verdicts,the trial proceedings turned to the issue of forfeiture to determine what,if any,assets the defendants would be required to turn over to the government.the government sought forfeiture of on the ground that that was the total involved in defendants operation of the hawala in violation of a,citing a,which provides that 
t he court,in imposing sentence on a person convicted of an offense in violation of section of this title,shall order that the person forfeit to the united states any property,real or personal,involved in such offense,or any property traceable to such property.
the government also sought forfeiture of that sum on the ground that that was the amount involved in abad structuring offense in violation of a,citing c a,which provides that 
t he court in imposing sentence for any violation of section of this title,or any conspiracy to commit such violation,shall order the defendant to forfeit all property,real or personal,involved in the offense and any property traceable thereto.
no evidence was presented at the forfeiture hearing the jury simply heard argument from counsel as to what assets should be forfeited.the government argued that the amount to be forfeited should include all assets that passed through the carnival french ice cream account.see tr.counsel for abad briefly urged the jury to require the government to return to abad the personal property that it had already seized from him.see id.at.counsel for aref presented no argument.see id.at.
after deliberating briefly,the jury returned a verdict finding that was involved in or traceable to the unlicensed business or the structuring activity.see tr.the verdict did not distinguish between the two defendants or between the various charges.counsel for abad promptly asked the district court to set aside the verdict,stating,i think the jury was confused.how could the total amount of the money be subject to forfeiture when there was a mixture of checks and cash id.at.the district court denied the motion.see id.no other challenge was made.
sentencing 
abad and aref were sentenced in separate proceedings in february.according to the presentence report psr prepared by the probation department on abad,the advisory guidelines range for imprisonment was months,based on increases for an aggravating role in the offense,obstruction of justice,and the amount of money involved in the criminal activity.in sentencing abad,the district court imposed a prison term of months see abad elfgeeh sentencing transcript,february,abad,at,stating,a ccording to booker the sentencing guidelines are advisory.and i have considered the guidelines,along with the other factors in,and i have come to this particular sentence id.at.
the psr on abad also noted that the range for the fine to be assessed against him was to,which encompassed all five counts on which he was convicted.the district court imposed a fine of on each count see id.at,for a total of million.the court stated,i impose this sentence because i think it is sufficient for the crime that was committed.id.the court ordered abad to forfeit.
the psr prepared on aref concluded that the prison range was months.that range was based on a base offense level of,plus a enhancement for the value of the currency had been transferred during the time for which aref was convicted of having participated in the offenses,and a upward adjustment for obstruction of justice for having given perjurious testimony at trial and at the suppression hearing.aref challenged the adjustment,arguing that his trial testimony,given his difficulty with english,was the product of confusion,mistake or faulty memory.letter from arthur friedman to shayna bryant,united states probation officer,dated december,aref letter,at quoting united states dunnigan,d.
at the sentencing hearing,the government suggested that aref be credited with a downward adjustment on the ground that he played a minor role in the offense,which would reduce his incarceration range to months.see aref elfgeeh sentencing transcript,february,at.the district court imposed a sentence of months intersection between the government suggested range and the range see id.at stating that there are more questions that loom than answers that were disclosed id.at.the district court stated,i impose this sentence because i think it sufficient for the crime that was committed,and i took into consideration the guidelines and also a.id.at see also id.t his is something that i think is the right thing.the district court ordered aref to pay a fine of on each count,for a total of,and to forfeit.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,both defendants contend principally that they were denied a fair trial by special agent murphy mentions of terrorism and by the news articles that linked abad to persons who were known or believed to be terrorists,and that the district court gave the jury an erroneous instruction on the mens rea element of a as amended.aref also contends that the district court erred in not excluding his postarrest statements and in not giving the jury a proper instruction as to its consideration of those statements.in addition,both defendants challenge their sentences on various grounds.for the reasons that follow,we find no basis for reversing their convictions or for disturbing most facets of their sentences.we vacate so much of abad sentence as imposed the fine,and we remand for reconsideration of the adjustment applied to aref.
aref postarrest statements 
aref contends that his postarrest statements about his involvement in the business were involuntary and that the district court erred in admitting them in evidence and in not instructing the jury that it could determine what weight to give them.we see no error.
admissibility 
prior to trial,aref moved to suppress his postarrest statements on the grounds that they were not voluntary,that when arrested he was in pain from a march operation on his back,that he had not been advised of his miranda rights prior to making those statements,and that he did not waive those rights.a pretrial suppression hearing was held at which aref testified in support of these contentions see suppression hearing transcript dated september,supp.tr,at,and special agent murphy testified as follows.
murphy testified that aref was arrested in december at john kennedy international airport.murphy advised aref of his miranda rights at the airport,reading them from an card he kept in his wallet.see supp.tr.aref indicated that he understood his rights.then driven to the fbi office in lower manhattan for processing.during that drive,aref began to say he knew what the arrest was about and that abad elfgeeh,his uncle,was the person to blame.id.at.murphy told aref to wait until they arrived at the fbi office before speaking about the case.see id.
once they arrived at the fbi office,murphy again advised aref of his miranda rights,and he gave aref an form written in both english and arabic.see id.at.murphy instructed aref to read the form,asked aref if he understood it,and then went over the form to ensure that aref understood each sentence.see id.at.aref refused to sign the form but indicated that he was willing to speak to the agents.see id.questioning of aref ensued,first in english,and then in arabic with the aid of an interpreter,until aref indicated that he was tired and wanted a lawyer,when the questioning ceased.see id.at.
the district court denied aref suppression motion.it found that the testimony given by agent murphy wa s credible and that the testimony of the defendant,aref elfgeeh,wa s incredible.supp.tr.the court found that aref was given miranda warnings at the airport that on the drive from the airport to manhattan,murphy stopped aref from initiating a conversation about the facts leading to his arrest that there was no violation of the defendant sixth amendment right to counsel id.at and that the government ha d sustained its burden to show a voluntary,knowing,and intelligent waiver of aref miranda rights id.at.
aref contends that this ruling should be overturned on the ground that he was denied a fair opportunity to support his suppression motion because the district court violated his sixth amendment right of confrontation by limiting his attorney of murphy.the record does not support this contention.the district court has 
wide latitude insofar as the confrontation clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such based on concerns about,among other things,harassment,prejudice,confusion of the issues,the witness s safety,or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.
delaware van arsdall,d see,davis alaska,d united states salameh,cir,cert.denied,d.
here,following murphy direct testimony,which lasted approximately minutes,aref attorney murphy for nearly an hour and a half.the covered various topics,including aref luggage see supp.tr,the vienna convention on consular relations see id.at,arabic dialects see id.at,notes taken by murphy while interrogating aref see id.at,an fbi legal handbook see id.at,aref indication that he would like something to eat see id.at,and murphy decision to ask a translator to help with the interrogation see id.at.
periodically during the,the district court cautioned aref counsel that certain questions had been a sked and answered.id.at see also id.at.after some minutes of questioning,the court reminded aref counsel,t he issue before me is the voluntariness of any statement made by the defendant,and stated,i have heard you address that.id.at.aref counsel indicated that his questioning was designed to show that murphy was biased or that his testimony was otherwise inaccurate in describing his encounter with aref.see id.at stating that a s a matter of impeachment,if a witness is biased,his testimony may be rejected no matter what he says.the court cautioned that it would permit aref counsel to explore this a little more and then the court would cut it off id.at,because aref counsel was wasting time id.at.
aref counsel continued to question murphy in the same vein,and the court repeatedly cautioned that the time was running out.the court eventually warned counsel that it would allow him more minutes,and subsequently eight minutes,and then two minutes.see id.at.finally,the court told aref counsel that his time wa s up.id.at.when counsel objected that the court was truncating his of th e witness,the district court stated let the record reflect this witness testified on direct examination approximately minutes.you been almost an hour and a half.id.aref has not suggested that this description was inaccurate.
this record does not indicate any abuse of discretion in the court termination of aref counsel of murphy.rather,it reflects that the court exhibited considerable patience during a that was repetitive and into matters that were at best tangential,without exploring the issue of voluntariness.we see no violation of aref confrontation rights.
nor do we see any error in the court ruling that aref postarrest statements were voluntary.findings that a defendant has waived his right to remain silent and his right not to be interrogated in the absence of counsel,see generally edwards arizona,d,are reviewed only for clear error,see,united states isom,cir.there was no such error here.
jury instructions as to voluntariness 
with respect to his postarrest statements,aref also contends,citing united states barry,cir,that the court should have given the jury an instruction pursuant to.aref elfgeeh brief on appeal at.that section provides that the trial court,after admitting in evidence a defendant statements that it found were made voluntarily,shall permit the jury to hear relevant evidence on the issue of voluntariness and shall instruct the jury to give such weight to the confession as the jury feels it deserves under all the circumstances.a see also id.e as used in this section,the term confession means any confession of guilt of any criminal offense or any statement made or given orally or in writing.we find no basis for reversal in the court instructions.
while aref counsel noted during the charging conference that the district court charge to the jury did not include instructions about the voluntariness of aref statements to murphy see tr,at no point was a jury instruction pursuant to requested by aref.his initial proposed instructions did not include such an instruction and his subsequent letter to the district court,sent in response to an inquiry by the court as to any remaining questions about the charge,did not request such an instruction.accordingly,the court failure to instruct the jury pursuant to a is reviewable only for plain error.see,united states fuentes,cir,cert.denied,d.a plain error is one that,inter alia,prejudicially affected the defendant substantial rights and seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states olano,d internal quotation marks omitted.aref claim does not meet this test.
although we stated in united states barry that a defendant may properly claim that he made no incriminating statements and that any statements which the jury might find that he made were coerced,at,we have since clarified that an instruction of the kind required by is mandated only where an issue of voluntariness has in fact been raised at trial,united states fuentes,at.an assertion that the defendant did not understand his miranda rights is not sufficient to require the voluntariness instruction,see id.nor is it sufficient that there is testimony that the defendant had initially stated that he did not wish to talk to the officers,see id.at.where t here was little,if any,evidence from which a jury could infer that the statement was involuntary,a does not require that the jury be specifically charged on voluntariness.united states lewis,cir,cert.denied,d.
here,there is no suggestion that the court excluded any relevant evidence as to voluntariness,but little such evidence was presented.although aref testified that when he was arrested he was in pain due to a back operation he had had nine months earlier,and aref counsel argued in summation that aref did not understand the waiver form he read in arabic and english see tr,there was virtually no evidence from which the jury could infer that aref statements to murphy were involuntary.and while the trial court did not instruct the jurors to determine for themselves what weight to accord to aref postarrest statements in particular,the court gave the usual general instruction that the jurors are the sole judges of the weight and effect of all evidence.id.at.given the record,we are not persuaded that there was error here,much less plain error,and we see no indication that aref substantial rights were affected.
testimony mentioning terrorism or violence 
defendants contend that they are entitled to a new trial on account of special agent murphy mentions of terrorism during his testimony,and the government questioning of abad about a blood feud in yemen.we disagree.
where an inadmissible statement is followed by a curative instruction,the court must assume that a jury will follow an instruction to disregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently presented to it,unless there is an overwhelming probability that the jury will be unable to follow the court instructions,and a strong likelihood that the effect of the evidence would be devastating to the defendant.greer miller,d internal quotation marks omitted.
there can be little doubt that in the wake of the events of september,evidence linking a defendant to terrorism in a trial in which he is not charged with terrorism is likely to cause undue prejudice.the district court endorsed that view.when murphy stated that he had been investigating a case that had to do with terrorism in response to questioning by abad attorney that may have been confusingly repetitive but that did not actually require him to mention court promptly gave a curative instruction to the jury,stating that the case was not about terrorism.tr.
after murphy,in answer to abad attorney ensuing question probing murphy instructions as to what the ci was to do in abad shop,stated that he had asked the ci to attempt to move money from the united states to yemen for terrorist causes id,the court promptly,in a sidebar conference,admonished the government to instruct murphy to avoid gratuitous mention of terrorism and warned abad counsel to be more careful with his questions see id.at.although it might have been preferable for the court also to give a second cautionary instruction immediately rather than later,it was well within the court discretion to conclude that another such warning so soon after the first was unnecessary,especially in light of the fact that abad attorney,who elicited the second mention of which aref,not abad,before aref objection,already begun to ask his next question.the court gave another cautionary instruction the following morning see id.at and at various points during the trial,as well as in its final instructions,the court gave additional general admonitions to consider only the testimony and documents that the court had allowed in evidence see,id.at.
although the two inappropriate answers by murphy indicated that abad was suspected of funding terrorism,the trial produced no further mentions of terrorism.we see no indication that the jury was unable or unwilling to heed the court repeated instructions that terrorism was not an element in the case,that the case was about alleged violations,and that the jury must consider only the evidence admitted at trial.the properly presented evidence that defendants had operated an unlicensed business,and that abad had structured the deposits into the carnival and feeder accounts,was overwhelming.we can not conclude that murphy two mentions of terrorism denied defendants a fair trial.
defendants also argue that the government reintroduced the subject of terrorism into the trial by asking abad whether he had sent money to yemen in connection with tribal wars,blood feuds,or other violence,and that those questions should have been excluded.we disagree with their characterization of this questioning and with their challenge to its admissibility.
the trial court has broad discretion to exclude even relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.see,old chief united states,d.the term unfair prejudice,as to a criminal defendant,speaks to the capacity of some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof specific to the offense charged.id.at.the rule of opening the door,or curative admissibility,gives the trial court discretion to permit a party to introduce otherwise inadmissible evidence on an issue a when the opposing party has introduced inadmissible evidence on the same issue,and b when it is needed to rebut a false impression that may have resulted from the opposing party evidence.united states rosa,cir,cert.denied,d.when a defendant offers an innocent explanation he opens the door to questioning into the truth of his testimony,and the government is entitled to attack his credibility on.united states payton,cir.a defendant has no right to avoid into the truth of his direct examination,even as to matters not related to the merits of the charges against him.id.
here,the district court ruled that if the elfgeehs testified that they merely helped yemeni immigrants to send money home to their family and friends,it would open the door to allow the government to attempt to show that the elfgeehs sent money instead for bellicose purposes.see tr.abad offered such testimony three times during his direct examination.see id.at yemeni community member would come,give me the money and deposit the money in the bank,ask the bank to wire transfer the money to the other side,to his family,a member of his family.id.at my brother in yemen give that money to the the beneficiaries that these people here send to the family to receive.id.at describing sending money to someone who is in a hospital.accordingly,the government was allowed to ask abad whether he knew that the money he sent was being used to buy arms and ammunition and was allowed to submit documentary evidence obliquely referring to such use see id.at,in order to attack abad credibility.in connection with this line of questioning,the government did not mention terrorism abad denied any knowledge that the money he sent was used for violent purposes see id.at,and defense counsel thereafter elicited testimony from abad that,so far as he knew,the united states government had no position in the dispute between yemeni tribes see id.at.we see no abuse of discretion in the district court evidentiary rulings and no unfair prejudice to defendants.
publicity and juror impartiality 
defendants also argue that the district court erred in failing to canvass the jury to determine whether any juror had been exposed to prejudicial media coverage during the course of the trial.they argue that the district court repeated admonitions to the jury to avoid news coverage of the trial were insufficient to ensure that the jurors had not been exposed to such coverage and that defendants are entitled to a new trial based on this error.we conclude that the proceedings in this regard,though they seem to have been a bit haphazard,provide no basis for reversal.
a district court decision regarding juror impartiality is reviewed for abuse of discretion and deserves deference.united states mcdonough,cir see also united states gaggi,cir.gaggi absent a clear abuse of the trial court discretion,its finding that the jury was impartial should be upheld,cert.denied,d.
in gaggi,we set out a process for the trial court to follow when it is brought to the court attention that there has been publicity about the case during trial.
the simple process is,first,to determine whether the coverage has a potential for unfair prejudice,second,to canvass the jury to find out if they have learned of the potentially prejudicial publicity and,third,to examine individually exposed the presence of the other ascertain how much they know of the distracting publicity and what effect,if any,it has had on that juror ability to decide the case fairly.
at see also united states lord,cir.this process is simple and is efficient to determine whether the publicity has the potential to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.the court should of course give an instruction even if one has been given earlier,for example,immediately after the jury has been sworn in that the jurors should not read any news article about the trial or watch or listen to any item on television or radio about the trial.if this process is followed,we may presume,in the absence of any indication to the contrary,that the jurors have followed the court instructions and have rendered their verdict solely on the basis of the evidence at trial.see,united states zichettello,cir,cert.denied,d united states mcdonough,at united states casamento,cir,cert.denied,d gaggi,at.
we have also held,however,that where the defendants prefer not to have the jurors interviewed individually,the trial court has discretion to forgo such interviews and instead give a general admonition to the jurors as a group to avoid exposure to publicity about the case.see united states eisen,cir individual interviews with the jurors were not necessary because the defendants specifically requested that no such individual voir dire be conducted for fear of magnifying the problem,cert.denied,d.in the absence of any indication that the jurors failed to follow the court instructions,we found that t he steps taken to protect the integrity of the jury deliberations were adequate under the circumstances.id.
in the present case,so far as appears from the record,none of the parties called the court attention to the prescribed procedure or to any of the above authorities,although aref attorney eventually made a proper request.as described in part.above,on the morning of september,the second day of testimony,four news articles appeared in three new york city area newspapers.before trial began that day,the ausa brought that fact,that articles had been published,to the attention of the district court.see tr.the judge had not seen any of the news items see id.at abad counsel stated that he had not seen them see id.at and apparently neither the attorneys nor the judge had copies of any of the pertinent newspapers in court.the ausa asked the court to give the jury an admonition not to read the newspapers,and abad counsel join ed in the application.id.the court accordingly instructed the jurors that the case was to be decided strictly on the basis of the evidence at trial and that they were not to read anything in the newspapers about the case.see id.at.
we see no error in the way the district court handled the matter up to that point.although the first step to be followed under gaggi and its progeny is to determine whether the news coverage has the potential for unfair prejudice,that step could not be taken on the morning of september because the judge had not seen,and was not presented with,any of the articles.at that time,the court could not sensibly do more than it did,which was,with abad attorney concurrence,simply to instruct the jury to avoid news items about the case.
after the court had read one of the articles during the lunch break,however,the answer to gaggi question was clear the articles plainly had the potential for unfair prejudice.each referred to the elfgeehs trial and made pointed references to,inter alia,terrorism al qaeda in addition,they described evidence that the jury would not be allowed to see or hear at trial and two of the articles stated that abad had previously pleaded guilty to the charges on which he was now being tried.see part.above.accordingly,had there been no objection or reservation expressed by defense counsel,the court should have proceeded to gaggi second step and canvassed the jury to determine whether any juror had been exposed to any of the news items.
however,aref attorney,who stated,i not sure whether your honor specifically instructed the jurors before not to read articles about this case tr,asked the judge to speak to the jurors individually to see that they have not read the articles and to ensure they wo read any more articles id.abad attorney joined in aref motion but it would not have been appropriate for the court to grant that motion,thereby going directly to gaggi third step,because it had not yet determined,in accordance with step two,that there was a need for such individual interviews.indeed,there may have been no such need,for the colloquys indicate that the articles on the trial did not appear in all editions of their respective newspapers.
the government,in opposition to aref initial motion for individual juror interviews,had suggested that the court instead make a general inquiry as to whether anybody has read any articles.id.at.abad attorney,although stating that he joined in aref motion which sought a mistrial or individual juror interviews,also stated that s ometimes when you have a situation like this,you make it worse a statement that was somewhat ambiguous as to whether he was expressing concern about conducting individual juror interviews or about posing a group question asking whether any juror had been exposed to the articles,or about both but whatever his concern,it was shared by the court,which was hesitant to call the articles to the jurors attention.the colloquy was 
hancock sometimes when you have a situation like this,you make it worse.
the court i agree with you.
hancock i do know what the remedy is.
the court generally in a situation like this,rather than call attention to it,because those who have not read it,maybe now they want to read it,i reiterate anything in the papers you not to read.if you come across it,put it down.again,i reiterate it,this case will be decided solely on the evidence.
nonetheless,aref attorney proceeded to ask the court to inquire of the jury as a group if anyone had read any article dealing with this case,with further steps to be taken if there was an affirmative answer.id.although this was a proper request by aref for the court to follow step two of the gaggi procedure,abad counsel,whose expression of concern followed essentially the same suggestion by the government,did not state that he joined in this new motion by aref.the court denied this motion,reiterating that such a question might pique undue curiosity on the part of jurors who had not seen the articles,and decided simply to issue another warning at the end of the day.see id.at.
had there been no expression of concern by abad attorney following the government suggestion that the court pose a general question to the jury,or had abad joined in aref eventually appropriate motion for such questioning,the court should have followed the gaggi procedure and asked the jurors,as a group,whether any of them had been exposed to the articles.in the circumstances as they appeared,however,with one defendant requesting,properly,that the jury be asked whether any jurors had seen a news article and the other defendant,as was his right,not joining in that motion and expressing concern that asking such a question might pose a greater danger of prejudice than not asking the question,we conclude that the trial judge had discretion to decide whether or not to put the question to the jury.
we can not conclude here that the trial judge abused that discretion.the articles were clearly prejudicial,but it is hardly clear that the jurors would have seen them.the judge had not seen them abad attorney had not seen them and we assume that aref attorney had not seen them since he said nothing during the first discussion of the articles and at lunchtime did not even recall that the court had instructed the jury that morning to avoid such articles.the articles did not appear in all of that morning editions of their respective newspapers.indeed,the judge himself could not find the article in the edition of the newspaper he first searched during the lunch break,finding it only in another edition of the paper.and abad attorney did not see one of the new york post articles until the weekend.that article had appeared in the earliest edition but had been withdrawn from other editions.the court repeatedly cautioned the jurors not to view any news items on the trial,and we presume that the jurors followed the court instructions.
in all the circumstances,with one defendant not joining the motion to have the court ask the jury whether anyone had seen any of the articles and expressing concern that asking that question might make matters worse,we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in declining to put the question to the jury.
instructions on the knowledge requirement of amended a 
defendants contend that in instructing the jury with respect to count four,which charged them with operating an unlicensed business after october,the district court erred by not informing the jury that the government was required to prove that they knew the business was unlicensed.although we agree that the jury should have been so instructed,we find no basis for reversal,for the court failure to give that instruction explicitly was,in the circumstances of this case,harmless.
the version of provides,in pertinent part,as follows 
a whoever knowingly conducts,controls,manages,supervises,directs,or owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business,shall be fined in accordance with this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
b as used in this section 
the term unlicensed money transmitting business means a money transmitting business which affects interstate or foreign commerce in any manner or degree and 
a is operated without an appropriate money transmitting license in a state where such operation is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony under state law,whether or not the defendant knew that the operation was required to be licensed or that the operation was so punishable 
b fails to comply with the money transmitting business registration requirements under section of title,united states code,or regulations prescribed under such section or 
c otherwise involves the transportation or transmission of funds that are known to the defendant to have been derived from a criminal offense or are intended to be used to promote or support unlawful activity.
as amended october.prior to october,the statute provided,in pertinent part 
a whoever conducts,controls,manages,supervises,directs,or owns all or part of a business,knowing the business is an illegal money transmitting business,shall be fined in accordance with this title or imprisoned not more than years,or both.
b as used in this section 
the term illegal money transmitting business means a money transmitting business which affects interstate or foreign commerce in any manner or degree and 
a is intentionally operated without an appropriate money transmitting license in a state where such operation is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony under state law or 
b fails to comply with the money transmitting business registration requirements under section of title,united states code,or regulations prescribed under such section.
emphases added.
thus,in order to convict a defendant of owning or conducting,a business in violation of a prior to october,the government was required to prove that the defendant had know ledge that the business wa s an illegal money transmitting business,id.emphases added,one that was intentionally operated without an appropriate money transmitting license,id.b a emphasis added.under a as amended,however,the government need prove only that the defendant had know ledge that the business was an unlicensed money transmitting business,a as amended emphasis added.accordingly,the government is no longer required to prove that he knew the business was illegal.
in amending a in this way in october,congress made a stricter by eliminating the requirement of proof that the defendant knew that a license was required.see,united states hopkins,cir one way of heightening criminal sanctions is to reduce the mens rea element of the prohibited acts,cert.denied,d.however,the language of the amended section knowingly conducts an unlicensed money transmitting business appears still to require proof that the defendant knew that the business was engaged in and also knew that the business had no license.and that implication is supported by subsection b a of the amended,which defines an unlicensed money transmitting business,in relevant part,as one that is operated without an appropriate money transmitting license in a state where such operation is punishable as a misdemeanor or a felony under state law,whether or not the defendant knew that the operation was required to be licensed or that the operation was so punishable,b a as amended emphases added.the amended subsection b a thus explicitly makes it irrelevant whether or not a defendant knew that a license was required but it does not state that it is irrelevant whether he knew it was unlicensed.united states talebnejad,cir noting that t he parties agree that the government must allege and prove the defendant knowledge that he operate d a money transmitting business,that it affect ed interstate commerce,and that it wa s unlicensed under state law,cert.denied,d.we infer from the language of subsection a itself and from the absence from subsection b a of a whether or not clause mentioning knowledge of the possession of a license,that in order to convict under the amended a,the government is required to prove that the defendant knew the business was unlicensed.
in the present case,aref asked the court to instruct the jury,inter alia,that t he government must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that the business was unlicensed.the trial court should have included such an instruction in its charge to the jury.
nonetheless,where the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator,there is a strong presumption that any constitutional errors that may have occurred including jury instructions that omit an essential element of the offense are subject to analysis.neder united states,d internal quotation marks omitted.if we can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the omitted element was uncontested and supported by overwhelming evidence,such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error,that the error did not contribute to the verdict obtained,then the erroneous instruction is properly found to be harmless.id.at.quoting chapman california,d.
in assessing the likely effect of imperfect instructions on the jury,we must view them in light of the jury charge as a whole.see,cupp naughten,d gaggi,at united states clark,cir the charge must be viewed in its entirety and not on the basis of excerpts taken out of context,which might separately be open to serious question.in reviewing an ambiguous instruction,we inquire whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that is fundamentally unfair.see,estelle mcguire,d boyde california,d.
in the present case,the court instructions did not state that the government must prove that defendants knew they were operating the business after october without a license,and stated that as to the fourth count,the charge that the elfgeehs operated an unlicensed business after october,the government need only prove that the defendant knew that he was engaged in transmission of money on behalf of others.tr.nonetheless,the instructions in this regard were ambiguous,for both before and after that sentence,the court told the jury that the only difference between the pre and versions of a was that,under the latter,the government need not prove that the defendant knew that a license was required or that the operation was illegal.
thus,as to count two,which,as the court read it to the jury,charged abad with conducting a business between january and october knowing that the business was an illegal money transmitting business,the court stated that the government was required to prove that abad knew that the business was an illegal money transmitting business,which means that it was intentionally operated without an appropriate money transmitting license and that the defendant was aware that the business was required to be licensed.tr,emphases added.
after explaining the terms knowingly,willfully,and intentionally,and the ways in which those mental states may be evidenced,the court turned to count four,which charged both abad and aref with conducting a money transmitting business between november and january.the court stated that the amended a 
provide s in relevant part 
whoever knowingly conducts,controls,manages,supervises,directs or owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business shall be guilty of a crime.
the elements required to prove the defendant guilty of count four are the same as those required for count two,with one exception.that exception is that for count four,the government does not have to prove that the defendant knew of the licensing requirement or that it was unlawful to operate such a business without a license.that is because the statute changed in november,such that it was no longer necessary that the defendant k new of the licensing requirement in order to be guilty of the crime.
tr.emphases added.up to that point,the instruction was correct.the ensuing sentence,that the government need only prove that the defendant knew that he was engaged in transmission of money on behalf of others id,was unduly limited and thus introduced an ambiguity.the court then continued 
in other words,in count two,which charges the defendant abad elfgeeh with conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business between january and october,the government must prove that the defendant knew of the licensing requirement or that the business was illegal.however,for count four,which charges both defendants with conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business between november and january,the government need not prove that the defendants knew of the licensing requirement or that it was unlawful to operate such a business without a license.
thus,viewing the instructions as a whole,there was a single sentence that was erroneous,and it was preceded and followed by correct instructions that the only difference between counts two and four was that on count four the government did not need to prove that the defendant knew that a license was a legal requirement.we think it highly unlikely that the jury focused on that lone erroneous sentence and disregarded the correct instructions that surrounded it.
in any event,the evidence at trial was such that the jury verdict would have been the same absent the error.as to abad,a march letter from the new york state banking department,found in his files,stated that a license was required for a business abad attorney had told abad that he needed a license and a state banking department witness testified that abad had no license.there could be no doubt that abad knew his business was unlicensed.
as to aref,although the evidence was more circumstantial,we likewise conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the instructional error did not contribute to the verdict against him.first,we note that the matter of aref knowledge as to whether the business was unlicensed was not expressly put in issue.his attorney opening statement to the jury did not suggest that aref was unaware that the business was unlicensed his summation did not suggest that the government had failed to prove that aref knew the business was unlicensed.and aref testimony was that he did not participate,not that he was unaware that the business was unlicensed.
the government evidence,on the other hand,overwhelmingly revealed the furtiveness of the actions of aref,as well as abad,in the operations.it showed,inter alia,that the hawala used numerous different bank accounts and small denominations of money that aref,like abad,opened accounts using the names addresses of other persons or entities that even within the carnival store which was listed as aref employer on bank documentation relating to one or more of aref accounts,the business was not promoted openly that customers were limited to known members of the brooklyn yemeni community that neither abad nor aref ever reported any income from the business in their respective tax filings and that aref continued to use the prospect deli account for hawala business after that deli closed in.and when aref at abad behest sent the last in the prospect deli account to abad brother,he did not write a check on that account to abad brother.rather,aref signed two prospect deli checks to himself and deposited them in his own account and from his own account he wrote several checks intended for abad brother but made them payable to aref own son and to others he could not remember at trial.see,tr.
the surreptitious manner in which aref helped to operate the hawala was overwhelming evidence that he knew that its operation was not authorized.as possession of a license would indicate authorization,the jury was entitled to find that aref knew the hawala was not licensed.
in sum,viewing the instructions as a whole and the nature of the evidence presented at trial,we are persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in the instructions was harmless because the jury would have reached the same verdicts had it been instructed not to convict these defendants unless it found they knew the business was unlicensed.
sentencing 
each defendant makes several challenges to his sentence.abad contends that the amount of his fine is unreasonable,and he requests a remand to a different district judge for resentencing.aref contends that the calculation of his sentence should not have included consideration of acts committed by abad and should not have included an adjustment for obstruction of justice.in addition,defendants challenge the accuracy of the forfeiture verdict and contend that the forfeiture amount violates the excessive fines clause of the constitution,const.amend.viii and they contend that the prison terms imposed on them are unreasonable and create unwarranted disparities between them and others convicted of similar crimes.considering the sentencing factors listed in a,and reviewing defendants sentences for reasonableness,see united states booker,d both substantive reasonableness and procedural reasonableness,see,united states canova,cir united states fernandez,cir,cert.denied,d united states crosby,cir we conclude that except for abad challenge to his fine and aref challenge to the obstruction adjustment,these challenges lack merit.
the amount of the fine imposed on abad 
in calculating a defendant fine,the sentencing court must follow a procedure similar to the procedure that it is to follow in calculating a defendant term of imprisonment it must consider the guidelines recommendation for the imposition of a fine,consider the a factors,and consider the factors listed in and.see united states rattoballi,cir rattoballi.section requires the court to consider,inter alia,the defendant income,earning capacity,and financial resources.a.the guidelines provide that t he court shall impose a fine in all cases,except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.guidelines a.the defendant must be given at least a minimal opportunity to show that he lacks the ability to pay the fine proposed by the court.see,united states marquez,cir.
a sentence that a district court imposes in reliance on factors incompatible with the commission policy statements may be deemed substantively unreasonable in the absence of persuasive explanation as to why the sentence actually comports with the a factors.rattoballi,at.
i f a district court elects to impose a sentence outside the applicable guidelines range,it has a statutory obligation to include a statement in the written judgment setting forth the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from the recommended guidelines sentence.
id.at quoting c.
the psr on abad calculated that,under guidelines c and,the recommended range of the total fine for the five offenses of which he was convicted was to.the district court instead imposed a fine of million,more than twice the sum prescribed by the advisory guidelines.this was somewhat less than the statutory maximum,given abad conviction under for structuring.see b setting as the maximum fine for each count of conviction for violating a or but see d whoever violates this section while violating another law of the united states or as part of a pattern of any illegal activity involving more than in a period shall be fined twice the amount provided in subsection b of section of title.the court did not state whether its fine of million was a fine or a fine,stating only,i am also going to fine the defendant on each count for a total is it million sic.i impose this sentence because i think it is sufficient for the crime that was committed.abad.the psr had concluded that,given the amount abad would be required to forfeit,he would not be able to pay a fine in any amount.
although abad present challenge to his fine triggers only analysis because he did not contest the amount of the fine in the district court,we conclude that there was plain error in the proceedings in connection with the imposition of the fine,for the record does not indicate that abad was given either notice that a fine of such magnitude was contemplated or an opportunity to be heard on his ability to pay such a fine.we do not see in the government presentencing submission to the district court any request for imposition of an fine.nor has the government called to our attention any indication in the record that abad was given notice by the court that it was considering imposing a fine above the top of the range.we conclude that the imposition of a fine of more than double the maximum recommended by the guidelines,without advance notice to the defendant,without affording him an opportunity to present evidence as to his ability to pay a fine,without any findings as to his ability to pay a fine,and without any acknowledgement by the district court at sentencing of its deviation from the guidelines,constituted a plain error that substantially impacted the fairness,or at least the appearance of fairness,of the sentencing proceeding.see,united states mordini,cir united states gordon,cir,cert.denied,d.accordingly,we vacate so much of abad sentence as imposed a fine of million,and we remand for reconsideration of the amount of the fine.
we deny abad request,however,that we remand to a different district judge.as a general rule,even when a sentencing judge has been shown to have held erroneous views or made incorrect findings resentencing before a different judge is required only in the rare instance in which the judge fairness or the appearance of the judge fairness is seriously in doubt.united states bradley,cir,cert.denied,d.this is not such an instance.
on remand,the district court must give abad an opportunity to present evidence with respect to his ability to pay a fine and make specific findings as to abad ability to pay the fine imposed.if the court decides to impose a fine that is different from the range,it must also provide an explanation as to the specific reason for its decision.
aref challenges to the and components of his guidelines offense level 
i f a defendant objects to a n obstruction of justice sentence enhancement resulting from her trial testimony,a district court must review the evidence and make independent findings necessary to establish a willful impediment to,or obstruction of,justice,or an attempt to do the same united states dunnigan,d.a district court may satisfy this requirement by adopting the recommendation of an obstruction enhancement found in the psr,provided the findings of the psr a re sufficiently detailed and explicit.united states johns,cir,cert.denied,d.
the psr recommended that aref offense level be increased by two steps pursuant to guidelines for obstruction of justice on the basis that his testimony at trial and at the suppression hearing was perjurious.aref objected,arguing that any falsity in his testimony was attributable to his difficulty with english,or to confusion,mistake or faulty memory.aref letter at quoting dunnigan,at.the district court did not address aref objection to this adjustment.it neither made specific findings as required by dunnigan nor expressly adopted the findings made in aref psr.accordingly,we remand for resentencing of aref in order for the district court to consider the adjustment and to make whatever specific findings are warranted.
we see no merit,however,in aref contention that his offense level,enhanced by steps because the amounts transferred during the period of his participation in the conspiracy totaled,see guidelines b i,should have been calculated without reference to any acts committed by abad.given the evidence discussed in part.above as to aref participation in the hawala,this enhancement was proper because,inter alia,aref was convicted of conspiring to operate the unlicensed business and the entire amount transferred during that period was reasonably foreseeable to him,see guidelines a b.
forfeiture 
defendants challenge the forfeiture orders,contending a that the jury,in determining the forfeiture amount,should have excluded checks of third persons not made out to cash,and b that the forfeiture amount is unconstitutionally excessive.we note that the constitutional challenge was not made in the district court and hence triggers analysis.we also note that although aref in his brief on appeal has adopted abad arguments to the extent that they may apply to aref,aref has not made any challenges of his own to the forfeiture amount.we conclude that the challenges made by defendants lack merit and do not require extended discussion.
the contention that checks of third parties should have been excluded is meritless for two reasons.first,the statutes require forfeiture of all property involved in the offenses of which defendants were convicted,c a.there is no question here that the moneys deposited by means of structured transactions in violation of a and transferred in the unlicensed operation in violation of a included the checks of third parties.hence those checks plainly were involved in those offenses and were not excludable.second,even if such checks had been excludable,defendants presented no evidence of the dollar amount represented by those checks and hence gave the jury no basis for returning a verdict in an amount less than that sought by the government.
the constitutional challenge advanced by defendants fares no better.f orfeiture is unconstitutionally excessive if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant offense.united states collado,cir quoting united states bajakajian,d,cert.denied,d.in determining whether a forfeiture is grossly disproportional,we are to evaluate 
a the essence of the crime of the defendants and its relation to other criminal activity,b whether the defendants fit into the class of persons for whom the statute was principally designed,c the maximum sentence and fine that could have been imposed,and d the nature of the harm caused by the defendants conduct.
united states collado,at citing bajakajian internal quotation marks omitted.
although the record is silent as to the fourth factor,the other three reveal that the order for a forfeiture of is not disproportional.the essence of defendants offenses was the unlicensed transmission of money,and neither defendant received the statutory maximum prison term allowed.the trial evidence showed that the total amount deposited into the carnival account was,and the total amount withdrawn was these sums,which were integral to the offenses,are quite close to the amount ordered forfeited.and although abad testified that his service was limited to members of the community and that the money was being sent home to family tr,the evidence showed that defendants in fact transmitted the moneys to different countries.plainly,defendants were persons at whom a was aimed.
the alleged unreasonableness or disparity in prison terms 
finally,we see no merit in the elfgeehs contention that the prison terms imposed on months for aref,months for substantively unreasonable or unwarrantedly high in comparison to the terms of imprisonment meted out to others convicted of similar crimes.while we may remand cases where a defendant credibly argues that the disparity in sentences has no stated or apparent explanation,united states ebbers,cir,cert.denied,d,we see no disparity here.the guidelines ranges are designed to eradicate unwarranted disparities between defendants convicted of similar conduct and with similar criminal backgrounds.except to the extent that a modification of aref offense level may be required with respect to the adjustment discussed in part.above,both sentences were within the applicable guidelines ranges.and except to that extent,we see no basis for concluding that the prison terms imposed are unreasonable,given that the district court articulation of the reasons for the prison terms imposed,although not extensive see part above,was sufficient to show that the court considered the guidelines and the required factors,see generally united states fernandez,at.
conclusion 
we have considered all of defendants contentions on these appeals,and except as indicated above,have found them to be without merit.defendants convictions,and all aspects of their sentences except the following,are affirmed.we vacate the sentence of abad elfgeeh and remand for reconsideration of the amount of his fine we remand with respect to aref elfgeeh for reconsideration of his term of imprisonment in light of the findings to be made as to the adjustment of his guidelines offense level for obstruction of justice.
i concur for the most part in the judgment of the court and the opinion of judge kearse.i respectfully dissent in part,however,because i would vacate the judgment of conviction of aref elfgeeh and remand the case against him to the district court for further proceedings.i do not think that his conviction comports with principles of due process for two reasons,one having to do with extensive and particularly prejudicial publicity part i,below,and the other with the district court instructions to the jury as to the state of aref knowledge needed to permit a conviction part ii,below.that the former requires a good deal more explication than the latter does not mean that i view the latter as is either a less important,or a less persuasive,reason for vacatur of the judgment against aref.
prejudicial trial publicity 
a.the first indictment of abad and his guilty plea 
immediately after the attacks,president bush announced that the united states would make no distinction between those who committed t errorist acts and those who harbor ed t errorists.global relief,new york times,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a few days later,the president stated that the united states would also focus on organizations which served as fronts or as funding mechanisms for terrorist organizations.id.
abad elfgeeh operated an informal,in arabic,a hawala from his ice cream store in park slope,brooklyn.the hawala was used largely by members of brooklyn community to transfer money abroad.on february,a indictment returned by a grand jury sitting in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york charged abad his nephew various violations of federal law in connection with his operation of the hawala.
in count one of the indictment,the grand jury alleged that between january and october,abad had conspired to,inter alia,conduct a business,the hawala,knowing that it was an illegal money transmitting business and that it affected interstate or foreign commerce,in violation of a.in count two,he was charged with,inter alia,conducting the business in violation of that statute and et.in count three,the grand jury charged that between november,when a new version of section a had become effective,and january,abad conspired,inter alia,to conduct an unlicensed business in violation of a.in count four,the grand jury asserted that during the same time period,abad,inter alia,conducted such a business.
more than eight months later,on october,abad entered a plea of guilty to all four counts in the indictment before a magistrate judge.the magistrate judge conducted a hearing pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure b,which requires that b efore entering judgment on a guilty plea,the court must determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.b.the magistrate judge then recommended that the district court accept the plea.
seven months later,on may,however,the district court charles sifton,judge rejected the magistrate judge recommendation.the court observed 
t he proceedings before the magistrate judge make clear that there was no factual basis for a finding that abad elfgeeh had engaged in either of the two conspiracies n obody guilt of any offense other than elfgeeh own was even discussed.so there was no allocution under oath or otherwise by elfgeeh to his participation in an illegal agreement with at least one other individual to commit the crimes with which he is charged in counts one and three.

b.the superseding indictments 
on june,several weeks after abad guilty plea was rejected,the grand jury returned a superseding indictment.it charged not only abad,but also his nephew,aref,in connection with the operation of the hawala.
this first superseding indictment noted by way of introduction that before november,an illegal money transmitting business,as defined in a,was a money transmitting business intentionally operated without an appropriate money transmitting license in a state in which doing so was a crime.indictment dated june,at,united states elfgeeh,no.cr,june,emphases added.beginning on november,however,congress substituted for the phrase illegal money transmitting business in the statute the phrase unlicensed money transmitting business,which included any money transmitting business operated without an appropriate money transmitting license if criminal penalties were assessed by the state for the lack of such a license.id.at emphasis added.thus,in the new,version of the statute,the requirement that the defendant intentionally operate the business without a state license was omitted.see usa patriot act of,stat,amending a.
in count one of the first superseding indictment,the grand jury then alleged that between january and october,abad had conspired,inter alia,to conduct a business knowing that the business was an illegal money transmitting business in violation of a.id.at.in count two,the grand jury charged that,during the same time period,abad,inter alia,conducted such a business in violation of that statute and et.id.at.in count three,the grand jury charged that between november and january,abad and his nephew aref conspired to,inter alia,conduct an unlicensed money transmitting business in violation of a.id.at.in count four,the grand jury asserted that during the same time period,inter alia,abad and aref conducted such a business.id.at.thus,in both the original indictment and the first superseding indictment,abad was charged with violation of both the and versions of the statute.in the first superseding indictment,aref was also charged,but with violation of the version of the statute only.he was thus not accused of intentionally operating the business without a state license.
on september,the grand jury returned a second superseding indictment.see indictment dated september,united states elfgeeh,no.cr.the indictment added a new count five charging only abad with structuring,breaking amounts of currency in excess of into smaller amounts and depositing the smaller amounts into an account with a financial for the purpose of evading federal reporting requirements,id.at violation of a.
unlike his guilty plea to the first indictment,abad elfgeeh pleaded not guilty to both superseding indictments.so did his nephew aref.
background prosecution of terrorists and those providing funding to them 
prominently connected with the prosecution of abad elfgeeh was the investigation and prosecution of mohammed as osama bin laden sheik and his alleged,mohammed zayed.the two were convicted on march,after a jury trial before sterling same district judge who presided over the elfgeehs conspiring and attempting to provide material support to hamas and conspiring to support the prosecution and the events surrounding it including a key witness apparent attempt to immolate himself in front of the white house were widely reported by and discussed in the media 
abad elfgeeh apparently had connections to,and the government plainly harbored suspicions that his hawala had been used to funnel money abroad in support of activity.but the government never purported to be able to prove any such link.no such charge was contained in the indictment.aref elfgeeh was accused only of the crime of operating and conspiring to operate an unlicensed business.
as the majority points out,the district court recognized that in light of the circumstances under which the elfgeehs trial was conducted,it had a fundamental responsibility to keep issues of terrorism out of the trial.it sought to ensure that the jury would consider the charges that were actually made against the elfgeehs,essentially financial in nature,and not the incendiary and uncharged accusation of their involvement in,facilitation of,or support for,islamic terrorism.
d.the trial publicity 
on september,the city and country marked the fourth anniversary of the attacks.the commemoration was,of course,front page news in new york the following day.see,michael wilson,marking while mourning a fresher loss,times,at.the elfgeeh jurors were sworn the same day,september,in the eastern district courthouse,some two miles from ground zero.opening arguments were held the next day,tuesday.
as the majority opinion explains in some detail,the elfgeeh trial itself received substantial press coverage.the publicity culminated on the third day of trial,september,see ante at,in the principal new york tabloids newsday the new york post,and the new york daily news the stories that day strongly suggested a link between the prosecution of the elfgeehs and other terrorism prosecutions.worse,they specifically questioned the district court ruling that the elfgeehs prosecution was not a terrorism prosecution,and the trial judge insistence that the issue of terrorism be avoided.the post,for example,asked 
was abad elfgeeh,upstanding american citizen,financing terror through ice cream you may never know because federal jurors may never hear the t word spoken aloud 
the articles were indisputably,intentionally inflammatory.and as the majority observes,there can be little doubt that in the wake of september,evidence linking a defendant to terrorism in a trial in which he is not charged with terrorism is likely to cause undue prejudice.ante at.
the articles plainly had the potential for unfair prejudice.each referred to the elfgeehs trial and made pointed references to,inter alia,terrorism al qaeda in addition they described evidence that the jury would not be allowed to see or hear at trial and two of the articles stated that abad had previously pleaded guilty to the charges on which he was now being tried.
id.at.the articles threatened to nullify the district court requirement that no one suggest to the jury that the prosecution was.
circuit law on prejudicial trial publicity 
the difficulty of the challenge to courts in ensuring that a criminal defendant enjoys due process even while the press is free to report on the defendant trial and the public is thus able to learn about it as it unfolds,has long been understood.see,hans linde,fair trials and press freedom two rights against the state,willamette.the supreme court has for many years recognized that in some cases trial publicity can so pollute criminal proceedings and thereby abridge the ability of the defendant to receive a fair trial that only remand and retrial can remediate the damage.see,estes texas,d holding that televising the trial,over defendant objection,violated due process rideau louisiana,d holding that television broadcast of the defendant confession violated due process.in sheppard maxwell,d,the court addressed,among other things,prejudicial publicity in the course of a criminal trial.
due process requires that the accused receive a trial by an impartial jury free from outside influences.given the pervasiveness of modern communications and the difficulty of effacing prejudicial publicity from the minds of the jurors,the trial courts must take strong measures to ensure that the balance is never weighed against the accused.and appellate tribunals have the duty to make an independent evaluation of the circumstances if publicity during the proceedings threatens the fairness of the trial,a new trial should be ordered.but we must remember that reversals are but palliatives the cure lies in those remedial measures that will prevent the prejudice at its inception.
id.at.see also.press ass stuart,d noting that judges have a duty to protect defendants from prejudicial publicity quoting sheppard,at.
pervasive trial coverage,of concern to the stuart and sheppard courts,is hardly unknown in this circuit.it is not an uncommon occurrence for a notorious trial held in metropolitan new york to engender extensive publicity.united states gaggi,cir,cert.denied,d.for that reason,more than years year following the supreme court decision in nebraska press established the appropriate procedures to be taken by a district court in the face of prejudicial trial publicity like that which occurred in the elfgeehs case 
the guidelines to be followed by a district court confronted with the problem of publication or broadcast of information concerning an ongoing criminal trial have been indicated by us.first the court must decide whether the publicity contains potentially prejudicial information,and whether the members of the jury might have been exposed to it.if the broadcast or article contains no information beyond the evidence in the case,or if the information is clearly innocuous or the possibility of the jury exposure to it is remote,further inquiry may not be necessary.if,however,the court determines that the article or broadcast has a potential for unfair prejudice,then an initial inquiry of the jury is necessary to ascertain whether any of its members have been exposed to the information.any juror who responds that he or she has been so exposed should be examined individually,out of the presence of the other jurors,to determine the extent of the exposure and its effect on the juror attitude toward the trial.this precautionary procedure should permit the court to determine what further steps,if any,are required to insure that the trial proceeds fairly.
united states lord,cir emphasis added citations and footnote omitted reversing a conviction because of,inter alia,the district court failure to take correct protective measures in the face of prejudicial publicity during a jury trial.
as we restated the rule ten years later 
the simple process is,first,to determine whether the coverage has a potential for unfair prejudice,second,to canvass the jury to find out if they have learned of the potentially prejudicial publicity and,third,to examine individually exposed the presence of the other ascertain how much they know of the distracting publicity and what effect,if any,it has had on that juror ability to decide the case fairly.ultimately,the trial judge must examine the special facts of each case to determine whether the jurors remained impartial.absent a clear abuse of the trial court discretion,its finding that the jury was impartial should be upheld.
gaggi,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
aref motion to poll the jurors 
the majority opinion describes in detail the district court attempt to neutralize the prejudicial publicity in the elfgeehs case.see ante at.to summarize on the morning of the day of the appearance of the articles in,september principal assistant united states attorney prosecuting the case called the court attention to the articles in question,asking the court to admonish the jury to avoid press accounts of the trial.the court did so.
the same afternoon,aref counsel addressed the articles and their potential impact at some length.he moved for a mistrial or,in the alternative,for the court to interview the jurors to see whether they had read the articles,and also to admonish them.abad counsel worried aloud,however,sometimes when you have a situation like this,you make it worse by polling the jurors.the court agreed,leaning toward an admonishment only.aref counsel nonetheless asked that the court ask the jury as a group whether anyone had read one of the articles.the district judge,noting that he had not seen the articles himself,said,there might be some who have not read it,you call their attention to it,and,after more colloquy,concluded,i think what i should do at the end of the day,when we get ready to go home,to mention it again as opposed to right after lunch.to this,aref counsel responded again,i have made my request.my request is on the record.as the majority recognizes,aref counsel,by requesting that the jurors be polled individually,and then asking that they be polled as a group,eventually made a proper request.ante at.at the end of the trial day,the court instructed the jury to avoid media reports,and that the case would be determined solely on the evidence presented at trial.
the trial continued five days later,on monday,september.abad lawyer raised the publicity issue again then,but it was in the form of a motion in limine about issues as to which abad would not have to testify.the motion was denied.the district court then reviewed one of the offending articles,apparently for the first time.the court repeated its september admonishment to the jury.
g.the insufficiency of the district court admonishment 
the majority states if the court gave a standard admonition not to read or watch anything about the trial,we may presume,in the absence of any indication to the contrary,that the jurors have followed the court instructions and have rendered their verdict solely on the basis of the evidence at trial.ante at.in gaggi,however,we opined,on just that point,that a district court should not rely solely on repetitive admonitions when widespread publicity created a strong possibility that some jurors might have been exposed to prejudicial publicity.gaggi,at citing lord,at.and in lord,we found it an abuse of discretion for the district court to rely solely on such an admonition.where articles about the trial appeared on the front page of the second section of the primary city newspaper,lord,at,we said 
the widespread availability of the newspapers as well as the prominent position occupied by the articles,created a strong possibility tha
