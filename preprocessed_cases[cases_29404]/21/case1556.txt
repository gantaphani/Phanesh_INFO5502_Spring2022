defendant oleg verkhoglyad appeals from that part of a judgment of conviction entered on august,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york nina gershon,judge,as sentenced him to a term of imprisonment for violating federal probation by illegally possessing controlled substances.presently incarcerated on this judgment,verkhoglyad contends that his sentence is both procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed a to consider the sentencing commission policy statements on probation revocation as well as other sentencing factors identified in a,and b to state its reasons for imposing a sentence and substantively unreasonable because it is disproportionate to the seriousness of his probation violation.
because we conclude that verkhoglyad sentencing challenges are essentially without merit,we affirm the judgment.we remand only to allow the district court to amend the judgment of conviction in order to memorialize therein its orally stated reasons for imposing the challenged sentence,as required by c.
factual background 
to facilitate our discussion of the reasonableness of verkhoglyad sentence,we detail defendant history of persistent recidivism despite the repeated leniency accorded him by the district court in return for his substantial assistance to law enforcement authorities 
a.the conviction 
in march,verkhoglyad was arrested by federal authorities for myriad crimes committed as a member of a violent russian organized crime group,the brigade.in june of that year,verkhoglyad entered into a cooperation agreement with the government that allowed him to resolve his criminal case by pleading guilty to violence in aid of racketeering,see a,extortion conspiracy,see id,and bank fraud conspiracy,see id.based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of i,verkhoglyad faced a sentencing guidelines range of to months in prison.prior to sentencing,prosecutors moved for verkhoglyad to receive a downward departure from this guidelines range based on his substantial assistance to federal authorities in their pursuit of russian organized crime members.see.the district court granted the motion and,on march,sentenced verkhoglyad principally to months incarceration followed by three years supervised release.in doing so,the district judge observed that verkhoglyad had not only received consideration he had earlier secured an enormous benefit by being allowed to plead guilty to reduced charges.sentencing tr.at.the judge cautioned verkhoglyad that if,upon release from custody,he were to violate his supervised release,she would not hesitate to put him in jail again.it as simple as that.id.at.
b.the violation of supervised release and conviction 
because verkhoglyad had been in custody since his arrest,he completed serving his sentence in november.only six months later,on may,verkhoglyad was arrested by new york city police officers and charged with criminal possession of a weapon,specifically a switchblade knife.that knife possession hardly represented the full scope of verkhoglyad criminal activities in the few months since his release from prison.as verkhoglyad disclosed to federal officials in securing yet another cooperation agreement,he had also illegally possessed a caliber handgun,participated in a staged accident ring in brooklyn,used false identification documents,and ingested illegal drugs.on november,verkhoglyad pleaded guilty to a information charging him with illegal possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,see g,and violation of supervised release by illegal possession of a switchblade knife.verkhoglyad was then released on his own recognizance to facilitate his cooperation,and sentencing was adjourned sine die.
it was not until three and a half years later,on april,that verkhoglyad was sentenced with an offense level of and a criminal history category of iii on the count,he faced a sentencing guidelines range of to months.meanwhile,because verkhoglyad possession of a switchblade knife qualified as a grade c probation violation under the guidelines,he also faced a to month prison term under applicable sentencing commission policy statements.see a.once again,the government moved for verkhoglyad to receive consideration.the district court granted the motion and sentenced verkhoglyad to four years probation on the charge and a concurrent term of supervision for the violation of supervised release.the court explained that the leniency of this sentence was based on defendant extremely valuable cooperation,provided in circumstances that posed a serious danger to him.sentencing tr.at.at the same time,however,the district court warned verkhoglyad that no offer of future cooperation would help him if he were to violate the conditions of his probation and supervised release.to the contrary,the court stated that a violation would place verkhoglyad before the court in the same position he was in that day,that is,facing a possible statutory maximum term of incarceration for his crime 
i just want you to understand that you not going to be able to avoid a prison term if you violate supervised release or probation now.if you violate,i can sentence you as i could have sentenced you today,which is to t he maximum term of imprisonment of ten years.if you jump a turnstile on the subway,you be back here.if you carry a knife or a little bit of drugs you be back here.and i want you to understand that i will not hesitate.i do care how good you being or how well you are working in your job or how well you are relating with your family because i giving you a big break today.
sentencing tr.at,see a.
c.the probation violation 
on april,one week after receiving the big break of sentences,verkhoglyad tested positive for marijuana use.a second test performed on may,detected an even higher level of marijuana as well as cocaine.probation officials further discovered that,in the time between these tests,verkhoglyad had traveled to virginia without authorization.based on these facts,verkhoglyad was charged with two probation violations illegal possession of controlled substances,and unauthorized travel outside the supervising district.verkhoglyad disposed of these charges by pleading guilty to the first on july.as a consequence,revocation of probation and resentencing on the underlying crime were mandated by b.
in a violation report prepared for the district court,the probation department advised that verkhoglyad drug possession constituted a grade c violation of probation,which,with a criminal history category of iii,resulted in a to sentencing range under policy statement a.based on defendant history of recidivism and the fact that he had committed two probation violations within two weeks of sentencing,the probation department recommended imposition of a custodial sentence above this range,specifically noting the district court statutory authority to defendant in accordance with the penalties applicable to his original crime of conviction.see a.
prior to imposing sentence on july,the district court heard from the prosecutor and probation officer,who urged incarceration as well as from defense counsel,who requested leniency in light of a series of stresses in verkhoglyad life that purportedly contributed to his violation and from defendant,who indicated a need for drug treatment.sentencing tr.at,july.
following this colloquy,the district judge concluded that verkhoglyad should receive a sentence within the guidelines range for the underlying crime of conviction.judge gershon explained 
i gave an enormous benefit to the defendant on the case,based on his cooperation and his representations,and those of his attorney,that he had been rehabilitated and he had been transformed.
i also gave him an enormous benefit on the supervised release violation,in which i could have also imposed custody which could have been consecutive to the time that i could have imposed on the case.
i should also point out that on the convictions for racketeering,extortion conspiracy,and bank fraud conspiracy,i sentenced him to months initially,when the guideline range at that point was to months,and i gave him the benefit based on his cooperation.
at this point i think everyone,including the defendant,recognizes it is impossible to simply return this defendant to any kind of community supervision.he is not amenable to it,at least not yet.in order to determine the sentence,i am going back to the original guideline range on the case,the case,which was to months on that case.of course the guideline range is now advisory and not mandatory however,i think it does give rise to an appropriate sentencing range for this violation.
id.at.the district court then sentenced verkhoglyad to months incarceration,observing 
this defendant has,i believe,misled the court about his intentions and his rehabilitation,and i think at this point there is reason for him to be punished for what he has done,deterred from doing it again,and also have available to him a drug treatment program that he can not avoid by simply not attending.
this timely appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
our review of challenged sentences is limited to reasonableness,united states booker,d,a concept that applies both to the sentence itself and to the procedures employed in arriving at the sentence,united states fernandez,cir see united states crosby,cir.the procedural inquiry focuses primarily on the sentencing court compliance with its statutory obligation to consider the factors detailed in a,united states canova,cir see united states rattoballi,cir,while the substantive inquiry assesses the length of the sentence imposed in light of the a factors,united states villafuerte,cir.in both respects,our standard of review is abuse of discretion.see gall united states,d noting rule that the standard of review applies to appellate review of all sentencing inside or outside the guidelines range see also rita united states,d united states fernandez,at.applying these principles to this case,we identify no unreasonableness in verkhoglyad sentence,although we do note a failure to comply with the ministerial requirement of written memorialization set forth in c.
procedural sentencing challenges 
verkhoglyad contends that his term of imprisonment is procedurally unreasonable in two respects the district court failed to consider the term of incarceration identified in the sentencing commission policy statement on probation revocation,as well as other sentencing factors outlined in a and the district court failed to state its reasons for imposing a sentence higher than that prescribed by the policy statement,as required by c.because verkhoglyad did not raise these procedural objections to the district court at the time of sentencing,we review his claims for plain error.see united states villafuerte,at holding that plain error review applies to procedural sentencing challenges not raised in district court.verkhoglyad submits that he is entitled to a less rigorous standard of review because the government has failed to argue that his claims are unpreserved.we need not here decide the effect of any government waiver because verkhoglyad can not demonstrate procedural unreasonableness under any standard of review.
consideration of a factors 
section a b 
verkhoglyad notes that,at the time it imposed the challenged sentence,the district court made no mention of the range of imprisonment provided in the guidelines policy statement on violations of probation and supervised release.he urges us to conclude from this fact that the district court necessarily failed to satisfy its obligations under a b,which requires the sentencing court to consider the applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.we are not persuaded.
the policy statements applicable to probation violations 
before discussing verkhoglyad specific argument,we review how chapter of the guidelines fits into the legal framework for evaluating probation violations.by statute,every probationary sentence is conditional and subject to revocation until its expiration or termination.e.because verkhoglyad possessed a controlled substance in violation of a condition of probation,the district court was required to revoke the sentence of probation and resentence him to any term that could have been imposed on the underlying crime of conviction in accordance with,the statutory provisions generally applicable to criminal sentencing.id.b see also united states goffi,cir.under b,an individual found guilty of an offense shall be sentenced in accordance with the provisions of section.section a,in turn,requires a district court to consider a number of relevant sentencing factors,including the applicable guidelines or policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.a b.
in formulating sentencing ranges for violations of probation and supervised release,the sentencing commission specifically limited itself to policy statements rather than formal guidelines.see ch,pt.a,intro.comment.even prior to booker,it was understood that such policy statements were only advisory.see united states goffi,at united states lewis,cir.the commission decision to proceed in this manner was informed,in no small part,by a lack of empirical data and national experience with both violations of supervised release,then a new form of supervision created by the sentencing reform act,ch,pt.a,intro.comment.b and violations of probation,which had been transformed from a suspension of an identified sentence to a sentence in itself,the revocation of which would trigger a resentence on the underlying crime of conviction,id.ch,pt.a,intro.comment.a see also.such data and experience are,of course,the foundation for most of the commission detailed sentencing guidelines.see ch,pt.a,intro.comment.see also gall united states.at noting that guidelines are generally the product of careful study based on extensive empirical evidence derived from the review of thousands of individual sentencing decisions.in the absence of such data,the commission opted to identify only policy statement sentencing ranges for supervised release and probation revocations,thereby affording greater flexibility for evaluation by the courts and the commission.ch,pt.a,intro.comment.a.such policy statements were intended to be the first step in an evolutionary process leading to formal guidelines,id.ch,pt.a,intro.comment,although to date,no such guidelines have been promulgated 
consideration of the probation violation policy statements in this case 
verkhoglyad claim that the district court failed to satisfy its obligations under a b is unconvincing for several reasons.
first,the law in this circuit is well established that,in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise,we presume that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors.united states fernandez,at.while our review is undoubtedly made easier if a district judge explicitly references the a factors,we have declined to prescribe any specific verbal formulations to demonstrate the adequate discharge of the duty to consider matters relevant to sentencing.united states fleming,cir united states crosby,at.thus,we will not assume,simply from the fact that the district court did not reference the to sentencing range provided in a,that it failed to satisfy its a b obligation.see united states fernandez,at accord united states villafuerte,at.
second,nothing in the record of this case warrants a different conclusion.to the contrary,the fact that verkhoglyad probation violation report specifically informed the district court of the sentencing range provided in a only supports the presumption that the able district judge considered this range as required by a b.as the violation report itself observed,a number of factors weighed strongly in favor of a higher sentence than that provided in a.indeed,the imposition of a higher sentence was supported by commentary to this very policy statement.application note to expressly recognizes that where a defendant original sentence of probation was the result of a downward departure,as a reward for substantial assistance,a violation may well warrant an upward departure from the policy statement range.
the district court appears to have had this application note in mind when it explained its decision to go back to the original guideline range on the felon in possession case,the case,which was to months in imposing a sentence for the probation violation.sentencing tr.at,july,as the court observed,verkhoglyad had been given significant sentencing consideration for his cooperation on more than one occasion a a term of probation on his conviction,when his guidelines range provided for to months incarceration b a sentence for his violation of supervised release,when consecutive prison time was authorized and c a prison term on his fraud conviction,when his guidelines range provided for to months incarceration.because verkhoglyad had repeatedly betrayed the trust reflected in these lenient sentences,the court reasonably concluded that a sentence in excess of the policy statement range was warranted on his violation of probation.see united states sindima,cir noting that sentencing commission policy statements emphasize breach of trust rather than egregiousness of violation conduct as critical factor in imposing sentence for violation of probation or supervised release quoting ch,pt.a,intro.comment.b explaining why commission chose to focus on breach of trust evidenced by defendant violation conduct.
because the district court sentencing conclusion is well supported not only by the facts,but also by the commission policy statements,see,application note id.ch,pt.a,intro.comment.a recognizing district court statutory authority to impose any sentence that initially could have been imposed on the underlying federal offense for which probation was being served citing,we reject as without merit defendant argument that the district court failed to satisfy its consideration obligation under a b.see united states fernandez,at 
b.the remaining a factors 
verkhoglyad asserts that the district court failed to give adequate consideration to other sentencing factors set forth in a,including the seriousness of his probation violation,his personal history and characteristics,and the disparity between his sentence and other probation violation sentences.the argument merits little discussion.
at the outset,we reiterate that the law does not impose any rigorous requirement of specific articulation on sentencing judges with respect to their consideration of a factors.united states crosby,at.no robotic incantations are required to prove the fact of consideration,and we will not assume a failure of consideration simply because a district court fails to enumerate or discuss each a factor individually.united states fernandez,at internal quotation marks omitted.further,the requirement to consider a factors is not synonymous with any requirement that a particular factor be given determinative or dispositive weight in the identification of the appropriate sentence.id.at emphasis in original.rather,the weight to be afforded any a factor is a matter firmly committed to the discretion of the sentencing judge and is beyond our review,as long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable.id.
in the course of sentencing verkhoglyad three times between and,the district court reviewed two presentence reports,two violation reports,and two motions.on multiple occasions,it heard from the prosecutor,probation officers,defense counsel,and the defendant himself.we have no doubt that the district court thus possessed ample information to assess the seriousness of verkhoglyad probation violation and the underlying crime of conviction on which he was to be resentenced,his history of crime and cooperation,and his personal characteristics.nothing in the record indicates that it overlooked any of these factors.rather,it appears not to have viewed them favorably to defendant.
for example,verkhoglyad suggests that his drug possession is not a particularly severe violation of probation.we need not address this dubious characterization of criminal conduct.as the district court correctly recognized,the severity of verkhoglyad violation was not to be determined by looking at the drug conduct in isolation.rather,the district court had to consider the conduct in context to determine the extent to which it reflected a betrayal of the court trust in imposing a sentence for the underlying conviction.see united states sindima,at.
as the record plainly shows,the betrayal in this case was flagrant.verkhoglyad did not simply use drugs while on probation he used drugs within days of being placed on probation and being warned by the district court that any violation would result in a severe term of incarceration,possibly up to the statutory maximum provided for his crime.in light of these circumstances,the district court reasonably concluded that the violation represented such a prompt and complete contempt for both the court trust and the law as to outweigh whatever cooperation benefits had initially prompted its imposition of a probationary sentence.indeed,that conclusion was reinforced by the district court chronicle of how defendant had persistently betrayed the court trust through repeated criminal conduct in the face of lenient sentences.
to the extent verkhoglyad faults the district court for failing to consider the disparity between his sentence and those imposed in other probation violation cases,nothing in the record warrants a departure from the presumption of consideration recognized in united states fernandez,at.insofar as verkhoglyad claims that the discrepancy between his sentence and the to policy statement range is simply too large to be reasonable,such an argument goes to substantive rather than procedural unreasonableness and will be addressed infra at.
in sum,on the record before us,we identify no merit in verkhoglyad claim that the district court failed to consider a factors in imposing the challenged sentence.
compliance with c requirement for statement of sentencing reasons 
verkhoglyad contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to articulate its reasons for imposing a sentence higher than that prescribed by the relevant policy statements,as required by c.pursuant to c,a district court,at the time of sentencing,must state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.in addition,if the sentence imposed is outside the applicable range prescribed by the commission guidelines or policy statements,the sentencing court must state the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from that prescribed by the commission and memorialize that reason in the written order of judgment and commitment.c see united states hall,cir united states jones,cir united states goffi,at.these requirements,which survive booker,serve the important goals of 
informing the defendant of the reasons for his sentence,permitting meaningful appellate review,enabling the public to learn why the defendant received a particular sentence,and guiding probation officers and prison officials in developing a program to meet the defendant needs.
united states villafuerte,at.
in considering the district court compliance with c in this case,we reiterate our holding in united states lewis that a court statement of its reasons for going beyond policy statements in imposing a sentence after revoking a defendant probationary term need not be as specific as has been required when courts departed from guidelines that were,before booker,considered to be mandatory.at emphasis in original.in fact,however,the district court was quite specific in explaining the reasons for its sentence.
it emphasized on the record the enormous sentencing breaks that it had repeatedly afforded verkhoglyad.sentencing tr.at,july.in particular,the court noted two prior occasions when it had imposed sentences substantially below the ranges prescribed by the guidelines based on his cooperation with the government and his representations,and those of his attorney,that he had been rehabilitated and he had been transformed.id.the court found that defendant had,in fact,misled the court about his intentions and his rehabilitation,and repeatedly violated the law.id.at.as a consequence,it decided that it had erred in affording verkhoglyad leniency on his underlying crime of conviction.it resentenced him by reference to the guidelines originally applicable to his offense.see a b.the court explained that such a term of incarceration was intended to meet three sentencing objectives punishment for the underlying crime,deterrence of future criminal conduct,and a measure of meaningful drug treatment.see sentencing tr.at,july,explaining i think at this point there is reason for him to be punished for what he has done,deterred from doing it again,and also have available to him a drug treatment program that he can not avoid by simply not attending.id.this oral explanation for verkhoglyad sentence was more than sufficient to inform the defendant and public of the reasons for the particular sentence and to permit our review for reasonableness.united states jones,at see united states sindima,at united states fleming,at.thus,we conclude that the district court satisfied the statutory requirement to provide the specific reason for the imposition of a sentence different from that prescribed by the applicable policy statements.c.
it appears,however,that the district court did not memorialize its stated sentencing reasons in the written order of judgment and commitment as further required by c.see united states rattoballi,at.while such an omission in the face of sufficient oral reasons will rarely rise to the level of plain error we have recognized it to be the better course in such circumstances to remand so that noncompliance with subsection c may be remedied.united states jones,at quoting united states goffi,at.as we observed in united states hall,
while a remand to the district court solely for the purpose of complying with section c will not result in any change in the conviction or sentence a written statement of reasons is beneficial because the bureau of prisons consults the written judgment of conviction,which may contain information relevant to a defendant service of sentence.
accordingly,although we do not identify any procedural error warranting resentencing in this case,we remand solely to permit the district court to amend its written judgment to satisfy the ministerial duty to memorialize its stated reasons for sentencing as required by c 
substantive sentencing challenge 
verkhoglyad acknowledges that his possession of controlled substances mandated revocation of his probation and resentence on his crime of conviction.nevertheless,he challenges his term of imprisonment on the ground that the length of his sentence was so disproportionate to the violation that it is unreasonable.appellant br.at.preliminarily,we observe that verkhoglyad did not raise this substantive challenge to the district court.although united states villafuerte holds that rigorous plain error analysis applies to unpreserved procedural challenges to a sentence,see at,this court has not determined whether the same conclusion applies to unpreserved substantive challenges to a sentence.we need not decide that question on this appeal because,whether we review verkhoglyad substantive challenge for plain error or for error alone,united states goffi,at internal quotation marks omitted,his argument fails on its merits.
as we have repeatedly observed in considering sentencing challenges,reasonableness is inherently a concept of flexible meaning,generally lacking precise boundaries.united states crosby,at see united states jones,at united states fairclough,cir.our review of sentences for reasonableness thus exhibit s restraint,not micromanagement.united states fleming,at.although the brevity or length of a sentence can exceed the bounds of reasonableness,we anticipate encountering such circumstances infrequently.id.this is not one of those rare cases.
in urging us to hold otherwise,verkhoglyad complains that his sentence is more than five times the of the applicable policy statement range.by itself,this is insufficient to demonstrate substantive unreasonableness.the supreme court has expressly rejected the use of mathematical formulas to gauge substantive unreasonableness.see gall united states.at.in so holding,the court noted that percentages can be particularly deceiving where,as in this case,the sentencing range at issue is measured in months.see id.noting that deviations always appear extreme when guidelines ranges are small.gall holding validates our own earlier conclusion that numerical rules are too simplistic to effectuate the sentencing purposes of a.united states rattoballi,at see united states fernandez,at w e have expressed a commitment to avoid the formulation of per se rules to govern our review of sentences for reasonableness.
nor can verkhoglyad demonstrate substantive unreasonableness by noting that his sentence far exceeds the sentence upheld in united states fleming for a defendant who also repeatedly violated supervision and abused drugs.see at.the cases are not analogous.fleming violated supervised release,not probation.this means he had served a term of incarceration on his underlying crime of conviction.thus,the relevant statute,e,did not provide for the district court to resentence fleming on his underlying crime of conviction.moreover,it expressly limited the prison sentence that could be imposed for his class d supervision violation to two years.see id.by contrast,verkhoglyad probationary sentence allowed him to avoid serving any prison time on his conviction,provided he adhered to certain conditions.when he breached one of those conditions by unlawfully possessing controlled substances,b required the district court to revoke the conditional sentence of probation and to resentence verkhoglyad to prison on the underlying crime of conviction,authorizing any term up to that crime maximum.
the district court did not impose a sentence.rather,it sentenced verkhoglyad to months imprisonment,the high end of the guidelines range applicable to his conviction.as we noted earlier,see supra,a district court is not restricted to the guidelines sentencing range applicable to a defendant underlying federal offense when sentencing a defendant for a violation of probation.at.nevertheless,on revocation of probation,a resentence that falls within the range for the underlying crime of conviction will rarely qualify as too severe to be substantively reasonable.to hold otherwise would be to suggest that a defendant is in a better position to argue the substantive unreasonableness of a guidelines sentence for a particular crime of conviction after violating probation than he is before breaching the court trust.rita united states.at observing that where sentencing court and commission both determine that guidelines sentence is warranted in case,sentence is unlikely to be held unreasonable.thus,in this case,in which verkhoglyad was spared incarceration because of his cooperation and promptly showed himself unworthy of that consideration by engaging in further criminal conduct,we reject the argument that a resentence on the underlying crime of conviction within the guidelines range for that crime is substantively unreasonable.
finally,our decision in united states sindima,does not support verkhoglyad claim that it was substantively unreasonable for the district court to impose a sentence significantly higher than the chapter guidelines range.in sindima,our primary concern was that the challenged sentence punished the defendant for the egregious nature of his violation conduct instead of sanctioning primarily the defendant breach of trust as provided by commission policy.id.at internal quotation marks omitted quoting ch,pt.a,intro.comment.b.for reasons already discussed,see supra at,no such concern arises in this case.the district court made clear that verkhoglyad possession of drugs in violation of his probation was relevant only insofar as it demonstrated that defendant had completely misled the court only days earlier about his willingness to conform his conduct to law as the court had demanded when it granted him the benefit of a sentence.to the extent sindima emphasized the commission policy to sanction primarily the defendant breach of trust,at,it did could the fact that revocation of probation requires a defendant to be resentenced on the crime of convic
