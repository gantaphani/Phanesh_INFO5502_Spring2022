on february,the district court,at a consolidated hearing,sentenced defendant leonel david maldonado escarfullery to months imprisonment pursuant to the defendant guilty pleas on firearms charges in three cases.maldonado escarfullery now challenges that sentence.we affirm.
because this sentencing appeal follows a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.united states madera ortiz,cir.
there were three criminal firearms schemes,resulting in three prosecutions.in december and january and march,maldonado escarfullery offered to ship firearms from florida to an associate in puerto rico for sale at a profit.maldonado escarfullery,who was an employee of fedex at the time,would purchase the firearms in florida and ship them to puerto rico by fedex.on march,fedex personnel in puerto rico discovered three packages containing firearms and contacted the local office of the bureau of alcohol,tobacco,and firearms atf.atf agents then conducted a controlled delivery of the firearms to maldonado escarfullery associate,who confessed and implicated the defendant.based on these activities,on march,a federal grand jury returned a indictment charging maldonado escarfullery with,inter alia,shipment of firearms in interstate commerce to someone other than a licensed dealer,importer,manufacturer or collector,in violation of e case.
in the second scheme,from august through march,maldonado escarfullery participated in a separate plan to ship firearms to another associate in puerto rico.before march,maldonado escarfullery had delivered approximately five packages containing firearms to this associate during march,he delivered two more packages containing a total of fourteen firearms.on august,a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging maldonado escarfullery with,inter alia,conspiracy to deal firearms in interstate commerce,in violation of and a a case.
maldonado escarfullery was arrested in florida by atf agents on april.he agreed to cooperate with the government,including by testifying against his before a grand jury,and he was released on a bond.on august,at a change of plea hearing,maldonado escarfullery pled guilty to one count in case and one count in case.
significantly,while he was free on bond,had signed a cooperation agreement,and was awaiting sentencing,maldonado escarfullery broke the law again.he shipped firearms from florida to puerto rico.he was arrested in florida in october,and his probation officer advised the court of the arrest on october.maldonado escarfullery was transferred from florida to puerto rico to appear at a show cause hearing on november,where his bail was revoked.on november,maldonado escarfullery pled guilty to one count of dealing firearms in violation of a a case.
on february,the district court in puerto rico held a consolidated sentencing hearing in the three cases.under the plea agreements,the government recommended sentences of months and one day for case months for case,to run concurrently with the sentence for case and months for case,with no recommendation as to whether that sentence should run concurrently with the others.maldonado escarfully maintained that all three sentences should run concurrently.this argument would have meant a maximum term of imprisonment of months.
the court calculated the sentencing guidelines range by grouping the counts of conviction together,since they involved two or more acts connected by a common criminal objective or scheme.b.the court determined that the base offense level was,id.a,then added a increase for an offense involving to firearms,id.b c a increase for trafficking in firearms,id.b,and a increase for reason to believe that the firearms would be used in connection with another felony,id.b.the court then subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility.id.a b.with an offense level of and a criminal history category of i,maldonado escarfullery guidelines range was to months of imprisonment.the combined statutory maximums were,of course,longer.
after considering the guidelines range,the recommendations in the plea agreements,and the arguments of counsel,the court sentenced maldonado escarfullery to months and one day for case months for case less than the government recommended,to be served concurrently and months for case,to be served consecutively,for a total term of imprisonment of months.maldonado escarfullery objected to the consecutive sentence.he timely appealed his sentence on february.
maldonado escarfullery now argues that the district court sentence was an abuse of discretion,saying the court failed to comply with b,which requires a court to consider the statutory sentencing factors under a when deciding whether multiple sentences of imprisonment will be served concurrently or consecutively.we evaluate maldonado escarfullery claim under an abuse of discretion standard.united states carrasco de jesús,cir citing gall united states,d.review of a sentence under this standard generally involves a process first,we determine whether the district court committed procedural error.second,if there was no procedural error,we determine whether the sentence was substantively reasonable.gall,at.taking defendant to allege on appeal both types of error,the claim fails 
the record shows that the district court did consider the statutory sentencing factors when it imposed a consecutive sentence for case.the court referred to section a throughout the sentencing hearing,though not always by name.for instance,when announcing its sentence,the court stated that the defendant request of months concurrent was not sufficient under the sufficient but not greater than necessary standard that is,the standard laid out in section a.the court also repeatedly emphasized the need for a consecutive sentence in case in light of maldonado escarfullery breach of the court trust by committing another firearms offense while free on bond.that is a sentencing factor consideration.see a a directing court to consider the need to promote respect for the law.
the court also carefully considered arguments from defendant counsel regarding maldonado escarfullery cooperation with the government in apprehending other members of the conspiracy,and as a result the court granted a month downward variance from the government recommended sentence in case.see id.a directing court to consider the history of the defendant.finally,maldonado escarfullery counsel specifically recognized that the court had considered the relevant factors,stating during his argument for reconsideration of the sentence your honor,i know that you have stated that the sic has been satisfied and the only way is to impose a consecutive sentence.
in the context of the entire sentencing hearing,this was more than enough.see united states dávila gonzález,cir although the court did not specifically reference the factors that the appellant now highlights,the sentencing transcript,read as a whole,evinces a sufficient weighing of the section a factors.carrasco de jesús,at the court statement of its reasons for its choice of a sentence plainly takes into account the section a factors.the district court had an ample basis to impose a consecutive sentence for case.
the sentence is affirmed.
according to the transcript of the sentencing hearing,the district court judge apparently stated that he was adding a increase for this factor.however,the court other calculations show that he in fact added six levels,as was proper under the november,edition of the guidelines,which the judge stated he was using.neither party objected to this apparent discrepancy during the hearing,and neither raises it as an issue on appeal.
the government argues,briefly,that the waivers of appeal in maldonado escarfullery plea agreements bar any claims here as to cases and,because in both of those cases the district court imposed the sentences recommended by the agreements.however,with regard to case,the plea agreement did not make any recommendation as to whether the sentence should run concurrently or consecutively.since the district court imposition of a consec
