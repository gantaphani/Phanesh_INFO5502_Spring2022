this appeal presents primarily the almost metaphysical issue of how,if at all,a lifetime term of supervised release,imposed for a supervised release violation,should be reduced by the number of months of a prison term imposed for that same violation,a subtraction we are willing to assume is required by the literal terms of the provisions governing supervised release.defendant appellant michael cassesse appeals from the june,judgment of the district court for the eastern district of new york sandra townes,district judge revoking his previous term of lifetime term of supervised release and sentencing him to a term of twelve months in prison followed by a renewed lifetime term of supervised release.we affirm.
background 
in,cassesse was convicted of conspiracy to distribute heroin and sentenced to five years probation.in,he was convicted of possession with intent to distribute more than grams of heroin and sentenced to months of imprisonment,a consecutive term of months for violating his probation,and a lifetime term of supervised release,the maximum possible term of supervised release under the statute.see b b.one of the conditions of lifetime supervised release for the narcotics offense was that cassesse refrain from new criminal conduct.
in,while cassesse was out of prison but continuing to serve his term of supervised release,he was indicted on several new charges,including racketeering in violation of.cassesse was subsequently charged with violating a condition of supervised release by committing a new crime.following his guilty plea to the racketeering charge,the district court sentenced cassesse for both the racketeering conviction and the violation.
speaking with respect to the racketeering offense,judge townes noted that she had considered all of the submitted documents,all of the statements made by the defense,the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines,and the factors enumerated by a,including the defendant history and characteristics,the nature of the crime committed,and the need for specific and general deterrence.judge townes noted that cassesse racketeering offense was a violation of his term of supervised release 
he committed the crime to which he pled guilty,racketeering while serving a term of supervised release.cassesse difficulties in life do not relieve him of his responsibilities for the consequences of continuing to commit crimes.yet he does not seem inclined to stop i truly do think cassesse has fully accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.i believe he just been caught.
the district court imposed a sentence of months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release for the racketeering crime.
judge townes next turned to the violation of supervised release.at this point the parties presented to the court a plea agreement,in which cassesse apparently agreed to plead guilty to the supervised release violation in exchange for the government recommendation that any additional prison term for that violation be served concurrently with the month racketeering sentence.the parties agreed that the relevant advisory range for the supervised release violation was six to twelve months of imprisonment.
the district court accepted cassesse guilty plea but rejected the parties recommendation of a concurrent term,imposing instead a sentence of twelve months of imprisonment for the supervised release violation to run consecutively to the month term for the racketeering conviction.having revoked the previously imposed term of lifetime supervised release for the narcotics violation,the district court then imposed a new lifetime term of supervised release.
although judge townes provided no detailed explanation for the sentence for the supervised release violation,she stated,i have reviewed everything.at the conclusion of the hearing,defense counsel objected to the lifetime term of supervised release but did not object either to the court failure to subtract the twelve month term of imprisonment from it or to the brevity of the court explanation of that term.
discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal,sentences may be challenged for substantive and procedural reasonableness.see united states verkhoglyad,cir.cassesse argues on appeal that the lifetime term of supervised release should somehow have been reduced by twelve months,which is a procedural objection.although cassesse did not specifically object in the district court to the lack of a twelve month reduction,we will assume that his general objection to the length of the new lifetime term comprehended this point.because this claim presents a question of statutory interpretation,we review the district court decision de novo.see united states aleynikov,cir.
cassesse also complains that the district court inadequately explained its reasons for the lifetime term,which is a procedural objection,and in the absence of any objection in the district court,plain error review applies.see united states villafuerte,cir holding that rigorous plain error analysis applies to unpreserved claims of procedural sentencing error under a and c 
whether and how to reduce the lifetime term of supervised release 
cassesse contends that the district court erred when,after revoking his previously imposed term of lifetime supervised release for his narcotics offense,it imposed both twelve months of imprisonment and a new lifetime term of supervised release for the supervised release violation.more specifically,he contends that the district court was required by statute to deduct the former from the latter,limiting the supervised release term to something at least twelve months less than the lifetime maximum authorized for the narcotics violation for which his original term of supervised release was imposed.
sentencing for a violation of supervised release is governed by.the parties agree that the relevant form of section is the one that was in force in,at the time that cassesse was sentenced to his original lifetime term of supervised release.see united states smith,cir.the version of section in effect in provides in relevant part 
the court may revoke a term of supervised release,and require the person to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision,if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person violated a condition of supervised release 
e.the version is silent on the question of whether a renewed term of supervised release may be imposed in addition to a prison term as punishment for a supervised release violation.interpreting this version of the statute,the supreme court in johnson united states,d,concluded that a court may revoke the release term and require service of a prison term equal to the maximum authorized length of a term of supervised release.id.at.moreover,the court added,because a term of supervised release continues after revocation even when part of it is served in prison,the balance of it remain s effective as a term of supervised release when the incarceration is over.id.at.as we have noted,section b b provided for the original term of supervised release and authorized a maximum term of lifetime supervised release.in,before johnson was decided,but after cassesse was sentenced,congress amended the supervised release provisions to provide explicitly that a renewed term of supervised release may be imposed for a supervised release violation.see violent crime control and law enforcement act of,stat,codified at h.the amending language not only authorized a renewed term of supervised release not to exceed the maximum allowable for the underlying violation,but also introduced the concept,relevant to this appeal,of a reduction of the maximum allowable term of supervised release by the length of time spent in prison for the supervised release violation.the amendment added section h,which provides 
when a term of supervised release is revoked and the defendant is required to serve a term of imprisonment,the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment.the length of such a term shall not exceed the term of sup
