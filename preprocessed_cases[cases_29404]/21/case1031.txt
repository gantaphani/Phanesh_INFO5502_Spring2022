constancy is a virtue,and he who vacillates often pays a price for his indecision.this sentencing appeal illustrates the point.
we extract the relevant facts from the plea agreement,the colloquy,the transcript of the disposition hearing,and the documents in the record.see united states,cir united states dietz,cir.
ivan has a history of trouble with the law.pertinently,he pled guilty to federal drug trafficking and money laundering charges on june.the united states district court for the district of puerto rico sentenced him to serve a incarcerative term in a federal correctional facility.on may,he pled guilty in the same court to additional violations and to transporting firearms.he received a sentence,to be served concurrently with his previous sentence.
the charges underlying this appeal stem from a protracted investigation by federal agents into the laundering of drug proceeds.this probe revealed that for a period of roughly ten months commencing around december of,the appellant participated in the laundering of drug money within the united states and abroad.on august,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico returned an indictment charging the appellant who was then incarcerated as a result of the sentences imposed in june and may with money laundering in violation of.
immurement did not check the appellant penchant for criminal activity.in november of,while still incarcerated,he engaged in telephone conversations concerning money laundering and the importation and distribution of quantities of cocaine.he did not inform the authorities of these conversations,as federal law requires.see id.
on november,the grand jury returned a superseding indictment that charged the appellant with,inter alia,conspiracy to commit money laundering id.a a i,a a,h.after initially proclaiming his innocence,the appellant entered a guilty plea to the money laundering count on may.on the same date,the government charged him,by information,with misprision of a felony,id.charge based on the telephone calls.the appellant pled guilty to that charge as well.
coincident with these developments,the parties entered into a plea agreement the agreement.see.e c.the agreement spelled out certain proposed offense level adjustments and,based on those stipulations,memorialized an agreement that the appropriate disposition of this case would be a sentence of months imprisonment.the length of this proposed sentence derived from the following calculation made by the government,acquiesced in by the appellant,and eventually adopted by the district court.the calculation started with the base offense level for laundering monetary instruments level.ussg a the base offense level was increased by six levels because the funds in question exceeded.id.b g.three more levels were added due to the appellant knowledge that the funds represented the proceeds of an unlawful activity involving the distribution of controlled substances.id.b.that subtotal was reduced by three levels for acceptance of responsibility.id.given the appellant adjusted offense level and criminal history category iii,the projected guideline sentencing range was months.the sentence that the parties agreed to recommend to the court reflected the top of that range.
the parties also agreed i that the government would request that the two new sentences one for money laundering and the other for misprision be served concurrently ii that no further adjustments or departures to the base offense level would be sought and iii that any request by the appellant for any further guideline adjustments will be considered by the united states as a breach of this agreement.the agreement neither referred to the appellant previous crimes nor mentioned his existing incarceration.
at the time that he signed the agreement,the appellant was represented by two experienced defense lawyers.he subsequently retained yet a third attorney,jos√©,to work in conjunction with them.if two were company,three proved to be a crowd on september,without the assent of his two,filed a motion seeking to have the new sentence run concurrently with the unexpired portions of the appellant existing sentences.in this motion,the appellant argued that ussg b required that result in the appellant view,his previous convictions had been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for his new sentence by reason of the enhancement for his knowledge that the laundered funds were drug proceeds.
the disposition hearing took place on september.the appellant three attorneys were present to represent their common client.
the district court first addressed the september motion.the court quickly ascertained that the appellant original lawyers,marlene aponte cabrera and rafael castro lang,had no input into the filing of that motion.aponte then stated that she believed the motion contravened the agreement.castro concurred with that assessment.the court asked the appellant what he wished to do in view of the fact that the motion was deemed inadvisable by two of his three attorneys.the appellant replied that he desired to withdraw the motion and proceed with the sentencing.
despite this blunt disavowal,the district judge conducted a thorough inquiry.she questioned the government on its interpretation of the agreement,heard again from the appellant,and listened to his battery of attorneys.in the end,the judge noted that the only mention of concurrent sentences in the agreement was the linkage between the money laundering and misprision charges,see supra note,and that the agreement made no reference to other criminal cases or sentences.the judge concluded that,under the circumstances,granting the motion would be an unwarranted modification of the plea agreement and,therefore,denied it.
from that point forward,the disposition hearing proceeded smoothly.in line with the agreement,the district court sentenced the appellant to a incarcerative term for money laundering and a incarcerative term for misprision of a felony.the court ordered those terms to run concurrently with each other but consecutive to the undischarged portions of the earlier sentences.
on september,the appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.in this venue,he argues that his motion for the imposition of concurrent sentences should not have been denied because the agreement did not speak to this aspect of the matter and,therefore,granting the motion would not have been inconsistent with the agreement.moreover,the applicable provisions of the sentencing guidelines mandated running the sentences concurrently.see ussg,quoted supra note.
the government first line of defense is that the appellant waived this claim.waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.united states olano,d citing johnson zerbst.see also united states rodriguez,cir.what constitutes a waiver depends in the first instance on the nature of the right at issue.see new york hill,d.criminal defendants may waive most rights as long as they do so voluntarily and with knowledge of the general nature and consequences of the waiver.united states teeter,cir.when a criminal defendant identifies an issue and then declines to pursue it,he normally will be deemed to have waived that issue for the purpose of appellate review.see rodriguez,at united states ross,cir.
the record here is transparently clear that the september motion brought the possibility of a broadly concurrent that would have encompassed both the new sentence and the undischarged portions of the earlier before the district court.having raised the issue,however,the appellant then retreated and stated unequivocally that he wished to withdraw his motion.the appellant trio of attorneys acquiesced in this decision indeed,two of them had opposed the filing of the motion from the moment that they learned of it,and the motion original agreed with this course of action.
the withdrawal of the motion constituted an express waiver,and the appellant is bound by that waiver.see rodriguez,at united states mitchell,cir.his appeal therefore fails.
we hasten to add that,even if we were willing to overlook the waiver,the appeal would not bear fruit.stripped
