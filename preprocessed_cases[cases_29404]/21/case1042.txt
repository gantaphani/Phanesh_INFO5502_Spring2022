this is the third appeal that patrick vigneau vigneau has brought before this court in relation to his march convictions on multiple federal charges for his participation in a drug distribution scheme.vigneau argues that there was an error in his sentencing which resulted in an additional months incarceration the district court sentence exceeded the statutory maximum in violation of apprendi new jersey,d and the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.because we find none of vigneau arguments persuasive,we affirm.
background 
in order to understand this appeal we present the relevant facts which have been recited in greater detail in previous opinions.see united states vigneau,cir,cert.denied,d vigneau i united states vigneau,fed.appx.cir per curiam vigneau ii.from february to the end of that year,vigneau and richard crandall crandall coordinated a drug venture whereby crandall shipped marijuana from texas to vigneau in massachusetts and rhode island.vigneau,with the help of others,redistributed the drugs to retail dealers in the northeast.vigneau and others transmitted some of the proceeds of the drug sales through western union money orders to crandall in texas.the transfers served the dual purpose of allowing crandall to share in the drug profits,as well as fund the purchase of more drugs.in texas,the money transfers were often received by timothy owens owens,who assisted crandall in acquiring drugs.owens would cash the checks,and deliver the money to crandall.
vigneau and crandall used a variety of methods to ship the marijuana.the drugs were initially shipped through commercial delivery services.in march,vigneau and crandall purchased two vans so that they could transport larger quantities of marijuana themselves.one of the vans was registered in vigneau name,the other in crandall name.in addition,they also began using trucks to transport the marijuana.the marijuana was in plastic and hidden behind furniture,which was then placed in the trucks.
authorities became aware of the drug smuggling venture.in september,the drug enforcement administration intercepted an airborne express package with several pounds of marijuana and some steroids addressed to a david weiber at lyon avenue in east providence,rhode island,an address at which vigneau wife donna vigneau donna was living.this lead to the acquisition of a search warrant for the premises,as well as vigneau van which was parked outside.authorities seized incriminating evidence from the residence,as well as a drug ledger from vigneau van.in december,the missouri highway patrol stopped owens and randy panahi panahi during a delivery of marijuana to vigneau.as a result,both owens and panahi agreed to cooperate secretly with the government.the government was also able to secure the cooperation of crandall,who organized a meeting with vigneau on december.at the meeting,which was recorded on videotape by the federal bureau of investigation,vigneau discussed how the authorities had discovered their technique and made several references to his brother mark vigneau mark.
in may,the grand jury issued a sealed indictment charging vigneau with numerous drug offenses.also indicted were vigneau brother mark,his wife donna,owens,panahi,joseph rinaldi rinaldi,and kyle robson robson.vigneau was tried in the district court,along with codefendants mark,donna,rinaldi,and robson.during the lengthy trial,the government presented testimony from over twenty witnesses,including owens and panahi who chronicled their dealings with vigneau and the particulars of the drug smuggling scheme.the government also introduced physical evidence including seized marijuana,the december,videotape,the drug ledger seized from vigneau van,phone records revealing communications between the coconspirators,and tax records establishing a lack of other income.on january,upon motion by the government,the district court dismissed the case against donna.during the trial,the only codefendant to testify on his own behalf was robson.his testimony included evidence against patrick vigneau.the other defendants did not testify.
on march,a jury found patrick vigneau guilty of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise cce,in violation of count possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute,in violation of counts and attempting to possess with intent to distribute,in violation of count conspiring to distribute marijuana,in violation of a count conspiring to commit money laundering,in violation of h a a i count and engaging in individual counts of money laundering,in violation of a a i counts.
vigneau brother mark was found guilty of conspiracy to distribute marijuana,conspiracy to commit money laundering,and money laundering,and sentenced to months in prison.mark was acquitted on eleven counts of money laundering.mark appealed and we vacated the judgment and sentence,and remanded for a new trial if the government wished to pursue one.see united states mark vigneau,cir.the government declined,and the district court dismissed the indictment against mark.as for the other codefendants in vigneau trial,robson was found not guilty,while rinaldi was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to months in prison.
in vigneau first appeal,we affirmed his conviction on all counts except the individual money laundering convictions.we vacated the money laundering convictions because they were based on inadmissible hearsay and we remanded the case for resentencing.see vigneau i,at.prior to resentencing,the probation department issued a revised presentence report revised psr that was identical to the original psr except that it referred to our decision in vigneau i.at resentencing,vigneau stated that although he was not trying to reargue the conviction at this point,he might challenge his cce conviction in a motion.vigneau was sentenced and he filed a timely notice of appeal.
in vigneau second appeal,he raised two arguments which he renews in this appeal.vigneau challenged for the first time the revised psr by arguing that he was incorrectly attributed one criminal history point for convictions in rhode island state court for assault and malicious destruction of property.vigneau claimed that these charges had actually been dismissed.we held that his argument lacked merit and that he had waived all objections to the revised psr by failing to object to the contents of the psr before his original sentencing.vigneau also challenged his sentences for the marijuana offenses on apprendi grounds.among other things,he argued that he should have been sentenced for violating b,which carries a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment.we disagreed,finding that he should have been sentenced for violating b d,which carries a maximum sentence of five years for offenses involving less than kilograms of marijuana.because vigneau sentence exceeded the five year maximum sentence allowable by section b d,we vacated his sentences on counts and remanded for resentencing.prior to his second resentencing,vigneau filed a number of intervening pro se motions.in these motions,vigneau raised the same arguments regarding apprendi and his criminal history score that we decided in his second appeal.vigneau also argued that he should receive a new trial because of newly discovered evidence in the form of testimony from former codefendants as to whom charges had ultimately been dismissed.at resentencing,the district court denied all of vigneau motions.vigneau appeals the denial of these motions.
ii.discussion 
we do not need to consider the merits of vigneau arguments regarding apprendi and his criminal history score,because this court has discussed and decided them in the vigneau ii opinion and they are therefore foreclosed under the law of the case doctrine.this doctrine is a prudential principle that precludes relitigation of the legal issues presented in successive stages of a single case once those issues have been decided.field mans,cir quoting cohen brown,cir.one aspect of the law of the case doctrine is the mandate rule,which requires a district court to follow the decisions of a higher court.see ellis united states,cir see
