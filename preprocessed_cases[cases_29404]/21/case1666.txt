background 
i.the government investigation and the offense 
in july,the federal bureau of investigation fbi began investigating,a website that sold child pornography over the internet.subscribers paid a monthly access fee,and the fbi determined,based on phillips records,that he had purchased a subscription.fbi agents then obtained a warrant to search a residence in mineola,new york,believed to belong to phillips.on march,when the fbi executed the warrant,they learned that the house was the home of a family that had befriended phillips.to protect their identity,we will call them the doe family.phillips had been a babysitter for and doe daughter,jane doe.the does gave the fbi jane doe diary,which recounted a previously unknown sexual and romantic relationship between the defendant and their minor daughter.they also turned over letters that phillips had written to jane doe,signed your husband,your hunnie,and your baby boy,and in which he expressed vows of affection.
the fbi subsequently executed a warrant to search phillips home.the search uncovered and the fbi seized a computer,various photographs,and phillips diary.the contained approximately images and short movies of child pornography.among the images on the were pornographic images of jane doe,including pictures of her performing oral sex on phillips,phillips inserting his fingers into her vagina,and jane doe exposing herself.during a subsequent interview,jane doe admitted to a sexual relationship with phillips,during which he had given her numerous gifts,such as pokemon games,sneakers,a bicycle,jewelry,and two vibrators.
the fbi discovered further evidence that phillips had sexually exploited at least four other children.this evidence was presented to the district court in a presentence report psr.first,some photographs found at phillips residence depicted a six or boy,later identified as a neighbor for whom phillips babysat.most of them showed the boy naked touching his penis in one,he was holding a sign that read,i enjoy this very much wow anthony.a later interview with the boy revealed that phillips had shown him pornography and made him touch phillips penis.
second,phillips made repeated references in his diary to sexual relationships with several minor girls.the fbi identified two of them.one girl denied having a sexual relationship with phillips,while the other recalled it.the latter,who was ten years younger than phillips,indicated that when she was seven or,phillips kissed her on the lips,touched her privates,and performed oral sex on her,all on more than one occasion.
third,the fbi learned of a relationship between the defendant and a brooklyn boy.the two met through an internet chat room the boy indicated that he was thirteen,while phillips claimed to be eighteen when he was,in fact,at the time.a month after they met in person,the two became boyfriends and engaged in sexual contact by kissing on the mouth.the boy stated that they slept together but did not engage in intercourse or oral sex.
fourth,an interview of phillips mother revealed that phillips had molested his.his mother stated that phillips had given the girl a vibrator,which she used while he watched her and masturbated.the described a gift of two vibrators and also recalled being shown child and adult pornography.she also recounted that,in january,when the defendant was years old,he had attempted unsuccessfully to put his hands down her pants and engage in anal sex with her.the also reported that phillips informed her of his plans to introduce her to a boy related to one ronald trimm so that the two children could engage in sexual activity in a hotel room.jane doe was also aware of this plan.
ii.the plea and sentencing proceedings 
on march,phillips pleaded guilty to knowingly and intentionally employ ing,us ing,persuad ing,induc ing,entic ing and coerc ing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing visual depictions of such conduct,which visual depictions were produced using materials that had been mailed,shipped and transported in interstate and foreign commerce,in violation of a and d.during his plea allocution,phillips admitted that he persuaded jane doe to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing photographs.
the psr recommended a total offense level of and a corresponding sentencing guidelines range of months.among the enhancements it proposed was a enhancement,pursuant to b,for engaging in a pattern of prohibited sexual conduct with at least two minor victims on separate occasions.in recommending this enhancement,which is the principal subject of this appeal,the psr relied on the sexual conduct with jane doe to which phillips pleaded guilty and the male victim he babysat for for two years approximately to.
prior to sentencing,phillips filed a letter with the district court in which he objected to various matters in the psr.specifically,he denied having sexual contact with his and the other female identified in the psr.he further maintained that the conduct,if any,with the boy for whom he babysat occurred when phillips was between thirteen and and,therefore,could not serve as a basis for the enhancement because it was unadjudicated juvenile conduct.
at sentencing,chief judge korman rejected phillips argument that juvenile conduct could not be used to determine the applicability of b.he also denied phillips request for a fatico hearing.chief judge korman adopted the factual findings and guidelines calculations set forth in the psr,concluding 
i agree with the probation guideline calculation and the upward adjustment for a pattern of behavior.i do think the fact that some of the conduct that constituted a pattern occurred when he was a juvenile provides a legal ground for not categorizing this as a pattern and for not increasing the offense level by five points.
the district judge sentenced phillips principally to months imprisonment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
phillips raises two objections to the enhancement under b that the enhancement for an offender engaged in a pattern of sexual exploitation of minors can not be based on unadjudicated juvenile conduct and that the district court made insufficient factual findings to support the enhancement.reviewing the district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error,see,united states rubenstein,cir,we conclude that unadjudicated juvenile conduct may be properly considered under b,but that the district court factual findings were insufficient.accordingly,we remand with instructions to vacate the sentence and resentence the appellant.
i.the consideration of unadjudicated juvenile conduct under b 
b provides,in relevant part,for a enhancement i n any case in which the defendant instant offense of conviction is a covered sex crime,neither nor subsection a of this guideline applies,and the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct.b 
phillips contends that the b enhancement for a pattern of prohibited sexual behavior does not apply to unadjudicated conduct perpetrated by an adolescent because neither the guidelines nor the application notes explicitly say that it does.phillips focuses on the language of a which provides for an enhancement based
