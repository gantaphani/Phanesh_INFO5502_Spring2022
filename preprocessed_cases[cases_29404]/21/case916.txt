imauri ivery ivery pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of g and was sentenced to months in prison under the armed career criminal act acca,e.the plea was conditioned on ivery retention of the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress a firearm and ammunition police recovered while searching ivery vehicle during a traffic stop.a.in addition to appealing the denial of the motion to suppress,ivery challenges the district court enhancement of his sentence under the acca.we affirm.
the primary question here goes to the scope of permissible police authority under terry ohio,d.
the facts found by the district court are as follows around am on august,boston city police officer grant callender was on duty in boston chinatown,an area known for crime,when he observed ivery driving a white mercedes with no front license plate and a partially detached rear license plate.callender pulled ivery over two blocks later,where he was joined by officer kevin ervin.while approaching ivery vehicle callender from the rear and ervin from the front,the officers noticed that ivery was leaning to the right that ivery glove compartment was open,revealing a box of plastic sandwich bags sticking out from the glove box and that both front seats of ivery car were fully reclined,obscuring the car rear floorboard.
still standing near the mercedes with ivery inside,ervin told callender that he recognized ivery as a person who had previously fled from police.hearing this,ivery interjected i do run from the police in a quivering voice.both officers said that ivery appeared nervous callender noted that ivery was actually shaking his hands were shaking.after this verbal exchange,callender instructed ivery to exit the car,frisked him,found nothing,and then directed ivery to the rear of the car where ervin was standing.callender next frisked the inside of the mercedes,searching the front and rear compartments,floorboards,and finally behind an armrest in the center of the rear,where he found a loaded pistol.when callender emerged,ivery unsuccessfully attempted to flee and was placed under arrest.
on december,ivery was indicted in one count for unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition by a person previously convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for one year or more in violation of g.ivery moved to suppress the pistol and ammunition on fourth amendment grounds,arguing that they were obtained through an illegal search of the mercedes.after an evidentiary hearing,the district court denied ivery motion.
relying on the officers observations of the character of the neighborhood,ivery nervousness,his possession of the suspicious plastic bags,and his concealment of the car rear floorboard,the district court concluded that the officers search was permissible under terry,based on their observations of the vehicle and of ivery.
while the district court credited ervin testimony that he recognized ivery as someone who had previously run from police,the district court did not rely on this testimony.the district court neither credited nor relied on ervin testimony that during the traffic stop officer chris hamilton informed ervin by telephone that there was a white mercedes that frequents the chinatown area whose driver had assaulted an officer.ivery entered a conditional guilty plea to the sole count in the indictment on july.
ivery stipulated at sentencing that he had three earlier convictions for serious drug offense s within the meaning of e.this led the district court to calculate ivery sentence under the acca.the district court sentenced ivery to months in prison the minimum sentence required by the acca,followed by months of supervised release,and imposed a statutory assessment.though the district court made a calculation of ivery sentence pursuant to the federal sentencing guidelines,ultimately the length of ivery sentence was determined by application of the acca,not the federal sentencing guidelines.thus there was no booker error.see united states booker,d,united states antonakopoulos,cir the error under booker is that the defendant was sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system.
in terry,the supreme court held that police may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.terry,at.we conduct a inquiry to determine whether a search complies with terry.first,we evaluate whether the officers initial interference with the defendant was justified second,we ask whether the ensuing search was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the officers initial interference.united states nee,cir citing terry,at.a search is reasonable under the second part of this test where a law enforcement officer conduct s a patdown to find weapons that he reasonably believes or suspects are then in the possession of the person he has accosted.ybarra illinois,d.vehicle searches are also permissible where officers possess a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts which reasonably warrant the officer in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons in the vehicle.michigan long,d quoting terry,at.here,the legitimacy of the traffic stop is undisputed,so the first part of the terry test is satisfied.thus the only issue on appeal is whether searching the car was permissible under the circumstances.see nee,at united states lott,cir.
in united states lott,we held that the second part of the terry test imposes a dual requirement for a permissible warrantless search for weapons the officers must have actually harbored a suspicion that the suspect was armed and that suspicion must have been reasonable under the circumstances.see lott,at.here,the district court credited callender and ervin testimony that they frisked ivery and searched his car based on their observations of the circumstances and ivery conduct.in crediting this testimony,the district court also evidently concluded that the officers testified credibly that they actually feared for their safety based on these observations.ivery contends that one of the professed factual bases for the officers statement to ervin about a white mercedes in the chinatown area whose driver had assaulted an discredited,so that it was error for the district court to rely on the officers remaining testimony.ivery thus insists that the district court finding that the officers actually feared for their safety lacked a proper factual predicate.we disagree.
whether the officers actually feared for their safety is a question of fact.on appeal from disposition of a motion to suppress,we review the district court findings of fact only for clear error.united states pardue,cir citing united states maguire,cir united states watson,cir.where evaluations of witnesses credibility are concerned,we are especially deferential to the district court judgment we may overturn its decision only if,after reviewing all of the evidence,we have a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states jones,cir.we have no such conviction here,and thus no reason to disturb the district court factual findings.the fact that the district court disbelieved one part of the officers testimony but credited other parts does not render suspect the district court credibility finding.thus,we conclude that the district court did not commit clear error in finding that the officers actually feared for their safety having concluded that lott actual suspicion requirement is satisfied here,we decline the government invitation to reconsider the continuing validity of that aspect of lott in light of the supreme court holding in whren united states,d 
the district court also concluded,as indicated by its reference to terry,that callender and ervin suspicions were reasonable under the circumstances.ivery challenges this conclusion as well.the district court reasonableness determination is a decision of law based on factual findings.we review the legal determination of reasonableness de novo.pardue,a
