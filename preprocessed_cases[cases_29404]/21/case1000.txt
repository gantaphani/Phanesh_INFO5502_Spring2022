defendant,trevis caldwell,appeals from the imposition of a sentence of confinement after a spree of state crimes,a brief interlude in the state of maine adult drug treatment program,and a more dangerous spree of federal offenses,including an armed bank robbery.we find any error in the district court calculation of caldwell criminal history to be harmless,and thus affirm the district court sentence of months imprisonment.however,the district court should have indicated whether caldwell federal sentence was imposed consecutively or concurrently to his undischarged state sentences,necessitating a remand solely for that purpose.
background 
the factual and procedural background of this case is complicated by the fact that caldwell committed the offenses that led to the federal charges,conviction and sentence in the present case while he was supposed to be participating in a drug treatment program ordered by maine adult drug treatment court as an alternative to imprisonment for a number of state convictions.we set forth here only the information material to the issues raised on appeal whether the district court erred in its calculation of caldwell criminal history and whether the district court erred in refusing to order that caldwell federal sentence run concurrently to his undischarged state sentences.
state proceedings 
before getting into federal trouble,in april,caldwell had been charged and convicted of a number of state offenses four of those cases were being handled in one of maine adult drug treatment courts,to which caldwell had been admitted on march.a defendant whose cases are transferred to adult drug treatment court has the opportunity to avoid imprisonment by entering and successfully completing a drug treatment program.failure results in the implementation of an alternate disposition 
on april,caldwell entered into a plea agreement covering the four cases in drug treatment court.in one case,caldwell had already been convicted and sentenced,but he was facing a probation revocation motion,maine caldwell,in the other three cases he had been charged,but not yet convicted or sentenced.see maine caldwell.filed,maine caldwell.filed,maine caldwell.filed.as a result of the plea agreement,the drug treatment court revoked caldwell probation in,and imposed a new sentence of five months in custody,with credit for the five months he had already served,to be followed by probation effectively a sentence of probation.in each of the other three cases,caldwell entered pleas of guilty and sentencing was suspended.the plea agreement provided that if caldwell were to successfully complete the drug treatment program,his eventual sentence for all four cases would not require him to return to custody if,on the other hand,caldwell failed to complete the drug treatment program,he faced a total of months imprisonment 
almost immediately after entering the drug treatment program,on april,caldwell disappeared from the ymca where he was supposed to be staying.in june,he was terminated from the drug treatment program,triggering the provisions of the plea agreement that applied if he failed to complete the program.see supra note.pursuant thereto,on october,the state court revoked caldwell probation in and imposed consecutive sentences totaling months imprisonment six months for the probation revocation in and a total of sixteen months for the three cases where sentencing had been suspended.as caldwell had to be released from federal custody to permit the state sentencing to proceed,see infra,he never began to serve his state sentences but was,instead,immediately returned to federal custody.
at the time caldwell entered the drug treatment court,he had one other pending state case.maine caldwell.judgment and commitment.this case,like,arose out of events that occurred in oxford county,maine,in june in,caldwell had received a sentence of nine months in jail,all suspended,and one year probation.when he was sentenced in,a few months later,on april,that sentence was imposed concurrently to his sentence in.however,no motion to revoke probation was ever filed in,and the case was never formally transferred to the drug treatment court.
federal proceedings 
on april,the day after he disappeared from the drug treatment program,caldwell,with an accomplice,commenced the series of related offenses,all in maine,which precipitated his arrest,federal prosecution,conviction,and sentencing.he began by robbing a gasoline station convenience store and threatening the clerk with a knife.a few days later,on april,he robbed another gasoline station convenience store,making an apparent bomb threat.and finally,on april,he robbed a bank,threatening the teller with a shotgun.in flight from the bank robbery,he and his accomplice were identified and arrested in new hampshire.
after caldwell arrest,he was transferred to federal custody,in maine,and charged with a number of federal offenses.on june,he entered a plea of guilty to five of the six federal charges pending against him.he has remained in federal custody since his arrest on the federal charges,except for his brief release to state authorities for sentencing.
on november,the district court held a hearing on disputed sentencing issues.two of its rulings there led to the present appeal.first,in calculating caldwell criminal history score,the district court ruled that caldwell two sentences from his oxford county cases,and,were not related,as defined by section a of the sentencing guidelines.sentencing guidelines manual a cmt.as a result,caldwell was assigned one criminal history point for his indeterminate probationary sentence in imposed in january,and two criminal history points for the sentence he had received on october,after his probation was revoked for the second time in if the district court had ruled that the sentences were related,caldwell would have been assigned a total of two criminal history points for both convictions.ultimately,caldwell final criminal history score was,placing him in criminal history category v had the district court ruled in his favor,it would have been,also in criminal history category 
the district court also rejected caldwell request to have his federal sentence run concurrently to his four undischarged state sentences,ruling that it lacked the power to order that the federal sentence run concurrently where caldwell was in federal custody and had not yet begun to serve his state sentences.
caldwell guideline range,based on an offense level of and a criminal history category of v,was months imprisonment.on december,the district court sentenced him to months each on four of the counts of conviction,to run concurrently,and a mandatory consecutive sentence of months on the remaining count.
ii.discussion 
we review the district court interpretation and application of the united states sentencing guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.see united states maxwell,cir united states,cir.
criminal history 
on appeal,caldwell challenges the district court calculation of his criminal history on the ground that under section of the guidelines it should have treated his two oxford county convictions as related.
section provides 
prior sentences imposed in unrelated cases are to be counted separately.prior sentences imposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence for purposes of a,b,and c.use the longest sentence of imprisonment if concurrent sentences were imposed and the aggregate sentence of imprisonment imposed in the case of consecutive sentences.
emphasis added.application note further defines the term related cases,
related cases.prior sentences are not considered related if they were for offenses that were separated by an intervening arrest,the defendant is arrested for the first offense prior to committing the second offense.otherwise,prior sentences are considered related if they resulted from offenses that a occurred on the same occasion,b were part of a single common scheme or plan,or c were consolidated for trial or sentencing.the court should be aware that there may be instances in which this definition is overly broad and will result in a criminal history score that un
