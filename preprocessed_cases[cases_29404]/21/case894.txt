in these consolidated appeals,we are called upon to answer a vexing question of first impression at the appellate level may a federal district court,consistent with the teachings of united states booker,d,impose a sentence outside the advisory guideline sentencing range based solely on its categorical rejection of the guidelines disparate treatment of offenses involving crack cocaine,on the one hand,and powdered cocaine,on the other hand the court below believed that it could and sentenced the defendants in accordance with that belief.after careful consideration,we conclude that the district court approach was incorrect as a matter of law.consequently,we vacate the defendants sentences and remand for resentencing.
background 
we start by limning the history of the disparate treatment of crack and powdered cocaine embedded in the federal sentencing guidelines commonly referred to as the ratio.we move from there to a brief glimpse of how that differential fared in our jurisprudence.
a.the disparity.
the sentencing differential for crack and powdered cocaine offenses had its genesis in the abuse act of,stat.codified in pertinent part at the act that legislation created two mandatory sentencing ranges for drug offenses.see id.codified at b.the lower bracket spanned periods of imprisonment ranging from a mandatory minimum of five years to a maximum of forty years the higher bracket spanned periods of imprisonment ranging from a mandatory minimum of ten years to a maximum of life.see id.congress prescribed the threshold quantities of both crack and powdered cocaine needed to bring a particular offense within either bracket.see id.despite the chemical identity of crack and powdered cocaine,congress set widely disparate threshold quantities for the two drugs,requiring one hundred times more powdered cocaine than crack cocaine to trigger inclusion in a particular range.see id.setting the threshold quantities for the lower range at five hundred grams of powdered cocaine and five grams of cocaine base and the threshold quantities for the higher range at five kilograms and fifty grams,respectively.thus,for sentencing purposes,congress treated one unit of crack on par with one hundred units of powder 
congress grounded this differential on its determination that crack cocaine and powdered cocaine are not fair congeners and that,all other things being equal,offenses involving the former pose a more serious societal danger than offenses involving the latter.see sentencing comm n,special report to congress cocaine and federal sentencing policy report.in particular,congress found that crack cocaine was more likely to i induce addiction ii correlate with the incidence of other serious crimes iii implicate especially vulnerable members of society iv cause deleterious physiological effects and v attract youthful users.id.at.
shortly after passage of the act,the sentencing commission issued the initial compendium of federal sentencing guidelines.the commission built the base offense levels for crimes involving crack and powdered cocaine around the threshold quantities set by congress.this architectural decision comported with congress discernible intent.see i requiring the commission to specify a sentence to a substantial term of imprisonment for offenders convicted of trafficking in a substantial quantity of a controlled substance.consistent with its congressionally imposed obligation to reduc e unwarranted sentence disparities,id.f,the commission also fixed the guideline sentences for offenses involving quantities of crack and powdered cocaine in accordance with the ratio.see generally ussg,cmt.backg.concluding that a logical sentencing structure for drug offenses requires coordination with mandatory minimum sentences.thus,while congress designed the ratio to operate at the minimum and maximum poles of the mandatory statutory sentencing ranges,it was the commission that incorporated the ratio root and branch into its calculation of every cocaine offender guideline sentencing range gsr.
over time,congress began to have second thoughts about the wisdom of this dichotomy.as part of the mandatory minimum reform act of,congress enacted a safety valve provision,which provided a vehicle for lowering mandatory minimum sentences in a narrow subset of drug cases.see f see also united states matos,cir describing the operation of the safety valve.that same year,congress directed the sentencing commission to study the ratio and to submit recommendations anent its retention or modification.see violent crime control and law enforcement act of,stat.
the report embodied the commission response to this directive.based on its review of the available data,it concluded that it could not recommend a ratio differential as great as the current quantity ratio,report at,and suggested that the ratio be and revised,id.at.at the same time,however,the commission determined that empirical data supported congress core finding that crack cocaine poses greater harms to society than does powder cocaine,id.at,and that,therefore,important distinctions between the two may warrant higher penalties for crack,id.at xii.the commission advised congress that it would present more comprehensive recommendations at a future date.id.at.
notwithstanding its acknowledgment that higher penalties for crack offenses were justified,the commission subsequently proposed guideline amendments designed to eliminate entirely the sentencing differential between crack and powdered cocaine.see notice of submission to congress of amendments to the sentencing guidelines,may.to accomplish this objective,the commission called for reducing the base offense levels for crack offenses to the base offense levels for offenses involving equivalent quantities of powdered cocaine.
congress held hearings on the commission recommendation.see p providing that proposed guideline amendments must be submitted to congress,which may modif y or disapprove them.it found that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates significant distinctions between crack and powder cocaine,at,reprinted in.congress also determined that a change in the guideline sentencing structure unaccompanied by a corresponding change in statutory mandatory minimums would result in gross sentencing disparities between offenses involving drug quantities around the threshold levels.id.at.based on these considerations,congress rejected the commission proposed guideline amendments.see,stat.
two years later,the commission issued a report.see sentencing comm n,special report to congress cocaine and federal sentencing policy report.in that document,the commission reiterated both its position that the ratio was excessive,id.at,and its conclusion that federal sentencing policy must reflect the greater dangers associated with crack,id.at.the commission recommended that the ratio be reduced to by increasing the threshold quantities for offenses involving crack cocaine and decreasing the threshold quantities for offenses involving powdered cocaine.id.at.even though this report prompted the introduction of several bills aimed at reducing or eliminating the disparity,congress took no action.
in late,members of the senate judiciary committee invited the sentencing commission to update the commission views the ratio.the following year,the commission issued a third report.see sentencing comm n,report to the congress cocaine and federal sentencing policy report.in it,the commission again advocated narrowing the gap that separated crack cocaine offenses from powdered cocaine offenses because i more recent data suggested that the penalties were disproportionate to the harms associated with the two drugs ii the dangers posed by crack could be satisfactorily addressed through sentencing enhancements that would apply neutrally to all drug offenses and iii the severe penalties for crack offenses seemed to fall mainly on criminals and african americans.id.at.the commission hastened to add,however,that crucial differences existed in the intrinsic and other harms attributable to the two forms of cocaine and acknowledged that these differences justified stiffer penalties for crack offenses.id.at.taking into account these competing centrifugal and centripetal forces,the commission endorsed a reduction of the ratio to.id.at viii.it did not,however,propose any amendments to the sentencing guidelines.congress subsequently deliberated on the substance of the report but did not act.
b.the legal landscape.
our case law recognized the relative severity of the penalty paradigm for offenses involving crack cocaine but consistently deferred to congress policy judgments in this regard.see,united states eirby,cir united states singleterry,cir.this approach produced a series of decisions that upheld the ratio against an array of challenges.these included forays based upon the equal protection clause,see,united states graciani,cir,and the rule of lenity,see,united states manzueta,cir.pertinently,we held that,under the mandatory guidelines system that was in vogue before booker,neither the sentencing commission criticism of the ratio nor its unrequited proposal to eliminate the differential provided a valid basis for leniency in the sentencing of crack offenders.see united states andrade,cir discussing the possibility of a downward departure under ussg united states sanchez,cir same.
ii.travel of the cases 
it is against this backdrop that we rehearse the travel of these two cases.because both appeals follow guilty pleas,we draw the relevant facts from each defendant plea colloquy,the unchallenged portions of his presentence investigation report psi report,and sentencing transcript.united states mercedes mercedes,cir united states dietz,cir.
on january,law enforcement officers searched a house occupied by defendant sambath pho pursuant to a warrant.they found grams of crack cocaine together with supplies,cash,and firearms.on june,pho entered a guilty plea to a information charging possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of cocaine base in violation of.a.that offense carried a mandatory minimum sentence of five years.see id.b b.
a probation officer subsequently compiled the psi report.after converting the confiscated cash into its drug equivalent,see united states gerante,cir explicating the provision now found at ussg,cmt,the psi report concluded that pho should be held responsible for grams of cocaine base.that yielded a base offense level of.a gun enhancement,ussg b,and a discount for acceptance of responsibility,id,brought the adjusted offense level to.given the absence of any meaningful prior criminal record,pho gsr was months.
at the disposition hearing,the district court confirmed the adjusted offense level proposed in the psi report over pho contention that the conversion of cash was inappropriate in this instance.the court then discussed its understanding of the controlling law in a world 
the question now is whether the gsr is a reasonable sentence the guidelines are no longer mandatory since booker.the law now is that the court impose a sentence that is reasonable whether it in the guideline range or not,and what we talking about is whether the guidelines produce a reasonable sentence.it is the law that the court has to impose whatever mandatory minimum may have been prescribed by congress,and t he court can not exceed any statutory maximum that been prescribed by congress.but beyond that,the guidelines are not the law.
after rejecting pho plea that his prior military service justified a lower sentence,the court described the only real remaining question as this recurring question of w hether it is fair and reasonable in calculating a sentence to consider crack cocaine as times more serious than cocaine powder.emphasis supplied.
in the court estimation,the ratio was excessive and not reasonable.the court explained that it had consistently taken the position that the commission recommendation of a ratio makes sense and declared that,except for the ratio,it had no quarrel with the guideline range because the guidelines take into account all the relevant factors and otherwise take an approach that is reasonable.
based on its conclusion about the inherent unfairness of the ratio,the court recalculated pho sentencing range in accordance with the ratio.this approach produced a sentencing range of months.the court then reiterated 
i not saying that the guideline range.the guideline range is to months.what i saying is that in order to arrive at what i would consider to be a fair and reasonable sentence that complies with the statutory criteria it seems to me that it more reasonable to use a to ratio,and that how i come up with to months.
the court proceeded to impose an incarcerative sentence in the middle of the reconstituted range months.the government filed a timely appeal.see b.
on september,police officers searched defendant shawn lewis home pursuant to a warrant and discovered a virtual cornucopia of drugs grams of crack cocaine,grams of powdered cocaine,grams of marijuana,and nine grams of heroin.the search also revealed various artifacts,a large sum of cash,and two loaded mm handguns.on june,lewis entered a guilty plea to a information charging possession with intent to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base and possession by a convicted felon of two handguns.see a g.the mandatory minimum sentence for lewis offense was ten years.see b a.
a probation officer subsequently prepared the psi report.based in large part on lewis admission that he had possessed more than one hundred fifty grams of crack cocaine,the psi report concluded that his base offense level for the count should be.a gun enhancement,ussg b,and a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,id,brought the adjusted offense level to.lewis prior criminal record was extensive and placed him in the highest possible criminal history category vi.those calculations yielded a gsr of months.
at the disposition hearing,the district court adopted,without objection,the findings in the psi report.the court then reviewed the particulars of lewis case.it found nothing at all in lewis background or upbringing that militated in favor of a shorter sentence.moreover,the evidence indicated that he was a fairly big time drug dealer who had been dealing in a significant quantity of a variety of different drugs that the loaded firearms posed a high degree of danger and that he had been undeterred by previous periods of incarceration over a long history of some serious criminal offenses.based on this bleak picture,the court concluded that a severe sentence is called for here.
the court then turned to lewis principal argument in favor of a lower sentence,namely,that the standard gsr was too punitive because it reflected the ratio.the court described its approach to fashioning sentences in the world 
t he starting point the court always looks to is the guidelines.the guidelines generally produce a sentence that is fair under the circumstances and in this case,my starting point is to look at the guideline range and try to determine whether i think that it produces an unfair sentence and,if so,to what degree the sentence called for under the guidelines would be unfair.
conceding that the factors delineated in a supported a higher sentence than the government was recommending the low end of the standard gsr,the court candidly acknowledged that the only thing i see in your favor here,the only reason i would conclude that the guidelines may call for an excessive sentence,is this question about the disparity between the crack cocaine and the powder cocaine.emphasis supplied.the court proceeded to voice its agreement with the sentencing commission position that a ratio was more appropriate than the ratio because the guidelines overstate what the penalty ought to be for crack cocaine as opposed to powder cocaine.
starting from this premise,the court recalculated lewis exposure in accordance with the ratio.this recalculation yielded a sentencing range of months for the count.the court imposed a sentence of months on that count.it also imposed a concurrent sentence of months on the firearms count which is not directly at issue in this proceeding.the government filed a timeous appeal.see b.
iii.discussion 
on appeal,the government position is not that the sentences imposed were unreasonable but,rather,that the district court committed legal error.while booker recognizes the authority of a sentencing court to tailor a sentence based on individual,considerations,the government thesis runs,it does not give the court free rein to reject,on a categorical basis,the ratio embedded in both the statutory scheme and the sentencing guidelines.the defendants rejoinder is twofold.they assert that the district court deviation from the advisory guidelines was appropriate in light of booker and that,in all events,the district court based the sentences actually imposed on the individual circumstances of each case not on policy considerations.we subdivide our analysis of this important controversy into two segments.we begin by articulating the standard of review.we then address the merits of the dispute that underlies these appeals.
standard of review.
it long has been the law that properly preserved challenges to a trial court conclusions of law engender de novo review.see,united states,cir.in the past,we have applied this standard to appellate review of a district court interpretation of the sentencing guidelines.see,united states,cir united states cyr,cir.
the defendants argue that this long line of cases does not survive the remedial holding of booker.while the defendants are correct in their observation that booker altered the landscape of appellate review of sentencing decisions,they are incorrect in asserting that booker displaces the de novo standard of review with respect to a sentencing court errors of law.see united states robinson,wl cir,slip op.at holding that booker did not alter the de novo standard applicable to review of a sentencing court legal interpretation of the guidelines.we explain briefly.
as part of its remedial holding,the booker court excised a provision of the sentencing reform act that established standards of appellate review for certain claims of sentencing error because the operation of that provision depended on the mandatory nature of the guidelines system.see booker.at striking down e.the court filled the resulting lacuna with a directive that the courts of appeals thereafter should review sentences for reasonableness.see united states antonakopoulos,cir explicating booker.
although the court instructed that reasonableness review of the length of a sentence would be guided by the statutory sentencing factors,see booker.at,it provided no similar instruction as to how the reasonableness standard should be applied to as the one that the government presses a sentencing court committed an error of law rather than an error of judgment.we agree with two of our sister circuits that,regardless of length,a sentence based on an error of law is per se unreasonable.see united states price,united states crosby,cir,abrogated on other grounds by united states fagans,cir.
this conclusion is reinforced by an analogy.the reasonableness standard and the familiar abuse of discretion standard bear a strong family resemblance to each other.see united states,cir observing that the practical import of the difference between the abuse of discretion and reasonableness standards is not immediately evident.under the latter standard,courts consistently have regarded an error of law as a per se abuse of discretion.see,koon united states,d united states snyder,cir.accordingly,while the abuse of discretion standard contemplates substantial deference to the judgment calls of a nisi prius court,it entails in practice de novo review on issues of abstract law.roger edwards,llc fiddes son,cir.we believe that the reasonableness standard functions in precisely the same way errors of law render a sentence per se unreasonable,and appellate review of claimed errors of law is nondeferential,de novo.
b.the merits.
in our constitutional system,the power to define penalties for federal crimes belongs to the legislative branch of government,not the judicial branch.united states evans.while federal courts possess the discretion to tailor individual sentences within the boundaries set by the statutory framework,that discretion is subject to the limitations imposed by congress.see mistretta united states,d.the creation of the sentencing commission and the inauguration of a guideline sentencing scheme were valid exercises of congressional authority to fix penalties for federal crimes and,concomitantly,to cabin judicial discretion.see id.at.so too was congress adoption of the ratio.see singleterry,at.
of course,congress authority in this area is not unbounded.earlier this year,the supreme court identified a constitutional infirmity in the sentencing guidelines.see booker.at.the booker court held that mandatory sentencing enhancements triggered by facts were in derogation of the constitutionally assured right to trial by jury.id.citing const.amend.vi.to cure that infirmity,the court excised the statutory provision that made the sentencing guidelines binding on the federal courts.id.at.that surgical strike rendered the guidelines effectively advisory and freed sentencing courts to tailor individual sentences in light of the factors enumerated in a id.at.this means that district courts now possess greater flexibility in reaching individual sentencing decisions.
we caution,however,that this newfound discretion,though broad,is not limitless the guidelines remain part and parcel of the sentencing algorithm.see booker.at directing sentencing courts to consult the guidelines and take them into account when sentencing see also a directing sentencing courts to consider the guidelines.it is for this very reason that the court made it pellucid that the sentencing commission would continue to function and to update the guidelines with a view toward encouraging better sentencing practices and promot ing uniformity in the sentencing process.booker.at.
over and above the guidelines themselves,booker recognized another significant restriction on sentencing decisions,those decisions must still be grounded on the factors contained in section a.booker.at.although the statutory sweep is wide,see supra note,those factors also serve to guide the discretion of sentencing courts in individual cases and thereby promote greater uniformity in sentencing decisions.see id.at.
with this in place,we turn to the propriety of the defendants sentences.laboring in uncharted waters,the lower court jettisoned the guidelines and constructed a new sentencing range by using a ratio in lieu of the ratio embedded in both the statutory scheme and the guidelines.this approach,which evinced a categorical,rejection of the ratio,amounted to error as a matter of law.
matters of policy typically are for congress.see,plumley container,cir explaining that it is congress mission to set the policy of positive law,whereas a court role is to interpret that law united states robinson,cir stating that the ratio is a permissible policy choice articulated by congress and that,therefore,the courts are obliged to give it effect.a corollary to this principle is that,in the absence of constitutional infirmity,federal courts are bound by congress policy judgments,including judgments concerning the appropriate penalties for federal crimes.see eirby,at.
by congressional edict,the sentencing commission is allied with congress in the important endeavor of calibrating sentences for federal offenses congress has directed the commission to devise policies that avoid unwarranted sentence disparities,while at the same time providing sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentences when warranted by mitigating or aggravating factors.b b emphasis supplied.the clear import of this statutory framework is to preserve congress authority over sentencing policy and to guarantee that the exercise of judicial discretion over sentencing decisions be based on circumstances,not on general,policy considerations.
nothing in booker altered this distribution of authority over sentencing policy.booker established that a district court may exercise discretion in fashioning that discretion was meant to operate only within the ambit of the individualized factors spelled out in section a see booker.at.
