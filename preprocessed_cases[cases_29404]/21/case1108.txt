this case raises an issue important to the administration of criminal law the accrual date for the application of the one year limitations period in supp.ii to a federal prisoner who petitions to reduce his federal sentence because the underlying state convictions on which the length of the federal sentence is predicated have since been vacated.
scott brackett is a federal prisoner who pled guilty in july to conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of and a.his federal sentence of months became final on march.more than two years later,on december,he filed a petition under to set aside his sentence.his claim was that his federal sentence,as a career offender under,was predicated on his having been convicted at least twice before of state crimes that those convictions had now been set aside by the state court and that he should now be resentenced.he says he is no longer a career offender and his sentencing range consequently is only to months.brackett argues that because he has already served this time he should now be released.
the district court dismissed the petition as untimely under.the district court later denied reconsideration on the grounds that brackett had not brought the petition within one year of the date the sentence became final as required by and that none of the other limitation provisions within that statute applied.gonzalez united states,d.the district court also issued a certificate of appealability on the question of whether the accrual provision set forth in was applicable here.id.at.
a chronology of the pertinent events is helpful to understand the issues presented.in,brackett was convicted in state district court of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon,on his admission to sufficient facts,and was sentenced to days.in,brackett pled guilty to a state charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and received a two year suspended sentence.further,in he also pled guilty to assault with a dangerous weapon in state court and was placed on probation.
on september,he was arrested on federal charges of conspiracy to distribute and possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine.
on october,brackett moved in state court to vacate the and convictions.he argued that the and plea colloquies were insufficient and that he was intoxicated at the time of the plea proceedings.in october of,a state district judge denied his motion as to the conviction.in the memorandum and ruling from the state district court,the judge found that after seven years there was no preserved record of the defendant plea conducted before the court.the case file indicated that brackett was represented by counsel,and had executed the standard written jury waiver.the reviewing judge noted that the familiar events of federal defendants returning to the state court to vacate state convictions 
often repeated themselves in our state courts system as defendants and defense attorneys seek all avenues of relief from federal sentencing guidelines.the resources of state courts,including those of massachusetts,are called upon time and again to turn the state criminal justice system upside down to find any possible reason to vacate state convictions to afford federal defendants relief from what apparently is becoming a more and more unworkable,mandatory federal sentencing system.
having reviewed the casefile in this matter at length,and the materials submitted by the defendant in support of his motion,i find no justifiable grounds to allow the defendant motion.further,it is to be noted that justice is not best served by the adoption of novel or convoluted arguments designed to ultimately afford defendants relief in state court from a mandatory federal sentencing system.that relief is best found within the federal system itself,be it within the federal courts or within the congress.
brackett other effort,to withdraw the admission to sufficient facts in his case,was rejected by the state court on february.the reasons brackett gave for undoing his plea were that the plea colloquy was incomplete and that brackett was under the influence of alcohol at the time and was unaware of the possible repercussions that could occur at a later date.the court noted that the tape recording of the plea colloquy no longer existed inasmuch as the defendant had delayed nearly five years in presenting the motion.although brackett had the right to appeal from the and denials of his motions to vacate the and convictions under rule c of the massachusetts rules of criminal procedure,he did not do so.
on february,brackett was sentenced on the federal methamphetamine charges.as a result of having two prior state convictions,he was in a criminal history category of vi,had an adjusted offense level of,and was sentenced as a career offender under.at the time he was sentenced,the prior state convictions stood.the state courts had rebuffed his efforts to vacate those and convictions.if the state convictions had then been vacated,his sentence would have been in the month range,as opposed to the months he received.gonzalez,d at.on march,his federal sentence became final because there had been no appeal.consequently the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,limit in of one year from the date of the final judgment of conviction expired before brackett filed his petition on december.
only after his federal sentence was imposed did brackett start yet another attempt to vacate his state convictions.on january,he filed a new set of motions to vacate the and convictions.in identical motions,brackett asserted that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in and because counsel did not object to his pleading guilty even though counsel knew that he was intoxicated,and for other reasons.
his year state motions for new trials on his plea and his plea were allowed by the state court when the state prosecutor office agreed to the motions.there was no judicial finding that the pleas should be vacated due to constitutional violations.in fact,the charges against brackett were pending in the state court system at the time this case was briefed to us.
under,a prisoner in custody under sentence of a federal court,claiming the right to be released on the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states,may petition the court that imposed the sentence to vacate,set aside or correct the sentence.the statute provides for a one year period of limitations,which runs from the latest of

the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
the question on the certificate of appealability concerns only the effect of subsection,and it is the only issue which we now consider.
brackett argues that the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence must mean the date on which the state court vacated the prior criminal conviction.the government contends that the statutory language refers to situations where the underlying facts supporting the vacating of the state conviction were not known to the defendant and could not have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence then the one year runs from the discovery of such facts or when they could have been discovered the government says that because brackett knew of the facts he used to support his state court motions well before the date of his federal sentencing,subsection does not apply and this case is governed by subsection.the government argues that brackett claim is time barred because more than one year has expired since the date on which the judgment of conviction became final.we review de novo the issue of statutory interpretation.trenkler united states,cir.
the problem before us is best understood in context.through several different mechanisms the federal sentencing guidelines increase the duration of imprisonment for a federal offender who has prior state or federal convictions.one of those mechanisms is the career offender enhancement found in.because the length of the federal sentences increases with prior state convictions,the sentencing guidelines have led to a cottage industry of diligent defense counsel seeking to vacate old state convictions in order to reduce the federal sentence.see united states payne,noting the surprising infirmity of massachusetts state court convictions as they are increasingly coming under intense scrutiny in the last ditch attempt to avoid enhanced federal sentences.in this sense,as the massachusetts state court judge noted in his denial of brackett motion to vacate,the federal sentencing guidelines have imposed an unwanted burden on the state courts,which are now faced with a flood of petitions from federal defendants and prisoners attempting to vacate state court convictions.these efforts often come many years after the date of those state convictions.this is particularly problematic because,as the supreme court noted in lackawanna county district attorney coss,d,as time passes,and certainly once a state sentence has been served to completion,the likelihood that trial records will be retained by the local courts and will be accessible for review diminishes substantially.attempts to vacate or set aside state court convictions have posed a particular problem in massachusetts,because in the state district courts,where a great many criminal offenses are tried,the records of the proceedings may be destroyed after two and one half years.special rule of the district courts a.
the problem of whether to adjust federal sentences when a federal defendant asserts that the state convictions were constitutionally invalid presents a number of issues.one was the issue of where a claim that the state conviction was invalid should first be heard.in custis united states,d,the supreme court held that the federal prisoner could not attack the validity of his prior conviction which raised his penalty from a maximum of years to a mandatory minimum of years in prison pursuant to the armed career criminal act,e acca,during the federal sentencing proceedings,unless the attack was based on a deprivation of the right to counsel under gideon wainwright,d.custis was animated by two policy interests ease of administration and finality of judgments.custis,at.custis noted that it is easier to administer cases in which gideon claims are made than cases that claim ineffective assistance of counsel or failure to assure a voluntary guilty plea.id.at.in addition,finality is especially important where a defendant challenges a previous conviction because the defendant is asking a district court to deprive the judgment of its normal force and effect in a proceeding that ha s an independent purpose other than to overturn the prior judgmen t.id.at.quoting parke raley,d alterations in original.naturally,the custis ruling applies whether the sentence enhancement was imposed because of acca or because of the sentencing guidelines.united states,cir united states garcia,cir.
after custis,the where question became whether the constitutional infirmity of the state conviction could be raised initially in federal court by a petition.in daniels united states,d,the supreme court answered this question negatively,with the exception of convictions in violation of the gideon right to counsel.the court said that a defendant may raise the issue of the validity of a state conviction in state court on direct appeal or in state proceedings,or,if those routes had been exhausted,by petition for habeas under.daniels.at.but the court would not permit leapfrogging of those state procedures to attack the state conviction initially by a federal petition.the court did leave open the possibility that a prisoner,who is prevented by no fault of his own from bringing a state proceeding to vacate,and was now barred by state law from doing so,could bring a petition.id.at.
this means that,absent a gideon challenge,the where question is answered the initial attack on the validity of the state conviction should be brought in state court.only after the state court proceedings are exhausted,as a general rule,can a prisoner come to federal court to pursue a habeas claim.this rule is generally true both under,the federal review for those in federal custody,and,more usually,under,the habeas statute for those in state custody.boerckel,d.
in this case,brackett has exhausted his state court remedies because he has managed to vacate two state convictions.he has accomplished the first step necessary to have his sentence reviewed by a habeas court.however,he must still contend with the time limitation contained in is,the question of when such a claim is no longer timely.initially,we look at this question by analogy to the parallel habeas statute.
aedpa affected both federal relief and habeas.the supreme court commonly interprets and in light of each other.see lackawanna county.at extending daniels rule under to a case.just as,the statute that concerns us,has time limits,so too does,which applies to petitions.
section d provides that a period of limitation shall apply for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court.it goes on to state that the period of limitation starts to run from the latest of four potential occurrences which are substantially similar to the ones outlined in.d.indeed,d d is strikingly similar to the provision that concerns us.the limitation under d d states that the limitation period shall run from the latest of the date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.d the only difference between the two provisions is that uses the phrase facts supporting the claim while d d uses the phrase the factual predicate of the claim.
the jurisprudence on the limits imposed on by is more developed and sheds some light on our problem.the supreme court addressed the issue of statutory tolling of d one year limitation period in artuz bennett,d,and held that,under d,an application to a state court for relief tolls the limitations period in d,even if the application contains procedurally barred claims.recently,in duncan walker,d,the court once more addressed the issue of tolling of the one year limitation period in d.duncan held that,while the time during which a properly filed application for state or other collateral review is pending is not counted toward the limitation period for filing a petition from aedpa effective date,the tolling provision does not apply to the time taken by a prior application for federal habeas corpus.duncan,at.at.the court noted that the one year limitation period in d expressed congress interest in finality of state court judgments because it reduces the potential for delay on the road to finality.id.at.the court also observed that while the tolling provision in d potentially lengthens the road to finality,it limits the harm to the interest in finality by according tolling effect only to properly filed application s for state or other collateral review.id.alteration in original.
