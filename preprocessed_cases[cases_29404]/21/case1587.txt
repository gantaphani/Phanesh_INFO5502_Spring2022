juan cuevas appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york jed rakoff,judge entered march,imposing a sentence under the united states sentencing guidelines guidelines of principally months imprisonment for conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine,to run concurrently with lesser sentences on other counts.
this court first considered cuevas appeal in november.at that time,we remanded the case to the district court to develop a factual record of the circumstances surrounding cuevas extradition from the dominican republic,and to determine whether the dominican republic decree granting the united states request for extradition required limitation of cuevas sentence to years,months.we deferred ruling on cuevas other sentencing objections until the district court made factual findings on the extradition issue.see united states cuevas,cir.
on remand,the district court received evidence from the parties relating to cuevas extradition,as well as the united states extradition practices in general.based on this evidence,the district court determined that the dominican republic sentencing cap did not apply to cuevas because the united states had never agreed to such a limitation as a condition of his extradition.the district court therefore confirmed its original sentence of months imprisonment.united states cuevas,d.
we find no error in the district court factual findings or legal reasoning with respect to extradition,and therefore affirm its decision on that issue.as to the remainder of cuevas sentencing objections,we conclude that the district court did not err in its guidelines calculations and did not violate cuevas constitutional rights by declining to adjourn the sentencing.nevertheless,because the sentence was imposed prior to the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,we must remand for reconsideration pursuant to united states crosby,cir.
background 
indictment and extradition 
on september,juan cuevas was indicted,along with nine other defendants,for conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine from about through the date of the indictment,in violation of a,b a,and.the superseding indictment,filed on april,added two more counts.count two charged cuevas and four others with conspiracy to launder money,in violation of h,a a i,a b i,and a.count three charged that cuevas and two others had participated in a money laundering transaction on or about march,in violation of a b i and.
several of the defendants named in the indictment were arrested in the spring and summer of.cuevas,who was living in the dominican republic,managed to avoid apprehension at that time.in july,the united states attorney office for the southern district of new york contacted the office of international affairs in the united states department of justice doj to initiate the process of requesting cuevas extradition.the office of international affairs,in turn,contacted the united states department of state state department,which instructed the embassy in santo domingo to communicate the request.on august,the embassy sent diplomatic note to the government of the dominican republic,requesting that cuevas be provisionally arrested in anticipation of extradition to the united states.by diplomatic note,dated november,the embassy transmitted to the government of the dominican republic the formal documentation in support of the request for cuevas extradition.the extradition request was made pursuant to the convention for the mutual extradition of fugitives from justice,june,stat,a bilateral treaty between the united states and the dominican republic,and pursuant to the united nations convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances,treaty doc,a multilateral treaty to which the united states and the dominican republic are both signatories.see cuevas,d at.
by diplomatic note,dated november,the government of the dominican republic acknowledged receipt of the extradition request.after some delay,on july,the dominican republic transferred custody over cuevas to the united states,and cuevas was subsequently transported to new york.in late july,two weeks after cuevas return,the united states received a copy of a decree,signed by the president of the dominican republic,authorizing cuevas extradition.id.at.the decree,dated july,stated in pertinent part i t is understood that the defendant is covered by the provisions of article,paragraph ii of law number,dated october,as amended by law number on july.dom.extradition decree,july.the referenced provision of the dominican republic law reads in extradition treaties signed by the dominican state with other states,when the extradition of a national is granted,no penalty greater than the maximum established in this country,which at the moment this law enters into force is thirty years,shall be imposed.dom.law on extradition,para.ii,as amended by dom.law.
plea and sentencing 
on october,cuevas appeared with counsel before the district court for the southern district of new york and pled guilty to all three counts of the superseding indictment.after conducting a thorough plea allocution,the district court accepted cuevas guilty plea on all counts.
during the course of the hearing,the assistant attorney ausa notified the district court that another indictment,charging a conspiracy,was pending against cuevas in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.the ausa stated that her office was willing to accept a transfer pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure and had so advised the united states attorney office in the southern district of florida,but that she had been unable to finalize the arrangement.the ausa further represented that in the event that the transfer request was declined,her office would continue to take the position that the sentences in the two cases should be imposed concurrently.cuevas stated that he understood the situation and acknowledged that there was no guarantee that the transfer would be completed before sentencing,which the district court scheduled for the following february.the district court set a fatico hearing for the week prior to sentencing to resolve the parties disputes over the applicability of certain sentencing enhancements.see generally united states fatico,cir.
the fatico hearing was held on february and.the government called two witnesses,both of whom had been charged as in the drug distribution scheme and who had entered into cooperation agreements with the government.the first witness,edward vidal,testified about the inner workings of the organization from his vantage point as a man for cuevas.the second witness,rafael duverge,testified about his business dealings with cuevas in the drug importation business from to september.counsel for cuevas was given an opportunity to both witnesses.cuevas himself did not testify or present any witnesses at the fatico hearing.
on february,the district court issued an order finding,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the conspiracy of which cuevas was a member distributed,as he well knew,in excess of kilos of cocaine,a firearm,as he well knew,was used in the conspiracy,and he was a leader of the conspiracy.the district court scheduled a hearing for february,to hear argument on the government request that cuevas not receive any reduction for acceptance of responsibility and on cuevas requests for downward departures based on his family ties and obligations,his physical disabilities,and a combination of those circumstances.
at the february hearing,cuevas counsel sought an adjournment of sentencing until the transfer of the indictment pending in the southern district of florida could be finalized.the district court denied the application stating that this sentence should not be delayed any further,but noted that it was strongly predisposed to impose a concurrent sentence on any rule sentence that might eventuate.after hearing argument from both sides on the sentencing issues,the district court granted cuevas a decrease for acceptance of responsibility,but declined to depart downward based on cuevas family and medical circumstances.applying the guidelines,the district court determined that,based on an offense level of for a quantity of over kilograms of cocaine,a enhancement for the leadership role,a enhancement for the firearm,and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,the total offense level was,yielding a guidelines range of months to life imprisonment.the district court ultimately sentenced cuevas to months imprisonment on count one,to run concurrently with months imprisonment on counts two and three,as well as a term of supervised release and a mandatory special assessment of.
initial appeal 
cuevas timely appealed his sentence.in his initial appellate brief,filed on june,cuevas argued that his guilty plea was involuntary and his sentence illegal because he was not informed of,nor sentenced in compliance with,the maximum penalty of years imprisonment as set forth in the decree granting his extradition from the dominican republic.cuevas also argued that the district court had erred in its application of the guidelines,specifically,in determining the quantity of drugs,in assessing the leadership enhancement,and in denying his downward departure motions.finally,cuevas contended that the district court had violated his due process rights by refusing to adjourn the sentencing pending completion of the rule transfer.
on july,cuevas filed a supplemental brief,raising the additional argument that under the supreme court june,decision in blakely washington,d,the district court ad hoc findings concerning his relevant conduct,role in the offense,and possession of a weapon were unconstitutional judicial determinations.
on november,following oral argument,this court issued a decision remanding the case on the extradition issue.we concluded that there was insufficient evidence to permit meaningful review of that issue,since the record lacked any indication as to whether the united states and the dominican republic reached an agreement as to the sentence that could be imposed upon cuevas.cuevas.at.we therefore directed the district court,on remand,to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the issue,make factual findings,and,if necessary,reconsider its prior rulings and modify the judgment.id.we deferred decision on the remaining sentencing matters until such time that the district court confirmed or modified its sentence in light of its findings on the extradition issue.
proceedings on remand 
pursuant to our order,the district court conducted several hearings and received written submissions from the parties on the matter of extradition.in support of its position,the government submitted declarations from the director of the office of international affairs and the state department assistant legal advisor for law enforcement and intelligence,who explained that typically,when a foreign country seeks to impose a sentencing limitation as a condition of granting extradition,it requests formal assurances from the united states prior to surrendering the defendant.the declarants further attested that between november,when the dominican republic acknowledged receipt of the extradition request,and july,when the dominican republic relinquished custody over cuevas,the united states did not receive any diplomatic communications from the dominican republic regarding cuevas extradition.
these undisputed facts formed the basis of the district court december,decision.the district court found that the united states had never expressly agreed to the limitation of cuevas sentence as a condition of extradition either prior to,or at the time of,the transfer of custody.the fact that the extradition decree contained such a condition was irrelevant,since the united states could not have agreed to be bound by a condition it only learned of after taking custody.cuevas,d at.the district court also noted that the dominican republic,though fully informed of the sentence imposed on cuevas,had not raised the slightest protest.id.based on these findings,the district court concluded that cuevas sentence should remain as originally imposed.id.
cuevas thereafter reinstated his appeal before this court.
discussion 
effect of extradition decree and treaties on cuevas sentence 
as a preliminary matter,the government contends that in the absence of protest from the dominican republic,cuevas lacks standing to raise violation of an extradition treaty as an issue.this court has not conclusively decided whether a defendant has standing to challenge his sentence on the ground that it violates the terms of the treaty or decree authorizing his extradition.see united states banks,cir.we need not resolve this issue here,however,because cuevas arguments plainly fail on the merits.see id.
the rule of specialty,which is derived from principles of international comity,generally requires a country seeking extradition to adhere to any limitations placed on prosecution by the surrendering country.united states baez,cir per curiam.typically,the rule of specialty is invoked to circumscribe the specific crimes for which a defendant may be tried following extradition.see united states campbell,cir it is well established that,under the international principle of specialty,an extradited defendant may not be tried for a crime not enumerated in the applicable extradition treaty.citing united states rauscher.united states flores,cir.however,the rule of specialty has application in the sentencing context as well.as we held in united states baez,since the cauldron of circumstances in which extradition agreements are born implicate the foreign relations of the united states,a district court,i n sentencing a defendant extradited to this country in accordance with a diplomatic agreement between the executive branch and the extraditing nation,delicately must balance its discretionary sentencing decision with the principles of international comity in which the rule of specialty sounds.at.in more concrete terms,this means that a district court should temper its discretion in sentencing an extradited defendant with deference to the substantive assurances made by the united states to an extraditing nation.id.emphasis added.
the district court did not offend against the rule of specialty here.the extradition treaty between the united states and the dominican republic contains no limitations on sentencing.see banks,at.furthermore,the factual record developed on remand establishes that the united states never made any substantive assurances to the dominican republic that if extradited and convicted,cuevas would not be sentenced to a term of more than years imprisonment.baez,at observing that prior to the extradition,the united states had sent a diplomatic note,assuring colombia that should restrepo be convicted of the offenses for which extradition has been granted,the united states executive authority,with the agreement of the attorney for the accused,will not seek a penalty of life imprisonment at the sentencing proceedings in this case campbell,at recounting that the department of state had provided assurances to the costa rican government in a diplomatic note stating,inter alia,that campbell will not be sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment greater than years.while the extradition decree indicates that officials of the dominican republic believed,no doubt based on the domestic law of the dominican republic,that cuevas sentence would be so limited,critically,nothing in the decree point s to any agreement or undertaking made by the united states to limit his sentence.banks,at.the dominican republic unilateral belief that cuevas would be covered by law is insufficient to bind the united states.see id.at.
cuevas does not dispute the district court finding that the united states provided no diplomatic assurances regarding the limitation of his sentence as part of the extradition arrangement.cuevas contends that the united states is bound by the sentencing limitation,notwithstanding the absence of specific assurances,because in signing the convention,the united states agreed it is the law of the dominican republic that controls the conditions upon which extradition is made.cuevas rests his argument on the language of article,paragraph of the convention,which provides extradition shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the law of the requested party or by applicable extradition treaties,including the grounds upon which the requested party may refuse extradition.convention,para,at.
in interpreting a treaty,we must begin with the text of the treaty and the context in which the written words are used.société nationale industrielle aérospatiale dist.court for the dist.of iowa,d internal quotation marks omitted.when article is read as a whole,it becomes clear that paragraph simply means that a state may consider conditions in its domestic laws or applicable extradition treaties in deciding whether to grant a request made pursuant to the convention,and may refuse to extradite unless the requesting state agrees to comply with those conditions.accordingly,paragraph of article states in considering requests received pursuant to this article,the requested state may refuse to comply with such requests where there are substantial grounds leading its judicial or other competent authorities to believe that compliance would facilitate the prosecution or punishment of any person on account of his race,religion,nationality or political opinions,or would cause prejudice for any of those reasons to any person affected by the request.convention,para,at emphasis added.the onus is on the requested state to determine,prior to surrendering the individual,whether extradition is permitted under its own laws and treaty obligations.thus,paragraph provides subject to the provisions of its domestic law and its extradition treaties,the requested party may,upon being satisfied that the circumstances so warrant and are urgent,and at the request of the requesting party,take a person whose extradition is sought and who is present in its territory into custody or take other appropriate measures to ensure his presence at extradition proceedings,para,at emphasis added.
here,the dominican republic did not make adherence to law a mandatory condition of extradition indeed,the issue of sentencing was never discussed at any point prior to the transfer of custody.nothing in article,including paragraph,makes the domestic laws of the dominican republic binding on the united states in this situation.rosado civiletti,cir opining that no nation may unilaterally bind another sovereign by the sheer force of its statutory enactments.
our reading finds further support in the normal practices of the united states and its extradition treaty partners,including the dominican republic.see société nationale,at.stating that the practical construction adopted by the parties may also be relevant in interpreting a treaty internal quotation marks omitted.as the declarations from the director of the office of international affairs and the assistant legal advisor for the state department establish,when a foreign nation seeks to impose a limitation on a sentence as a condition of granting the extradition of a defendant to the united states,it formally requests assurances from the united states by way of diplomatic note.the doj,in consultation with the state department,determines whether the united states can and should provide the requested assurances,and relays the official position by diplomatic note.the foreign nation then considers the response of the united states in deciding whether to extradite the defendant.
in this case,the dominican republic did not request or secure any assurances regarding the limitation of cuevas sentence before surrendering him to the united states.because the united states never agreed that cuevas extradition would be subject to law,the district court was under no obligation to limit cuevas sentence to years.we therefore affirm the district court conclusion that cuevas sentence of months imprisonment is not illegal,and that his guilty plea was not involuntary or uninformed.
cuevas sixth amendment and objections 
in his initial appeal,cuevas raised several objections to his sentence.in his original brief,cuevas challenged the district court offense level determinations,specifically its underlying findings as to drug quantity and his role in the organization,as clearly erroneous in light of the record developed at the fatico hearing.cuevas also argued that the district court had committed error in denying his motion for a departure based on extraordinary family and medical circumstances.in his supplemental brief,filed a month after the supreme court handed down its decision in blakely washington,d,cuevas advanced the alternative position that the district court should not have relied on its own findings at all,at least not to enhance the sentence.
since the time of the first appeal,the law governing federal sentencing has changed significantly.six months after blakely,the supreme court decided united states booker,d.in booker,the court clarified that to comply with the sixth amendment,a ny fact other than a prior conviction which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the statutory maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.stevens,opinion for the court.to implement this holding,the supreme court excised the provision of the guidelines that made its application mandatory.see id.at.breyer,opinion for the court.
although booker removed the mandatory teeth of the guidelines by rendering them advisory,it did not discard the guidelines altogether.united states cavera,wl,at cir.june.while a district court is no longer required to impose a guidelines sentence,it still has a duty to consider the applicable guidelines range,in addition to the other factors listed in a,in determining the appropriate sentence.see crosby,at.furthermore,under the regime,the sentencing judge is entitled to find all of the facts that the guidelines make relevant to the determination of a guidelines sentence and all of the facts relevant to the determination of a sentence.id.at.in short,district courts remain statutorily obliged to calculate guidelines ranges in the same manner as before booker and to find facts relevant to sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence.united states vaughn,cir,cert.denied,d see also,united states salazar,cir.june.
cuevas pled guilty to a conspiracy involving more than five kilograms of cocaine,which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment,b a,and to money laundering and conspiracy to launder money,each of which carries a maximum sentence of years imprisonment,a.because the sentence imposed did not exceed these statutory maximums,the district court did not violate cuevas sixth amendment rights by relying on its own factual findings in determining the appropriate guidelines range.see united states florez,cir,cert.denied,d see also united states ubiera,cir booker does require factfinding by a jury and beyond a reasonable doubt,but only where the fact is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty.quoting booker,at,petition for cert.filed june.
because the district court sentenced cuevas prior to booker,however,it understandably but erroneously treated the guidelines as mandatory.in united states crosby,this circuit first decision applying booker,we held that where a defendant raises a sixth amendment challenge to his sentence on appeal that he did not preserve below,booker requires that we remand the case for the district court to consider whether it would have imposed a nontrivially different sentence had it appreciated that the guidelines were advisory and considered all of the factors listed under a.see crosby,at.the purpose of a crosby remand is to ascertain whether the district court mandatory application of the guidelines was plain error.the plain error analysis is satisfied if,on remand,the district judge determines that the original sentence would have differed in a nontrivial manner from that imposed.id.at.if,on the other hand,the district judge decides,in full compliance with now applicable requirements,that under the regime the sentence would have been essentially the same as originally imposed,any sixth amendment error is harmless.id.
while the government acknowledges that cuevas original sentence predates booker,it contends that a crosby remand is unnecessary for two,because the district court chose a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range and expressed its views on the appropriateness of the guidelines sentence at the original sentencing and second,because the district court concluded on remand,after booker and crosby,that cuevas sentence should remain as originally imposed.cuevas,d at.neither rationale is persuasive.first,as we recognized in crosby,while it may be possible for this court to make an educated guess as to the likely outcome of a remand,it is still prudent to remand because that guess might be wrong,absent a clear indication at the original sentencing supporting the inference that the same sentence would have been imposed under the regime.crosby,at.no such clear indication exists here although the district court noted that it was not uncomfortable with how high the g uidelines sentence was in cuevas particular case,we can not say with certainty that the district court would not have imposed a sentence had it perceived this to be a possibility.second,while the district court stated in its december decision that cuevas sentence should remain as originally imposed,the body of the decision makes plain that the only matter considered by the district court on remand was the extradition issue.cuevas,d at see also id.the dominican republic failure to object calls into question whether it ever intended the language in the decree to give rise to an agreement,and,in any case,suggests that affirming the court prior sentence will not offend principles of comity.accordingly,juan sentence should remain as originally imposed.citations omitted.at oral argument,the government conceded that there was no mention of booker at any point during the remand proceedings.we therefore conclude that a crosby remand is necessary.
because the district court has not yet had the opportunity to reconsider its sentence in light of booker,our present task is not to review cuevas sentence for reasonableness,the new standard established by booker.united states garcia,cir.we consider cuevas objections to the district court guidelines calculations,however,because the district court,on remand,remains under an obligation to consider the guidelines,and our resolution of a defendant guidelines objections will assist the district court in fulfilling that obligation.id.quoting united states maloney,cir see also united states carr,cir considering the defendant objection to the district court previous application of the sentencing guidelines before remanding,and explaining that t his is a question the district court will again be required to decide on remand because,it must still consider the appropriate guidelines sentence along with the other section a factors in arriving at the correct sentence,cert.denied.
cuevas contends that there was insufficient evidence for the district court to find that the conspiracy involved more tan kilograms of cocaine,or that he played a leadership role in criminal activity involving five or more participants,see a.in reviewing a district court sentencing decision on appeal,this court accept s the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous united states franklyn,cir see united states gotti,cir stating that the clear error standard is appropriate where the district court application of a sentencing guideline in a particular case presents an issue that is predominantly factual rather than legal,cert.denied,d.a finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states hazut,cir internal quotation marks omitted.factual findings based on the testimony and observation of witnesses are entitled to particular deference,united states morrison,cir,since assessing the credibility of witnesses is distinctly the province of the district court,united states beverly,cir.
our examination of the record leaves us with a firm conviction that no error was committed here.at the fatico hearing,edward vidal named more than five people who worked for cuevas.he testified that between and alone,the organization arranged for more than kilograms of cocaine to be shipped from miami to new york.vidal job was to distribute the cocaine to customers in new york when asked who provided the delivery instructions,vidal stated that cuevas told him how many kilos to deliver to each customer.vidal further testified that between the end of and the time of his arrest in,he picked up five or six shipments of cocaine,totaling more than kilograms.vidal stated that he attended some meetings at which the final large shipment of cocaine was discussed,but that cuevas was the one who actually negotiated the deal with the supplier.although vidal was not paid much for his work,at least not in cash,he testified that the one cash payment he did receive came from cuevas.
rafael duverge testified that he and cuevas were partners in the drug importation business,although they ran separate organizations.duverge stated that during the length of their partnership from to september,cuevas received approximately kilograms of cocaine from the supplier.duverge also confirmed that cuevas was the boss of his organization,which had multiple employees.duverge described conversations that he had with cuevas regarding the security of the locations where cuevas stored the drug proceeds,and noted that on one occasion,cuevas had money moved from one place to another to avoid apprehension.the above testimony,which the district court found credible,provided more than enough evidence to support its findings that the conspiracy involved the distribution of more than kilograms of cocaine,see a a,b,and that cuevas was a leader of the conspiracy,which involved five or more participants,see united states valdez,cir see also,cmt.
cuevas also argues that the district court erred in rejecting his application for downward departures on the bases of his family and medical circumstances.this argument is without merit.as was true when the guidelines were mandatory,we have held in the sentencing regime that a refusal to downwardly depart is generally not appealable,and that review of such a denial will be available only when a sentencing court misapprehended the scope of its authority to depart or the sentence was otherwise illegal.united states stinson,cir quoting united states valdez,cir citing united states gonzalez,cir stating rule.the district court here clearly understood that it had the authority to grant the requested departures,but decided not to depart in consideration of the particular circumstances of cuevas case.
finally,cuevas contends that the district court unconstitutionally prevented him from testifying in his own defense by refusing to adjourn the sentencing until the related indictment pending in the southern district of florida could be transferred,so that he might enter a guilty plea in that matter.we are unpersuaded by this argument cuevas was afforded the opportunity to testify on his behalf at the sentencing hearing,but after weighing the advantage of the privilege against against the advantage of putting forward his version of the facts,he opted not to do so.brown united states,d.we find no constitutional error in the district court decision not to adjourn the proceedings.united states maurer,cir per curiam the procedures used at sentencing are within the discretion of the district court so long as the defendant is given an adequate opportunity to present his position as to matters in dispute.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the district court judgment is affirmed with respect to the extradition issue and the guidelines calculations.we remand the case to the district court for reconsideration of its sentence in light of united states booker,d,and united states crosb
