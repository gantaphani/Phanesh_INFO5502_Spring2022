omar appeals his conviction and sentence for his role in two robberies interfering with interstate commerce in violation of a.we affirm.
rodríguez was charged with participating in two separate conspiracies to commit robbery.his indictment alleged that he and two cohorts,elin and samuel,conspired to rob,first,a bar and business in guayamo,puerto rico,and,second,a beer truck en route from san juan,in the spring and summer of.to provide the necessary context for rodríguez claims,we briefly survey the evidence adduced at trial.
in,rodríguez worked in guayamo,at a bakery across the street from a bar and business owned and operated by juan narbel.from the bakery,rodríguez had occasion to observe narbel arrive at his business every thursday morning carrying a satchel of money.rodríguez approached lugo and santos,two of his friends,about taking advantage of this opportunity to rob narbel.rodríguez offered to provide a mm pistol for use in the crime.
on the day of the robbery,santos and lugo drove together to the neighborhood where the bakery and business were located.santos was armed with the pistol rodríguez had given him.based on instructions from rodríguez,santos waited in the vehicle until narbel arrived.santos then entered the business and,in the course of wrestling the satchel away from narbel,shot him several times.santos and lugo fled the scene in their car.narbel died from his wounds.
santos and lugo met rodríguez at his home later that day,where santos returned the pistol to rodríguez.santos also gave rodríguez between and from the approximately in proceeds from the robbery.a few days later,rodríguez asked santos and lugo for additional money to buy the silence of one of rodríguez at the bakery,raul,whom rodríguez had told of the plan to rob narbel before it had been carried out and with whom he had discussed the crime afterwards.santos and lugo together gave rodríguez for this purpose,half of which he paid to.
santos and lugo saw each other often in the months following the robbery.on the morning of july,santos called lugo and asked him to go out with him for the day.santos then arrived at lugo house,driving a minivan with a mm pistol on one of the seats.santos told lugo that rodríguez was the source of the same one,in fact,used in robbing narbel.santos also told lugo that they were driving to san juan that day to steal a truckload of beer,which santos planned to sell for.lugo dropped santos off on the side of the expressway near salinas,puerto rico,to wait for the beer truck to pass.santos flagged down the truck while lugo continued ahead in the minivan,exited the expressway,and parked at a roadside stand.
lugo then followed the truck,now under santos control,to a vacant lot off the expressway,where the vehicles were joined by another minivan occupied by two men who had arranged to buy the stolen beer,known to lugo as ricky and colon.the trailer of beer was detached from the truck and left with ricky and colon,while lugo followed santos,still driving the truck,to a spot on the side of the road in aguirre,puerto rico.there,santos shot and killed the truck driver,josé,and abandoned the vehicle.later that day,santos and lugo went to salinas to meet ricky,who paid santos for the beer.rodríguez received as his share of the money.he later gave approximately to guillermo luis rigual almodovar,a rodríguez had enlisted in an apparently unsuccessful attempt to find a buyer for the beer,and with whom he had discussed his involvement in the robbery of narbel.
santos and lugo were indicted for their roles in the robberies in and,respectively.rodríguez,however,was not indicted until.at that point,both santos and lugo had already pleaded guilty and been sentenced,though santos had appealed his sentence and lugo case remained open pending his cooperation in the government prosecution of rodríguez.
before trial,rodríguez filed a motion seeking to compel,inter alia,discovery of the santos and lugo case files.rodríguez asserted that this material was exculpatory because of the passage of nearly three years between the indictments of his alleged and his own.though the motion was unopposed,the district court denied it except insofar as it sought information within the scope of giglio united states,d.the court had also previously ordered the disclosure of giglio material,together with a host of other discovery,as part of its scheduling order in the case.rodríguez sought reconsideration of the order denying his discovery motion,which was denied.
at trial,lugo served as the government key witness to rodríguez role in the robberies,although the jury also heard testimony on that subject from both and rigual.santos did not testify.the jury found rodríguez guilty on two counts of conspiring to commit robbery interfering with interstate commerce in violation of a.he was acquitted on charges of aiding and abetting those robberies and aiding and abetting the use of a firearm to commit them.the jury also completed special verdict forms,submitted in response to the supreme court decision in blakely washington,d,indicating their finding beyond a reasonable doubt that both narbel and,who died in the robberies,had suffered permanent or bodily aggravating factor under the sentencing guidelines.
prior to the submission of the case to the jury,the government had requested jury interrogatories on a number of other potential enhancements to rodríguez sentence under the guidelines,including whether murders had occurred during the course of the robberies.while the district court refused to ask the jury about these factors because they had not been charged in the indictment,it determined that the occurrence of bodily injury may reasonably be inferred from the charges and therefore permitted a special verdict form on that issue.
before rodríguez was sentenced,however,the supreme court issued its decision in united states booker,d,holding that the mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines was unconstitutional.taking account of the murders of the robbery victims,the presentence report set rodríguez base offense level at,using the guideline for murder,rather than robbery.see c id.a.while this calculation called for a life sentence under the guidelines,rodríguez faced a statutory maximum of twenty years on each count under a.
rodríguez objected on the theory that his sentence could not be increased based on the murders of the robbery victims because the jury had not made any findings in that regard.he argued for a sentence in accordance with the base offense level under the guidelines,elevated only by the fact,as found by the jury,that the victims had suffered serious or bodily injury.this calculation,adjusted for rodriguez conviction on multiple counts in accordance with,would have resulted in an offense level of,for a guidelines range of months.
the district court disagreed,reading booker to authorize a sentence within the range prescribed by a,fashioned with due regard for the sentencing factors enumerated in a.the court then sentenced rodríguez to the statutory maximum on each count,to be served consecutively,for a total of months.
rodríguez makes three claims of error.first,he argues that the district court wrongfully denied him discovery into the government files on his alleged.second,he asserts that the district court denied him a fair trial by unduly interfering in the proceedings.third,he challenges his sentence as imposed in violation of the due process and ex post facto clauses of the constitution and,in any event,unreasonable.as set forth below,we reject these contentions.
rodríguez claims that the district court refusal to compel the disclosure of his files deprived him of his rights under giglio and its progenitor,brady maryland,d.brady requires the prosecution,upon request,to produce material,exculpatory evidence,id.at,while giglio recognizes that this evidence often includes any understandings or agreements as to future prosecution between the government and one of its witnesses.at.brady does not,however,establish any general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case united states,cir quoting weatherford bursey,d.to establish a brady violation based on the denial of a discovery motion,a defendant must show prejudice,that he was deprived of material,exculpatory evidence as a result.see also united states,cir.
rodríguez has failed to make that showing here.he does not identify what he hoped to find in his files,or how it would have helped his defense.he argues,as he did below,that the passage of three years between the indictments of santos and lugo and his own,on charges arising out of the same robberies,suggests his innocence.but nothing within the files was necessary to develop this chronology of the prosecution was apparent from the dates of the indictments themselves.furthermore,santos was not called as a witness,and lugo was extensively on his failure to tell the authorities about rodríguez participation in the robberies until after receiving a lengthy sentence for his own role in them.counsel for rodríguez was therefore able to argue to the jury,as he did,that both of these facts served to weaken the government case.accordingly,rodríguez has not shown that access to the files would have meaningfully assisted his defense at trial see united states dumas,cir impeachment evidence,even that which tends to further undermine the credibility of the key government witness whose credibility has already been shaken due to extensive,does not create a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist where that evidence is cumulative or collateral.internal quotation marks omitted.
rodríguez further argues that the government failed to provide giglio material as to or rigual,despite the district court two orders to that effect.in support of this claim,he notes that and rigual were never prosecuted,even though each received money from one of the robberies.assuming that these facts suggest an agreement or understanding between the government and these witnesses both and rigual were effectively about taking the money but not getting charged.as above,then,the failure to provide giglio material for these witnesses,if any existed,did not prejudice rodríguez.
rodríguez also claims that the district court failed to conduct his trial in a fair and impartial manner.he asserts that the trial judge reprimanded his counsel,repeatedly interrupted his,unfavorably commented on his objections to the prosecutor questions,and made a series of unpredictable and adverse rulings on the propriety of various questions and evidence.rodríguez contrasts this rough treatment with the easy time the government had in putting on its case,arguing that it benefitted not only from a series of favorable rulings from the bench but also from the court helpful questioning of prosecution witnesses.rodríguez argues that the trial judge thus manifested a hostility toward him,and a corresponding affinity for the government,that influenced the jury to find him guilty.
we have observed that t rial judges are justifiably accorded broad latitude to ensure proper courtroom behavior.united states gomes,cir citing liteky united states,d.this latitude extends to the court questioning witnesses on its own behalf,logue dore,cir,and rebuking counsel for inappropriate behavior,united states,cir.but the judge participation must be balanced he can not become an advocate or otherwise use his judicial powers to advantage or disadvantage a party unfairly.logue,at.
rodríguez brief recounts dozens of instances,culled from the course of his trial,that in his view attest to the judge bias.in our view,however,these instances reflect,on the whole,legitimate efforts to clarify testimony,expedite the trial,and maintain courtroom decorum.logue,at.we must consider alleged examples of judicial bias in light of the entire transcript so as to guard against magnification on appeal of instances which were of little importance in their setting,at internal quotation marks omitted.rather than analyzing each of the numerous claimed instances of judicial bias separately,then,we will address them in summary fashion,explaining why we believe they do not amount to a due process violation,either individually or collectively.id.at logue,at.
at the outset,we consider rodríguez claim that the district judge favoritism came through in the high number of times she interrupted when counsel for rodríguez was examining a witness as compared to when the prosecutor was.the government takes issue with rodríguez tabulation,arguing that it experienced roughly as many interruptions as he did.assuming that a phenomenon as vaguely defined as interruptions can be accurately counted,we do not consider this sort of comparison to be any more reliable an indicator of a biased judge than the relative number of penalties called against each side in a hockey game indicates a biased referee.the record reveals that,when the district court intervened sua sponte during live testimony,she did so to clarify either a question from counsel or an answer from the witness.as we have noted,this is generally an appropriate role for the judge to play.logue,at.
in a similar vein,rodríguez identifies bias in a number of instances when the judge interceded to restrict his attorney.by and large,however,the district court did not rule certain topics out of bounds she merely instructed defense counsel to reformulate his inquiries so as to avoid potentially confusing responses.a trial judge retains wide latitude to impose reasonable limits on in order to avoid confusion united states mikutowicz,cir internal quotation marks omitted.the district court did not exceed its discretion in this regard.indeed,rodríguez trial called for particular vigilance from the court,involving,as it did,two different robberies and a number of different participants who had each been previously interviewed by different authorities at different times.the district court thus often interrupted both questions and answers to ask,for example,which robbery was being described,whom among the various men named during the trial was meant by he,or as on several of the occasions cited by rodríguez which of the witness prior statements was at issue.we do not see that as evidence of partiality.
rodríguez also takes exception to a number of times when the district court criticized his counsel for various aspects of his performance.in assessing such a claim,we must differentiate between expressions of impatience,annoyance or ire,on the one hand,and bias or partiality,on the other hand,at internal quotation marks omitted.we believe that the trial judge comments to rodríguez attorney fit squarely in the former category.the great majority were delivered outside the presence of the jury,and o n several occasions,this court has held that a trial judge frustration displayed at sidebar does not deprive a defendant of a fair trial.id.
while,in a few instances,the judge took an arguably harsh tone,we have found far sterner rebukes of counsel or litigants insufficient to demonstrate judicial bias.see,logue,at court called appellant lawyer smart little guy and,after close of evidence,called appellant an absolute and incorrigible liar deary city of gloucester,cir court referred to lawyer as very devious united states polito,cir court warned counsel he was being reported for violating rules of professional conduct.furthermore,the court reserved its most pointed reprimands for what,in an objective sense,was the most serious misconduct two occasions when defense counsel or his colleague was looking at the jurors in what the judge perceived as an inappropriate manner.the handling of those incidents strikes us as entirely defensible,if not outright necessary,and does not fairly suggest prejudice against rodríguez.see gomes,at noting that justifiable rebukes by judge offer less support to claim of bias.
the district court also showed exasperation with defense counsel in front of the jury from time to time.although comments made in the presence of the jury generally have a greater potential for unfairness,appellate courts can not expect that a trial judge,under siege,will function as a bloodless automaton.logue,at.generally,the district judge corrected rodríguez attorney before the jury only when he disregarded instr
