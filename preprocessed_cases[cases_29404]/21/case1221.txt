under c,a federal court may,in certain circumstances,reduce a defendant term of imprisonment because of amendments to the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines.this sentencing appeal concerns the application of section c in the unusual context of a combination of guidelines amendments,an amended statutory mandatory minimum,and a substantial assistance departure from a mandatory minimum authorized by e.the appeal presents three issues whether the defendant appellant is eligible for any section c reduction,whether a section e departure from a mandatory minimum displaces the mandatory minimum for purposes of guidelines calculations,and whether the reductions in mandatory minimums made by the fair sentencing act of,stat.the fsa or the act apply to a defendant sentenced before the effective date of the fsa whose sentence was reduced after that date pursuant to section c.
these issues arise on an appeal by defendant appellant matthew johnson from the may,order of the united states district court for the western district of new york william skretny,chief judge,granting his motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to section c.chief judge skretny reduced johnson sentence from months to months.johnson contends that the court calculation of the reduction was improper and should have resulted in a range of months.
we conclude that johnson was not eligible for a reduction under section c,that the mandatory minimum applicable to johnson has not been displaced,and that the fsa does not apply to johnson.in the absence of a by the government,we affirm.
background 
in may,johnson pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute grams or more of a substance containing cocaine base sometimes called crack cocaine.at the time,the statutory minimum sentence for this offense was ten years imprisonment.see b a iii.the plea agreement provided that the amount of cocaine base involved in johnson relevant conduct was between and grams.the agreement also provided that johnson would cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of others,and if the government was satisfied with his cooperation,it would move for a downward departure under e and 
in the presentence investigation report psr,the probation department determined that johnson base offense level was.see c.with a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see id.a,b,johnson adjusted offense level was.this adjusted offense level and a criminal history category chc of iii resulted in an advisory sentencing range of months.however,because the statutory minimum term of imprisonment was ten years,the probation department adjusted its recommended sentencing range to months,pursuant to c sentence may not be less than any statutorily required minimum sentence.
pursuant to the plea agreement,the government moved for a substantial assistance departure,specifically a reduction in the adjusted offense level from to,which,in chc iii,resulted in a sentencing range of months.the district court granted the government motion,accepted the suggestion that the departure for substantial assistance should be measured by offense levels,lowered the adjusted offense level from to,and,on september,sentenced johnson to months imprisonment,the low end of the range for level in chc iii johnson initial appeal,we held,was barred by the waiver contained in the plea agreement.see united states johnson,cir.
on august,the fsa took effect,reducing the mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine offenses and reducing the disparity between the penalties for cocaine base and powder cocaine offenses.the reduction was accomplished by raising the quantities of cocaine base required for various mandatory minimum sentences.for example,the fsa raised the minimum quantity of cocaine base requiring a minimum sentence from grams to grams,thereby making offenses like johnson,involving grams,subject to a minimum sentence.see,stat,a,codified at b b iii.the sentencing commission subsequently promulgated amendments to the guidelines to reduce base offense levels to conform to the new statutory minimums for cocaine base offenses.as relevant to johnson,the commission reduced the base offense level for grams of cocaine base from to.see,amend,third effective,promulgating temporary,emergency reductions,amend,first paragraph effective,repromulgating reductions as permanent.the commission then amended c to provide that portions of amendment,including those applicable to johnson,applied retroactively.see,amend,second paragraph effective.
in november,johnson moved for a sentence reduction pursuant to section c,relying on amendment.johnson argued that with his base offense level reduced from to,the district court should accord him the same five levels of reduction the court had originally made three levels for acceptance of responsibility plus two levels for substantial assistance,which would have lowered his adjusted offense level from to,with a new sentencing range,in chc iii,of to months.however,the commission has instructed that the relevant guideline range is to be derived from the offense level determined before a departure for substantial assistance.see,cmt.a.johnson offense level after the commission amendments would have been with a reduction for acceptance of responsibility but without the departure for substantial assistance,which,in chc iii,would have yielded a guideline range of months,but for application of the month mandatory minimum.
in response to johnson motion,the probation department prepared an abbreviated supplemental presentence report aspsr.the aspsr agreed that johnson new base offense level was and that,with a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,his adjusted offense level would have been,except for the effect of the mandatory minimum.the aspsr reasoned that johnson remained subject to the mandatory minimum of months,and that his adjusted offense level could therefore be no lower than because that is the lowest level,in chc iii,that yields a sentencing range to months that includes months the aspsr agreed that johnson was entitled to a comparable downward departure of two levels for substantial assistance,like the one he had received at the initial sentencing,apparently relying on b b,which provides that in the event of a government motion reflecting the defendant substantial assistance,a reduction comparably less than the amended guideline range may be appropriate.however,the aspsr recommended that these two levels be subtracted from level,instead of.the aspsr therefore recommended a adjusted offense level of,with a guideline range,in chc iii,of to months.
the district court agreed with the analysis in the aspsr,granted johnson section c motion,and reduced his sentence to months,the low end of the range for level in chc iii,but more than johnson would have received at level where the range in chc iii is to months had the two levels for substantial assistance been subtracted from level.
discussion 
although this court generally reviews a district court decision to grant or deny a section c motion for abuse of discretion,see united states borden,cir,the questions of law raised on this are reviewed de novo,see united states main,cir.
eligibility for section c relief 
section c provides 
where a defendant has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the sentencing commission pursuant to o,the court may reduce the term of imprisonment,after considering the factors set forth in section a to the extent that they are applicable,if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.
c emphasis added.the emphasized words raise an initial issue as to johnson eligibility for any section c relief whether johnson sentencing range was lowered.
was johnson sentencing range lowered 
in answering this question we are obliged to make a regrettably complicated analysis of the commission policy statements because the concluding words of section c state that a reduction must be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.the policy statement relevant to the lowerin
