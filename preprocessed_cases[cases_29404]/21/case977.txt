carlos humberto cabrera pleaded guilty to participating in a drug conspiracy and was sentenced to serve a incarcerative term.he did not appeal.subsequently,however,he moved to modify his sentence.the district court denied that motion and cabrera now invites us to reverse that ruling.we decline the invitation.
the historical facts are largely undisputed.agents of the drug enforcement administration apprehended and detained cabrera on november,after they caught him receiving a package of heroin at the luis muñoz marín international airport in carolina,puerto rico.to cut to the chase,cabrera eventually pleaded guilty to one count of a second superseding indictment charging conspiracy with intent to distribute between grams and one kilogram of heroin.see a,b b i.
the district court sentenced cabrera on october,the presentence investigation report recommended a base offense level of.see ussg c.with a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see id.a,his adjusted offense level was.because cabrera had no prior criminal record,the guideline sentencing range gsr was months.the district court sentenced him to the bottom of the applicable range.he did not seek,and the district court did not grant,a safety valve adjustment.see id.b,see also united states,cir explaining the operation of the safety valve.
although cabrera did not appeal from these sentencing determinations,he later discovered a typographical error in the final judgment which indicated that his crime was not completed until almost a year after his arrest.in view of this error,he moved to vacate the judgment pursuant to.on april,the district court granted the motion,vacated the judgment,and then reentered it with a corrected description of the offense.the sentence itself remained unchanged.
days later,cabrera moved to modify his sentence.the gravamen of the motion was his argument that amendment to the sentencing guidelines,effective november,applied retroactively to his case and authorized the court to reduce his sentence by utilizing the safety valve adjustment the government objected.in considering this motion,the district court did not address whether amendment applied retroactively or,indeed,whether it had any pertinence to cabrera case.instead,the court disposed of the motion on the ground that cabrera was ineligible for safety valve relief because of his managerial role in the offense of conviction.this appeal followed.
we are not committed to the district court reasoning,but,rather,may affirm its order on any independent ground made apparent by the record.intergen grina,cir united states nivica,cir.in this instance,we believe that the district court proceeded too hastily to the merits.there is a logically antecedent question involving the propriety vel non of cabrera motion.we turn to that question.
in his brief,cabrera classifies his motion as a motion to modify an imposed term of imprisonment.that taxonomy seems appropriate consequently,we inquire first whether cabrera situation fits within the narrow confines of the statutory provision governing motions to modify judgments in criminal cases,namely,c.
section c grants federal courts a limited power to modify criminal sentences in specific types of situations.the statute limns three areas in which such relief may be available.generally speaking,these areas are accessible if a defendant can show that i the requested change is expressly permitted either by statute or by rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure,ii the sentencing commission has revised the guidelines in a fashion that lowers the applicable gsr and clears the way for retroactive application of the revision,or iii certain extraordinary and compelling reasons exist that warrant a modification.this case does not implicate either the first or third areas,and cabrera advances no argumentation that touches upon them.therefore,we focus our attention on the second alternative.
the statute provides in pertinent part 
i n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the sentencing commission pursuant to o the court may reduce the term of imprisonment if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.
c.cabrera argues that,in enacting amendment,the sentencing commission effectively reduced the gsr applicable to his case and anticipated that the amendment would be applied retroactively.on this basis,he urges that section c authorizes reevaluation of his sentence.
we do not agree with this construct.by its terms,section c authorizes a reduction in sentence only if the reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.for present purposes,two policy statements are germane.
the first of these policy statements says that if a court applies an earlier edition of the guidelines manual,the court shall consider subsequent amendments,to the extent that such amendments are clarifying rather than substantive changes.ussg b.thus,clarifying that are purely be applied retroactively.see united states lacroix,cir isabel united states,cir see also david united states,cir.
though he does not fully brief the point,cabrera argues by implication that one portion of amendment that the safety valve is available regardless of whether there is a mandatory minimum sentence for the offense,see supra note clarifies the existing guideline.this is true as far as it goes indeed,the commentary to the amendment says this explicitly.see ussg supp.to app.c,amend,at.but that language can not be read in a vacuum.amendment also works a substantive change in the applicable guideline because its principal effect is to create a new offense level cap for safety valve purposes.see id.at.for that reason,the three courts that have passed upon the point including this court,albeit in a opinion have pronounced amendment to be substantive in nature.see united states,cir united states,cir per curiam united states smith,cir per curiam.
a guideline amendment is either substantive or it is not.this amendment is substantive.see cases supra see also united states descent,cir per curiam directing courts to look at the significance of the amendment as a whole.amendment is,therefore,not retroactive under the clarification doctrine.
this conclusion does not end our inquiry.the fact that a guideline amendment is substantive in character does not necessarily vitiate all hope that it may apply retroactively.see,desouza united states,cir per curiam united states havener,cir.a second policy statement explains that a substantive guideline amendment may be accorded retroactive effect if it is listed in ussg c.see ussg a see also united states sanchez,cir desouza,at.here,however,the sentencing commission did not see fit to include amendment in the section c list.thus,that policy statement closes the door on cabrera claim that the sentencing commission anticipated its retroactive application.as the commission itself has admonished if none of the amendments listed in subsection c is applicable,a reduction in the defendant term of imprisonment under c is not consistent with this policy statement and thus is not authorized.ussg a.for this reason,we agree with the second circuit that the sentencing commission decision not to list amendment which,as we have said,is substantive in ussg c deprives the amendment of any possible retroactive effect.united states garcia,cir per curiam.
we add a coda.based on the record before us,cabrera seems at all times to have satisfied the plain language of the safety valve guideline had he raised his claim of entitlement to the safety valve at sentencing and appealed a denial,he may well have succeeded in his quest.see,at.but cabrera never raised the point at the disposition hearing,and to make matters worse,he took no direct appeal from the imposition of the sentence.those defaults are insurmountable in this proceeding.after all,a motion to modify a sentence can not be used as a substitute for a direct appeal.united states,cir finding that a defendant improvidently brought a section claim and explaining that a n ar
