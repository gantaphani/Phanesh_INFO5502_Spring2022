police investigating a robbery obtained a recorded phone conversation between two suspects,shelton lewis and robert correa,that took place while correa was in detention at the plymouth county house of correction.before trial,lewis moved to suppress the recording on the ground that it had been intercepted in violation of title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of.the district court denied lewis motion,and a jury subsequently convicted him of being a felon in possession of a firearm,g,interference with commerce by robbery,a,and use of a firearm during a crime of violence,c.following the conviction,the court sentenced lewis to months in prison and months of supervised release.lewis now appeals both the denial of his suppression motion and his sentence.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm lewis conviction but remand for resentencing.
during the early morning of september,three men robbed the abington ale house grill in abington,massachusetts,at gunpoint.the following day,the police arrested robert correa in connection with the robbery and detained him at the plymouth county house of correction plymouth.on september,while still at plymouth,correa spoke to lewis by telephone.that call,like almost all calls made by plymouth inmates,was recorded.
the massachusetts department of corrections has authorized superintendents of its correction facilities to monitor and record inmate phone calls.tit,d.under this regulation,superintendents must develop procedures to ensure that inmates have access to telephones in a way that is both orderly and safe.id.plymouth procedure is known as the plymouth inmate telephone system policy.provides for the recording of all inmate phone calls,except those to clergy and attorneys.
inmates are informed in at least two ways that their calls are monitored.first,in order to place outgoing calls,inmates must obtain an inmate personal identification number ipin.doing so requires that they complete a form which includes the following notice your acceptance of the ipin and use of the inmate telephones will be deemed as consent to the conditions and restrictions placed upon inmate telephone calls,including call monitoring,recording,and call detail.inmates and the recipients of their calls are also informed that their calls are monitored at the beginning of every call,when they hear the following recorded message nynex has a collect call from name,an inmate at the plymouth county house of correction.to refuse this call,hang up all call detail and conversation,excluding approved attorney calls,will be recorded.to accept this call,dial one now.
the department of corrections regulations do not specify whether outside law enforcement officials may listen to recorded inmate phone calls without first obtaining a court order.however,plymouth policy states that c riminal justice agencies outside the plymouth county sheriff department are allowed access to recorded tapes within the scope of their legally authorized request court orders.random or general access to monitored telephone conversations are sic strictly prohibited.
at some point after september,massachusetts police officer john brooks and brockton police detective joseph cummings contacted plymouth telephone system administrator george pyne,asking to listen to correa outgoing calls.pyne acquiesced,listening to the calls for the first time as he played them for the officers.the parties have stipulated that the officers subsequently subpoenaed cassette copies of the calls based on that session with pyne.the government then sought to use one of the recorded calls at lewis trial.
on may,lewis moved to suppress the recorded call.he asserted that by allowing brooks and cummings to listen to the recording,pyne violated title iii of the omnibus crime control and safe streets act of title iii,relevant to this case,title iii prohibits the interception of telephone conversations,subject to certain exceptions,without a court order.wire or oral communications intercepted in violation of title iii are inadmissible as evidence in court.the district court denied lewis motion,concluding that the recorded call fell within two of title iii exceptions,the consent exception,c,and the law enforcement exception,a ii.see united states correa,d.
section c provides that,it shall not be unlawful for a person acting under color of law to intercept a wire,oral,or electronic communication,where one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception.lewis conceded that correa had given such consent,but argued that the exception was nonetheless inapplicable because the scope of correa consent was limited by the terms set forth in and the interception here violated those terms in two ways.first,lewis emphasized that authorizes call monitoring for internal security purposes,while here the monitoring was used for other investigative purposes.the court rejected this reasoning,noting that inmates are told merely that all calls will be monitored recorded.no indication of why the calls are recorded is given correa,d at.lewis also stressed that pyne violated the terms of by allowing outside law enforcement officers to listen to the tapes without first obtaining a court order.the court rejected this contention as well.although the court agreed that pyne had violated,it found that 
suppression does not necessarily follow.was established,as noted earlier,under the power given correction facility superintendents by.that regulation does not confer any procedural or substantive rights or any private cause of action not otherwise granted by state or federal law.in effect,this provision of the regulation tells defendants they must look elsewhere for a limitation on the scope of correa consent.
id.at.the court thus concluded that correa consented to a monitoring and recording system that was unqualified in all relevant aspects and that the recording was permissible under the consent exception.id.at.
the court then turned to title iii law enforcement exceptions,one related to interceptions and one to disclosure.for title iii purposes,a ii exempts from the definition of intercept a communication acquired by a device being used by an investigative or law enforcement officer in the ordinary course of his duties.a different exception,provides that 
any investigative or law enforcement officer who,by any means authorized by this chapter,has obtained knowledge of the contents of any wire,oral,or electronic communication,may disclose such contents to another investigative or law enforcement officer to the extent that such disclosure is appropriate to the proper performance of the official duties of the officer making or receiving the disclosure.
the statute defines i nvestigative or law enforcement officer to include any officer of a state or political subdivision thereof,who is empowered by law to conduct investigations of or to make arrests for offenses enumerated in this chapter.
the court analyzed the applicability of these exceptions under a test.first,it found that pyne was an investigative or law enforcement officer for purposes of the statute because prison officials must be deemed,at the least,to have authority to investigate potential criminal violations in the interest of prison security.correa,d at.second,the court reasoned that pyne recording was properly made in the ordinary course of his duties under a ii because it was done pursuant to and,and because correa was not personally targeted by the recording program.correa,d at.finally,the court concluded that having lawfully intercepted correa calls,pyne did not violate title iii by playing the tapes for brooks and cummings.id.the court opined that disclosure absent a court order was not appropriate to pyne official duties.id.at.but it emphasized that disclosure is also permissible under when it is appropriate to the duties of the receiving officer.here,it is beyond dispute that it was proper for brooks and cummings to obtain evidence against the two men by any lawful means.id.the court thus concluded that title iii did not prohibit use of the recorded conversation at trial,a ruling that lewis now challenges on appeal.
following a trial at which the prosecution played excerpts of the recorded conversation,a jury convicted lewis of all three counts on which he was indicted being a felon in possession of a firearm,g count i,interference with commerce by robbery,a count ii,and use of a firearm during a crime of violence,c count iii.the court then sentenced lewis to months in months for counts i and ii,followed by seven years for count months of supervised release.
we review the district court conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error.united states footman,cir.
title iii generally forbids interceptions of wire communications absent prior judicial authorization.gilday dubois,cir.the statute defines an intercept as the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any wire,electronic,or oral communication through the use of any electronic,mechanical,or other device.however,a ii creates a law enforcement exception to what constitutes an intercept.specifically,it defines the phrase electronic,mechanical,or other device to exclude equipment being used by an investigative or law enforcement officer in the ordinary course of his duties.a.in other words,the acquisition of the contents of a communication by an investigative or law enforcement officer in the ordinary course of his duties is not an interception for title iii purposes.see smith dep t of justice,united states van poyck,cir united states feekes,cir united states paul,cir.
our first question,then,is whether pyne is an investigative or law enforcement officer,which the statute defines as an officer empowered by law to conduct investigations of or to make arrests for offenses enumerated in this chapter.the district court found that pyne,as the telephone systems administrator and a prison employee,must be deemed,at the least,to have authority to investigate potential criminal violations in the interest of prison security.id.at.lewis challenges this conclusion,asserting that,under massachusetts law,corrections officers are not empowered to conduct investigations.
it is that federal corrections officers are investigative or law enforcement officers under title iii.see united states hammond,cir united states sababu,cir paul,at crooker united states dep t of justice.plymouth,however,is not a federal facility,but rather part of the massachusetts correctional system.thus,lewis correctly urges us to look to local law to determine whether pyne has the authority to conduct investigations or make arrests.
although there does not appear to be a statutory provision expressly endowing pyne with investigative authority,the plymouth phone monitoring policy,together with the laws and regulations that dictated its adoption,indicate that pyne has such authority.massachusetts law empowers the commissioner of correction to promulgate necessary rules and regulations incident to the performance of his duties.laws ch,q,which include maintain ing safety,security and order at all state correctional facilities.id.b.pursuant to this mandate,the commissioner promulgated regulations instructing prison superintendents to develop a policy for inmate telephone access whereby all calls are subject to monitoring.tit.plymouth phone monitoring policy,was adopted in accordance with those regulations.provides,in part,that whenever a significant occurs at plymouth,assault,disorder,employees authorized to utilize the inmate telephone system may review tape recordings of all telephone calls made from the incident site to determine applicable intelligence information.in other words,pyne,as an employee authorized to use the inmate telephone system,is empowered to assist with investigations into events occurring at plymouth.he is therefore an investigative or law enforcement officer.
lewis argument to the contrary rests on.laws ch,which provides that w henever the superintendent of a correctional institution determines that a felony has been committed therein,he shall forthwith notify the district attorney for the county.lewis reasons that this district attorney notification provision means that corrections officers do not have the power to conduct investigations of felonies occurring within the prison.this logic is flawed.while requires the superintendent to notify the district attorney of a felony,it does not preclude prison officials from investigating those felonies.indeed,common sense dictates otherwise.as another court aptly noted,i t is beyond question that as a part of managing and regulating the activities of a correctional institution,prison officials must be empowered to investigate potential criminal violations in order to preserve the security and orderly management of the institution.crooker.at see also gilday,at noting without comment that the united states district court for the district of massachusetts determined that massachusetts department of corrections officials fall within the title iii law enforcement exception breest dubois,wl.rptr.lexis,similar 
our inquiry does not,however,end here.the law enforcement interception exception only applies to contents of a communication acquired in the ordinary course of an officer duties.a ii.pyne acquired the contents of correa conversation when he recorded it whether monitoring or recording calls pursuant to an established prison policy could qualify as within the ordinary course of correctional officers business within the purview of a is a question which we had previously reserved for decision.campiti walonis,cir see also footman,at.we now join our sister circuits in answering this question in the affirmative in the circumstances of this case.see,smith,at van poyck,at but see united states amen,cir questioning,without deciding,whether monitoring inmate calls was within the ordinary course of prison officials duties.
this case thus differs markedly from the monitoring that we held was not part of the ordinary course of prison officials duties in campiti.see at.there,prison officials allowed an inmate to place a call specifically because they hoped to catch him making incriminating statements.rather than posting an official near the telephone to monitor the inmate end of the conversation,as was the normal practice,prison officials had an officer eavesdrop on the conversation by means of a phone extension.we concluded that this monitoring was not in the ordinary course of the officer duties,but rather an exceptional course of conduct for both the monitoring officer and the prison administration.id.at.here,by contrast,correa call to lewis was recorded in accordance with regulations set forth by the massachusetts department of corrections and plymouth internal policy.the recording therefore fits squarely within the case law applying the a ii law enforcement exception to recordings made by prison authorities who routinely monitor inmates conversations.smith,at.we agree with the district court that pyne recorded the calls in the ordinary course of his duties.
we emphasize the limits of this ruling.that an individual is an investigative or law enforcement officer does not mean that all investigative activity is in the ordinary course of his duties.indeed,the premise of title iii is that there is nothing ordinary about the use of a device to capture communications for investigative purposes.as one of our sister circuits has explained 
investigation is within the ordinary course of law enforcement,so if ordinary were read literally warrants would rarely if ever be required for electronic eavesdropping,which was surely not congress intent.since the purpose of title iii was primarily to regulate the use of wiretapping and other electronic surveillance for investigatory purposes,ordinary should not be read so broadly it is more reasonably interpreted to refer to routine noninvestigative recording of telephone conversations.
