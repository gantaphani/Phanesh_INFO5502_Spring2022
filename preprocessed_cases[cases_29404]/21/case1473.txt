we review the determination of the united states district court for the southern district of new york koeltl,that the government committed only a clerical error subject to correction at any time,see a,when it cited only the lower of the two applicable enhancements in the prior felony information served on defendant ramon morales before trial.we hold that a remand is required in order that the district court may determine whether morales was prejudiced by the government omission.
the federal narcotics laws require that the sentence for a defendant convicted of certain narcotics offenses be increased if the defendant has a prior felony narcotics conviction.in particular,b a generally provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for an offense involving one kilogram or more of heroin.however,if the defendant was previously convicted of a felony drug offense,the mandatory minimum is twenty years imprisonment.likewise,under b b,a defendant convicted of a narcotics offense involving grams or more of a substance containing heroin faces a mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment and a maximum sentence of forty years imprisonment,but if he or she has a prior felony drug conviction,the minimum is ten years and the maximum,life.as a condition precedent to the court imposition of an enhanced penalty under either of these subsections,the united states attorney to trial or and serve on the defendant an information stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.a see sapia united states,cir.if the government fails to timely file an information identifying the previous conviction s,only the lower penalty otherwise applicable may be imposed.united states labonte,d.however,c lerical mistakes can be corrected at any time prior to the imposition of sentence.a.
the government timely filed and served on defendant ramon morales a prior felony information accurately describing the prior offense on which it wished to rely.had the government gone no further,the district court would have been required to impose at least a sentence because section a does not require that the government identify the statutory section authorizing an enhanced penalty and assuming the proper filing and service of an accurate prior felony information,the trial court must impose the mandatory minimum.
however,the government went beyond accurately describing the prior felony and added potentially misleading information.after describing the qualifying prior felony conviction,the information continued a ccordingly,the defendant is subject to the enhanced penalties of title,united states code,sections a,b b,and.the indictment charging morales contained two counts a conspiracy count involving one kilogram or more of heroin and a substantive count involving grams or more of heroin.the reference to section b b clearly informed morales that the government would seek and the district court would be required to impose a sentence of at least ten years on the substantive count.morales contended at sentencing that he went to trial because he believed that the only mandatory minimum the government would seek was the ten years authorized by section b b this argument has some force because lack of an affirmative obligation to convey information does not necessarily excuse the giving of potentially misleading incomplete information.united states couto,cir holding that although we had previously held that an attorney failure to inform his or her client of the immigration consequences of a conviction was not ineffective assistance,actively misleading the client concerning these consequences was ineffective assistance.
nevertheless,because section does not require that a prior felony information identify the statutory basis of a proposed enhancement or its length,the government urged at sentencing that its mistake in identifying the relevant statute was at worst a clerical error,which it corrected in an amended prior felony information filed and served after morales conviction but before his sentencing.the district court agreed and sentenced morales to twenty years imprisonment.
two circuits have considered whether an omission that could lead the defendant to believe that the government is seeking a lower sentence than the one the government actually seeks requires a remedy at sentencing.the district court decision is consistent with the position of the fourth circuit.see united states campbell,cir.in campbell,the government filed and served a prior felony information citing only b c,which provides that repeat drug offenders shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than years.id.at.after conviction but before sentencing,the government realized its mistake and sought to amend the information to refer to section b b,which provides a mandatory minimum penalty of ten years imprisonment for repeat offenders.id.at.the district court allowed the amendment,and campbell appealed.id.at.finding that the purpose of section was to afford a defendant notice so that he or she can show that the enhancement does not apply,the fourth circuit held that the misstatement of the section imposing the enhanced penalty was a clerical one that could be corrected at any time before sentencing.id.at.the court also noted,however,that a t oral argument,campbell attorney conceded that his trial strategy would have been no different had the government pretrial information recited the correct.id.at.
the fifth circuit considered a similar error in a prior felony information to be potentially much more serious.see united states arnold,cir.in arnold,as in this case,the government timely filed and served a prior felony information informing the defendant,marcus arnold,that he was subject to enhancement pursuant to b b,which would have subjected arnold to a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment.id.at.prior to sentencing,but after trial,the government offered an amended information replacing section b b with section b a.id.because arnold had two prior felony convictions,he was subject to a mandatory minimum of life imprisonment under section b a.the fifth circuit held that one of the purposes of section requirement was to allow a defendant ample time to determine whether to enter a plea or go to trial and plan his trial strategy with full knowledge of the consequences of a potential guilty verdict.id.at quoting united states williams,cir.the court,therefore,remanded in order to determine whether the defendant had been prejudiced by the citation of the wrong statute.id.at,in particular,the district court was asked to determine whether arnold was aware before trial that a mandatory life sentence could be imposed upon his conviction and,if not,whether,in this particular case,such ignorance did in fact make any difference in the defense conduct respecting the case.id.at.
thus,both the fourth and fifth circuits were influenced by their conceptions of the purpose s of section a when they determined how to treat potentially misleading language in a prior felony information.we agree with the fifth circuit that section a has two purposes.in vadas united states,cir,we held 
section notice requirement reflects,essentially,two goals,first to allow the defendant to contest the accuracy of the information,and second to allow defendant to have ample time to determine whether to enter a plea or go to trial and plan his trial strategy with full knowledge of the consequences of a potential guilty verdict.
quoting williams,at cir 
because the vadas court did not explain its conclusion that one of the purposes of a prior felony information is to allow the defendant to knowledgeably prepare for trial or determine to plea bargain,we pause briefly to explain why that conclusion is sound.concededly,the most readily apparent purpose of section a is allowing the defendant to defend against the allegation that he has a prior felony drug conviction.this is so because the information required by the statute is the prior conviction.
however,the failure of section a to require the government to list the statutes that establish the enhanced penalty is
