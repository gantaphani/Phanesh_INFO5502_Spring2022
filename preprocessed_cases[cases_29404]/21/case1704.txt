defendant clarissa aspinall,who,following her plea of guilty,was convicted of credit card fraud in violation of and sentenced principally to a term of probation,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york,denny chin,judge,revoking her probation and sentencing her principally to a term of imprisonment.the district court found that aspinall had violated the terms of her probation by,inter alia,submitting fraudulent employment information to the united states probation department probation department or department and violating the conditions of her home confinement.on appeal,aspinall contends primarily that she a was denied due process and the right of confrontation by the admission of hearsay evidence at her probation revocation hearing,and b was denied due process by reason of an ex parte conversation between her probation officer and the district judge prior to that hearing.she also argues that the term of imprisonment was unreasonably long.finding no merit in any of her contentions,we affirm.
background 
following her plea of guilty to credit card fraud,aspinall was sentenced on august,principally to a term of probation,with a special condition of six months home confinement that permitted her to leave her residence during specified hours in connection with her employment.in order to permit probation department verification of aspinall compliance with the terms of her home confinement,aspinall was required,inter alia,to submit job descriptions,work itineraries,and employment contracts to the department.
in december,united states probation officer enid febus filed a petition with the district court for a warrant to initiate a probation violation proceeding against aspinall probation revocation petition or petition.the petition alleged that on or about november,aspinall had failed to submit a complete and truthful supervision report to the probation department and had in fact submitted a fraudulent report from approximately august through december,aspinall had failed to answer truthfully inquiries by febus regarding her employment and had in fact provided misleading information as to her employment and assets on or about december,aspinall had failed to comply with home confinement conditions on the same date aspinall had tampered with her electronic monitoring device,in an attempt to avoid detection of that noncompliance and from approximately october through november,aspinall had failed to submit employment verification documents.see probation revocation petition at.the petition described aspinall conduct during the four months in which she had been on probation see id.at and stated that aspinall had been uncooperative and defiant and that her actions of submitting false and misleading documentation indicates that she has possibly continued her involvement in illegal activity.her defiance with home confinement clearly demonstrates a disregard to sic the court and criminal justice system.id.at.the petition stated that chapter of the sentencing guidelines guidelines manual suggested a range of months imprisonment for such violations by a defendant such as aspinall but that,as that chapter expressed only policy statements,it was not binding on the district court the petition stated that under a,aspinall could be resentenced to,inter alia,the maximum term of imprisonment applicable to her offense.see petition at.
the warrant was issued,and an evidentiary hearing was convened on february.as detailed in part.below,before receiving any evidence at the hearing,the district court stated that it had received a visit that morning from febus with respect to a matter that was not a charge in the petition and which would not affect the court consideration of the charges in the petition.see revocation hearing transcript,february,tr,at.
a.the evidence at the revocation hearing 
at the probation revocation hearing,the government called febus as a witness and introduced a number of documents in support of the probation revocation charges.with respect to the first two charges,febus testified,inter alia,that aspinall had claimed in september to be that in november she stated that she was working as an employee of a company called shard consulting shard and that in december,aspinall stated that her employment with shard required her to commute to connecticut.in support of her claim to be employed by shard,aspinall submitted to febus pay stubs from shard handwritten,certified reports by aspinall see,government exhibit and a letter dated december,on shard consulting,llc.letterhead,signed by edna reeves,managing partner project leader,stating that,commencing december,aspinall would be required to perform her duties in stamford,connecticut government exhibit the shard letter.
febus testified that when she suggested in her december conversation with aspinall that febus would call shard to verify aspinall new assignment in connecticut see tr,aspinall said,do call them because they do know my status on probation.and if you do,they are going to fire me id.at.after that conversation,febus performed computerized database searches to determine whether there was any corporation called shard at main street,suite,brooklyn,new york,the address that was shown on the shard letter and that had previously been given for shard by aspinall in documents she submitted to the probation department and the department of justice.febus testified that her search turned up no company called shard at that address.accordingly,febus thereafter asked an fbi agent,whose other duties required a trip to brooklyn,to stop by this location and check if this company existed and if the company existed to determine whether what aspinall had submitted were true pay stubs.id.at.
febus testified that the fbi agent visited the purported shard address,found there only a small answering service,ai business services ai,and obtained from ai two documents identified at the hearing as government exhibits and 
q.did the fbi agent go to the address at main street,suite 
yes,they sic did,on december in the morning.
q.did you speak to the fbi agent after the fbi agent went to that address 
yes.she called me and she told me that she had been to the location,that there was not a company called shard consulting at the address or the room given,that it was an answering service.
q.what was the name of the answering service 
ai business services.
and did the fbi agent describe to you what suite looks like 
yes.she said it was a room that was not too big.it had about five representatives of ai that served as operators answering telephones with telephone equipment on a desk.
aside from visiting the location,did she do anything else at that location.
a.she returned after performing her other duties that day and they handed documents to her.
and what documents were they 
a.they were agreements that were completed by the probationer who would be paying for services to ai.
has the fbi agent provided you with copies of those documents 
a.she provided me with the originals.
what,if anything,did you learn from those documents about the relationship between shard consulting and ai business services 
tr.at this point,aspinall attorney objected 
baum attorney for aspinall your honor,i object to this testimony on several grounds.number one,it not demonstrated that kareese lindsay or even clarissa aspinall is the source of the information on these documents.
id.at see also id.at kareese lindsay was aspinall name prior to a september name change.defense counsel continued 
secondly,it hearsay.and while hearsay is permissible at probation hearings,they sic are permissible only where the government demonstrates that they sic are unable to get the original source before the court.
t here is nothing in this record,nor in the foundation now being laid to demonstrate that my client is the source of this information.so for the officer to tell the court that this is what the document says and it comes from my client has no basis in fact at this point.
there is an objection to the documents.this is the basis for my objection aside from hearsay.the objection to the documents is it is being offered to show that the information in the document comes from my client.it being offered for its truth.
although assistant united states attorney lai responded that the ai documents were not being offered for their truth tr,aspinall attorney continued with his hearsay objection and argued that the admission of the documents would violate the defendant constitutional right of confrontation id.the hearsay debate then continued,and defense counsel reiterated his contention that there was a foundation problem 
lai your honor,it is being offered for the falsity sic of the statements in paragraph of government exhibit and maybe also paragraph.
baum that the point.it is being offered for its truth sic and there is nothing to show that it comes from aspinall.we do even know if it was written by aspinall or under what circumstances it was filled out.we do know if it accurate or where the information comes from.
the court i have it.let see where we go t here is no jury here.so let us proceed and we will see what happens.i have to sort out exactly what it is being offered for,whether indeed it is being offered for the truth.if it is not being offered for the truth,then we do have a hearsay problem anyway.it not being offered for the truth in the sense that the government is not taking the position that the information in this document is truthful.that not the government position.the government position is that the information in the document is false.
the other question,though,is,where did this come from,who wrote it i do know that that a hearsay problem.
baum that a foundation problem because if they ca show it came from lindsay or aspinall,then why is it being offered what the relevancy 
the court it has her name in it.the question is,who would have submitted something to ai that said,please note,if anyone requests to verify clarissa aspinall,please make sure that the social security number is verified,et cetera,et cetera.who would have had incentive to write this information on this piece of paper and give it to ai i do think it a hearsay problem.i think it more what does it show.and i think i need to hear all the facts and circumstances.and i conclude whether it shows anything.let see what happens.
tr.ultimately,government exhibits and were admitted in evidence.see id.at.
government exhibit was an ai document bearing the heading customer service questionnaire and calling for details as to how the customer wished certain matters handled.question read,if you would like to provide employment verification services,please include employee name,dates employed,position with company,and salary,and question asked for any additional information that would assist ai in handling the account.government exhibit,at.the handwritten responses on exhibit included aspinall name,social security number,and the following instruction 
if anyone requests to verify clarissa aspinall,please make sure ss is verified,and let them know her hours of employment and that she is paid off the books and her hours are pm and on saturdays she does an unpaid internship.schwann mayer is her supervisor.
if anyone requests to speak with her,she is an external consultant that meets with various clients daily,request if want to leave a message or voicemail.
the ai document introduced as government exhibit was a handwritten memorandum from aspinall to debra re phone call yesterday,stating that t he company is shard consulting.attached is kareese authorization to use the card.please process asap.government exhibit,at.the attachment read,i,kareese lindsay,do hereby authorize clara aspinall to use my credit card on august,for charges by ai services,and it provided a credit card number,expiration date,and code.government exhibit,at.aspinall had been permitted to change her name from kareese lindsay pursuant to a order in september see defense exhibit a on the ground that she was a victim of domestic violence and sought to avoid detection by her child father see tr.the order authorized her to use the name clarissa janae aspinall,and no other name s.defense exhibit a,at.
febus received the ai documents on friday,december.see tr.on that day,the government applied for a search warrant for aspinall home,arnow avenue in the bronx.see id.at.in addition,early on monday,december,probation officers set up a surveillance of aspinall in light of her representations that she would be working in connecticut.see id.at.during the surveillance,the officers reported to their supervisor that aspinall seemed to be driving around new york randomly febus promptly called aspinall cell phone to ask about the location of her employment.see id.at.aspinall responded that she was on her way to her employment in connecticut however,as the surveillance team observed,she instead went home.see id.at.
the requested search warrant for aspinall home was issued,and was executed on december.among the documents seized was a payroll record generated by a company called paychex,addressed to shard at arnow avenue in the bronx,aspinall home.see id.at.that document,introduced as government exhibit,bore the legend kareese lindsay dba shard,revealing that shard was an for kareese lindsay,aspinall former name which aspinall had continued to use.see also defense exhibit c,an internal revenue service employer identification number cover sheet dated november,addressed to kareese lindsay for kareese lindsay dba shard consulting.
the shard payroll record listed as employees only aspinall,kareese lindsay,and alaisia aspinall daughter.government exhibit.edna reeves,signer of the shard letter as shard purported managing partner project leader,was not listed see tr.nor was any adult person listed other than aspinall.thus,despite the representation by aspinall that shard d id know her status on probation and would fire her if it found out id.at,the documents revealed that shard was aspinall own company.febus also testified that no documents were found indicating that shard itself ha d ever received payments for contract work to other companies.id.at.
as to the probation revocation petition charges that aspinall had violated the terms of her home confinement and had tampered with her electronic monitoring device in an attempt to avoid detection of that violation,febus testimony may be summarized briefly as follows.on december,aspinall was required to be in her home by no later than.at,the electronic device in aspinall residence was disconnected at,aspinall left the house.at,she returned,whereupon the unit was plugged in again.unbeknownst to aspinall,however,the device contained a battery that permitted it to continue functioning even after being unplugged thus,her absence from home was recorded.febus testified that aspinall,when first confronted about the unauthorized absence,repeatedly denied leaving her residence and denied any unplugging of the monitoring device she recanted those denials only after learning of the device battery backup system.thereafter,aspinall claimed that the device had been accidentally disconnected by her daughter.aspinall called her mother as a witness to testify to that effect at the hearing.
b.the decision of the district court 
in a decision announced from the bench at the end of the revocation hearing,the district court found aspinall guilty on the first four charges in the probation revocation petition.as to counts and,which alleged that aspinall had submitted false and misleading information to the probation department with regard to her employment,the court found that shard wa s an utter sham.tr.it found that edna reeves,the purported author of the shard letter,was nonexistent,that the shard letter was a fabrication,and that aspinall engaged in a scheme to fabricate documents and to create this fictitious employer.id.
the court also found aspinall guilty on counts and,to wit,that she had violated her home confinement conditions and had tampered with the electronic monitoring device in an effort to conceal that violation.see id.at.the court found aspinall not guilty on count,which charged that she had failed to submit required employment documents.the court reasoned that since shard was a sham,there were no authentic documents for aspinall to submit.see id.at.
after allowing a period for psychiatric evaluation of aspinall,the court sentenced her principally to a term of imprisonment,to be followed by two years of supervised release.the court stated that it was troubled by the fact that it had g i ve n aspinall a break by sentencing her to probation and that she had abused that status by f abricating documents,submitting fabricated documents to the court,and trying to commit a fraud on the probation department and the court.sentencing hearing transcript,may,at.in august,the district court denied a motion by aspinall for bail pending appeal.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,aspinall contends principally that the documents obtained from ai,as well as febus testimony relating to the fbi agent visits to ai,were improperly admitted in evidence at her revocation hearing and that the sentence imposed by the court was unreasonably long.she also contends that the ex parte prehearing communication between the court and febus violated her due process rights.we find no merit in any of her contentions.
a.the admission of the ai documents 
aspinall contends that the ai evidence constituted double hearsay from sources she was unable to and that the admission of the documents thus violated her rights of confrontation under the constitution and.b.although we agree that some of febus testimony with respect to the ai documents was hearsay,we see no basis for reversal,given,inter alia,the absence of any objection by aspinall in the district court to one level of hearsay,the nature and reliability of the hearsay evidence to which aspinall did object,and the inapplicability of the confrontation clause and the federal rules of evidence to probation revocation proceedings.and although a defendant threatened with probation revocation has rights to certain procedural protections under the due process clause and rule,we find no violation of those rights here.
the hearsay objection 
we begin by noting that part of febus testimony was indeed hearsay.febus testified that the fbi agent told her what ai indicated as to what instructions aspinall had given ai.thus,there are three levels of statements at issue.the first and second,what the fbi agent told febus and what ai communicated to the fbi agent,were,as will be discussed below,hearsay.the statements,however,the instructions written on the ai documents,were not hearsay for two reasons.the classic definition of hearsay is testimony as to an statement,offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted in that statement.see,mccormick,evidence,at ed.mccormick on evidence.c hearsay is a statement,other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing,offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.the ai documents were not offered for the truth of their contents but for the fact that the statements were made,that the services of ai were engaged exhibit and that ai was given instructions,as responses on its questionnaire form,on how to describe aspinall employment see exhibit indeed,the government argued that the contents of the responses to the ai questionnaire were false see,tr.accordingly,as they were not offered for their truth,the statements in the ai documents were not within the definition of hearsay.further,if those statements were made by aspinall,they would not be hearsay even if offered by the government for their truth,because a party own statement,offered against that party,is defined as not hearsay.d a.see also mccormick on evidence,at even if regarded as hearsay,statements of a party opponent are admissible without presentation of any predicate or foundation.
on the other hand,the testimony of febus as to statements made to her by the fbi agent was plainly hearsay.part of that testimony described the agent observations and matters within the agent own knowledge the layout of the premises at the address aspinall had given for shard,the observation that there was only a telephone answering service,not a consulting firm,operating there,and the fact that the agent was given two documents by ai.although on this appeal aspinall complains that the fbi agent was not produced at the hearing and hence could not be,aspinall made no objection to that part of febus testimony at the hearing.as revealed by the transcript passages set forth in part above,defense counsel did not object until febus,after giving the above testimony,was asked what the ai documents themselves showed with respect to aspinall see tr.and the objections focused solely on the source and import of the documents contents see,id.at.thus,aspinall present challenge to so much of febus testimony as described the fbi agent actions and observations is reviewable only for plain error,see.b.
a plain error is one that prejudicially affected the defendant substantial rights and seriously affect ed the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states olano,d internal quotation marks omitted see,united states gordon,cir,cert.denied,d.a challenge to the admission of evidence faces an uphill battle when the defendant has raised no question as to the information relevance or accuracy.united states szakacs,cir consideration of hearsay evidence at sentencing hearing held not plain error,in part because there was no indication nor even an assertion at sentencing or on appeal that the hearsay was in any way inaccurate or misleading,cert.denied,d.
aspinall present challenge to the admission of febus description of the fbi agent observations and receipt of documents from ai clearly fails the test.the lone presence of the ai answering service at the address aspinall had given for shard was relevant to the allegation that aspinall had lied to the probation department about her employment.the fbi agent obviously would have been competent to testify to her observations of those premises and,as the district court later noted,the layout of ai premises was neither hard to prove or disprove nor controversial bail hearing transcript,august,bail tr,at.further,there can be little question that the ai documents were given to the agent by ai.indeed,the substance of the hearsay testimony by febus has not been contested by aspinall in any way.the admission of febus unchallenged testimony as to the fbi agent observations and receipt of the documents from ai did not constitute plain error.
aspinall did,however,challenge the testimony by febus to the effect that ai had represented to the fbi agent that the instructions given in exhibits and came from aspinall.febus did not attempt to recount the precise conversations between the agent and would have made the hearsay nature of the information received from ai the record does not include the details of those conversations.however,it was established that the agent had gone to ai premises expressly to inquire about aspinall and shard ai giving the agent those two documents in response to the agent questions constituted a representation by ai that it had received the statements on those documents from aspinall,and as such,it was hearsay,for actions may be as much a part of the speaker effort at expression as his words are,mccormick on evidence,at see.a nonverbal conduct of a person,if it is intended by the person as an assertion,is a statement within the meaning of the hearsay rule stevenson commonwealth,where a police officer requested that the defendant wife give him the clothes the defendant had been wearing on the day of a certain homicide,the wife giving the officer a shirt constituted a nonverbal assertion that defendant wore that shirt on the day of that homicide.thus,ai giving the agent exhibits and in response to the agent inquiry is properly viewed as an assertion by ai that the source of the written statements on the documents was aspinall.
at the hearing,aspinall objected to that assertion as hearsay,stating,inter alia,that the admission of the documents would violate her constitutional right of confrontation tr.on this appeal,she argues that the admission of febus testimony as to ai representation that aspinall made the statements in exhibits and violated her rights of confrontation and,as recently enunciated by the supreme court in crawford washington,d,and as provided by the federal rules of criminal procedure.
the sixth amendment right of confrontation 
in crawford washington,the supreme court held that in the trial of a criminal case,an testimonial statement is prohibited by the sixth amendment confrontation clause unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant has,or previously had,an opportunity to him.see at.at.that clause,however,gives an accused the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him i n criminal prosecutions,const.amend.vi emphasis added,and it has long been established that p robation revocation,like parole revocation,is not a stage of a criminal prosecution,gagnon scarpelli,d see morrissey brewer,d revocation of parole is not part of a criminal prosecution.thus,in morrissey,the supreme court noted that although a parolee is entitled not to have his parole revoked without due process,id.at,the full panoply of rights due a defendant in a criminal prosecution does not apply to parole revocations,id.at.and in scarpelli,the court held that the same principles apply to proceedings for the revocation of probation,see at nn.nothing in crawford,which reviewed a criminal trial,purported to alter the standards set by or otherwise suggested that the confrontation clause principle enunciated in crawford is applicable to probation revocation proceedings.
criminal procedure rule b c and due process 
the federal rules of criminal procedure provide that,in a probation or revocation hearing,the defendant is entitled to an opportunity to question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.b c.aspinall,relying on this court decision in united states chin,cir per curiam chin,contends that this rule required the district court to balance the reason for the government failure to produce an ai witness against aspinall right of confrontation and that the court admission of the ai documents without such a balancing analysis and without even asking the government to explain that failure constituted per se error aspinall brief on appeal at.we find no basis for reversal.
chin dealt with a revocation proceeding in which the defendant was charged with violating the terms of his supervised release by committing an assault with a firearm.see at.see also united states jones,cir the constitutional guarantees governing revocation of parole or probation are identical to those applicable to revocation of supervised release united states sanchez,cir same.at the chin revocation hearing,the government did not produce the alleged victim of the assault rather,government witnesses testified that the victim had asked about the defendant release status,stating that she feared for her life,and they testified that numerous attempts had been made to locate the victim to have her testify at the hearing,but without success.see at.at that time,the pertinent subpart of rule provided simply that the defendant in a revocation proceeding shall be given the opportunity to question adverse witnesses.a d,without the qualification that appears in the current provision,to wit,unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.b c.the chin panel ruled,however,that the defendant right of confrontation wa s not absolute,at,and that the district court was required to balance the defendant right of confrontation with the government grounds for not allowing confrontation,and with the reliability of the evidence offered by the government,id.the court concluded that there had been no violation in the case before it because the district court had performed the balancing analysis.
though the chin opinion stated,without apparent limitation,that the court must conduct such a balancing analysis,we subsequently held in united states jones,jones,that that requirement is inapplicable where the statement falls within an established exception to the hearsay rule,see id.at.in jones,we noted that the statement proffered by the government at the revocation hearing was within the traditional hearsay exception for excited utterances,see,and we held that in that circumstance no balancing analysis and no explanation by the government for nonproduction of the declarant were required.at.we distinguished chin as follows 
the hearsay testimony offered in chin did not appear to fall within any exception to the hearsay rule neither was there any discussion in chin of the applicability of hearsay exceptions.see at.this is significant because it is well established that where the government seeks to introduce testimony under the excited utterance exception,and where that testimony is properly admitted by the district court,the government is under no constitutional obligation to explain the unavailability of the hearsay declarant consequently,chin requirement that the district court consider the government grounds for not allowing confrontation does not apply to the instant case.
jones,at emphasis added.thus,under jones,the balancing analysis need not be made where the proffered statement is admissible under an established exception to the hearsay rule.jones also noted that a statement r eliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,id.at quoting idaho wright,d,but that if further confirmation of reliability were needed at the jones hearing,it was reflected in the district court unimpeached view that the witness who testified to that statement had no reason to falsify the statement,jones,at.
the present case is more like jones than like chin,for the statements at issue in chin could not have been admitted under any traditional exception to the hearsay rule,whereas the documents at issue here are unquestionably ai business records.nonetheless,the present case differs from jones in that,here,the government did not proffer all of the foundation evidence necessary to have the ai documents admitted under the traditional exception for business records.under that exception,a business record is not excluded by the hearsay rule,even though the declarant is available as a witness,if it is a record of acts or events made at or near the time by,or from information transmitted by,a person with knowledge,if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity.
the federal rules of evidence,however,other than those governing privileges,do not apply to proceedings revoking probation.d.and although criminal procedure rule b c reflects one of the due process components enunciated in morrissey,the right to confront and adverse witnesses unless the hearing officer specifically finds good cause for not allowing confrontation,at,it is clear that rule b c also incorporates morrissey statement that in revocation proceedings the normal evidentiary constrictions should be relaxed 
the hearing required by the version of rule b c,which was then numbered a is not a formal trial the usual rules of evidence need not be applied.see morrissey brewer,supra the process should be flexible enough to consider evidence including letters,affidavits,and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial 
advisory committee note.similarly,in gagnon scarpelli,with respect to the probation revocation defendant due process rights to present witnesses and to confront and adverse witnesses,the court noted that 
w hile in some cases there is simply no adequate alternative to live testimony,we emphasize that we did not in morrissey intend to prohibit use where appropriate of the conventional substitutes for live testimony,including affidavits,depositions,and documentary evidence.
at.emphasis added.
although the government did not produce an ai employee to testify to the making or maintenance of exhibits and,the evidence in the present case was ample to permit the court to admit those documents under the more relaxed standard envisioned by morrissey and scarpelli,and hence by rule b c as well.first,there can be no question that those documents were ai business records ai was in the business exhibit was a customer service questionnaire on ai letterhead,asking,inter alia,how the customer wanted ai to answer calls and inquiries from the customer callers and exhibit authorized payment to ai for its services.nor can there be any question that the documents were maintained by ai febus testified without objection that the fbi agent was handed the documents by ai at ai offices.further,the record leaves little room for doubt that such records would normally be maintained by ai in the ordinary course of its business ai had employees answering five telephones,presumably indicating its service of numerous customers maintenance of records of each customer instructions in response to the questions would clearly be essential to ai operations.
finally,indicia of the reliability of ai assertion that the customer information in exhibits and had come from aspinall were supplied by two types of evidence.first,the documents were obtained not from some random location but rather from the very address that aspinall had represented both to the probation department see government exhibits aspinall monthly report and the shard letter and to the department of justice see government exhibit aspinall financial statement was the address of her employer,shard.
second,and more importantly,compelling evidence that the information in the ai documents had come from aspinall was provided by the confluence of two unusual facets of this case,namely that that information was handwritten and that there were indisputable samples of aspinall handwriting in the record.if the instructions on exhibit had been typewritten,for example,it would probably have been necessary for the government to produce an ai witness to provide a foundation for imputing those instructions to,to testify that aspinall herself had typed the instructions or that she had given the instructions to an ai employee who timely transcribed them or relayed them to another ai employee who did so.however,the instructions were in handwriting that matched the handwriting on exhibits and,which was undisputedly that of aspinall see bail tr,furnishing compelling circumstantial evidence that the source of the instructions on the ai documents was indeed aspinall.
given these circumstances and the extended colloquy between defense counsel and the court at the revocation hearing with regard to whether aspinall was the source of the instructions on the ai documents,and given the court observation that no person other than aspinall was shown to have any incentive for giving ai instructions on how to answer questions with respect to aspinall employment see tr,we conclude that the district court made the requisite determination that the interest of justice did not require the presence of an ai employee for admission of the ai documents.in light of this record,we can not conclude that the admission of the ai documents violated aspinall rights under the due process clause or rule b c.
in any event,a district court failure to comply with the requirement of rule b c and morrissey scarpelli is subject to analysis.see,united states redd,cir court of appeals,itself engaging in a balancing analysis and making an determination with respect to laboratory reports,concluded that the district court failure to do so was harmless error united states comito,cir conducting analysis,but finding that district court failure to conduct the balancing analysis was not harmless where the oral statement was accusatory,did not fall within a recognized hearsay exception,and was of questionable reliability,and the nonhearsay evidence was insufficient.see also.b c advisory committee note citing,inter alia,comito with respect to the need for a balancing analysis.
to the extent that the rule or due process required a more explicit analysis or statement than is reflected by the record of the proceedings in the present case,we conclude that any error was,for two reasons,entirely harmless.first,the strong evidence,discussed above,of the reliability of the ai documents as reflecting statements made by aspinall easily outweighed aspinall interest in an ai employee,given,inter alia,that the ai documents are not accusatory,that ai had no apparent reason to fabricate instructions from aspinall,and that no reason has been suggested why anyone else would have had an incentive to give ai instructions on how to answer questions with respect to aspinall employment.second,any error was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence supporting the court findings of aspinall guilt even without consideration of the ai documents.plainly those documents had no bearing on the charges that aspinall disregarded her home confinement schedule and tampered with her monitoring device.and as to the charges that aspinall had provided fraudulent information to the probation department with regard to her employment,the documents and the testimony of febus showed,inter alia,that the ai address aspinall repeatedly gave the government for shard was at the very least misleading that edna reeves,managing partner of shard,who purportedly signed the shard letter stating that aspinall would be working in connecticut,was a fiction that aspinall falsely reported that she was on her way to connecticut on an occasion when surveillance revealed that she was instead going home that aspinall sought to forestall an attempt by febus to verify the shard letter statements by falsely representing to febus that shard did not know aspinall was on probation,when in fact shard only adult employee was aspinall and that aspinall professed fear that she would be fired if the fact that she was on probation were disclosed to,her own clearly fraudulent.
in sum,the admission of the ai documents provides no basis for reversal.
b.the district court ex parte conversation with febus 
aspinall also contends that the conversation between the district judge and febus prior to the probation revocation hearing affected the court sentencing decision see,aspinall brief on appeal at and so tainted the proceedings that it violated aspinall due process rights,requiring a new hearing id.at.the record does not support this contention.
at the start of the probation revocation hearing,the district judge informed the parties of information he had received from febus earlier that morning.the court stated that 
the probation officer visited me this morning.i think probation is technically an arm of the court.i do know whether it constitutes an ex parte conversation in the usual sense or not.but i put on the record exactly what the conversation was.
febus played for me a recording that is on a cell phone that was seized from aspinall apartment search.it was seized from the defendant as part of the search.and somehow there is recorded what sounds like a beating or a spanking of a child which goes on for a long time with what sounds like repeated slaps and a child crying for a long time.i do know if the issue is going to come up today.i do think it bears directly on the particular violations.but i thought that counsel ought to know about it.if defense counsel wants to listen to it at some point,it will be made available.
tr.see also id.at again inviting counsel to listen to the cell phone voicemail recording if he wished.
