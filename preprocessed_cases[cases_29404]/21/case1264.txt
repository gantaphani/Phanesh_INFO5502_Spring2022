devon robinson appeals from the january,judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york john gleeson,judge,convicting him,following a jury trial,on two counts of sex trafficking of a minor in violation of.on an issue of first impression,we consider the appropriate construction of c,an evidentiary provision added by the william wilberforce trafficking victims protection reauthorization act of tvpra,stat,which provides that i n a prosecution in which the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim,the government need not prove that the defendant knew that the person had not attained the age of years.c supp.ii.we hold that this provision,when applicable,imposes strict liability with regard to the defendant awareness of the victim age,thus relieving the government usual burden to prove knowledge or reckless disregard of the victim underage status under a.we reject robinson remaining evidentiary and sentencing challenges as lacking merit,and therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
on april,a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging devon robinson with three counts of child sex trafficking in violation of.two counts proceeded to trial,both relating to a single minor victim,jane doe,who was born on april.these two counts corresponded to the two versions of in effect when robinson is alleged to have trafficked jane doe.count one,as renumbered at trial charged sex trafficking of a minor under the amended version of and covered the period from december,when the amendments took effect,through april,when jane doe turned eighteen count two charged sex trafficking of a minor under the preceding version of a and covered the period from january,through december,
a.the trial 
a jury trial commenced before judge gleeson in the eastern district of new york on june.during trial,the government called jane doe who at that time was nineteen years old to testify.after she invoked the fifth amendment protection against and was granted immunity,the government received permission to treat her as a hostile witness.she testified that she had run away from home on several occasions in her early teenage years,and had dropped out of high school at the age of seventeen.while in high school,jane doe began to work as an exotic dancer at a strip club and as a prostitute.she was arrested several times for and convicted of prostitution in queens,new york,in and.jane doe testified that she met robinson through his sister two and a half years prior to the trial and started dating him when she was seventeen.she also testified that she told everybody that she was nineteen at the time.throughout the trial,jane doe insisted that robinson was her boyfriend rather than her pimp,and that he was only living off of her income as a prostitute rather than facilitating that line of work.
the balance of the evidence against robinson consisted primarily of recorded statements.on july,robinson made a videotaped statement to a detective and an assistant district attorney ada in the queens county district attorney office,in which he admitted that he had been staying with his girlfriend jane doe at the courtesy hotel in hempstead,new york,for about three months and that jane doe paid for their room.the videotaped statement included the following exchange 
ada you got ta,the obvious thing is you got to be real with us.
dr but i ai gon na say i a pimp though.but you know.
ada you watch out for them and they give you money.
dr they take care of me.word.

dr exactly.tried to do something else.and awright sic,it worked for a little while.
gov t app x.the prosecution also introduced recorded telephone calls that robinson made from various detention facilities between july,and april.as demonstrated in the following excerpts,robinson repeatedly implored jane doe to make money for him 
september,you gon na make that bread tonight,right baby so you gon na make daddy happy when i call you in the morning id.at.

in other conversations,robinson threatened jane doe when she failed to deliver the money

robinson kill your a.
jane doe did you use to say till death do us part what does that mean you gon na kill me before i leave right 
robinson yeap,kill you.id.at.
during other phone calls,robinson discussed women named angie and creame.for instance,in an october,call,robinson told his cousin,tykim,that when he got out of jail,creame is back in my possession.robinson also said that he spoke to creame and that she was ready to come back to her n er and that robinson told her just stay where you at though right now man i be home soon man.you coming back to a pimp.id.at.
b.the verdict and sentence 
on june,the jury returned a guilty verdict on both counts of sex trafficking of a minor in violation of.the jury also found by special verdict that robinson knew that jane doe was under the age of eighteen,recklessly disregarded that fact,and that he had a reasonable opportunity to observe jane doe.
on january,robinson was sentenced principally to months of imprisonment on each count,to run concurrently,followed by five years of supervised release.judgment was entered on january.this appeal followed.
discussion 
section was first enacted as part of the trafficking victims protection act of tvpa,stat,the stated purpose of which was to combat trafficking in persons,a contemporary manifestation of slavery whose victims are predominantly women and children,to ensure just and effective punishment of traffickers,and to protect their victims.a.the tvpa defined as severe forms of trafficking in persons the two forms of sex trafficking proscribed by sex trafficking involving a commercial sex act induced by force,fraud,or coercion,or in which the person induced to perform the sex act was under the age of eighteen.id.a.under the tvpa,a conviction for child sex trafficking under required proof,inter alia,that the defendant acted knowing that the person has not attained the age of years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act a emphasis supplied.
section was amended by the william wilberforce trafficking victims protection reauthorization act of t vpra,stat.which took effect on december,under the amended version of,a defendant could be convicted of child sex trafficking upon a showing,inter alia,that he acted knowing,or in reckless disregard of the fact that the person has not attained the age of years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act.a supp.ii emphasis supplied.the tvpra also added a new subsection c,which provides as follows 
in a prosecution under subsection a in which the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the person so recruited,enticed,harbored,transported,provided,obtained or maintained,the government need not prove that the defendant knew that the person had not attained the age of years.
id.c supp.ii.the proper construction of the new c is an issue of first impression in our circuit.
as noted above,count one charged robinson with sex trafficking of a minor,in violation of the amended version of,while count two charged him with sex trafficking of a minor,in violation of the previous version of.on appeal,robinson primarily contests his knowledge or reckless disregard of jane doe status as a minor.specifically,robinson argues that his conviction should be reversed because the district court erred by instructing the jury that he could be convicted upon a showing that he had a reasonable opportunity to observe jane doe,and evidence was insufficient to prove that he knew or recklessly disregarded that jane doe was a minor.robinson also argues that the district court erred by admitting certain recorded telephone calls,and that his sentence of months was procedurally unreasonable.we address these arguments in turn.
a.the jury instructions on count one 
robinson challenges the jury instructions on count one,which charged him with sex trafficking of a minor,in violation of the amended version of.robinson argument focuses on the statute mens rea requirement with regard to his awareness that jane doe was a minor.the district court charged the jury,in relevant part,that t o prove count one,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew that jane doe had not attained the age of eighteen years,or he recklessly disregarded that fact,or he had a reasonable opportunity to observe jane doe.joint app x.in other words,the district court identified three independent ways of proving criminal liability with respect to robinson awareness of jane doe status as a minor he knew that she was under eighteen,he recklessly disregarded the fact that she was under eighteen,or he had a reasonable opportunity to observe her.
on appeal,where our review of jury instructions for legal error is de novo,united states kozeny,cir,the parties present two widely divergent interpretations of the statute.robinson argues that c is a conjunctive requirement,meaning the government must prove both that he had a reasonable opportunity to observe jane doe and that he recklessly disregarded her age.in support of this view,he cites the only federal decision addressing this question.see united states wilson,cr,wl.july,report and recommendation adopted by wl.in wilson,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation,which stated that where the government elects to proceed under the reckless disregard level of mens rea,section c requires the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the defendant acted in reckless disregard of the victim status as a minor,but also that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the person recruited.id.at.
by contrast,the government defends the district court instructions,arguing that the word knew in c refers to knowledge and reckless disregard,thus creating a freestanding alternative to proving either of the mens rea alternatives in a.see gov t br.the district court correctly read c to mean that the government need not prove the knowledge element whether under a knowing or reckless disregard standard in cases where the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim.emphasis in original.
robinson responds to the government interpretation by pointing out that the amended version of a requires the government to prove know ledge or reckless disregard,whereas c mentions only that in certain circumstances the government need not prove that the defendant knew that the victim was a minor.compare a supp.ii defendant must have acted knowing,or in reckless disregard of the fact,that the person has not attained the age of years,with id.c supp.ii in certain circumstances,the government need not prove that the defendant knew that the person had not attained the age of years.based on this discrepancy,robinson frames the government argument as an unwarranted effort to insert language into a statute in the interest of achieving symmetry.appellant br.see also duncan walker,d w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.quotation marks omitted.
we must begin,of course,with the plain language of the statute,and our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.schindler elevator united states ex rel.kirk,d alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil,d.in interpreting the statute at issue,we consider not only the bare meaning of the critical word or phrase but also its placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.holloway united states,d alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.or,as justice scalia observed in another context,the words of a statute are not to be read in isolation statutory interpretation is a holistic endeavor.regions hosp.shalala,d scalia,dissenting quoting united sav.of timbers of inwood forest,d.
robinson interpretation is mistaken.the text and structure of the statute do not indicate that c imposes an additional element on top of the mens rea requirement in a.quite to the contrary,c states what the government need not prove.c supp.ii emphasis supplied.
the better reading of c is that the government may prove that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to view the victim in lieu of proving knowledge.in relevant part,c reads where the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim,the government need not prove that the defendant knew that the person had not attained the age of years.id.viewed in context,the most natural reading of this provision is that proof that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim may substitute for proof that the defendant knew the victim underage status.because a requires proof of knowledge or reckless disregard not both the government may satisfy its burden by proving knowledge or the substitute for knowledge under c.accordingly,c supplies an alternative to proving any mens rea with regard to the defendant awareness of the victim age.this reading gives force to the provision obvious goal to reduce the government burden where the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim.
this commonsensical understanding of c also vindicates the cardinal rule that,if possible,effect shall be given to every clause and part of a statute.radlax gateway hotel,llc amalgamated bank,d quotation marks omitted see also duncan,at it is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute.quotation marks omitted.if robinson were correct that c use of the word knew did not remove the usual mens rea requirement,then c would add nothing to the statute.that is because by including reckless disregard as one of the mens rea options,a already provides that a defendant may be proved guilty without having known that the victim was a minor.in sum,the plain reading of c,and the only interpretation that preserves any meaning,is that the provision creates strict liability where the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim.accordingly,just as the district court instructed,a and c provide the government with three distinct options prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had knowledge of the victim underage status that the defendant recklessly disregarded that fact or that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim.
we are mindful that criminal statutes are generally construed to include mens rea requirements.see staples united states,d united states gypsum,d.but that presumption does not apply to sex crimes against minors,see morissette united states,at least when the perpetrator confronts the underage victim personally,united states x citement video,d moreover,the presumption applies when someone engages in otherwise innocent conduct,including constitutionally protected conduct,id.at,and thus has little purchase for robinson,who was engaged in sex trafficking.see united states griffith,cir a defendant is already on notice that he is committing a crime when he transports an individual of any age in interstate commerce for the purpose of prostitution.see also x citement video,at criminal intent serves to separate those who understand the wrongful nature of their act from those who do not,but does not require knowledge of the precise consequences that may flow from that act once aware that the act is wrongful,united states feola,d holding that to effectuate the congressional purpose of according maximum protection to federal officers,a federal criminal statute punishing assaults against federal officers can not be construed as embodying an unexpressed requirement that an assailant be aware that his victim is a federal officer.
our interpretation of c also maintains uniformity with the other federal statutes that use nearly identical language and that have been interpreted to lack mens rea requirements with respect to the victim age.united states jennings,cir.for example,in and two provisions that punish sexual abuse of children congress drafted subsections labeled s tate of mind proof requirement,which explain that the government need not prove that the defendant knew the victim was a minor.d,d courts have uniformly interpreted these provisions as disclaiming mens rea requirements with respect to the victim age.see,united states white calf,cir addressing d united states ransom,cir addressing d see also jennings,at addressing both sections and applying the same principle to united states juvenile male,cir addressing c.moreover,one of these provisions d evidently was the template for c having used identical language,congress obviously intended the same principle to apply with respect to c,thus making the defendant awareness of the victim age irrelevant when the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim.
finally,we note that c drafting history further supports our textual analysis.the legislative reform that culminated in the adoption of c in the amendments began in the house of representatives with a bill that would have left knowledge as the only mental state referenced in a but would have added the following provision in a prosecution under this subsection,the government need not prove that the defendant knew that the person had not attained the age of years,cong.as passed by.the house bill thus proposed made the trafficking of minors into a crime with respect to a defendant awareness of the victim age,even if the defendant never observed the victim.the members of the senate judiciary committee apparently disfavored this option and instead reported a bill adding or in reckless disregard to the mens rea requirement in a,cong.as reported by comm.on the judiciary.the house then responded by passing another bill,this time keeping the proposed mens rea language from the reported senate bill but adding the provision that now appears in c providing that when the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim,the government need not prove that the defendant knew that the person had not attained the age of years,cong.as passed by.this drafting history helps clarify what is already apparent when reading in its entirety the government need not prove any mens rea with regard to the defendant awareness of the victim age if the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim.
given this holding,we conclude that the district court did not err in giving the jury instruction.in a prosecution under,the government may satisfy its burden of proof with respect to the defendant awareness of the victim age by proving any of the following beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant knew that the victim was under eighteen,the defendant recklessly disregarded the fact that the victim was under eighteen,or the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to observe the victim 
b.the sufficiency challenge 
robinson raises sufficiency challenges on counts one and two,arguing that the government failed to present sufficient evidence that he either knew or recklessly disregarded jane doe minor status.when reviewing a sufficiency challenge,we will uphold the judgments of conviction if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.as we have often stated,this standard is exceedingly deferential,to the jury role as factfinder.united states hassan,cir.in considering such a challenge,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,crediting every inference that could have been drawn in the government favor,and deferring to the jury assessment of witness credibility,and its assessment of the weight of the evidence.united states chavez,cir internal citations,alterations,and internal quotation marks omitted.
robinson primarily argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove his knowledge or reckless disregard of jane doe status as a minor because jane doe testified repeatedly that she told robinson,his family,and everybody she was nineteen.when she was arrested for prostitution,jane doe also told the police she was nineteen the police were able to determine her true age only by producing her arrest record or rap sheet.robinson also cites the testimony of donald smith,who worked at a hotel frequented by robinson and jane doe,and who testified that an african american female staying with robinson appeared to be maybe,years old 
the government responds by pointing out that robinson reasonable opportunity to observe jane doe was a highly relevant circumstance from which an inference of knowledge or reckless disregard can be drawn.gov t br.for example,in a call recorded on january,when jane doe was eighteen years old,jane doe stated that she and robinson had been together every weekend for like three years.in another conversation,robinson and jane doe discussed her birthday.the government argues that even if people who interacted with jane doe on a or casual basis could be deceived about her age,it would strain credulity to suggest that someone who had known her as long and as intimately as robinson would not have learned her true age.gov t br.finally,the jury had an opportunity to observe jane doe testify at trial,when she was nineteen years old,and also to view several photographs of jane doe taken before she turned eighteen.the government concludes that it was well within the province of the jury to find that jane doe appearance and demeanor were such that her status as a minority would have been obvious to someone intimately involved in her life.
viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,see evans united states,d,we conclude that the record supports the jury finding of guilt on counts one and two.with regard to count one,it is uncontested that robinson had a reasonable opportunity to observe jane doe when he was causing her to engage in commercial sex acts as a minor,and,as explained above,that showing satisfies the government burden under the amended statute.see c supp.ii.therefore,we reject robinson sufficiency argument with respect to count one.and,even if we disregarded c,the jury still had sufficient evidence under the amended version of a to render its special verdict with respect to robinson reckless disregard of jane doe status as a minor.a reasonable jury could conclude that robinson ability to personally observe his underage victim,especially given their intimate relationship,put him on notice of an unjustifiably high risk that she was underage.see note,ante.
for the same reasons,a reasonable jury also could conclude,both with respect to the count one time period and the
