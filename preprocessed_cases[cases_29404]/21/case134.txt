héctor santiago was charged in a criminal indictment alleging bank robbery in violation of a,d count one,and use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,in violation of c a ii count two.following trial,the jury returned a guilty verdict against santiago on both counts.the district court sentenced santiago to months imprisonment as to count one and months imprisonment as to count two,to be served consecutively for a total of months.santiago now appeals,claiming ineffective assistance of counsel.he also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to convict him as well as the reasonableness of the district court imposed sentence as to count one.
for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment below,without prejudice,however,to appellant right to raise his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a relief proceeding brought pursuant to.
on august,an armed assailant entered the banco popular branch in morovis,puerto rico.upon entering the bank,the assailant covered his face with a mask and told bank teller lilia,at gunpoint,to fill a white plastic bag with money.complied with the assailant instructions,but she also placed two red security dye packs inside the plastic bag.the bank robbery was captured by the bank video surveillance equipment.
after the assailant left the bank,agent orlando agent guzmán,an puerto rico police department prpd officer who was at the bank at the time of the robbery,ran after santiago and unsuccessfully attempted to detain the assailant.at trial,agent guzmán testified that he observed the assailant remove his mask as he exited the bank and get in the driver side of a dark brown nissan pathfinder.
on august,officer carlos officer gonzález,an investigating agent and crime scene technician with the prpd bank robbery division,received an anonymous tip concerning a different bank robbery at citifinancial in orocovis,puerto rico.the record is not developed as to the precise nature of the information provided by the anonymous tipster.however,officer gonzález testified that the tipster told him about a man known as bartolo,who owned a dark burgundy or brown colored nissan pathfinder and a white honda accord.officer gonzález also testified that he confirmed that santiago was known as bartolo.
the next day,officers gonzález and joel officer rodríguez went to santiago address to corroborate the information provided by the tipster.after remaining in the area for several hours,the officers observed santiago arrive in a white honda accord.at this juncture,the officers decided to request assistance from a patrol car so that officer rodríguez could approach the residence under the pretext of investigating a domestic disturbance call 
when he arrived at the residence,officer rodríguez was met by julio julio santiago,santiago brother,and gladys,santiago mother,who told the officer that her other son was taking a bath.
officer rodríguez requested that santiago come out of the home when he was finished.when santiago came outside,he provided officer rodríguez with identification and was placed under arrest for bank robbery.officer rodríguez advised santiago of his rights in accordance with miranda arizona.after reading santiago his rights,officer rodríguez asked santiago if he had the weapon or money connected to the bank robbery.santiago stated that he had disposed of the gun,but reported that he had money inside the house.santiago added that the money was damaged because it was stained red.
santiago,julio santiago,and signed a consent form authorizing a search of the residence.santiago then led officer gonzález to his bedroom and showed him where he had stored money obtained during the robbery,which exhibited red stains and exuded a strong pepper gas odor.santiago told officer gonzález that he also stored money from the robbery inside the honda accord further,he told officer gonzález that he had utilized the nissan pathfinder to commit the bank robbery.
the owner of the nissan pathfinder,signed a second consent form authorizing the search of her nissan pathfinder,which revealed that the passenger seat was stained red.similarly,santiago signed a consent form authorizing the search of the honda accord,yielding additional money that was stained red.
subsequently,officers rodríguez and gonzález transported santiago to the police station.as they were driving,santiago,without prompting,told the officers that he was repentant.the next day,santiago,who was still under arrest,told officer rodríguez that he wanted to apologize for the bank robbery.officer rodríguez provided santiago with additional miranda warnings,after which he provided santiago with a pen and a piece of paper.santiago then wrote a note asking forgiveness for committing the banco popular robbery in morovis.that same day,agent guzmán identified santiago as the person who robbed the banco popular in morovis on august,during an lineup 
appellate courts are usually to handle the inquiry required by ineffective assistance of counsel claims.united states rodríguez,cir.quoting united states ofray campos,cir.as a result,w e have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that ineffective assistance of counsel claims,which require a showing of deficient attorney performance and prejudice to the defendant,must originally be presented to,and acted upon by,the trial court.id.quoting united states mala,cir.further,the insights of the trier,who has seen and heard the witnesses at first hand and watched the dynamics of the trial unfold,are often of great assistance.id.at quoting united states moran,cir.accordingly,only in exceptional cases where there are no critical facts in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed will we entertain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal.ofray campos,at citing united states torres rosario,cir.
santiago contends that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel because she failed to seek suppression of the evidence against him.santiago principal contention is that there was no probable cause to arrest him,which tainted the evidence introduced against him santiago further claims that his mother and brother lacked any authority to consent to a search of his bedroom.alternatively,santiago posits that agent guzmán lineup identification was suppressible because the lineup was suggestive.
here,the record is not sufficiently developed for us to assay santiago claims of ineffective assistance.the record is unclear as to what probable cause existed for santiago arrest.moreover,the record is not sufficiently developed as to whether santiago mother and brother could consent to a search of santiago bedroom.the record is also devoid of any guidance as to why santiago trial counsel did not pursue suppression of the physical evidence against santiago or agent guzmán lineup identification.
this undeveloped record renders us unable to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel challenged conduct,and to evaluate the conduct from counsel perspective at the time.strickland washington.accordingly,we decline santiago invitation to address these issues on direct appeal.
we review sufficiency of the evidence challenges de novo.united states,cir.citing united states boulerice,cir.in doing so,we affirm the conviction when,after viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and indulging all reasonable inferences in the government favor,a rational factfinder could conclude that the prosecution proved all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.notably,we avoid credibility judgments as part of this analysis.united states,cir.citing united states,cir.
when reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim,we consider all the evidence offered by the government that was admitted by the court,even if the court erroneously admitted some of that evidence.united states,cir.citing lockhart nelson,see also united states claxton,cir.
santiago challenges the sufficiency of the evidence presented against him.specifically,he argues that given the illegality of his arrest and its illegal fruits,we are preempted from considering the evidence presented at trial.santiago also challenges agent guzmán identification as not being credible.
here,the government presented ample evidence to support santiago conviction specifically,the government presented evidence that santiago admitted to committing the robbery and showed the arresting officers where he had hidden the proceeds from the bank robbery,the banco popular bank teller,testified that she placed two security dye packs in the bag used to commit the bank robbery the money found in santiago bedroom and vehicle was stained red a search of nissan pathfinder showed that the passenger seat was stained red there was surveillance video that showed a masked assailant identified as santiago utilizing a gun to commit the bank robbery and fleeing in a nissan pathfinder and agent guzmán observed santiago flee the robbery in a dark brown nissan pathfinder.
although the evidence outlined so far is sufficient to end santiago sufficiency claim,we note that agent guzmán identified santiago during a police lineup and again in court.santiago claims that agent guzmán identifications are inadmissible because the record belies that he was able to observe santiago face.however,we do not engage in credibility determinations when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence.in any event,there was sufficient evidence presented against santiago aside from agent guzmán identifications.
we further note that santiago failed to advance any argument that we should consider a suppression argument on appeal accordingly,we conclude that santiago waived this argument.see united states houlihan,cir.noting settled appellate rule that issues not briefed and properly developed on appeal are waived united states zannino,cir.it is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way,leaving the court to do counsel work,create the ossature for the argument,and put flesh on its bones.
thus,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury verdict,we find that there was sufficient evidence presented as to both counts.
lastly,santiago challenges the reasonableness of the district court sentence as to count one the district court calculated santiago guidelines sentencing range gsr as seventy to months imprisonment.however,the district court made an upward variance of months and sentenced santiago to a total of months.the statute of conviction provides a maximum sentence of years.a,d.
we generally review the district court sentencing decisions for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard.united states trinidad acosta,cir.citing gall united states.appellate review of federal criminal sentences is characterized by a frank recognition of the substantial discretion vested in a sentencing court.united states flores machicote,cir.
when assaying procedural reasonableness,we review factual findings for clear error,arguments that the sentencing court erred in interpreting or applying the guidelines de novo,and judgment calls for abuse of discretion simpliciter.trinidad acosta,at quoting united states serunjogi,cir.procedural reasonableness includes errors such as failing to consider appropriate sentencing factors,predicating a sentence on clearly erroneous facts,or neglecting to explain the rationale for a variant sentence adequately.united states del,cir.citing united states martin,cir.
in contrast,substantive unreasonableness encompasses whether the sentence survives scrutiny when examined under the totality of the circumstances.id.the hallmarks of a substantively reasonable sentence are a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible result.united states,cir.quoting martin,at.
according to santiago,the district court improperly deviated from the gsr when it based the variance on his prior criminal record,which was already contemplated in his chc.he relies on for the proposition that 
w hen a factor is already included in the calculation of the guidelines sentencing range,a judge who wishes to rely on that same factor to impose a sentence above or below the range must articulate specifically the reasons that this particular defendant situation is different from the ordinary situation covered by the guidelines calculation.
at quoting united states zapete garcía,cir.
santiago ignores that a sentencing judge may consider whether a defendant criminal history score substantially underrepresents the gravity of his past conduct as part of the inquiry of the defendant history and characteristics,at citing united states lozada aponte,cir.united states walker,cir.as a result,a district court may vary a sentence upward in an effort to reflect past leniency.id.
here,the district court noted that santiago had an extensive criminal history that encompassed a conviction for burglary and various arrests for illegal appropriation,controlled substances,and robbery notably,said conviction and arrests did not factor into the calculation of santiago criminal history score.the court also highlighted that because the majority of these arrests resulted in dismissals,santiago had enjoyed significant leniency from the state courts.the district court was also well aware of the fact that santiago did not qualify as a career offender under the sentencing guidelines because of a technicality these factors readily support our conclusion that the court sentence was largely premised on an understanding that santiago criminal history score severely underrepresented his criminal behavior.
santiago also contends that the district court imposed variance is not modest and requires that the court provide a compelling reason to justify it.he correctly notes that the greater a deviation from the gsr,the more compelling the sentencing court justification must be.del,at citing united states smith,cir.here,the sentencing court sufficiently indicated that santiago sentence was necessary because his chc did not properly reflect his previous and numerous criminal transgressions.in doing so,the sentencing court made clear that santiago situation is distinct from the norm.see id.as such,we are satisfied that the court sufficiently justified the imposed variance 
given the district court preoccupation that santiago criminal history score did not adequately reflect his criminal past,we can reasonably infer that the court was concerned with santiago potential for recidivism,as well as the need to protect the public.thus,the court could conclude that santiago extensive criminal antecedents and the state court leniency resulted in santiago failure to respect the law and necessitated an sentence in order to prevent future crimes.
furthermore,the district court did not double count santiago criminal history.to the extent that the district court may have taken into account any of santiago crimes that were already factored into his criminal history score,the court did not utilize the same factor twice to calculate his gsr.instead,the court took into account those crimes that factored into his criminal history score to calculate his gsr and then considered all the factors,which included his history and characteristics.see united states,cir.
similarly,the district court did not double count the elements of the bank robbery offense.rather,the district court noted that santiago brandished his weapon at bank employees and customers and never expressed remorse or empathy for the people at the bank or the tellers that he held at gunpoint.it is beyond cavil that this proclamation was not,in effect,double counting the bank robbery elements 
santiago also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.as previously stated,santiago was sentenced to months imprisonment as to count one and months as to count two,to be served consecutively.although the district court handed out a considerable sentence,it was clearly less than half than the statutory maximum and outlined a plausible rationale that falls within the expansive universe of reasonable sentences.united states king,cir.
additionally,santiago personal characteristics support the imposed variance.united states,cir.a sentencing court reasons for a variance should typically be rooted either in the nature and circumstances of the offense or the characteristics of
