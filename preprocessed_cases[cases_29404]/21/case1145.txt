defendant paul daugerdas appeals from a judgment entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york pauley,following a jury trial convicting him of one count of conspiracy to defraud the internal revenue service irs in violation of see and four counts of client tax evasion in violation of and one count of irs obstruction in violation of a and one count of mail fraud in violation of and.he was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,three years supervised release,in forfeiture,and in restitution.he argues on appeal that i the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions ii the indictment was constructively amended iii the indictment was duplicitous iv the accumulation of errors at trial violated his due process right to a fair trial v the district court supplemental instruction on the annual accounting rule misled the jury vi his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable and vii the government failed to establish the requisite nexus between his crimes and the property sought in forfeiture.finding no merit in his arguments,we affirm.
background 
the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the government showed the following.
paul daugerdas was a certified public accountant cpa and tax attorney at arthur andersen through august of the law firm altheimer gray from the end of through and the chicago office of the law firm jenkens gilchrist j g from through april.throughout his career,daugerdas developed,sold,and implemented a variety of strategies for wealthy clients the short sale shelter,short option shelter,swaps shelter,and homer shelter.besides daugerdas employers,two other entities had significant involvement in this undertaking.the accounting firm bdo seidman bdo referred its clients to j g and helped to sell the shelters,and the investment bank deutsche bank brown db assisted j g in the design of the shelters,held informational meetings with clients,and implemented the transactions that composed the shelters.
i.the development and sale of the tax shelters 
daugerdas designed and sold the shelters beginning in the early when he was a partner at arthur andersen.although the transactions underlying the shelters changed over time,the facts surrounding their marketing and implementation varied little.daugerdas designed the short sale shelter,which created losses through the short sale of treasury securities followed by transfers between a partnership,a limited liability company,and an.in,because daugerdas and other j g attorneys were concerned that pending legislation would render the short sale shelter ineffective,they developed the short option shelter as a substitute.this shelter generated losses through the sale of a digital currency option instead of through the short sale of treasury securities but was otherwise similar to the short sale shelter.
in august of,the irs announced that transactions like the short sale and short option shelter would no longer provide the favorable tax treatment that j g sought for its clients.to replace these two shelters,daugerdas and his colleagues developed the swaps shelter,which simply replaced the digital currency option with a swap transaction.at approximately the same time as he was developing the swaps shelter,daugerdas also worked on developing and implementing the homer shelter.the structure of the homer shelter underlying transactions was more complex than the structures of the other shelters.
as an essential part of the marketing of all the tax shelters,daugerdas and his colleagues issued opinion letters to clients who purchased the shelters.such letters state that under current federal income tax law it is more likely than not that the transactions comprising the shelters are legal and will have the effect sought by the clients.they protect clients from the irs imposition of a financial penalty in the event that the irs does not permit the losses generated by the shelter to reduce the client tax liability.paralegals or attorneys who worked for daugerdas generated these letters and daugerdas often reviewed and signed them himself.the letters stated that the clients had knowledge of the particular transactions underlying the shelter and that the clients were entering into the shelter for business reasons.multiple clients testified that they never made representations of knowledge to daugerdas or his associates and that,in any event,these representations were false because the clients knew little or nothing about the underlying transactions and entered into the shelters only to reduce their tax liability.
because daugerdas and his colleagues designed the transactions with a focus on their tax consequences rather than their profitability,they generally did not generate meaningful returns.for example,the clients who engaged in the short sale shelter in lost approximately as part of the shelter.clients who used the short option shelter had a to chance of doubling their investment.if they did not double their investment,they lost it in its entirety.swaps shelter clients were even less likely to profit from their transaction of the approximately participants in the trade,only two made a profit on the trade,one of whom made only one dollar.the chance of any client profiting from the homer shelter as it was originally designed was negligible j g associate attorney john beery informed daugerdas that an implementation issue would prevent any of the homer clients from realizing a profit from the transaction.nevertheless,daugerdas chose to proceed and even issued opinion letters falsely stating that some of the transactions had a reasonable possibility of producing a profit.moreover,the profit potential of all the shelters disappeared entirely when the fees charged by j g,bdo,and db for the shelters were taken into account.
ii.the backdating of shelter transactions 
as part of the implementation of the swaps and short option shelters,daugerdas either directly or through his team at j g participated in the correction and backdating of certain transactions that had originally been incorrectly implemented on behalf of matthew coleman and greg blair michael toporek and the aronoff family.a lawyer who worked with daugerdas testified that he discussed with daugerdas the backdating of transactions and how they could justify it.another witness testified that daugerdas was the head of the team of lawyers with whom she communicated regarding backdated transactions.
in,to obtain ordinary losses,business partners coleman and blair consulted with daugerdas and decided to enter into the swaps shelter.in december,db broker david parse assistant,carrie yackee,received authorization from j g to complete the purchase and sale of cisco shares as part of the shelter.in february,j g attorneys realized that this transaction had generated capital losses rather than ordinary losses.to correct this error,j g faxed to parse an undated letter asking him to reverse the cisco sale,along with letters dated december and,directing him to implement transactions that would have the effect of generating the ordinary losses requested by coleman and blair.yackee received these faxes,and ensured that db carried out the instructions they requested.she eventually returned to j g the account statements containing the backdated transactions.these statements were used in the preparation of coleman and blair tax returns.
for and,toporek sought from the swaps shelter million in ordinary losses and in capital losses.j g made a mistake in the instructions given to parse,requesting the reverse in ordinary losses and million in capital losses.in march,j g became aware of this error.after internal discussions regarding how to proceed,beery asked parse to implement several transactions in april but date them to december.after db implemented the corrective transactions,daugerdas sent toporek tax preparer,judith quedenfeld,a letter falsely indicating that the transactions had been completed in and seeking the return of a prior opinion,which had detailed the original,erroneous transaction.quedenfeld used documentation of the corrected transaction in the preparation of toporek tax returns and,as a result,toporek was able to claim the losses he had originally sought.
j g attorneys and db employees engaged in a similar course of conduct to correct mistakes that were made in the implementation of the short option shelter for the aronoff family.this incident is not at issue in this appeal.
iii.daugerdas personal use of tax shelters 
daugerdas also used tax shelters to reduce his personal tax liability.from to,daugerdas received more than million in income.he personally used the short sale shelter yearly during that time period,and,as a result,he paid only in federal personal income tax.from to,daugerdas had over million in income.during those years,he used the short option shelter to offset this income and paid no income tax.
iv.procedural history 
in,daugerdas,parse,and others involved in the design,marketing,and implementation of the shelters were indicted for conspiracy,tax evasion,obstructing the irs,and mail fraud.daugerdas was convicted on all of the counts with which he was charged.the results for the other defendants were mixed.on june,the district court granted a new trial based on juror misconduct as to all defendants except parse,who,the district court found,had waived his right to raise the objection.after this court reversed the district court determination as to parse,united states parse,cir,parse negotiated a deferred prosecution agreement with the government.
on july,the government filed a new indictment,containing charges similar to those in the prior indictment,against daugerdas and a who was later acquitted on all counts.the indictment charged daugerdas with one count of conspiracy to defraud the irs in violation of see and ten counts of client tax evasion in violation of and three counts of personal tax evasion in violation of one count of irs obstruction in violation of a and one count of mail fraud in violation of and.daugerdas was ultimately convicted of one count of conspiracy to defraud the irs four counts of client tax evasion arising from the shelters implemented for coleman and blair and toporek one count of irs obstruction and one count of mail fraud.he was acquitted of six counts of client tax evasion and the three counts of personal tax evasion.
in may,the district court sentenced daugerdas to months imprisonment,three years supervised release,in forfeiture,and in restitution.
discussion 
daugerdas presents the following issues for our review i whether the evidence was sufficient to support his convictions ii whether the district court supplemental instruction on the annual accounting rule misled the jury iii whether the indictment was constructively amended iv whether the accumulation of errors at trial violated his due process right to a fair trial v whether the indictment was duplicitous vi whether his sentence was procedurally and substantively reasonable and vii whether the government proved the requisite nexus between his crimes and the property sought in forfeiture.
sufficiency of the evidence 
we review de novo a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction by view ing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,drawing all inferences in the government favor and deferring to the jury assessments of the witnesses credibility.united states pierce,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.we will sustain the jury verdict if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.
a.the evidence supporting daugerdas mens rea 
daugerdas first argues that the government failed to prove that he had the necessary mens rea to be guilty of tax evasion,mail fraud,and obstruction of the irs.the convictions on these counts turned upon the misrepresentations in the tax returns of coleman and blair and toporek.
daugerdas conviction on these counts will stand only if the evidence was sufficient to enable a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that daugerdas knew that the tax returns of coleman and blair and toporek misrepresented their tax liability in some way.see united states regan,cir.amended,cir.stating that the crime of tax evasion requires the voluntary,intentional violation of a known legal duty internal quotation marks omitted united states alkins,cir.if an individual believes that the information set forth in a mailing is true,it follows that he can not have the requisite intent to commit mail fraud.parse,at to act or endeavor corruptly,within the meaning of the statute criminalizing obstruction of the irs,means to act or endeavor with the intent to secure an unlawful advantage or benefit either for one self or for another.some internal quotation marks omitted.
daugerdas attacks the sufficiency of the government proof that he knowingly developed and sold shelters that violated the economic substance rule.under this rule,sham transactions that can not with reason be said to have purpose,substance,or utility apart from their anticipated tax consequences can not form the basis of legitimate tax losses under the internal revenue code.bank of mellon comm r of internal revenue,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
for a jury to conclude that daugerdas had the necessary mens rea to commit tax evasion,mail fraud,and obstruction of the irs on the basis of violations of the economic substance rule,they would have to find both that he knew the rule and knew that the transactions lacked economic substance.see parse,at.our inquiry into whether a transaction lacks economic substance requires us to examine whether the clients had an objectively reasonable expectation of profit,apart from tax benefits,from the transaction and whether the clients had a subjective business purpose in entering the transaction.bank of mellon,at.this inquiry does not involve a rigid process,but instead calls for a flexible analysis where both prongs are factors to consider in the overall inquiry.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
knowledge of the economic substance rule 
in parse,we found the following facts sufficient to support a conclusion that parse knew the economic substance rule he was an experienced cpa with a master degree in business administration and in connection with his personal use of a similar tax shelter,he received an opinion letter describing the economic substance rule in detail.at.as in parse,on the facts of this case,a rational jury was entitled to conclude that daugerdas was with the economic substance rule based on evidence that he was an experienced cpa and tax lawyer who explained the economic substance requirement to his clients.
the economic substance of the swaps shelter 
coleman,blair,and toporek objectively reasonable expectation of profit 
in arguing that the government failed to prove that he knew that coleman and blair and toporek did not have an objectively reasonable expectation of making a profit from the swaps shelter,daugerdas relies on the legal ambiguity surrounding the question of whether the tax advisory fees associated with each shelter should be factored into the analysis.daugerdas argues that,because it is not clear whether or not the fees should be included in the calculation,he had a belief that the fees should not be considered.the lack of economic substance is only apparent,he argues,if the costs associated with the tax advisory fees are included in the calculation.
this argument ignores the fact that,even if the tax advisory fees were not included in the analysis,the chance of any swaps shelter investor earning a profit was still extremely low.the government expert testified that coleman and blair had a chance and toporek a chance of earning a profit even before the inclusion of the fees.in the end,only two of the approximately clients who invested in the swaps shelter made a profit,and one of these earned a profit of just one dollar.
moreover,daugerdas was aware that the possibility of success was low.he acknowledged to coleman that the transaction was highly unlikely to produce a profit and this would happen only if all the moons were lined up.taken together,this evidence permitted a rational jury to infer that,regardless of daugerdas purported belief that advisory fees were properly excluded,daugerdas knew that coleman and blair and toporek could not have had an objectively reasonable expectation of profiting from their investment.
coleman,blair,and toporek subjective non tax business purpose in entering the transaction 
the evidence of the low likelihood of coleman,blair,and toporek profiting from the swaps shelter provided circumstantial support for inferences that they did not have a subjective business purpose in entering the transaction,and that daugerdas knew it.
the latter inference is also supported by coleman testimony about his conversations with daugerdas.coleman testified at trial that daugerdas advised him to focus on making the investment for profit purposes if he were to be audited by the irs.tr.coleman viewed this advice as an effort to have him stretch the truth about why he was entering into the shelter.id.at.this advice was also relevant to the question of whether daugerdas knew that toporek did not have a subjective business purpose in entering the transaction.if daugerdas could infer,based on the low profit potential,that coleman and blair were not intending to make a profit,then he could have inferred the same about toporek,given that his profit potential was similarly low.
a rational jury could thus have concluded that daugerdas was familiar with the economic substance rule and knew that the transactions lacked economic substance because he knew that a coleman and blair and toporek had no objectively reasonable expectation of making a profit from the swaps shelter and b they did not have a subjective business purpose in entering the transaction.therefore,the evidence was sufficient for a jury to find that daugerdas was guilty of tax evasion,mail fraud,and obstruction of the irs.
b.the evidence supporting daugerdas convictions of conspiracy and mail fraud 
daugerdas next argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions for conspiracy to defraud the irs and the same mail fraud count previously discussed because there was no evidence that he participated in the scheme involving illegal backdating the government failed to prove that the mail fraud affected a financial institution and the indictment did not allege that the mail fraud affected a financial institution.each of these contentions is meritless.
evidence of daugerdas participation in backdating 
the record belies daugerdas argument that there was no evidence that he participated in the scheme involving illegal backdating.erwin mayer,a lawyer who worked with daugerdas for several years,testified that he had discussed backdating with daugerdas on multiple occasions and that the discussions concerned fixes that he does for their client situations and ways to potentially justify backdating the transactions.tr.
further,yackee testified extensively about her communications with j g employees regarding backdated transactions effected on behalf of coleman and blair,toporek,and the aronoff family.although yackee did not specifically name daugerdas as a participant in these communications,she stated that he was the head of that team of people at j g with whom she communicated regarding the backdating.id.at.
finally,quedenfeld,who prepared tax returns for toporek that reflected the backdated transaction,also provided testimony describing daugerdas direct involvement in the backdating.she told the jury that she had first prepared returns for toporek based on the opinion letter,drafted and sent by j c,that contained the original,incorrect transaction.she sent these returns to daugerdas,and then received a revised opinion letter signed by daugerdas that included the backdated transaction and a request to return the original,incorrect opinion letter.she prepared returns based on the new opinion letter and then provided the new returns to beery,who worked for daugerdas,for beery review.
a rational jury could have concluded from the testimony of mayer,yackee,and quedenfeld that daugerdas participated in the scheme involving illegal backdating by directing his subordinates to effect backdated trades.his argument on this point is therefore without merit.
stipulation that the mail fraud affected a financial institution 
we easily reject daugerdas argument that the government failed to prove that the mail fraud affected a financial institution.without this element,the mail fraud charged would be barred by the statute of limitations.section of title of the united states code sets a statute of limitations for federal crimes,whereas sets a statute of limitations for mail fraud affect ing a financial institution.we agree with the district court that the government must prevail because daugerdas entered into a stipulation that deutsche bank was a financial institution that was affected by the shelters.
indictment failure to allege that the mail fraud affected a financial institution 
daugerdas claims error because the indictment did not allege that the mail fraud affected a financial institution.daugerdas did not raise this claim until after trial,and therefore this challenge is subject to plain error review.united states nkansah,cir,abrogated on other grounds by united states bouchard,cir.to obtain a reversal on this basis,daugerdas must show there is an error the error is clear or obvious the error affected his substantial rights and the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
any error could not have affected daugerdas substantial rights,because his stipulation that deutsche bank was a financial institution that was affected by the shelters put him on notice of this element of mail fraud.see united states doe,cir.stating that a defendant substantial rights are not affected where information is missing from an indictment if the defendant otherwise had notice of the missing information.therefore,he can not establish plain error.
ii.constructive amendment of the indictment 
daugerdas argues that the prosecution rebuttal summation and the court supplemental instructions constructively amended the indictment to include a theory of criminal liability based on his violation of the annual accounting rule by including backdated transactions in tax returns that were submitted to the irs.this rule requires that the tax consequences of a transaction generally be assessed in the returns of the year in which the transaction took place.see united states skelly oil,d.
we review de novo the question of whether an indictment was constructively amended.pierce,at.a constructive amendment is a per se violation of the fifth amendment,but significant flexibility in proof is constitutionally permissible,as long as the indictment provides notice to the defendant of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.united states,cir.emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted.because the core of criminality involves the essence of a crime,in general terms,and excludes the particulars of how a defendant effected the crime,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,there is no constructive amendment when the proof at trial does no more than supply the particulars.
the indictment in this case was not constructively amended.daugerdas claim that the government ignored backdating as a separate theory of liability until its rebuttal summation is contradicted by the text of the indictment,which describes backdating repeatedly.the backdating of tax returns,described in paragraph of the indictment,is in the section of the indictment that describes the various fraudulent schemes that were involved in the development,sale,and implementation of the tax shelters.backdating is later listed in paragraph as one of the methods by which the conspiracy was carried out.paragraph is incorporated into the obstruction and mail fraud counts.
daugerdas correctly notes that,in its opening argument,the prosecution described backdating as evidence that the shelters lacked economic substance.much of the trial testimony also focused on the economic substance theory of liability.however,presenting backdating as an alternate theory of liability on some of the counts did not change the essence of the crime,in general terms,which remained throughout a massive tax fraud orchestrated by daugerdas.the incidents of backdating and corresponding violations of the annual accounting rule were simply particulars of how daugerdas effected the crime,and the government reliance on this theory of liability did not amount to a constructive amendment of the indictment.id.at.
iii.duplicitous indictment 
daugerdas argues that count thirteen,which alleges obstruction of the irs,was duplicitous because it involves two separate schemes one based on the use of tax shelters by clients and the other based on daugerdas personal use of the shelters.
we review properly preserved challenges to an indictment de novo.see united states vilar,cir.as we explained in united states aracri,cir,an indictment is duplicitous if it includes multiple crimes in one count,but not if it includes in that count multiple ways of committing a single offense.
under the aracri standard,count thirteen is not duplicitous.it alleges a single crime obstruction of the irs.it then alleges that this crime was committed in many different ways.the fact that the various methods of committing a single offense can be divided into two separate categories those that relate to daugerdas work on behalf of his clients and those that relate to daugerdas personal use of the shelters does not create duplicity.id.i t is well established that the allegation in a single count of a conspiracy to commit several crimes is not duplicitous,for the conspiracy is the crime and that is one,however diverse its objects.alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
iv.violation of due process 
daugerdas argues that a the admission of evidence of a guilty plea to a tax evasion charge b the government improper summation arguments and c the government inconsistent positions at summation and sentencing created a trial so riddled with errors that his due process right to a fair trial was violated.
a.the admission of john ivsan guilty plea 
daugerdas first objects to the admission of the fact of john ivsan guilty plea.ivsan was a tax attorney and part of a group of advisors who were unaffiliated with daugerdas but who consulted with larry morgan,a daugerdas client and cooperating witness,about his decision to participate in the short sale shelter.on,daugerdas elicited from morgan that ivsan was one of the advisors who concluded that the shelter was legal.over daugerdas objection,the district court allowed the government to introduce,pursuant to federal rules of evidence and,the fact that ivsan had in pleaded guilty to unrelated tax crimes.when this evidence was introduced,the district court instructed the jury that the jury consideration of ivsan guilty plea was limited to what it revealed about ivsan credibility.ivsan credibility was relevant to the jury assessment of the truthfulness of his statement that he believed that the short sale shelter was legal,which is itself relevant to the question of whether daugerdas,also a tax attorney,had a similar belief.in its summation,the prosecution referred to the guilty plea.
we review the district court ruling for abuse of discretion,united states taubman,cir.per curiam,which requires us to ask if the ruling was arbitrary and irrational,united states mercado,cir.internal quotation marks omitted.
assuming that the statements that daugerdas elicited from morgan about ivsan opinion on the short sale shelter constituted hearsay within the meaning of federal rule of evidence,it was permissible to use ivsan guilty plea to impeach that opinion under rules and,subject to rule balancing test.the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of ivsan guilty plea in impeaching ivsan opinion was not substantially outweighed by its danger of unfair prejudice.fed.evid.the probative value of the evidence lay in its relevance to the jury assessment of ivsan credibility,which was itself relevant to its assessment of whether daugerdas had a belief in the legality of his actions.to be sure,the fact that ivsan was convicted of a tax crime ran a risk of unfairly prejudicing daugerdas,but here this prejudice was mitigated by the district court limiting instruction and by the fact that ivsan himself was unaffiliated with daugerdas or his firm.the admission of ivsan guilty plea did not implicate daugerdas right to a fair trial.
errors in the prosecution summation 
daugerdas argues that the prosecutor summation was so prejudicial that he must receive a new trial.
we review de novo a claim that a prosecutor summation unfairly prejudiced a defendant.see united states bubar,cir.but such a claim presents a significant hurdle for daugerdas.the prosecution and the defense are generally entitled to wide latitude during closing arguments,so long as they do not misstate the evidence.united states tocco,cir.an improper summation will only warrant a new trial when the challenged statements are shown to have caused substantial prejudice to the defendant rarely will an improper summation meet the requisite level of prejudice.united states mapp,cir.citation omitted.
commentary on daugerdas failure to produce evidence 
daugerdas identifies two examples of what he believes to be impermissible statements in the prosecution summation concerning his failure to present evidence a statement that the defense had not introduced any evidence that anyone had convinced the irs that the shelter transactions were legitimate and a statement that daugerdas did not record his views about the validity of the shelters,seek other legal opinions on the validity of the shelters he was selling,or litigate them in court.
the district court sustained the defense objection to the first line of argument and not to the second.because we are required to look at the entire argument in context,see united states caracappa,cir,we consider both arguments and conclude that both were permissible.although the government can not comment on a defendant failure to testify,it is permissible to draw the jury attention to the fact that a defendant did not call witnesses to contradict the government case or support his own theory of what happened.united states mcdermott,cir.a prosecutor commentary about a defendant lack of evidence becomes prejudicial only if the jury would naturally and necessarily interpret the government summation as a comment on the defendant failure to testify or if the evidence that the defendant has not produced was exclusively in his control.id.
here,although the missing evidence is relevant to daugerdas subjective belief in the legality of the shelters,it is not evidence that is only in his control,nor would the jury otherwise interpret the prosecutor statements as comments on daugerdas failure to testify.a witness who had successfully defended one of the shelters before the irs would provide evidence of a legal ambiguity that could provide circumstantial support for daugerdas contention that he had a good faith belief in the legality of the shelters.the same is true of evidence that daugerdas had either recorded or publicly sought confirmation of this belief.many witnesses other than daugerdas could have testified about these actions.because daugerdas was not the exclusive source of this evidence,there was no suggestion that he had a duty to testify or produce evidence solely within his control.
commentary on the law 
daugerdas next points to the prosecutor comments twice during summation that the jurors would learn from the district court that daugerdas legal views about the calculation of profit under the economic substance doctrine were incorrect.these statements were not an improper comment on the law because daugerdas subjective view of the law was a fact that was at issue in the case.the government was required to prove that daugerdas did not have a good faith belief that the shelters at issue were legal.see supra section in discussion.therefore the state of the law at the time of the transactions as it bore on daugerdas state of mind was relevant to the government case and was an appropriate subject for the prosecution c
