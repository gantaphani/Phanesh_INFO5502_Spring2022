this sentencing appeal embodies four discrete claims of error.having scrutinized these claims in light of the record as a whole,we affirm the appellant sentence.
background 
the critical facts are largely uncontested.englis pérez,a dominican national,journeyed to venezuela in early to undertake a venture.shortly after midnight on march,federal authorities intercepted a foot speedboat operating without lights,powered by two outsized outboard engines,and equipped with extra fuel tanks that had left port in venezuela and was approaching the coast of puerto rico.the vessel was carrying bales,which contained in the aggregate approximately kilograms of cocaine.
only two persons were aboard the vessel when it was intercepted the appellant and an individual later identified as gregorio rodríguez.a federal grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico returned a indictment against the pair,charging them with conspiracy to import or more kilograms of cocaine into the united states,in violation of a,and count conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute kilograms or more of cocaine,in violation of a and count aiding and abetting in the possession with intent to distribute kilograms or more of cocaine,in violation of and a count aiding and abetting in the importation of kilograms or more of cocaine,in violation of and and count conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute or more kilograms of cocaine on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states,in violation of c d,a,b and a and b count and aiding and abetting in the possession with intent to distribute kilograms or more of cocaine on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the united states,in violation of and c d,a,b and a count.although the appellant originally maintained his innocence,he shortly entered a straight guilty plea to all six counts of the indictment.
following the preparation of a presentence investigation report and some related skirmishing,the district court convened the disposition hearing on january.the november edition of the sentencing guidelines controlled.see united states harotunian,cir.the court calculated the appellant guideline sentencing range gsr as months and imposed a sentence at the bottom of that range months.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
in this case,the appellant challenges both the procedural underpinnings and the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.overall,claims of sentencing error are reviewed for abuse of discretion.see gall united states,d united states martin,cir.with respect to procedural claims,however,the standard of review is not monolithic.within it,we assay the district court factfinding for clear error and afford de novo consideration to its interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines.united states flores machicote,cir.
against this backdrop,we turn to the appellant asseverational array.because a reviewing court,in the sentencing context,should first address claims of procedural error,see martin,at,we start there.
mitigating role.
the appellant asserts that the district court committed procedural error when it refused to reduce his gsr to compensate for the appellant role in the offense.this claim was preserved below and,thus,our review is for clear error.see united states garcia,cir.
ussg b provides for reducing a defendant base offense level by two levels if the defendant was a minor participant in the criminal activity.the appellant argues that he was entitled to the benefit of this adjustment which would have lowered his gsr and,presumably,his sentence.we do not agree.
a defendant who seeks a mitigating role adjustment bears the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he is entitled to the downward adjustment.see united states vargas,cir.to qualify as a minor participant,a defendant must prove that he is both less culpable than his cohorts in the particular criminal endeavor and less culpable than the majority of those within the universe of persons participating in similar crimes.united states torres landrúa,cir quoting united states santos,cir.here,we need go no further than the first prong of this test.
determinations are notoriously.see united states meléndez rivera,cir united states rosa carino,cir.in this instance,the district court explicitly found,as a matter of fact,that the two participants in the smuggle the appellant and rodríguez were equally culpable.this finding is not clearly erroneous the two men traveled first to colombia and then to venezuela,specifically to undertake the unlawful voyage they shared the work at sea en route to puerto rico and the appellant special skill set as a mechanic was essential to the success of the venture.the fact that rodríguez was deemed the captain of the craft does not undermine the sentencing court finding that they were equal partners in the criminal activity.see,united states bravo,cir.
we have said before that absent a mistake of law,battles over a defendant status will almost always be won or lost in the district court.united states graciani,cir.this case is no exception.
in an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,the appellant advances two arguments.first,he says that the district court summarily declined to grant the minor role adjustment without outlining any reasoning for its decision.this statement is simply wrong the district court entertained extensive argument on this very point and explained its reasoning in some detail.the court mentioned the large quantity of drugs,the trust that the drug owners obviously placed in the appellant,and the appellant expertise in how to handle the boat.that the appellant resists the district court explanation for the equal culpability finding is not a basis for holding that the finding is unexplained.
the appellant also makes a hierarchical argument.he submits that he is a minor participant in the criminal activity,broadly defined,because he played a bit part when compared to those unidentified individuals who owned the drugs and those unidentified individuals who presumably were prepared to distribute them in the united states.
this argument is unavailing.when two persons undertake to transport by themselves a large quantity of drugs in a long and hazardous voyage at sea,it is not clear error for a sentencing court to regard each as a principal and refuse to grant any mitigating role adjustment see united states zakharov,cir united states coneo guerrero,cir.
that ends this aspect of the matter.where there is more than one plausible view of the circumstances,the sentencing court choice among supportable alternatives can not be clearly erroneous.united states ruiz,cir.
failure to explain.
congress has directed every sentencing court to state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.c.though the court explanation need not be precise to the point of pedantry,united states turbides leonardo,cir,the explanation given should identify the relevant factors driving the sentencing determination.united states sepúlveda hernández,cir,slip op.at see united states ruiz huertas,cir,cert.denied,d.
the appellant argues that the court below forsook this duty.since the appellant did not preserve any such claim of error in the district court,our review is for plain error.see united states montero montero,cir,slip op.at.to establish plain error,an appellant must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the appellant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.
the appellant argument is puzzling.he alleges,without qualification,that the district court failed to explain its reasons for the month sentence it imposed.yet,the sentencing transcript belies this allegation.the court explicitly stated that t he guideline computations satisfactorily reflect the components of this offense by considering its nature and circumstances the court went on to note that it had considered the other sentencing factors set forth in title.the court also referred to the appellant personal history and characteristics as well as th
