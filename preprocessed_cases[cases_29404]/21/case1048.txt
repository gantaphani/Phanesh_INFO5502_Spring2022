congress enacted the safety valve,f,as a vehicle for shielding certain offenders from the draconian effects of mandatory minimum sentences.but the safety valve is not available upon demand to qualify for it,a defendant must make a multifaceted showing including a showing that he has disclosed to the government,truthfully and completely,all relevant information concerning the offense of conviction and any related offenses.
illio matos and carlos attempted to make that showing the district court methodically weighed their proffers and determined that they were ineligible for relief under the safety valve.united states ovalles torres,d.having reviewed the record with care,we find no clear error in the district court determination.we therefore affirm the stated terms of imprisonment.
there is,however,a secondary issue.the lower court also ordered each appellant to serve a term of supervised release following the end of his incarceration.the appellants challenge both the legality of the elongated supervised release terms and the manner in which they were imposed.on this issue,we conclude that terms of supervised release were within the court authority.nevertheless,we agree with the parties that a procedural irregularity occurred in imposing the terms of supervision,the court made what amounted to an upward departure without giving the appellants adequate notice of its intentions.consequently,we vacate that aspect of the sentences and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the second superseding indictment in this case implicated the appellants,along with others,in an elaborate and operation.on january,the appellants pleaded guilty to a single count of that indictment,thus admitting that they had conspired with others to possess and distribute large quantities of cocaine.see a.each appellant entered into a written plea agreement.these agreements contemplated the only the the district court might impose a sentence without regard to any statutory minimum if the court finds that the defendant meets the criteria established in the safety valve statute,f.
this brings us to the statute.with its enactment,congress specifically excepted from statutory minimum sentences any defendant who meets the following criteria 
the defendant does not have more than criminal history point,as determined under the sentencing guidelines 
the defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon or induce another participant to do so in connection with the offense 
the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person 
the defendant was not an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of others in the offense,as determined under the sentencing guidelines and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise,as defined in section of the controlled substances act and 
not later than the time of the sentencing hearing,the defendant has truthfully provided to the government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan,but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.
against this statutory backdrop,we return to the case at hand.law enforcement agents debriefed the appellants,one by one,in order to gain whatever information they might possess concerning the offense of any other offenses that were part of the same scheme or course of conduct.see id.f.after comparing the appellants stories with information gleaned elsewhere,the interrogators concluded that the appellants had been neither completely truthful nor especially forthcoming during their debriefings.as a result,the government promptly notified the appellants that it intended to oppose their attempt to invoke the safety valve.
although the appellants have separate attorneys on appeal,both of them were represented below by the same counsel.that lawyer pressed the government to disclose the basis for its belief that the appellants had not fully complied with the statute,but the government refused to elaborate.it likewise refused a request that it conduct another round of debriefings.instead,the prosecutors noted that it was a defendant burden to prove his eligibility for the safety valve warned that,if nothing more was forthcoming,they would present evidence at the appropriate time and place to rebut any claim of eligibility and reminded defense counsel that the sentencing court would make the ultimate eligibility determination.the government added that a defendant knows when he has withheld information during a debriefing,and that such a defendant is free to augment his disclosures at any time prior to the sentencing hearing.finally,the prosecutors took the position that the law did not require them to make agents available to extract such additional information by question and answer.
the district court subdivided the sentencing hearings into two parts.it began with separate hearings for each appellant on the question of safety valve eligibility.after holding evidentiary hearings on august and september,first for matos and the second for court found that neither man had proven that he had timely furnished the government with truthful and complete information.ovalles torres,d at.these findings,which we discuss infra,precluded access to the safety valve.
on september,the court convened a joint hearing dedicated to the imposition of sentences.each appellant stipulated that he bore responsibility for at least five but less than fifteen kilograms of cocaine.the government and the district court accepted the stipulations,which triggered mandatory minimum sentences.see b b.the court thereupon sentenced each appellant to an incarcerative term of that duration,to be followed by ten years of supervised release.these appeals ensued.
ii.analysis 
the appellants jointly maintain that the district court committed no fewer than three significant errors.the first assignment of error challenges the court determination that they were ineligible for the safety valve.the second involves a claim that the appellants did not receive the process that was due.the third questions the imposition of periods of supervised release for efficiency of analysis,we address each of these claims of error separately.
safety valve eligibility.
in the court below,the appellants asserted that they had truthfully and completely answered all the questions that the government had asked,and,therefore,that the burden had shifted to the government to show that they were ineligible for the safety valve.the appellants added that if the government believed that either of them was withholding information,it had a duty to come forward with the basis for that belief so that the affected defendant would have a fair chance to explain away the alleged omission.the district court rejected this contention as turning the statute upside down.the court stated in pertinent part 
the statute says that the defendant has to come forth and truthfully testify as to everything he knows.now if he is going to sit back and say well,they did ask me that,then that is not what the statute requires.the statute requires an affirmative step on his part to come in and say,i want to be debriefed because i want to tell you everything that i know.t he affirmative steps have to be taken by the defendant if he wants to have an opportunity to qualify for the safety valve.
ovalles torres,d at quoting court comments during initial phase of sentencing hearing.
in assaying a sentencing court determination that a defendant failed to qualify for the safety valve,the standard of appellate review varies according to the foundation upon which that determination is based.see united states marquez,cir.to the extent that the determination rests on conclusions of law,appellate review is plenary.id.to the extent,however,that the determination hinges on differential factfinding,appellate review is for clear error.id.the district court determinations in this case are challenged both on legal and factual grounds,so both standards are in play.
it is too elementary to warrant citation of authority that we must test the district court determination of safety valve ineligibility against the five requirements limned in section f.the parties agree that the first four criteria have been satisfied.the battleground,then,is the fifth.as to that requirement,we have made it pellucid that nothing short of truthful and complete disclosure will suffice and,therefore,that truthful and complete disclosure is a condition precedent to relief under the safety valve.see,marquez,at united states montanez,cir.
a defendant bears the burden of showing that he made appropriate and timely disclosures to the government.marquez,at united states richardson,cir.this burden obliges the defendant to prove to the court that the information he supplied in the relevant time frame was both truthful and complete.marquez,at.consequently,a safety valve debriefing is a situation that cries out for straight talk equivocations,and veiled allusions will not do.after all,congress evident purpose in creating the safety valve was to mitigate the harsh effect of mandatory minimum sentences on certain first offenders who played supporting roles in schemes.united states,cir emphasis supplied.the only intended beneficiaries of congress largesse are those who have satisfied the five statutory criteria.united states,cir.others simply do not qualify.id.
we afford de novo review to the district court interpretation of a statute.marquez,at.in this instance,the legal standard to which the district court held the appellants comports with the body of law elucidated above.see,d at.thus,the appellants initial line of attack gains them no ground.
the appellants have a series of fallback positions.first,they insist that they filled any gaps in their original disclosures by their testimony during the aforementioned hearings.generally speaking,this is the wrong focal point.the governing statute,f,requires truthful and complete disclosures to be made not later than the time of the sentencing hearing.this means that the deadline for making truthful and complete disclosure is the moment that the sentencing hearing starts see united states marin,cir united states long,cir per curiam.
this is a wholly of the statute.in the first place,section f requires disclosure to the government,not the court.in the second place,we have noted that congress aim ed its safety valve leniency at defendants who did their best to cooperate to the extent of making full disclosure.montanez,at emphasis in original.to engage in carefully guarded comments during a debriefing and then attempt to recoup lost ground after commencement of the sentencing hearing is manipulation,not cooperation.see marin,at.
retreating a step further,the appellants challenge the district court findings of fact as clearly erroneous.this challenge lacks force.
the clear error standard is exceedingly deferential.marquez,at.under it,an appellate court ought not to disturb either findings of fact or conclusions drawn therefrom unless the whole of the record compels a strong,unyielding belief that a mistake has been made.cumpiano banco santander,cir.the process of evaluating witness testimony typically involves judgments and credibility calls that fit comfortably within the margins of the clear error standard.marquez,at.
in this case,the sentencing court carefully examined the witnesses testimony,listened to arguments involving credibility,and based its denial of the safety valve on specific factual findings.see ovalles torres,d at.in resolving the issue of whether truthful and complete disclosure had been made adversely to both appellants,the court cited book and verse.it gave examples of the appellants untruthfulness in the course of their safety valve debriefings and recounted several instances in which the appellants statements were incomplete.see,id.although another trier might not have reached the same conclusion,our review of the record confirms the plausibility of these findings as to both appellants and,thus,confirms the absence of clear error.
we add a few words in the interest of assuring our own effectiveness in reviewing the fairness of this kind of decision.our obligation to accord substantial deference to the sentencing court is best carried in close that court shares its basis for concluding that the disclosure efforts fell short.from its written decision,we can readily understand the court failure to be impressed by the record in case.for example,his denial contradicted by a government agent that he had met with the ringleader of the conspiracy,his failure to identify codefendant matos in a critical meeting at a restaurant,and his failure to inform the government that he had participated in an additional narcotics load are telling indicia of the quality of his disclosures.thus,we descry no error as to the district court refusal to grant the benefit of the safety valve.
in contrast,the court findings as to matos untruthfulness are much less impressive.the court found that matos had falsely denied communicating with a coconspirator after the of conspiracy that he had failed to reveal a telephone conversation with a coconspirator in which he was asked if he knew that the dogs have that and replied that they had nothing to worry about because they were not involved in that situation and that he had falsely denied that the same coconspirator had initially recommended him to the leader of the enterprise.these findings,collectively,do not weigh heavily.nevertheless,other evidence that can be gleaned from the record indicates that matos was not entirely this evidence,his contradictory testimony about the capacity of his boat,misleading information anent the function of a satellite telephone,and nondisclosure of his participation in another drug smuggle seems of greater significance than the few examples cited in the district court written decision.although the question is closer as to matos,we find,in the end,that the record contains adequate support for the lower court denial of the safety valve.
the appellants,ably represented on appeal,attempt to explain away their flawed disclosures.these carefully constructed explanations are marginally plausible but ultimately unpersuasive.the default rule is that when more than one sensible interpretation of a particular set of circumstances can supportably be drawn,a sentencing court decision to credit one alternative and reject another can not be deemed clearly erroneous.united states ruiz,cir.
the appellants persist.they next suggest that,even if their testimony was inconsistent or fragmentary in some respects,they nonetheless made a effort to answer the questions asked by the government agents.they add that,for the most part,their contradictions and omissions related to peripheral matters,and thus should not deprive them of the benefits of the safety valve.
we considered and rejected a similar argument in marquez,noting that the safety valve provision explicitly obligates a defendant to provide all information.at quoting f.in other words,section f,fairly read,requires a defendant to be forthcoming.he can not simply respond to questions while at the same time keeping secret pertinent information concerning the offense of conviction and related offenses that falls beyond the scope of direct interrogation.
to be sure,we have left a door open for a defendant who does not furnish information because he innocently believes that it would be of no interest.id.at.but the district judge is the sentry who guards this portal,and he obviously was not persuaded that the appellants contradictions and omissions had an innocent explanation.while we regard the court conclusions matos as close to the line,we are mindful that the sentencing judge had the benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses at first hand.we are,therefore,satisfied that this record offers no justification for overriding his ruling.
the appellants last attack on the safety valve determinations raises the most serious question.they accuse the governme
