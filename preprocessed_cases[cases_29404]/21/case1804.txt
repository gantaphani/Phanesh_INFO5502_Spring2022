background 
defendant conviction stems from a conspiracy to artificially inflate the price of the common stock of a publicly held company,healthtech international,healthtech,by giving brokers extraordinary commissions to recommend the stock to their clients.three stock promoters,eugene lombardo,irwin schneider and claudio iodice collectively,stock promoters,conspired with gordon hall,the ceo of healthtech,to pay brokers employed at the new hyde park office of meyers pollock robbins,meyers pollock,a registered firm,to recommend healthtech stock.under the agreement,the brokers were assigned a gross commission on the sales of healthtech stock from which the broker received a net commission in cash equal to half of that amount.three brokers at meyers pollock,arnold schneider,lawrence schneider,and michael motsykulashvili collectively,supervisory brokers,supervised the other brokers and were responsible for distributing the cash to the brokers.
the brokers at meyers pollock who carried out the scheme can be divided into two groups.the first group had recently transferred to meyers pollock from another securities firm,toluca pacific,and were the first to become involved in the scheme toluca group.the second group,to which santoro belonged,acted under the direction of jonathan lyons and joined the scheme one week after it began lyons group.
between january and february,santoro recommended and sold shares of healthtech stock to five customers for a total of approximately.motsykulashvili,one of the supervisory brokers,testified that he discussed the commission with santoro shortly before santoro started selling healthtech stock and that santoro received cash amounting to of his sales of the stock in exchange for his recommendation.the government also submitted into evidence a spreadsheet that,according to motsykulashvili,was prepared by the supervisory brokers to keep track of the sales of healthtech stock and the commissions owed to each broker participating in the scheme.santoro does not dispute that the spreadsheet identified the brokers that sold healthtech stock in furtherance of the conspiracy.
the spreadsheet indicated that rick made four sales to named customers in january and,under the heading gross,listed dollar amounts for each transaction that equaled approximately of santoro sales of healthtech stock during january to those customers.these figures were added and were represented on the spreadsheet as rick total.these transactions and the customers identified on the spreadsheet matched the records of santoro trading activity in healthtech stock kept by bear sterns clearing corporation,an independent clearing agent for meyers pollock.at the bottom of the spreadsheet,the totals for all of the brokers were aggregated and then halved.motsykulashvili testified that he used the spreadsheet to determine the amount of each broker commissions.santoro never disclosed the cash commissions to his clients.between late and february,the trading volume and price of healthtech stock rose dramatically before the fraud was discovered a few months later.
discussion 
abuse of trust enhancement 
section of the sentencing guidelines provides for a enhancement if the defendant abused a position of public or private trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense.in the case of a fraud conviction,an abuse of trust enhancement may not be imposed on a defendant solely because in committing the fraud,he violated a legal obligation to be truthful.see united states hirsch,cir united states broderson,cir.rather,to warrant the enhancement,the defendant must abuse a relationship of trust and confidence with the victim that enabled the defendant to commit the crime or escape detection.see hirsch,at united states jolly,cir broderson,at.a defendant position in this relationship is characterized by substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference by the victim.cmt.see hirsch,at united states laljie,cir t he primary trait that distinguishes a position of trust from other positions is the extent to which the position provides the freedom to commit a wrong.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
at sentencing,santoro argued that he did not occupy a position of trust,relying on evidence that at least two of his clients independently researched healthtech stock before purchasing it.in addition,santoro submitted a letter written by one of those clients,duncan hoffman,that stated,i do not believe that santoro did anything that i would consider an abuse of trust.
the district court rejected defendant arguments and imposed a enhancement on his sentence pursuant to based on its finding that the extraordinary commissions were santoro sole reason for recommending healthtech stock and that he failed to disclose the commission,despite his duty to his clients.in addition,the district court found that the modus operandi of the conspiracy consisted of first recommending a security to their clients,thereby gaining the clients trust,before suggesting that they buy healthtech stock.
on appeal,santoro argues that the enhancement was improper because he lacked discretionary authority to invest his clients funds and thereby was not his clients fiduciary.thus,according to santoro,he did not occupy a position of trust as defined by.in addition,he contends that the enhancement is unwarranted because his victims did not subjectively place their trust in him.
what constitutes a position of trust as defined by the guidelines is a question of law,which we review de novo.see united states hussey,cir per curiam.we accord due deference to the district court application of the guidelines to the facts,and we will not overturn the district court finding that the defendant abused a position of trust to significantly facilitate his offense unless it is clearly erroneous,see united states hirsch,cir.we find that a position of trust exists,even in the absence of a fiduciary relationship,where a affirmatively establishes a trust relationship by recommending a stock to his clients.we agree with the district court that the enhancement is warranted where a broker in such a trust relationship fails to disclose that he is receiving a substantial commission or other payment for the recommendation.
we first address santoro contention that he did not occupy a position of trust because he lacked discretionary authority to invest his clients funds.we agree with defendant that there is no general fiduciary duty inherent in an ordinary relationship.independent order of foresters donald,lufkin jenrette,cir.however,nothing in the guidelines requires that the position be a fiduciary one.even where a broker lacks discretionary investment authority,a relationship of trust and confidence exists between a broker and a customer with respect to those matters that have been entrusted to the broker.united states szur,cir.as to such matters,a broker has an affirmative duty to dis
