joshua dunfee confessed not once,but twice,to allegations that he engaged in conduct sufficient to support convictions for the coercion and enticement of a minor,and the sexual exploitation of a child.the first of these confessions came at the time of dunfee arrest,and the second came during a hearing before the district court,at which dunfee pled guilty to the charges against him.later,dunfee filed two motions seeking to withdraw his guilty plea.the district court denied these motions and sentenced dunfee to a term of imprisonment.dunfee now appeals from the denial of his motions to withdraw his plea,as well as from his sentence,which he challenges as procedurally and substantively unreasonable.we affirm.
facts and background 
a.the offense conduct 
in,dunfee created a fictitious facebook page for a photography studio by the name of hunt photography.using the equally fictitious pseudonym,john,dunfee held himself out as a hunt employee and,in september,began communicating online with an adult female,a resident of massachusetts.was interested in working as a model.believing that hunt photography was a legitimate enterprise and that john was its legitimate employee,agreed to take part in an audition with john via a webcam,during which she exposed intimate parts of her body.
had a daughter,on october,dunfee again contacted.this time,again acting as john,dunfee offered for a bikini modeling contract.to secure the contract,dunfee explained,and would need to audition.
during the course of a skype call that afternoon,at dunfee direction,posed in front of the webcam wearing a bra and panties.again at dunfee direction,manipulated underwear,then agreed to shave pubic area.then returned to the webcam fully nude and,following dunfee instructions,displayed genitalia,ostensibly so that dunfee could determine if was a suitable model.became so upset that she refused to continue and terminated the skype call.then discussed the incident with her sister,who promptly reported it to police.
using his ip address,law enforcement officers tracked dunfee communications to his residence,located in oxford junction,iowa.on november,officers with the united states postal inspection service uspis executed a search warrant at the premises.after waiving his miranda rights,dunfee gave a full confession to uspis inspector scott kelley,describing in detail his creation of the hunt photography facebook page and his role posing as john,and confirming that he had directed to shave and display genitalia.dunfee admitted to inspector kelley that although he was unsure of exact age,he guessed she was around.dunfee was placed under arrest and was transferred to the district of massachusetts.
as part of their search of dunfee residence,officers seized a number of computers,later examination of which revealed a wealth of incriminating evidence.for example,officers discovered records of the communications between dunfee and,as well as hundreds of sexually provocative pictures and videos of young girls 
pretrial proceedings and dunfee guilty plea 
on november,dunfee appeared for a hearing before a magistrate judge.concluding that he posed a danger if released,the magistrate ordered dunfee detained prior to trial.dunfee was subsequently indicted on charges of sexually exploiting a child,in violation of a and e,and coercing and enticing a minor,in violation of b.
in march,at dunfee request,the magistrate judge dismissed dunfee appointed federal defender,and appointed attorney john salsberg,an experienced member of the criminal defense bar,to represent him later,following the district court approval of further funds,attorney salsberg was joined by an associate,resulting in dunfee having two lawyers representing him for a significant portion of the pretrial proceedings.
in may,dunfee moved for reconsideration of the magistrate judge pretrial detention order.the magistrate judge held a hearing,at which dunfee offered the testimony of his wife,barbara dunfee his,terry sherman and his,ashley hubbard.through this testimony,dunfee sought to establish an alibi to prove that he was not at home on october,when he was alleged to have contacted and for example,barbara and ashley testified that they were with dunfee for portions of the day,and terry testified that she recalled seeing dunfee and ashley driving together that afternoon.
this alibi defense was subsequently undermined in a number of key respects.for example,on,ashley dunfee admitted that she had previously had a sexual relationship with dunfee and that she was aware dunfee had used the hunt photography facebook account.during her,terry dunfee conceded that she was unsure whether she had seen ashley and dunfee together on october,or some other date.what is more,while ashley claimed that she and dunfee had gone together to two restaurants on october,credit card records later established that they had in fact visited those locations on the previous day,october.
the magistrate judge expressed his skepticism of the alibi defense at the hearing,observing that the testimony simply does persuade me,period.later,the magistrate judge issued a written order denying dunfee motion to reconsider,in which he described the alibi defense as incredible and unpersuasive.
on september,dunfee filed a motion to suppress the confession he had offered to uspis inspector kelley,claiming that kelley had misled and coerced him into waiving his miranda rights.during a series of ensuing hearings,the district court heard testimony from dunfee,inspector kelley,and another uspis inspector who had witnessed dunfee receipt and acknowledgement of a miranda waiver.in a written decision,the district court denied dunfee motion to suppress,finding that inspector kelley did not coerce,intimidate,or otherwise deceive dunfee,and that dunfee credibility was undermined by his clearly false testimony.united states dunfee,cr pbs,wl,at.
pretrial proceedings continued through the end of and into.the trial was repeatedly delayed as dunfee hired a series of forensics experts with funds to assess his computer and the records of his online activities.finally,a trial date was set for march.on the morning trial was to begin,however,dunfee informed the district court that he intended to plead guilty to both of the charges against him.during a lengthy colloquy that followed,dunfee assured the district court that he was fit to enter a guilty plea,that he had carefully reviewed the indictment with his attorneys,and that he was satisfied with the quality of the representation he had received.the government then offered a summary of the allegations it would have proven at trial,focusing specifically on dunfee use,on october,of the hunt photography facebook page to induce and.this led to the following exchange 
the court do you disagree with the government description of the offense conduct 
the court all right,were you the person who was pretending to be hunt photography and enticing that girl 
dunfee yes.
the court did you know she was underage 
dunfee yes.
after further questioning,during which dunfee repeatedly assured the district court that his decision to plead guilty was undertaken knowingly,freely,and voluntarily,the district court accepted dunfee plea.
dunfee attempts to withdraw his plea sentencing 
some two months later,in may,the probation office issued a presentence report psr,which calculated a guideline recommended sentence of life imprisonment.soon thereafter,dunfee filed a pro se motion seeking to remove his attorney and to withdraw his guilty plea,which dunfee stated was the product of ineffective assistance of counsel.in an accompanying affidavit,dunfee professed his innocence and claimed that he was forced to plead guilty because his attorney had not adequately prepared for trial and had obstructed his defense by,among other perceived shortcomings,failing to pursue exculpatory evidence,discouraging defense witnesses from testifying,and telling dunfee that his conviction was guarantee d if the case went to trial under separate cover,dunfee filed a series of exhibits,including correspondence with his attorney and internet service records,which dunfee argued proved he was innocent of the charges.despite dunfee voluminous filings,he did not request a hearing.on august,the district court denied dunfee motion to withdraw his plea in a thorough written decision 
in october,still dissatisfied,dunfee filed yet another pro se motion seeking to withdraw his plea.as before,dunfee appended a lengthy series of exhibits,which he argued supported his claim of innocence.again,he did not expressly request a hearing.the district court promptly denied this motion.
although dunfee psr calculated a recommended sentence of life imprisonment,both dunfee and the government urged the district court to impose a sentence.the government requested a sentence of years dunfee requested fifteen years.in december,the district court sentenced dunfee to a prison term.
ii.discussion 
dunfee appeals from the denial of his motions to withdraw his guilty plea,as well as from his sentence,which he challenges as procedurally and substantively unreasonable.we consider these issues in turn.
withdrawal of the guilty plea 
a defendant may withdraw a guilty plea before sentence is imposed if he shows a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.united states isom,cir quoting.d b.we review a district court denial of a motion to withdraw for abuse of discretion,united states sousa,cir,setting aside factual findings only if they are clearly erroneous,united states santiago miranda,cir.
a defendant does not have an unfettered right to retract a guilty plea and he bears the burden to establish a fair and just reason for withdrawal.united states merritt,cir.in considering whether the defendant has carried this burden,we consider whether the plea was voluntary,intelligent,knowing and in compliance with rule the strength of the reasons offered in support of the motion to withdraw whether there is a serious claim of actual innocence the timing of the motion and any prejudice to the government if the withdrawal is allowed.isom,at.
rule voluntary,intelligent,and knowing 
the question of whether the defendant guilty plea was entered voluntarily,intelligently,and knowingly is regarded as the most significant of the relevant factors.see united states cotal crespo,cir.here,we have little difficulty concluding that dunfee plea passes muster.upon being advised of his intention to plead guilty,the district court placed dunfee under oath and advised him of his rights to a jury trial,to be represented by counsel,and to confront the witnesses against him.see.b c f.the district court also reviewed with dunfee the charges he faced,the minimum and maximum penalties associated with those charges,the applicable sentencing guideline range,and the fact that there was no plea agreement in place.see id.b g n.
what is more,the district court went to great lengths to ensure that dunfee was pleading guilty of his own volition,and that there was a sufficient factual basis for him to do so.see id.b and.in response to clear and direct questions posed by the district court,dunfee confirmed that he had reviewed the indictment with his attorneys,that he understood its contents,and that he was satisfied with his legal representation.then,at the court request,the government described the factual allegations it would have been able to prove at trial.after hearing these allegations,dunfee confirmed that they were true and correct.he also answered yes when the district court asked him whether he had used the hunt photography facebook account to entice and,and whether he knew at the time that was underage.
in sum,dunfee affirmatively declared under oath at a properly conducted rule hearing that he was guilty of the crimes with which he was charged.these declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity,santiago miranda,at quoting blackledge allison,d,and the district court was entitled to give weight to those declarations absent a good reason for disregarding them,id.quoting united states torres rosario,cir see also united states gates,cir a defendant is normally bound by the representations that he himself makes in open court at the time of his plea.
dunfee argues here,as he did before the district court,that his decision to enter a guilty plea was not made voluntarily rather,it was the product of his attorney ineffective assistance and coercion.more specifically,dunfee maintains that because his attorney failed to adequately prepare for trial,he felt that he had no choice but to plead guilty.compounding matters,dunfee felt coerced by his attorney,who told him that his conviction was guarantee d if the case went to trial.
to parse dunfee ineffective assistance claim,we apply the standard articulated in strickland washington,d.see united states isom,cir.in order to prevail,dunfee must show that,first,counsel performance in advising his guilty plea fell below the standard of performance of reasonable proficient counsel,and second,that by such inadequate performance,dunfee was induced to enter a guilty plea which he otherwise would not have entered.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the strickland test imposes highly deferential judicial scrutiny of counsel performance and a strong presumption that counsel conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.lopez nieves united states,cir quoting strickland,at.where,as here,the defendant was represented by multiple attorneys,an ineffective assistance challenge is particularly difficult to mount.see id.at.
dunfee offers several examples of what he characterizes as attorney salsberg ineffectiveness.he claims that attorney salsberg failed to investigate and uncover exculpatory evidence,and discouraged certain defense witnesses from testifying.he also argues that attorney salsberg failed to investigate his mental health as relevant to the defense,and failed to advise the district court,on the eve of trial,that a continuance was needed in light of a new prospective witness that dunfee had identified.
we begin with dunfee claim that attorney salsberg failed to pursue exculpatory evidence.although it is somewhat unclear,as best we can tell,this claim relates principally to evidence which falls into one of two broad categories.first,dunfee claims that attorney salsberg failed to adequately pursue evidence and witnesses which would have supported his alibi defense.second,dunfee argues that attorney salsberg was derelict in failing to uncover electronic records which he maintains would have proven that he could not have communicated with and on october.
dunfee attorneys aggressively pursued evidence to support the alibi defense,but the evidence simply did not exist.by way of example,while dunfee sought to offer the testimony of terry and ashley to prove that he was not at home at the time of the alleged offense,neither witness was apparently in a position to establish his whereabouts on the day in question.likewise,while dunfee pointed to his work records as evidence that he could not have committed the crime,they in fact showed that he was not at work during the day on october.
furthermore,to the extent that dunfee now claims that electronic records might have helped his cause had his attorneys uncovered them,the district court acted well within its discretion in finding that any such records either did not exist or would not have been helpful to dunfee.as we have said,the pretrial proceedings were repeatedly delayed as dunfee sought more time and funding for further forensic review of the computers seized during the search of his residence.despite ample opportunity for the discovery of the electronic records that dunfee claims his attorneys should have found,no such evidence was presented to the district court,nor has it been presented to us on appeal.see united states pulido,cir w e have typically disregarded representations at a plea colloquy only when the allegations were highly specific and usually accompanied by some independent corroboration.quoting united states butt,cir.
ultimately,the district court conclusion that dunfee attorneys did not fail to seek out exculpatory evidence was rooted in the district court reasonable evaluation of the extensive factual record before it.where,as here,such factual deter
