jorge guevara appeals from the judgment of conviction and sentence entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york martin,after a jury trial.guevara challenges his conviction on the following grounds under apprendi new jersey,d,his due process and sixth amendment rights were violated when he was sentenced to a mandatory minimum month term of imprisonment under b a on the basis of a judge preponderance finding that more than one kilogram of heroin was involved in the conspiracy rather than by a jury determination of drug quantity beyond a reasonable doubt apprendi aside,there was insufficient evidence to support the district judge determination that the conspiracy involved more than one kilogram of heroin the district court abused its discretion and denied guevara the right to present a defense by refusing to receive in evidence certain tape recordings and transcripts that are allegedly exculpatory and guevara was denied his sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel when his lawyer stipulated to the accuracy of certain english language transcripts before guevara had listened to the spanish language audiotapes.
for the reasons set forth herein,we conclude that guevara sentence of months violated apprendi.applying plain error review pursuant to.b,we conclude that the district court committed error that was plain,that affected guevara substantial rights,and that seriously affected the fairness and the public reputation of judicial proceedings.
as to the other grounds of appeal,we conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that more than one kilogram of heroin was involved in the offense the district court exercised proper discretion in excluding certain evidence and guevara counsel was not constitutionally ineffective.
accordingly,we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with this opinion.
jorge guevara was convicted by the jury of conspiring to distribute heroin in violation of and.the indictment handed down against guevara charged him with conspiring with others to distribute and possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance,to wit,one kilogram and more of mixtures and substances containing a detectable amount of heroin,in violation of title,united states code,section.indictment.at trial,however,the court instructed the jury,consistent with the law of this circuit at the time of trial,that t he amount of narcotics alleged to have been distributed or possessed with intent to distribute is not an essential element of the criminal objective.you need only find that the agreed to distribute,or possess with intent to distribute,any quantity of narcotics.charge to jury,trial transcript at emphasis added see united states thomas,cir,vacated and remanded for reconsideration,d.guevara did not object to the jury instruction at trial and the jury returned a guilty verdict.
the investigation report psr prepared by the united states probation office in advance of the sentencing hearing to the united states sentencing guidelines guidelines a criminal history category of iv taking into account guevara prior felony drug conviction and a base offense level of premised on the recommended finding that his criminal activity involved the distribution of grams of heroin.psr citing sentencing guidelines c.guevara objected to the psr on a number grounds that did not include those later raised under apprendi.in adopting the psr recommendations,the district judge concluded that there was sufficient evidence at trial to establish that guevara knew the conspiracy involved at least one kilogram of heroin.
guevara criminal history category and base offense level resulted in a sentencing guideline range guideline range of to months.the court adopted no departure from that range in either direction.however,the district court 
ruled that because of its finding that the conspiracy involved more than one kilogram of heroin and that guevara was a prior drug felon,guevara was subject to the mandatory minimum sentence of months under b a i 
ruled that the month mandatory minimum trumped the top of the applicable guideline range months,see b where a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range,the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.and accordingly 
sentenced guevara to months in prison.
guevara filed a timely notice of appeal,challenging both his conviction and sentence.the principal question presented in this appeal is whether,under the supreme court decision in apprendi new jersey,d,guevara due process and sixth amendment rights were violated on the judge finding by a preponderance of the evidence,rather than a jury determination,that more than one kilogram of heroin was involved in the was sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment under b a that exceeds the highest term of imprisonment to which he would have been sentenced under the sentencing guidelines alone,notwithstanding that the sentence did not exceed the month statutory maximum under b c.
in apprendi new jersey,d,the defendant was convicted under a new jersey statute making it a offense to possess a firearm for an unlawful purpose,see stat.ann.a west,punishable by a maximum sentence of ten years.the state moved to enhance apprendi sentence under new jersey hate crime statute,which authorized a sentence of ten to twenty years if the trial judge found,by a preponderance of the evidence,that apprendi acted with a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individuals because of race,color,gender,handicap,religion,sexual orientation or ethnicity.apprendi,at.quoting e.having duly found that apprendi had acted with a biased motive,the trial judge sentenced apprendi to a term of twelve years.
apprendi argued that his sentence exceeded by two years the punishment authorized for the crime of which he had been convicted.the supreme court held that the sentencing enhancement based on the judge finding of bias was unconstitutional because 
other than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.with that exception,we endorse the statement of the rule set forth in the concurring opinions in jones united states,d i t is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.it is equally clear that such facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
apprendi,at.quoting jones,at.
in united states thomas,cir en banc,we joined a majority of circuits to conclude that apprendi applies to the federal narcotics statute,which specifies escalating penalties based on drug quantity.thus,in reverse alphabetical order of subsections 
section b c,applicable to drug trafficking offenses under a involving an indeterminate quantity of drugs,mandates no minimum sentence and authorizes a sentence ranging up to months,or up to months for prior drug felons 
section b b,applicable to drug trafficking offenses under a involving inter alia at least grams of heroin,mandates a minimum term of months or months for prior drug felons and authorizes a sentence ranging up to months or life for prior drug felons and 
section b a,applicable to drug trafficking offenses under a involving inter alia at least one kilogram of heroin,mandates a minimum term of months or months for prior drug felons,and authorizes a sentence of up to life.
therefore,under apprendi,if the type and quantity of drugs involved in a charged crime may be used to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum for an indeterminate quantity of drugs b c,then the type and quantity of drugs is an element of the offense that must be charged in the indictment and submitted to the jury.thomas,at collecting cases 
apprendi did not decide whether a defendant convicted of conspiring to commit a drug trafficking offense under a involving an indeterminate quantity of drugs can be sentenced to a mandatory minimum under b a that falls within the range of penalties authorized under b c,but exceeds the guideline punishment to which the defendant would otherwise be exposed.the supreme court had no reason to consider this issue because apprendi,which was an appeal from the supreme court of new jersey,was of course uninfluenced by any consideration of the federal sentencing guidelines.
we conclude that,by virtue of apprendi,a statutory mandatory minimum sentence specified in either b a or b b can not mandate a prison sentence that exceeds the highest sentence to which the defendant would otherwise have been exposed,the top of the federal guideline range,based on district court findings under the guidelines,with or without a departure if the applicability of subsections a or b depends on a finding of drug quantity not made by the jury 
the apprendi inquiry was whether,under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment,a fact that authorizes an increase in the maximum penalty to which a defendant could be sentenced must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.the supreme court held that any fact other than a prior conviction authorizing an increase in the defendant sentence beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be proved by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt and that it is unconstitutional to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.apprendi,at.
apprendi arose under new jersey state law,which has no analog to the federal sentencing guidelines.in states without a guideline system,a judge sentencing discretion is essentially unlimited except by the range of penalties authorized under the criminal statute in question.
by contrast,the federal sentencing guidelines constitute an overlay of binding law that limits discretion.they were promulgated by the united states sentencing commission pursuant to law,see sentencing reform act of act,as amended,et ed.supp.iv,and ed.supp.iv,and have the force and effect of laws.apprendi,at.thomas,concurring quoting mistretta united states,d scalia,dissenting see also united states martin,cir same united states muniz,cir same united states higgins,cir same united states ming he,cir.at the risk of being obvious,the guidelines bind judges and courts in the exercise of their uncontested responsibility to pass sentence in criminal cases.mistretta,at.see also stinson united states,d quoting mistretta.
under the act,the sentencing court must impose a sentence within the guideline range absent a finding made as to an aggravating or mitigating circumstance not adequately considered under the guidelines.stinson,at.quoting a,b c see also sentencing guidelines manual,ch.pt.a,pursuant to the act,the sentencing court must select a sentence from within the guideline range,so long as the case does not present atypical features warranting a departure.commentary found in the sentencing guidelines manual is authoritative unless it violates the constitution or a federal statute,or is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that guideline.stinson,at.
because the guideline range is law that binds the sentencing court,we believe that the maximum sentence justifiable under the guidelines if less than the maximum sentence authorized under the applicable penal statute,is the prescribed maximum sentence to which a defendant may be exposed and sentenced.following apprendi and thomas,therefore,if drug quantity is used to trigger a mandatory minimum sentence that exceeds the top of the guideline range that the district court would otherwise have calculated based on the court factual findings,with or without departures,that quantity must be charged in the indictment and submitted to the jury.apprendi,at.thomas,at.
the month sentence was imposed on guevara solely on the basis of the minimum sentence mandated by b a i the applicability of subsection a depended in turn on the district judge preponderance finding as to drug quantity and the month sentence exceeded the otherwise applicable range of penalties to which guevara was exposed by the findings made beyond a reasonable doubt by his jury,the guideline range of to months.we conclude therefore that the month sentence was constitutionally impermissible.see united states ramirez,cir w hen a defendant is found guilty of violating a,he must be sentenced under b c unless the jury has found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the minimum amounts required by b a and b b.
because guevara was convicted of a crime involving an indeterminate quantity of drugs,he must be sentenced under b c.this provision mandates no minimum sentence so pursuant to c,guevara sentence was required to fall within his guideline range.
it appears that our conclusion aligns this circuit on one side of a circuit split.
the only circuit so far as we can tell that has addressed the narrow issue presented in our,where a defendant sentence falls within the range of penalties authorized under the penal statute but exceeds the top of the applicable guideline range based on a judge finding of drug quantity by a united states harris,cir,cert.granted,d,wl,term.
the defendant in harris had been convicted of carrying a firearm in relation to drug trafficking under c a.at.upon the district court determination that harris had brandished the firearm,he was sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of seven years under c a ii,rather than the five year mandatory minimum sentence he otherwise would have received under c a i.id.the harris court rejected the defendant challenge to his sentence under apprendi on the ground that apprendi only applies to sentences beyond the prescribed statutory maximum,id.at quoting united states pratt,cir,and c a contains no statutory maximum.relevant to our case is the reference in the harris opinion to the defendant argument that,absent the district court finding that he brandished the firearm,he most likely would not have received a sentence in excess of five years under the sentencing guidelines.without mentioning harris applicable guideline range,the court rejected his argument the relevant maximum under apprendi is found on the face of the statute rather than in the sentencing guidelines.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
a number of circuits have articulated the broad rule that apprendi is not implicated where a sentence falls within the maximum sentence prescribed in the applicable penal statute.some courts have articulated this holding with respect to the federal narcotics statute,others in the context of different federal statutes with escalating penalties however,these cases have not recited facts to show that they faced the circumstances presented here where the finding of fact results in a mandatory minimum that exceeds the top of the guideline range.the procedural circumstance in which guevara has been caught up is,relatively speaking,a rare bird.thus,while these holdings could be read as contrary to our view,it also appears that they have not considered the precise issue that we must decide.
the sixth and ninth circuits are on the side of the circuit split with which we align ourselves.the sixth circuit evidently reaches the same result we do because it holds that a defendant convicted of an offense under a involving an indeterminate quantity of drugs must be sentenced under b c and in accordance with the sentencing guidelines.the ninth circuit adopts a broader principle than we are inclined to follow,and procedurally,is not on all fours with guevara case 
in united states ramirez,cir,rehearing en banc denied,the defendant was charged with conspiring to distribute cocaine and attempting to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute.neither count specified drug quantity,and quantity was not an issue submitted to the jury.id.at.at the sentencing,however,the district judge found that the conspiracy involved more than five kilograms of cocaine,and therefore sentenced the defendant a prior drug felon to a mandatory minimum sentence of months under b a.id.the published opinion does not indicate ramirez applicable guideline range.the relevant statutory maximum under b c was months,and ramirez actual sentence fell within this range.
ramirez appealed,and the sixth circuit ruled that under apprendi,the district judge finding of drug quantity and imposition of a month mandatory minimum sentence was impermissible 
w hen a defendant is found guilty of violating a,he must be sentenced under b c unless the jury has found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the minimum amounts required by b a and b b.because in this case the government did not charge or attempt to prove to the jury a quantity of drugs that would permit a mandatory sentence,we remand this case to the district court with instructions to sentence the defendant under b c and in accordance with the sentencing guidelines.
id.at emphasis added.
the idea that apprendi is never implicated if a sentence falls within the maximum sentence prescribed in the applicable penal statute,although found persuasive or spoken in dicta by other courts,does not rest on supreme court precedent.true,apprendi held that a fact that increases a penalty beyond the prescribed maximum must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,but apprendi also held that i t is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.apprendi,at.apprendi validated the sentencing judge discretion to consider factors such as drug quantity for purposes of guidelines calculations and at the same time held that a legislature can not remove from the jury facts that increase a defendant sentence beyond the prescribed maximum.in so doing,apprendi left room for the conclusion that once the guideline range is calculated,facts that increase a defendant sentence above this must be found by a jury.as the sixth circuit has stated 
t here is a substantial difference in penalty based on drug quantities when a statute moves the penalty from a maximum penalty of or years or life to a mandatory minimum penalty of the same length because a life sentence is not mandatory under the latter provision.
ramirez,at citing and quoting united states flowal,cir.
our holding does not invalidate statutory mandatory minimum sentences based on facts found by the judge under a preponderance standard.in mcmillan pennsylvania,d,which the apprendi court declined to overrule the supreme court considered a pennsylvania statute that subjected a defendant to a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison if a judge found,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the defendant had visibly possessed a firearm during the commission of the underlying offense.at.the court rejected petitioners claims that the prosecution had to prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant visibly possessed a firearm,and affirmed the holding below finding the statute constitutional.id.at.
mcmillan authorizes mandatory minimum sentences,but like apprendi,mcmillan arose under state law,without sentencing guidelines,so that the only range of penalties to which the defendants were exposed was the range in the penal statute.because the mandatory minimum sentence of five years fell within that range,the defendants sentences did not exceed the otherwise applicable prescribed range of penalties the mandatory minimum operate d solely to limit the sentencing court discretion in selecting a penalty within the range already available to it mcmillan,at.
in guevara case,the mandatory minimum term imposed by the district court exceeded the otherwise applicable range.thus,our holding is consistent with mcmillan indeed,in limiting mcmillan to cases that do not involve the imposition of a sentence more severe than the statutory maximum for the offense established by the jury verdict,apprendi,at,the supreme court acknowledged the distinction on which we rely.other mandatory minimum cases are distinguishable for the same reason,as demonstrated in the margin 
we review guevara challenge to his sentence for plain error pursuant to.b since he failed to raise this objection below.see thomas,at.this requires guevara to demonstrate error,that is plain,and that affect s substantial rights.johnson united states,d quoting united states olano,d internal quotation marks omitted,alteration in original.if all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error,but only if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at.quoting olano,at.internal quotation marks omitted,alteration in original.
guevara indictment alleged that he committed acts constituting a violation of b a,but since the issue of drug quantity was explicitly taken away from the jury by the judge charge,the jury did not convict guevara of acts constituting a violation of b a.rather,because drug quantity was not put to the jury,guevara was found guilty of violating b c.since guevara was sentenced to months in prison under b a based on the district judge drug quantity finding,however,guevara sentence was months greater than the maximum sentence he otherwise could have received,thus constituting error.
an error is plain if it is clear or obvious at the time of appellate consideration.johnson,at.an error is clear if the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal.johnson,at.
we conclude that the error was plain in light of apprendi,opinions in this circuit and others concluding that specific threshold drug quantities are elements of the offense that must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in order for a defendant sentence to exceed the prescribed statutory maximum to which he would otherwise be exposed,the conclusion reached in the sixth circuit and the appeal in this case that guevara must be sentenced under the provision for which he was convicted,and our conclusion that guevara sentence can not exceed the top of his guideline range based on a judge finding by a preponderance.
to show that the plain error impaired his substantial rights,guevara must establish prejudice that affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.united states gore,cir 
more or less as in thomas,the error in this case is the incongruency between the crime found by the jury b c and the crime for which guevara was sentenced b a.thomas,at.as the thomas en banc determined,the consequence of this error can be viewed either as a sentencing error,that guevara was sentenced to a penalty greater than the one authorized by congress for the crime of which he was convicted or as a defective conviction because the crime of conviction,b a,was not found by the jury,at.we,like the thomas court,decline to resolve this issue because under either view guevara has demonstrated that the error affected his substantial rights,at.
if the error is a sentencing error,the prejudice is clear.the facts found by a jury supported a penalty under b c and upon calculation of his guideline range,guevara faced a sentence of to months.instead,he was sentenced to months under b a,months more than the applicable maximum.
if we consider that the error inhered in the conviction,the proceedings below were defective because the jury was not permitted to make a finding of an essential element of the crime drug quantity,see,at,the district judge constructively amended the indictment as follows.in charging the jury that drug quantity was not an element of the offense and need not be proven,the court created a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have been convicted of an offense other than that charged in the indictment.united states delano,cir quoting united states mollica,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a constructive amendment is a per se prejudicial violation of the grand jury clause of the constitution.thomas,at united states frank,cir.thus,viewed either as a sentencing error or a conviction error,guevara has demonstrated prejudice.
having satisfied the first three prongs of olano,we must now determine whether to exercise our discretion to notice the plain error,which we may do if the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceed
