this case crystalizes the difficulties confronted by district court they navigate the turbulent waters of booker and its aftermath.see united states booker,d.the defendant,antron russell,has already been sentenced three times following his guilty plea on a charge of distributing crack cocaine.prior to the supreme court decision in booker,russell was sentenced to months of imprisonment,the bottom of the applicable guideline range.after we remanded for resentencing in light of booker,he was sentenced to months,a downward variance based upon a ratio that the district court substituted for the ratio under the guideline regime for offenses involving crack as opposed to powder cocaine.we subsequently rejected the calculation of variances based upon the categorical substitution of a ratio for the ratio embedded in the sentencing guidelines in united states pho,cir.accordingly,russell sentence was vacated.upon remand,he was sentenced to months.
russell now appeals that sentence,contending that it is not reasonable.while his appeal was pending before us,the supreme court decided kimbrough united states,d,holding that it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the disparity yields a sentence greater than necessary to achieve a purposes,even in a case.id.at.russell seeks to parlay kimbrough into a fourth sentencing.because we conclude that the district court anticipated the holding in kimbrough,considered the disparity as part of its individualized a analysis at the most recent sentencing,and imposed a reasonable sentence,we affirm.
russell was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in excess of fifty grams,in violation of a and b a he entered a guilty plea pursuant to a plea agreement,stipulating that the quantity of cocaine base involved in the offense and related conduct totaled grams.in exchange,the government agreed to recommend the lowest prison term within the applicable guideline range,advocate for either a two or decrease for acceptance of responsibility,and refrain from filing for a sentence enhancement under and seeking an official victim enhancement under of the sentencing guidelines.
at the plea colloquy,the government reviewed the factual basis for the plea.on march,local police learned that a man fitting russell description was planning to sell crack at a mcdonald restaurant in cranston,rhode island.at the scheduled time,russell arrived at the mcdonald parking lot in a car driven by a woman.police officers approached both sides of the car and removed the driver.as this was happening,russell reached over from the passenger seat and drove the car forward and backward in an attempt to escape.three officers were struck by the car,and the police ultimately opened fire on the car to stop it.russell was carrying grams of crack cocaine in his pocket.at the colloquy,russell also admitted to selling additional quantities of crack cocaine,totaling grams,to undercover officers on three prior occasions in late and early.
at the first sentencing hearing,held on august,the district court calculated russell applicable guideline sentencing range based on the stipulated drug quantities,russell base offense level was set at.the court found that a reduction for timely acceptance of responsibility and a enhancement for reckless endangerment,pursuant to,were appropriate,yielding a total offense level of.russell criminal history points placed him in criminal history category chc vi,producing a guideline sentencing range of to months.
russell objected to the enhancement for reckless endangerment on the ground that,in light of blakely washington,d,the government had not met its burden of proving the facts predicate to the enhancement beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.the court rejected this view,stating that there was no blakely issue because in the plea colloquy the government outlined all of the facts that are alleged to support this enhancement and russell had agreed to that outline.the court imposed a sentence,the lowest sentence available within the guideline range 
russell appealed his first sentence based on the blakely issue.however,while the appeal was pending,the supreme court decided booker and the government conceded that a remand was required for resentencing under an advisory guideline regime.we accepted that concession and remanded.
in his written submissions and at the second sentencing hearing,held on october,russell asked the court to impose a applicable mandatory minimum.russell asserted that a sentence would better serve the interest of rehabilitation than the much longer guideline sentence.he also claimed that his criminal history score was overstated and argued that the ratio for crack versus powder cocaine embedded within the sentencing guidelines was unjust.the government countered by highlighting russell long list of adult arrests and convictions and noting that the three short prison sentences he had served previously had not deterred his criminal conduct.the government also contended that it should be left to congress,not the courts,to modify or even abrogate in its entirety the sentencing distinctions between crack cocaine and powder cocaine,and noted that if different district courts used different ratios to calculate sentences for crack cocaine,substantial sentencing disparities would arise.the government advocated for the reimposition of a sentence.
the district court stated its categorical disagreement with the ratio in the sentencing guidelines.the court stated that a ratio,which would have produced a to guideline range in russell case,should be used to guide the application of the advisory guidelines.the court then considered the factors and imposed a sentence of months.
russell appealed this sentence,arguing that it was unreasonable even though it was substantially below the applicable guideline sentencing range.the government,arguing that the district court categorical rejection of the ratio violated our holding in united states pho,cir a case decided about two months after russell second sentence was imposed.we remanded for resentencing in light of pho without addressing the reasonableness of the sentence.
russell filed a motion to continue his third sentencing pending the supreme court decision in claiborne united states,d and the final approval of amendments proposed by the sentencing commission to the guidelines applicable to crack cocaine offenses the court denied the continuance,and then explained at the third sentencing hearing on may,that it had concluded that a continuance was unnecessary because it has substantial discretion to vary from the guideline sentence,notwithstanding our rejection of categorical ratio substitutions in pho.the court also concluded that it could take into account the proposed crack cocaine guideline amendments in considering the overall reasonableness of russell sentence.however,the court explained that it had undervalued several aggravating factors at the previous sentencing.the court particularly noted the large amount of crack cocaine involved and russell violent escape attempt,which had forced officers to fire their weapons in a busy mcdonald parking lot,where children might have been endangered.the court imposed a sentence.
russell then filed this appeal,claiming that his sentence was unreasonable.while the appeal was pending,the supreme court decided kimbrough.russell argues that the kimbrough decision further supports his contention that his sentence was unreasonably high.the government counters by asserting that the district court anticipated the holding in kimbrough and properly considered all of the relevant factors in making the individualized determination called for by a we agree.
we review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion,but we first consider whether the court below committed a significant procedural error,such as treating the guidelines as mandatory.united states decologero,cir quoting gall united states,d.accordingly,we turn first to russell contention that the district court committed a procedural error by failing to consider the cocaine disp
