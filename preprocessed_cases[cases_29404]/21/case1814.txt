defendant james gaines defendant or appellant was convicted,following a jury trial,of violating g,a statute that makes it unlawful for a person having previously been convicted of a felony to possess a firearm.judgment on this conviction was entered on september,in the united states district court for the western district of new york skretny,and defendant was sentenced to months imprisonment.from this judgment,defendant appeals.we affirm.
a crucial piece of evidence used by the prosecutor at trial was a statement gaines made to the arresting officers.because defendant is illiterate,his lawyer declares on appeal that this fact,under all the circumstances,should have resulted in a finding that the voluntariness of the statement is inherently tainted.the subsequent motion to suppress that statement should have been granted,counsel continues,because the confession was obtained in violation of defendant fifth amendment right to remain silent.we agree that the inability of an accused to read or write is a factor to be considered in deciding the voluntariness of a confession.but that inability by itself does not mean a suspect can not make a knowing,intelligent and voluntary waiver of his right to remain silent.here we are persuaded,as was the district court,that gaines knew full well what he was doing.he heard the statement,knew what it meant,and freely agreed to it.
background 
the conviction in this case stems from a sting operation involving a police informant.in january the informant revealed to the federal bureau of investigation career criminal task force task force that defendant was looking for handguns.at the behest of the government,the informant set up an appointment with gaines to make a sale.on the day of the appointment,february,members of the task force outfitted a truck with surveillance equipment and put a box containing three guns within reach of the front seats.the informant then drove to gaines home where defendant climbed into the truck.after inspecting the weapons,defendant decided to purchase all three,but asked for time to obtain the purchase price.the informant agreed,but refused to allow gaines to take the guns until he had paid for them.
a short while later the informant returned,and gaines climbed into the truck again.once inside,gaines asked for the guns to be left in the box and paid the agreed upon.the informant accepted the money and told gaines that it was a done deal,which was the signal to the surveillance team that the transaction was complete.unfortunately,the members of the fbi task force monitoring the sting were unable to hear the of faulty no one moved in to make an arrest.unsure of what to do,the informant stalled gaines by having him look under the dashboard for a additional gun.meanwhile,the government agents called the informant on his cell phone which allowed him to confirm that the transaction was complete.the agents then arrested gaines.
once defendant was arrested,a member of the task force,agent robert wilson,reportedly had a short conversation with him about cooperating with the government.gaines was later interviewed by a different member of the task force,detective robert williams.although the facts surrounding this interview are in dispute,it is clear that defendant made an inculpatory statement about the day events,which was memorialized by williams.as a result gaines was convicted on a indictment charging him as a felon with unlawful possession of firearms.
discussion 
gaines raises several issues on appeal.these relate to his motion to suppress his statement,the sufficiency of the evidence and other trial matters,and his sentencing.we discuss each of them.
i suppression of statement 
defendant argues that his statement should have been suppressed for three reasons.first,he contends he was not read his miranda rights second,he is unable to read,which he asserts renders his confession inherently tainted and thus involuntary and third,he alleges that his statement was impermissibly coerced by a deceitful promise of leniency in exchange for cooperation.
miranda instructs generally that an uncounseled statement made by a defendant during custodial interrogation should be suppressed from use by the government in its unless the prosecution proves that the suspect voluntarily waived his right to counsel and privilege against.miranda arizona,d.more specifically,when the government seeks to admit such statements at trial,it must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant relinquished his rights voluntarily with a full awareness of the rights being waived and the consequences of doing so.united states male juvenile,cir.when evaluating voluntariness,we have no per se rule that bars oral or implicit waivers,north carolina butler,d,but rather,make a determination based upon the totality of the circumstances,tankleff senkowski,cir.
if,however,a defendant is not advised of his miranda rights prior to making his custodial statement,an irrebuttable presumption of compulsion arises and the state can not show that the suspect waived his rights voluntarily.oregon elstad,d.a trial court conclusions regarding the constitutionality of a defendant waiver of his right to remain silent is reviewed de novo on appeal the underlying findings of fact are reviewed for clear error.see united states spencer,cir per curiam.
gaines first contends the arresting officers did not inform him of his right to counsel and privilege against before taking a statement from him,which,if found to be true,would create an irrebuttable presumption of compulsion.for circumstantial support of his version of the facts,appellant asserts the fbi task force made a number of mistakes in the course of their sting operation,such as failing to ensure that all of the surveillance equipment was in proper working order.if some of the portions of the sting were performed improperly,gaines reasons,then it must follow detective williams improperly interrogated him as well.additionally,defendant points to a number of memory lapses on williams part concerning some of the specifics of the arrest,such as the detective inability to recall whether he had asked gaines any questions at the scene of the crime.defendant urges us to draw an inference of dishonesty from these lapses in memory.
at the suppression hearing detective williams testified that he read to defendant from a treasury department form that spelled out the miranda warnings in detail,and that gaines verbally acknowledged his understanding of the rights read to him.since gaines does not contest the adequacy of the treasury department form,this dispute is limited to the factual questions of whether williams actually read the form to defendant and whether defendant acknowledged having been read his rights.
while it would be preferable to have physical evidence supporting williams testimony,such as gaines signature of acknowledgment as was obtained on gaines statement,defendant points to no evidence that would establish clear error on the part of the district court in choosing to credit williams testimony over gaines.while defendant describes the sting operation as a comedy of errors,the errors defendant points the task force failure properly to maintain the surveillance not probative on the issue of credibility.given the lack of contrary proof,we rely on the district court findings because of its better vantage point from which to assess credibility.see united states rosa,cir assessments of the credibility of witnesses are the province of the district court,and we are not entitled to overturn those assessments on appeal.
next,gaines maintains that because he is unable to read or write,his inculpatory statement is inherently tainted and thus involuntary under the totality of the circumstances.because defendant counsel only raises this issue in a section heading and all but ignores it in his discussion,we would normally find the issue to have been waived.see norton sam club,cir issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal.nonetheless,giving defendant the benefit of the doubt on whether the issue was preserved,the unde
