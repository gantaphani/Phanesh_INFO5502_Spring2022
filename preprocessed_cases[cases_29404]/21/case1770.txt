appeal from a judgment entered on april,in the united states district court for the northern district of new york,scullin.the defendant pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine base in violation of a and b c and was sentenced principally to months imprisonment.this appeal addresses the district court decision to apply an enhancement pursuant to for obstruction of justice,its denial of credit for acceptance of responsibility,and its refusal to grant the defendant motion for a downward departure based on his alleged cooperation with the government.
background 
the charges and brown decision to cease contact with the dea agents 
michael brown was arrested on december,after authorities retrieved from him a bag containing grams of crack cocaine.later that day,a criminal complaint was filed against brown in federal court.he made his initial appearance before a magistrate judge and was released on a personal recognizance bond in anticipation of his cooperation with drug enforcement administration dea agents.the record does not reveal a formal,written cooperation agreement executed by the parties.on that same day,the magistrate judge set conditions of release,which required,among other things,that brown report to the dea on a regular basis,and that he obtain the dea permission to travel outside of the northern district of new york.
brown maintained regular contact with the dea for approximately two months,at which point his whereabouts became unknown.on february,a fugitive warrant was issued for brown arrest.while the probation department later determined that brown had left the jurisdiction for a short period of time,allegedly to visit his mother,he ultimately was apprehended in the northern district of new york approximately five weeks later.on the government motion,brown bail subsequently was revoked.on april,a grand jury returned an indictment charging brown with one count of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of a and b c.thereafter,on september,brown entered into a plea agreement with the government and entered a plea of guilty in district court.
presentence interview and report 
in his presentence interview,brown told the probation department that following his release from custody in december,and pursuant to his unwritten agreement to cooperate,he obtained contact information,made calls,and purchased narcotics at the direction of the dea.he related to the probation department that after approximately two months,the dea wanted him to buy off anybody,meaning that he was asked to enter into drug transactions with a larger number and greater variety of people than he was accustomed.brown explained that this placed him in danger because people on the street knew he did not operate like that.he stated that because he felt that his life was in danger,he ceased his cooperation.
the presentence report psr recommended that an enhancement be applied pursuant to for brown alleged obstruction of justice,and that he be denied any credit for acceptance of responsibility under and its commentary.the psr stated that by disobeying an order of the court to report to agents and becoming a fugitive from justice,brown willfully obstructed the administration of justice during the course of the investigation and prosecution of the instant offense of conviction,and the obstructive conduct related to brown offense of conviction.explaining its recommendation that brown not receive a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,the psr noted that the guidelines suggest that a defendant who receives an obstruction enhancement under section ordinarily is ineligible for credit under section.see,cmt.accordingly,the psr recommendation that brown not receive credit under section was based solely on the application of the obstruction enhancement,as opposed to specific facts contained in the psr.
the sentencing and brown motion for a downward departure 
prior to sentencing,brown counsel objected to the enhancement as well as the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility.brown also moved for a downward departure based on his brief cooperation,claiming as the government later conceded that the information he provided led to portions of the indictment in united states bermudez,et,cr.in his motion,brown reiterated that he cooperated as much as he possibly could with the dea agents until he started feeling as if he was being put in danger.thus,brown argued,he did not cease contact purposely to violate the law he ceased contact because he feared for his safety.in response,the government maintained that the agents never placed brown in harm way,and that it was brown who put himself in danger.to support its contention in this respect,the government was prepared to present testimony from the agent who had primary contact with brown.
the district court did not take any testimony to determine whether brown ceased cooperation and left the jurisdiction with the intent to obstruct justice.rather,it denied brown motion for a downward departure and adopted the psr recommendation that he receive no credit for acceptance of responsibility and that his sentence be enhanced based on his obstruction of justice.specifically,the district court commented 
i do think i can give acceptance having found,and i agree,with the obstruction of justice,by fleeing when he was supposed to be cooperating.there no question that this obstructed the justice,the investigation,prosecution of cases.so i concur with the probation department in that respect as well.
in calculating brown sentence,the district court set brown base offense level at.it then added the enhancement,bringing brown adjusted offense level to.when combined with his criminal history score of vi,brown received a range of to months imprisonment.the court sentenced brown to months imprisonment,a term of supervised release,and a special assessment.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
i.the enhancementa.standard of review 
the imposition of an enhancement is subject to a mixed standard of review.see united states cassiliano,cir.as such,we must accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous.united states woodard,cir internal quotation marks omitted.however,a ruling that those facts constitute obstruction or attempted obstruction under the guidelines is a matter of legal interpretation and is to be reviewed de novo.cassiliano,at.
specific intent required for enhancement 
section of the sentencing guidelines provides for a increase in offense level if 
a the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice during the course of the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,and b the obstructive conduct related to i the defendant offense of conviction and any relevant conduct or ii a closely related offense.
we have repeatedly held that an enhancement under is appropriate only if the district court makes a finding that the defendant had the specific intent to obstruct justice,that the defendant consciously acted with the purpose of obstructing justice.woodard,at internal quotation marks omitted.see also united states bradbury,cir vacating sentence and remanding for resentencing where district court did not make required finding concerning defendant state of mind before applying enhancement united states reed,cir same.such a finding is essential,as we have recognized that the term willfully implies a mens rea requirement.reed,at.when making a finding as to a defendant specific intent to obstruct justice,a district court may look to and rely on circumstantial evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence.see united states carty,cir.
here,prior to sentencing,brown filed a motion for a downward departure in which he elaborated on his objections to the psr recommendations.in his motion,he maintained that he stopped cooperating with the dea only when he began to feel the agents were putting his life in danger by requesting that he make purchases in obvious places from peopl
