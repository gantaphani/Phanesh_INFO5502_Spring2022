john maynard and jill ludwig appeal the restitution component of judgments entered following their guilty pleas on a series of bank robberies.pursuant to the mandatory victims restitution act of mvra,stat.codified at,the united states district court for the district of vermont reiss,imposed restitution in an amount consisting of the money taken in the robberies and additional expenses incurred by one of the victim banks.maynard and ludwig object only to restitution for these additional expenses as falling outside the provisions of the mvra.for the following reasons,we vacate the restitution component of the judgments and remand to the district court.
background 
maynard and ludwig robbed five banks between september and november each time,one of the two entered the bank alone,passed a note to the teller claiming possession of a gun,and demanded money.each robbery lasted only a few minutes.nobody was harmed.
the couple was arrested hours after the last robbery on november.they were indicted on three counts and one count of conspiracy.ludwig pled guilty on august,to one charge of bank robbery in violation of a.the next month,maynard pled guilty to conspiracy in violation of.the two were sentenced in december.
in the sentencing phase,the government sought restitution under the mvra,pursuant to.more than half of the proposed restitution was to repay the money taken during the robberies,and is uncontested on appeal.the rest included certain expenses paid by merchants bank,of which the following are the subject of this appeal paid for the bank regular staff,and the pay of replacement staff mileage expenses for the replacement staff the cost of wanted posters and the cost of a temporary security guard at the bank after the robbery.
at separate sentencing hearings,the merchants bank teller testified about the anxiety and emotional harm she suffered as a result of being held up.at maynard hearing only,the bank security officer,robert,testified that the regular staff was sent home the day of the robbery because the bank was a crime scene,and that the bank did not reopen until it was released by law enforcement at the end of the day.on the two days following,the bank operated with temporary replacements while the regular staff was given paid leave to handle any trauma associated with the robbery.he explained that this was the bank usual practice,and that taking care of employees in that way served a business purpose.
maynard and ludwig contested the inclusion of the bank expenses in the restitution order.the court found,however,that the expenses claimed could be compensated because they were directly and proximately caused by the because they were directly and proximately caused by the robbery.the couple was sentenced,inter alia,to pay restitution in the amount of jointly and severally.this amount included the expenses incurred by merchants bank listed above.
discussion 
while the mvra serves the broad policy purpose of assisting the victims of crime,it also enumerates the specific losses compensable in a mandatory restitution order.maynard and ludwig argue that merchants bank expenses are not subject to restitution because they are not among these enumerated harms.
prior to,federal courts were not permitted to order restitution outside the probation context.see united states amato,cir.the victim and witness protection act of vwpa,stat.currently codified,as amended by the mvra,at,afforded courts discretion to impose restitution for specified kinds of harm.see amato,at.
the victims rights movement later inspired a review of the judiciary use of restitution.in,congress passed the mvra to help victims and to hold offenders accountable for the losses they inflict see,at.
the mvra made restitution mandatory for a broad swath of offenses see a,c.the purpose of the mvra is to make victims of crime whole,to fully compensate these victims for their losses and to restore these victims to their original state of.united states boccagna,cir quoting united states simmonds,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
when the mvra controls,a court shall require the defendant to pay restitution for the harms listed in the statute.b no other expense reimbursement is made mandatory.there is no provision in giving the district court discretion to order any other restitution.
the broad scope of the mvra is subject to some limitations.only a victim or the victim estate is entitled to restitution.see a.the term victim is defined as a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense for which restitution may be ordered.a.this causation principle also governs the calculation of reimbursable loss.see united states gushlak,cir.and only a victim actual loss is compensable,not losses that are hypothetical or speculative.id.at.
the procedures by which the sentencing court imposes a restitution order are set forth in.united states marino,cir see also d.among other things,this section prevents restitution from being conditioned or limited by a defendant ability to pay in each order of restitution,the court shall order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim losses as determined by the court and without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.f a emphasis added.
the decisive issue on this appeal is whether expenses other than those enumerated in b are compensable under the mvra.we conclude they are not.
we begin our interpretation of a federal statute with the statutory text.city of new york permanent mission of india to the united nations,cir.it is apparent from the text of that unlisted harms are not compensable in restitution.because courts have no inherent authority to order restitution,congress must provide the authority.see united states casamento,cir.congress did so through the mvra,but chose to include only the four categories of harms listed in b.if congress intended to include all harms directly and proximately caused by a defendant offense,it could have done so with wording more simple and categorical.applying the rule of statutory construction inclusio unius est exclusio alterius that to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of the other it follows that congress intended to limit the restitutable harms covered by the mvra.united states tappin,cir.
the government reliance on the statutory mandate to impose restitution in the full amount of each victim losses,f a,is misplaced.the mvra provides that is procedural rather than substantive.see d see also united states cliatt,cir stating can not trump substantive restitution provisions because it is only a procedural mechanism.furthermore,the context of this clause is that the full amount of loss be determined without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant.f a.the provision emphasizes only that courts may not decrease restitution to account for the defendant ability to pay.taken thus in context,this clause can not serve as the government springboard for restitution more broad than the text specifies.
the government seems to suggest that any and all losses are compensable to the extent that they were directly and proximately caused by a defendant offense.however,the requirements of direct and proximate causation,see,marino,at,are necessary conditions for restitution under the mvra not sufficient ones.as the statute makes clear,the harm must also come within one of the categories enumerated in b.
the government cases do not support a broader application of the mvra.many are mere applications of b,which allows reimbursement for property loss.see,united states qurashi,cir allowing prejudgment interest for funds paid out of life insurance funds to ensure the victim received the full amount of their losses united states donaby,cir damage to police car in chase after bank robbery.
we now consider whether the specific costs incurred by merchants bank fall within the enumerated harms of b.
in the wake of the robbery,the bank was closed as a crime scene for the afternoon,and the bank regular staff stayed home the following two days to get over any stress caused by the incident.the district court ordered maynard and ludwig to pay re
