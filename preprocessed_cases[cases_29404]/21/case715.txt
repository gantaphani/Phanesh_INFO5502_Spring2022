carlos jaca nazario jaca pled guilty to conspiring to transport cocaine in two separate criminal cases.he was sentenced by a different judge for each plea.he makes a variety of claims on appeal,some directed at one sentence,some at the other,and some at both.because we find that the district court erred in its determination of whether the conduct underlying each case was,in the parlance of the federal sentencing guidelines,relevant conduct as to the sentencing of the other,we vacate both sentences and remand for resentencing.
jaca pled guilty in both proceedings we therefore recite the facts as contained in the presentence reports psrs,sentencing memoranda,and transcripts of the sentencing hearings.see united states marks,cir.we reserve discussion of some facts relevant to particular arguments.
jaca was a taxi driver who had connections among the workers at marin airport in san juan,puerto rico.he would take bags filled with cocaine and through this network of accomplices ensure that they were put on airplanes bound for the mainland united states.this operation came under scrutiny by two separate investigations at around the same time.
from february to july,jaca transported what he believed to be cocaine for a woman named vanessa.vanessa was cooperating with authorities the cocaine was a dummy.jaca and his crew placed twenty kilos of this sham cocaine on a flight in february.federal agents in charge of the investigation contrived to have that shipment lost,enabling some hardball tactics by vanessa,about which we will say more later.a successful shipment of another twenty kilos followed in march.in july,jaca twice handled more cocaine for vanessa both attempts failed only because an accomplice did not load the sham cocaine on the airplane.for the sake of clarity,we refer to these activities collectively as the sham cocaine smuggling.
the day after the last attempt to ship cocaine for vanessa,jaca and his crew placed thirty kilos of real cocaine on an airplane bound for new york as part of a conspiracy to move a large quantity of cocaine through puerto rico to the mainland.neither vanessa nor the government were involved.we will refer to this conduct as the real cocaine smuggling.
an indictment for the real cocaine smuggling issued in september,it charged some of the other conspirators with moving as much as kilos of cocaine.the indictment for the sham cocaine smuggling issued in march.
different district court judges presided over the two cases.jaca moved to consolidate the cases,but the motion was denied he was the only defendant common to both.after refusing a plea deal of eleven years for both cases,jaca eventually made straight guilty pleas.he moved,again unsuccessfully,to consolidate the two sentencing hearings.
jaca entered a guilty plea for his role in the sham cocaine smuggling three days before trial was to begin.at sentencing,he was found to have participated in the transport of not less than but not more than kilos of cocaine.with acceptance of responsibility and a safety valve reduction in offense level,he was sentenced to months,the bottom of the appropriate guideline sentencing range of to months.in issuing this sentence the first sentence,the district court expressly declined to consider the pending charges in the other indictment.
the indictment for the real cocaine smuggling likewise ended in a guilty plea.the district court declined to consider the sham cocaine smuggling as relevant conduct in calculating the total quantity of drugs for sentencing purposes.the court,however,did give jaca the benefit of the safety valve reduction,sentencing him the second sentence to months.the court also exercised its discretion to pronounce a partially concurrent sentence.see.in order to credit jaca for time already served,the second sentence was deemed to have run concurrently with the first sentence from the date of jaca incarceration until the date of the second eleven months.the remainder of the second sentence was to run consecutively to the first sentence.the second sentence therefore would start,run for around eleven months concurrently with the first,and then stop for a little more than nine years,only to start again when the first sentence was finished.
jaca contends that the district court erred by not considering the sham cocaine smuggling to be relevant conduct in the second sentence that because the sham cocaine smuggling was relevant conduct in the second sentence,the district court erred in not imposing a fully concurrent sentence as required by b that the second sentence constitutes a suspended sentence expressly forbidden by b a that the district court erred in not considering a sentencing entrapment argument,or that,to the extent it did consider the argument,the district court erred in not finding sentencing entrapment and that the government refused to move for a reduction in bad faith,and therefore the district court should have granted the reduction without the motion we will examine these in turn.
relevant conduct 
on appeal,jaca maintains that the sham cocaine smuggling was relevant conduct to the second sentence,and therefore the second sentence should run entirely concurrent with the first.this argument necessarily has two parts first,that the conduct was relevant under and second,that concurrent sentencing was mandated under b.the first part of this argument has independent force and requires remand for resentencing.we decline to reach the second question,noting only that the second part of this argument may depend on which version of the guidelines is used for sentencing.
the threshold question is whether jaca conduct in the sham cocaine smuggling was relevant to the second sentence in the required sense.since jaca raised the argument below we review for clear error.united states joost,cir.
in sentencing jaca for the real cocaine smuggling,the district court treated the sham cocaine smuggling as relevant conduct for some purposes but not for others.we can not accept this approach.the district court granted a dispensation from the mandatory minimum sentence under the safety valve provision.but that provision benefits only defendants who have not more than criminal history point.a.jaca prior sentencing in the sham cocaine smuggling would have yielded more than one criminal history point he could not then be treated as a first offender in the second sentencing.this apparent incongruity is resolved,however,by the psr for the real cocaine smuggling.it recommended that jaca receive the safety valve provision for the second sentence as well as the first,because the sham cocaine smuggling was conduct that is part of relevant conduct for this offense.indeed,the district court could only grant the safety valve a second time if it considered this relevant conduct under but requires that all relevant conduct be taken into account in sentencing,so the drug quantities should have been aggregated in fact,the government made this argument,unsuccessfully,in its objection to the second psr,requesting that the amounts be aggregated and the base offense level thereby increased.because the district court evidently considered the sham cocaine smuggling to be relevant conduct for the purposes of granting the second safety valve,but did not consider it relevant conduct for the purposes of calculating offense level,we must vacate jaca second sentence.
the parties have also briefed the underlying question of whether the sham cocaine smuggling is indeed relevant conduct to the second sentence.we conclude that the two offenses do relate to the same course of conduct,and therefore vacate both sentences and remand so that each can properly account for this relevant conduct under.
determining whether the sham cocaine smuggling is relevant conduct for the purposes of the second sentence takes us on a hopscotch path through the guidelines.section of the guidelines defines relevant conduct.subsection a applies to offenses for which d would require grouping of multiple counts and makes relevant conduct all acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan.a.section d includes a list of provisions to which it applies section of the guidelines,under which jaca was sentenced,is included in this list.the sham cocaine smuggling,then,is relevant conduct if it is part of the same course of conduct or a common scheme or plan.closer inspection reveals that jaca various crimes are part of the same course of conduct.
for offenses to qualify as the same course of conduct,they must be sufficiently connected or related to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode,spree,or ongoing series of offenses,cmt.b.application note further directs the court to consider the degree of similarity between the two offenses,the regularity repetitions of the offenses,and the time interval between the two offenses.when one of the above factors is absent,a stronger presence of at least one other factor is required.id.see united states mallett,cir upholding district court finding that possessing the same drug and the same drug paraphernalia on two occasions eight months apart constituted same course of conduct united states wright,cir upholding district court finding that two similar transactions separated by seventeen days constituted same course of conduct.
jaca and his crew used the same means to place similar quantities of the same drug on the same airlines out of the same airport.and the last attempt in the sting occurred the day before the conduct at issue in the second sentence.while the regularity factor is somewhat attenuated,the strength of the similarity and temporality factors more than compensates.the district court,therefore,correctly considered the sham cocaine smuggling to be relevant conduct in the second sentence when it granted the safety valve.further,because the test for same course of conduct is by its terms symmetrical,the activity in the real cocaine smuggling must have been relevant conduct for the purposes of the first sentence.the contrary finding of the first sentencing court was,thus,clearly erroneous.we must therefore vacate both sentences and remand for resentencing 
ii.concurrent or partially concurrent sentencing 
jaca argues that the district court erred in applying c,which allows discretion in choosing a concurrent,partially concurrent,or consecutive sentence.he claims that instead b mandates a fully concurrent sentence.because we remand for resentencing,we consider the argument only long enough to note that this guideline changed after jaca committed these crimes but before he was sentenced for them.see united states lino,cir.we expect that the ex post facto clause requires application of the older guidelines if those would be more lenient.see b if the use of the guidelines manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced would violate the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution,the court shall use the guidelines manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was committed.united states harotunian,cir.
iii.suspended sentence 
although we vacate both sentences,we nonetheless address jaca suspended sentence argument for what guidance our comments may afford the district court on remand.convictions such as jaca may not result in suspended sentences jaca second sentence itself is not unclear the sole question is whether it is a suspended sentence.we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.united states frechette,cir.by common definition a suspended sentence is a definite sentence postponed so that the defendant is not required to serve his time in prison unless he commits another crime or violates some condition during a probationary period.united states gajdik,cir see also black law dictionary ed defining suspended sentence as a sentence postponed so that the defendant is not required to serve time unless he or she commits another crime or violates some other condition.here,the district court allowed jaca credit against the second sentence for time he had served before the second sentencing.the second sentence was retroactively deemed to have begun at the time the first sentence began,to have been served partially concurrently therewith until the date of the second sentencing the remainder of the second sentence was to be served consecutively to the first sentence.at no time would jaca be out of custody the balance of the second sentence would commence automatically when the first sentence ended.this type of sentence,even if unusual,does not constitute a suspended sentence.
iv.sentencing entrapment 
jaca next contends that the district court erred in rejecting the sentencing entrapment argument.because we find that jaca was not improperly induced to commit more,or more serious,crimes than those to which he was already predisposed,we agree with the district court that no improper manipulation occurred.the following additional facts provide the basis of jaca sentencing entrapment argument.
investigators working with vanessa arranged for the first shipment of sham cocaine to be lost.from this,more urgency was manufactured for subsequent frequently told jaca that she would be held responsible for the lost shipment.the transcripts of recorded conversations show vanessa telling jaca that she feared for her life.jaca at one point responded that he was losing sleep over the situation.he now argues that this kind of he had to help vanessa lest she be his will and caused him to commit additional offenses which then drove up his sentence.
we have used the terms sentencing entrapment and sentencing factor manipulation interchangeably.united states lora,d,citing united states woods,cir discussing varying use of the terms among the circuits.in sentencing factor manipulation cases,the burden of proof is upon the defendant to show that he is entitled to a reduction.united states montoya,cir citation omitted.the district court fact findings on this issue,as on other fact questions,are subject to the clearly erroneous standard.id.because this is such a inquiry,we extend deference even to the district court conclusion about whether or not the government has behaved outrageously or intolerably.id.stating that such a conclusion is not lightly to be disregarded.
jaca presses this argument two ways.first,he claims,it was error for the district court to refuse to entertain the sentencing manipulation claim.second,to the extent that the district court did entertain the claim,it erred in denying relief.neither avenue leads anywhere.
the record of the relevant sentencing hearing reveals that the district court did consider the argument,but rejected it.jaca relies on the statement by the district judge that,i not going to determine that in this.i have all the tapes there,and each one interprets the tapes whichever way they think,and i not going to get into any issue concerning whether the government has misconduct or not.we are invited to read this comment as a refusal even to entertain the argument.but a little later in the hearing,jaca counsel stated,i f you reject our sentencing manipulation argument,and i understand the court has,and the court responded,i have.later,the court said to the government,that was argument concerning the manipulation which i am not accepting.thus,the district court did consider the argument enough to reject it.
the merits of the sentencing entrapment argument itself are similarly unconvincing.an undercover operation may carry with it a risk that law enforcement will unduly pressure a suspect to commit crimes to which he is not predisposed.but sentencing entrapment does not occur unless law enforcement agents venture outside the scope of legitimate investigation and engage in extraordinary misconduct that improperly enlarges the scope or scale of the crime.united states barbour,cir.to establish a claim,the defendant must show that the agents overpowered the free will of the defendant and caused him to commit a more serious offense than he was predisposed to commit.id.courts must focus primarily on the behavior and motives of the government.see united states gibbens,cir when an accusation of sentencing factor manipulation surfaces,the judicial gaze should,in the usual case,focus not necessarily the government conduct and motives.with that focus the sentencing court
