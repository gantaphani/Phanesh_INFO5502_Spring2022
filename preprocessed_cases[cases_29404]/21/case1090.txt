this case requires us to decide whether the district court acted within its legal authority in relying upon a police report relating to a defendant prior state conviction to conclude that he was a career offender and thus subject to an enhanced sentence under the federal sentencing guidelines.concluding that the court exercised its sentencing authority properly,we affirm.
on july,jos√© delgado and a sold crack cocaine cocaine base to an undercover agent of the drug enforcement administration dea.on august,delgado,with two other,again sold cocaine base to that dea agent.on december,delgado and nine others were charged in a drug trafficking indictment.delgado was indicted on one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute in violation of,and two counts of cocaine base distribution and aiding and abetting that distribution,in violation of a and.
pursuant to a written plea agreement,delgado pled guilty to these charges on september.at sentencing,the court concluded,over delgado objection,that he was a career offender and that,under the career offender guideline,his base offense level was,and his criminal history category was vi.awarding delgado a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,the district court calculated his final adjusted offense level at.the applicable sentencing range for a level category vi offender was to months.the district court accordingly sentenced delgado,inter alia,to months imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release 
in determining delgado career offender status under,the district court concluded that delgado criminal history included two prior convictions for crimes of violence,thus warranting an increase in the offense level for the instant offense on february,delgado was convicted in state court of assault with a dangerous weapon,assault and battery on a police officer,and disorderly conduct,and sentenced to ninety days in prison.on april,delgado pled guilty to the charge of breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony.the effect of this latter conviction on delgado federal sentence was hotly disputed by the parties at sentencing and now constitutes the core issue on appeal.
the career offender guideline,provides for an enhanced sentence if the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time he committed the offense for which he is being sentenced that offense is a felony that either constitutes a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense and the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions for either crimes of violence or crimes involving controlled substances.for application of the career offender provisions,the sentencing guidelines define crime of violence to encompass certain federal and state offenses punishable by more than a year in prison,including burglary of a dwelling.
here,was years old at the time of the instant controlled substance satisfies the first two criteria under.furthermore,delgado concedes that his february conviction constitutes a crime of violence and thus qualifies as a predicate offense under.delgado argues,however,that the offense to which he pled guilty in april does not constitute a crime of violence under,and hence he is not a career offender within the meaning of the guidelines 
a.the taylor categorical approach 
in determining whether delgado april conviction constitutes a crime of violence,we follow the categorical approach outlined in taylor united states,d,and subsequent first circuit precedent.while questions of law concerning interpretation of the sentencing guidelines are reviewed de novo,the factual conclusions of the sentencing court,which must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence,are reviewed for clear error.see united states damon,cir united states grant,cir.
under the taylor approach,a sentencing court should look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for sentencing enhancement purposes id.at.see also united states meader,cir deciding whether a crime is a crime of violence is an inquiry restricted to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses without regard to the particular facts underlying them united states harris,cir.
sometimes,however,looking to the statutory definition alone will not establish whether the crime underlying the prior conviction was one of violence because some statutes contain language that covers both violent and crimes.harris,at internal quotation marks omitted.where the statutory definition encompasses both violent and offenses,a sentencing court may look to the charging as the indictment or jury instructions to ascertain whether the conviction was for a violent or crime.see taylor,at.united states shepard,cir united states sacko,cir harris,at.
if the charging document only incorporates the unhelpfully broad statutory language and if there is no jury charge because the conviction is based on a guilty plea,a sentencing court may appropriately 
look to the conduct in respect to which the defendant was charged and pled guilty,not because the court may properly be interested in this context in the violent or nature of that particular conduct,but because that conduct may indicate that the defendant and the government both believed that the generically violent crime rather than the generically crime was at issue.
harris,at.thus,the issue before the sentencing court is not what the defendant did to provoke the criminal charges to which he pled guilty.shepard,at.rather,what is critical is the meaning of the defendant guilty plea that is,whether the defendant guilty plea constitute s an admission to a crime of violence under the preponderance of the evidence standard.id.at.
in discerning the plea meaning,the court may rely on sufficiently reliable evidence independent of a admission.id.at.such long as it is deemed sufficiently reliable by the district include police reports.id.at based on our precedents,we see no justification for an absolute bar to the consideration of police reports when the sentencing court must determine whether the defendant and the government both believed that the defendant was entering a guilty plea to a generically violent crime.
b.the trial court ruling on the predicate offense 
here,with respect to the april conviction,delgado was initially charged in december with home invasion in violation of.ch.however,the fitchburg district court amended the charge of home invasion to breaking and entering in the night time with intent to commit a felony.delgado pled guilty to that amended charge in april 
it is well established in our the parties do not.ch,includes conduct that constitutes a crime of violence as well as conduct that does not.see united states dueno,cir holding that encompasses conduct that constitutes a crime of violence,breaking into and entering a person home,see a burglary of a dwelling is a crime of violence,and conduct that almost certainly does not,breaking into and entering a vehicle harris,at reading in similar fashion in context of violent felony.because the statutory definition does not resolve the question of whether the conviction was for a crime of violence,the sentencing court had to look elsewhere,beyond the statute,in accordance with the approach set forth in taylor and our subsequent precedent.based upon the original complaint containing the charge of home invasion in violation of.ch,and the police report underlying the april conviction,the district court concluded at the sentencing hearing,pursuant to the preponderance of the evidence standard that delgado pled guilty to breaking into and entering a dwelling,and therefore that the april conviction was for a crime of violence under.the court specifically stated 
and it is my determination that the amendment to a breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit a felony must be interpreted in looking at the entire picture,including the original criminal complaint in which this defendant was charged with knowingly entering and remaining in the dwelling place of another.and i have considered the police report.it may not be entirely reliable in all of its aspects.but with respect to where the crime was committed,i think it is entirely reliable,and i believe that the statements that are made in that report lead me to believe that the conviction of which to which delgado pled guilty was a crime of violence,therefore,a second predicate,and he will be determined to be a career offender under the guideline provisions.
delgado argues that it was error for the district court to rely on these,the original complaint and the police determining whether the april conviction was a crime of violence.
the original complaint alleging home invasion states that 
on,delgado did knowingly enter,or enter and remain in,the dwelling place of another,knowing or having reason to know that one or more persons were present within and did so while armed with a dangerous weapon,or did use force or threaten the imminent use of force upon a person within such dwelling 
because the amended charge to which delgado pled guilty supercedes the original complaint,we have reservations about the appropriateness of the trial court giving the original complaint any further consideration in determining the meaning of delgado plea on the crime of violence issue.we do not have to decide that issue,however.even assuming that the district court reliance on the original complaint was improper,such error was harmless because the police report alone was sufficient to justify the district court ruling that the defendant had pled guilty to a crime of violence.
the crime of violence determination required the district court to focus on a simple question framed by the breaking and entering charge to which delgado pled guilty under.ch.section criminalizes,inter alia,breaking and entering a building,ship,vessel or vehicle,with intent to commit a felony.ch.given the inclusion of burglary of a dwelling as a crime of violence under,the court only had to decide if the government had presented sufficiently reliable evidence to permit it to conclude,by a preponderance of the evidence,that delgado plea to the charge constituted an admission to breaking and entering a dwelling,instead of a ship,vessel or vehicle.id.the police report,appended to the report,includes numerous references to a dwelling and the details characteristic of a dwelling 
on,three officers were dispatched to the area of spruce street for a call of a n unknown problem.i arrived at the scene and spoke with victim ruby cartagena.cartagena said that she was babysitting for her sister a n esmeralda cartagena at the address of temple street.cartagena stated that while she was in the apartment babysitting she received a phone call and once she picked up the phone who ever was on the other end hung up the phone cartagena then went into one of the bedrooms and while in the bedroom she heard the front door open she proceeded to the front door and once she entered the living room all of a sudden a cloth was put over her face and someone grabbed cartagena and told her not to yell or they would hurt her car t agena then observed the suspect proceed to where the kitchen was and suspect go into the bedroom where the children were,su s pect stayed with cartagena holding her and after approximately a minute or two suspect placed cartagena into the bathroom and shut the door on her while still holding the bathroom door shut.cartagena then heard the suspects leave the apartment and she ran out of the bathroom and proceeded to the window.cartagena then observed a grey motor vehicle leaving the front of the house of temple 
focusing on the narrow issue before it,the district court sensibly observed that the police report may not be entirely reliable in all of its aspects,but is entirely reliable as to where the crime was committed.the court thus concluded that the crime to which delgado pled guilty was a crime of violence.
other than a general objection to reliance on the police report,delgado offered nothing about the circumstances of the plea hearing or the creation of the police report to challenge the sentencing court conclusion that delgado and the government both believed that he was entering a guilty plea to the generically violent crime of breaking and entering a dwelling harris,at.in the absence of such a proffer,we conclude that there was no clear error in the district court finding that,by a preponderance of the evidence,delgado pled guilty to the amended charge of breaking and entering a dwelling with intent to commit a felony.see damon,at holding that factual conclusions of sentencing court,which must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence,are reviewed for clear error.
delgado gains nothing by arguing that the district court could not rely on an uncertified copy of the police report.without minimizing the value of providing certified copies of police reports at a sentencing hearing,we note first that delgado did not object specifically to the court reliance on an uncertified document.moreover,certifying a copy of a police report simply attests that the report is a true and accurate copy of the original.delgado never challenged the accuracy of the copy included in the report,either in the district court or on appeal.
finally,to the extent that delgado challenges the police report on hearsay grounds,we reject that argument out of hand.it is that a sentencing court may consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial,provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.see also united states,cir the sentencing court is free to rely upon outside evidence,including hearsay evidence that has never been subject to.
delgado claims that the district court erred when it failed to depart downward sua sponte on account of his alleged rehabilitation and the conditions of his confinement.however,delgado explicitly conceded in his plea agreement that there were no grounds for a departure defendant agree s that there is no basis for a departure from the sentencing range established by the united states sentencing guidelines.accordingly,defendant will not seek a departure on any ground from the sentencing guidelines here.thus,delgado has waived his claim for a departure.
even in the absence of waiver,delgado failure to present this claim below constitutes a procedural default curtailing appellate review.see united states piper,cir it is settled that,in respect to criminal sentencing,as in other contexts,arguments not squarely presented to the sentencing court can not debut as of right in an appellate venue.thus,we decline to consider delgado departure claim.
in virtually all circumstances,panels within a circuit are bound by the holdings of prior panels.see,united states chhien,cir united states wogan,cir.given the force of this rule and its applicability here,i acknowledge that united states shepard,cir,dictates the outcome of this appeal.i write separately,however,because i believe that shepard,and cases like it,take impermissible liberties with the narrow exception envisioned in taylor united states,d,and,thus,undermine the integrity of the categorical approach favored by the supreme court for cases in which predicate offenses are used to enhance defendants sentences.were we writing on a pristine page,i would hold particularized inquiry of the type and kind approved in the majority opinion inquiry which ranges well past the charging papers,jury instructions,and other formal accouterments of the predicate offense to a copy of a police report compiled by an investigating officer to be beyond the limits contemplated by the taylor court.the page,however,is not pristine,and so i reluctantly concur in the judgment of the panel.
absent delgado career offender status,his sentence would likely have been seven years shorter than the months he received.
delgado criminal history also includes a conviction for cocaine possession under puerto rico law.a controlled substance offense may qualify as a predicate act triggering application of the career offender guidelines where the defendant possessed the drugs with the intent to manufacture,import,export,distribute or dispense them.see
