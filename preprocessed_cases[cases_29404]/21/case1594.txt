petitioner robert vadas appeals the district court denial of his petition,pursuant to,to vacate,set aside,or correct his sentence of imprisonment.vadas claims constitutionally ineffective assistance by two successive attorneys.
background 
on june,vadas was charged in a superseding indictment with involvement in a drug operation see united states rudolfo segura et united states robert vadas,bahama bob,et.from june through august,attorney francis,who was appointed by the court,represented vadas.on august,the district court granted vadas motion for leave to have attorney richard wynn appear pro hac vice and was relieved as defense counsel.
the june superseding indictment indictment i charged vadas with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute,and to distribute,more than grams of cocaine and cocaine base,in violation of a.because vadas had been convicted of a felony drug offense prior to the commission of the offenses charged in indictment i,he faced an enhanced statutory minimum sentence under b.but a court may not impose such an enhanced sentence unless the government trial or the entry of a guilty information with the court specifying in writing the earlier convictions upon which the enhancement rests.according to petitioner,the government informed vadas counsel on november,and again on march,that vadas had a prior felony conviction and that the prosecution intended to file a information under.
on april,the government filed a information pursuant to.this information constituted the required notice that petitioner had sustained a narcotics conviction and therefore was subject to an enhanced mandatory minimum sentence.without the prior conviction,vadas charge for conspiracy to possess and distribute more than grams of cocaine but less than kg would have entailed a mandatory minimum sentence,but provides that,subject to notice,the existence of a prior conviction requires that a minimum sentence be imposed for violations,like the one here charged,that involve grams of cocaine.this information stated 
the penalty for a violation of a and is a sentence of a term of imprisonment which may not be less than five years,if the offense involves more than grams of cocaine.see b b.however,
i f any person commits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final,such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which must not be less than ten years 
emphasis added.
subsequently,on january,the government filed a second superseding indictment indictment ii,charging vadas with,in relevant part 
count conspiring to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute fifty grams or more of cocaine base and five kilograms or more of cocaine,schedule ii controlled substances,contrary to section a and section b a.
count possessing with the intent to distribute more than grams of cocaine,a schedule ii controlled substance.
count having previously been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year for the sale of narcotics,knowingly and intentionally possess ing a firearm 
count knowingly us ing and possess ing firearms during,in relation to,and in furtherance of,a drug trafficking crime,that is,a conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute,and the distribution of cocaine in violation of a and,as more specifically set forth in count one of this indictment.
and on march,the government filed an amended information pursuant to,placing the defendant on notice that he is subject to enhanced mandatory minimum penalties if he is convicted of a narcotics offense in the referenced matters.referencing indictment ii count one violations of a and with respect to more than kilograms of cocaine,the amended information stated 
the penalty for a violation of a and is a sentence of a term of imprisonment which may not be less than ten years if the offense involves more than kilograms of cocaine.see b a.
i f any person commits such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final,such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which must not be less than twenty years 
as the defendant was convicted of a felony drug offense prior to the commission of the offenses charged in the indictments in this case,and the amount of cocaine that is attributable and reasonably foreseeable to the defendant in this offense exceeds kilograms,the defendant is on notice that he faces a mandatory minimum twenty year term of imprisonment as provided by b a in the event of a conviction on the drug offense charged in count one of the second superseding indictment 
emphasis added.
vadas entered a guilty plea pursuant to a written plea agreement on april.the agreement stated,in relevant part 
robert vadas agrees to plead guilty to counts one and nineteen of the second superseding indictment in this matter charging him,respectively,with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than kilograms of cocaine in violation of b a and,and criminal forfeiture.the defendant and the government agree that the defendant is responsible for more than grams,but less than kilograms of cocaine,thereby constituting a offense to the charge contained in count one of the second superseding indictment 
in exchange for the plea,t he government also agrees to withdraw the amended second offender notice information filed march,pursuant to section.
this offense carries a mandatory minimum penalty of ten years imprisonment 
emphasis added.in the plea colloquy judge burns recited the terms of the plea agreement,including the government withdrawal of the amended information.and vadas consented.
on this basis,the district court sentenced vadas to a term of imprisonment of ten years,followed by supervised release.in may,on grounds other than those forming the basis of the instant petition,vadas appealed the court sentence.we affirmed.see united states williams,cir.thereafter,in july,vadas filed a motion for relief under.the district court denied vadas motion but issued a certificate of appealability 
on appeal,vadas asserts two grounds for his claim of ineffective assistance.first,he contends that attorney failed to inform him correctly of the effective terms of the government initial plea offer.second,he argues that attorney wynn representation was constitutionally deficient because wynn failed to object to vadas enhanced sentence of ten years imprisonment despite the government withdrawal of the amended information.that withdrawal,vadas maintains,reduced the and mandatory minimum sentence facing him from ten years imprisonment to five years imprisonment.
in response,the government states that it did not agree,and never would have agreed,to a plea implicating a mandatory minimum sentence of only five years imprisonment.the government also contends that the original,not withdrawn,information filed in april remained valid,despite the withdrawal of the amended information.the amended notification was needed,and filed,only to support vadas sentence of twenty years for conviction of count one of the second superseding indictment,and had no effect on the validity of the earlier one.
we hold that vadas petition fails because the original information filed on april,complied with the express requirements and the underlying purposes of and,and that his attorneys were in no way deficient in representing him.
ii.discussion 
petitioner claims that his attorneys failure to focus on a the,and b the invalidity,of enhancement notifications deprived him of the constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.to prove his claim,vadas must meet two conditions.first,he must demonstrate that his attorney performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under the prevailing professional norms.strickland washington,d.second,he must show a reasonable probability that absent counsel error,the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.id.at.
claim of ineffective assistance by attorney 
vadas alleges that his first counsel,attorney,was constitutionally deficient in failing to advise him that he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of only five years imprisonment and not to the mandatory mi
