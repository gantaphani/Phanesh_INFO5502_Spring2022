background 
the charges and trial 
evidence adduced at trial established that between september,and october,using the internet and the mails,keigue opened accounts at six different brokerage firms including merrill lynch company,charles schwab,muriel siebert company,first trade securities,and oxford company.keigue attempted to fund each of these accounts with two checks one in the amount of drawn from a citibank account in his name,and the other in the amount of,purportedly drawn from a chase manhattan bank account also bearing keigue name.
although the citibank checks were genuine,the evidence established that the chase manhattan bank account did not exist and that each of the checks purportedly drawn on that account and sent through the united states mail were counterfeit.a number of the brokerage accounts that keigue opened provided him with the ability to purchase securities valued at twice the amount of cash value supposedly in his account.ultimately,keigue plan was unsuccessful as no trades were ever made on any of the six accounts.as the district court later observed,the scheme was doomed from the beginning,as authorities would quickly discover that the checks keigue submitted would not clear.
on november,keigue was arrested,and on november,a grand jury returned an indictment charging keigue with seven counts of mail fraud and one count of uttering and possessing a counterfeit security.trial began on september,and a week later a jury found keigue guilty on all counts charged following the verdict,the district judge set sentencing for december.in november,the sentencing guidelines were amended.
the probation department presentence report 
in its presentence report psr,the probation department stated that an ex post facto issue would exist if the sentencing guidelines were used to determine keigue sentence.the sentencing guidelines require that a defendant be sentenced under the version of the guidelines in effect on the date of sentencing.see a see also united states gonzalez,cir citing a a.where,however,the version of the guidelines in effect on the date of sentencing calls for a more severe penalty than the version in effect at the time of the offense,the earlier version should be applied to avoid a violation of the ex post facto clause of the constitution.see gonzalez,at citing b.see generally miller florida,d discussing ex post facto prohibition.the probation department offered no explanation for its conclusion that an ex post facto issue would result from its use of the guidelines and proceeded to calculate keigue recommended sentencing range using the guidelines.
referencing section of the expired guidelines,the psr fixed keigue base offense level at,which is appropriate for offenses involving altered or counterfeit instruments.a.because the psr determined that the intended loss of keigue scheme totaled,levels were added.see b g requiring the addition of levels where the amount of loss exceeds.another levels were added because keigue offense involved a scheme to defraud more than one victim.see b b.the result of the psr calculations was an adjusted offense level of,which,when combined with keigue criminal history category of i,yielded a guidelines range of to months.see sentencing table intersection of offense level and criminal history category i.
as it turned out,use of the guidelines would not have raised any ex post facto issues.had the court adopted the psr proposed intended loss figure of,the guidelines would have resulted in keigue receiving the same adjusted offense level of that he received under the guidelines.specifically,his offense level of would have remained the same.see a.keigue then would have received an enhancement for a loss totaling more than.see b e.there would have been no enhancement for an offense involving a scheme to defraud more than one victim,however,as that provision was deleted under the amendments.see appendix c,amendment deleting.
in a letter to the court prior to sentencing,keigue requested that he be sentenced at the bottom of the applicable range,citing his mental illness and the fact that no one suffered actual loss as a result of his unlawful scheme.neither the government nor keigue raised any objections to the psr.in fact,keigue expressly stated that he did not dispute the probation department findings.
the december sentencing 
the sentencing took place on december,at which time the guidelines were in effect.after confirming that the parties had no factual challenges to the probation department findings,the district court,sua sponte,questioned the psr calculation of the amount of loss implicated by keigue scheme.for reasons not relevant to this appeal,the district court concluded that it was more inclined to find the potential loss to be in the range of.because the guidelines added levels to the base offense level when the amount of loss fell between and,see b f,rather than the levels associated with the figure,the court decreased keigue adjusted offense level from to.see b g.the result of this adjustment was a guidelines range of to months.see sentencing table intersection of offense level and criminal history category i.application of the guidelines to the loss figure would have yielded a range of to months see sentencing table intersection of offense level and criminal history category i.
the court then noted for the record that keigue criminal efforts to defraud the brokerage houses represented a very stupid scheme that would inevitably have been discovered quite quickly when the counterfeit checks failed to clear.it then imposed sentence having reviewed all the facts and circumstances,i think it appropriate to sentence keigue in the middle of his guideline range.i sentence you,keigue,to a term of months.neither party raised any objections immediately following the court sentence.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
it is helpful at the outset to set forth what is not at issue in this appeal.first,both parties agree that the psr was incorrect in concluding that,using the loss figure,an ex post facto issue existed under the guidelines.second,the parties do not dispute that the district court use of the guidelines to determine keigue offense level in light of its amended loss figure constitutes an error normally requiring reversal.see united states keller,cir holding that use of expired version of guidelines where there is no ex post facto issue constitutes plain error.finally,the parties do not contest that keigue failure to raise this error below requires that our review be confined to one of plain error.where keigue and the government part ways,however,is on the type of plain error review applicable and the ultimate result of that review.
standard of review 
the government argues that keigue failure to bring the expired guidelines issue to the attention of the district court requires that we undertake a traditional plain error analysis,which precludes us from correcting an error unless it affects a defendant substantial rights.see united states keppler,cir noting that sentencing issues not raised in trial court are waived on appeal in absence of p lain errors affecting substantial rights.quoting.b.keigue contends that our recent decision in united states sofsky,cir,governs our review here and permits us to entertain his challenge without insisting on strict compliance with the rigorous standards of rule b.see id.at.we need not now resolve this difference between the government and the defendant because nothing turns on it here.the outcome,for the reasons discussed below,is the same regardless of which standard we use.for the purpose of our inquiry,we assume without deciding that traditional plain error analysis applies.
to establish plain error,a court must find an error,that is plain,that affects substantial rights.united states gordon,cir.under this analysis,there must be an error,or deviation from a legal rule which has not been waived.united states viola,cir citation omitted,recognized as abrogated on other grounds in united states zichettello,cir.that error is considered plain if it is clear or obvious at the time of appellate consideration.gordon,at citation omitted.such an error affects the substantial rights of a defendant if it is prejudicial and affect s the outcome of the district court proceedings.id.citation omitted.if an error meets these first three requirements,the court engages in a fourth consideration whether or not to exercise its discretion to correct the error.the plain error should be corrected only if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.at quoting jones united states,d.
b.the merits 
an error was committed 
the sentencing guidelines explicitly mandate that a court use the version of the guidelines in effect on the date of the defendant sentencing.see a see also gonzalez,at generally,the guidelines in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced should govern the sentence imposed.citing a a.the exception to this rule arises when the version of the guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing is more severe,than the version in effect when the offense was committed.id.citation omitted.in such cases,there is an ex post facto problem and the earlier guidelines should be applied.see also b.here,there was no ex post facto problem.using the district court loss figure,keigue offense level under the guidelines was.see b f and b b.keigue offense level under the guidelines would have been.see supra.consequently,it was error for the district court to calculate keigue offense level using the expired version of the guidelines in effect on the date the offense was committed.
the error was plain and affected substantial rights 
we have held that where there is no ex post facto problem,it is plain error to fail to apply the version of the guidelines in effect at the time of the sentencing.keller,at.at the same time,under other circumstances,we have declined to find plain error in instances where a defendant could have received the same sentence in the absence of the alleged error,reasoning that such an error does not affect the substantial rights of a defendant.see united states diaz,cir concluding that there was no plain error where incorrect application of a enhancement resulted in sentence of months because,even without enhancement,sentence still fell within correct guidelines range of to months keppler,at concluding that there was no plain error where court determined range to be to months and sentenced defendant to months,even though correct application of challenged sentencing provision would have resulted in lower range of to months united states arigbodi,cir per curiam declining to find plain error where district court sentenced defendant to months based on allegedly incorrect range and where remedying alleged error would have resulted in lower range of to months.but see united states,cir finding plain error where court sentenced defendant to months based on range of to months arrived at through mathematical mistake absent incorrect calculation range would have been to months.these decisions raise the question of whether a defendant can establish plain error where,as here,the sentencing judge uses an incorrect version of the guidelines,but imposes a sentence that falls within the overlapping portion of both the correct and incorrect ranges.
citing diaz,keppler,and arigbodi,the government argues that the district court use of the wrong version of the guidelines does not warrant remand because the sentence keigue asked for and received fell within the ranges called for by both the expired guidelines calling for a range of to months and the effective guidelines calling for a range of to months.because keigue could have received the same sentence in absence of the error,the government contends,his substantial rights were not affected and no manifest injustice occurred.see diaz,at w hen a defendant could have received exactly the same sentence in the absence of the alleged error,we can not say that its occurrence affected defendant substantial rights resulting in a manifest injustice.internal citations and quotation marks omitted accord keppler,at arigbodi,at.keigue responds that even if our holding in keller does not mandate a finding of plain error,our decision in we concluded that a defendant had established plain error despite the fact that he could have received the same sentence under either of the two arguably applicable guidelines remand.see,at.because the facts before us more closely mirror those facing the panel,we agree with keigue and remand for resentencing.
while,at first blush,the conclusion of the panel appears in conflict with our holdings in arigbodi,keppler,and diaz,these decisions can and should be reconciled with one another.to do so,a more detailed account of is necessary.the defendant there pled guilty to charges that he had conspired to evade income taxes in violation of.see id.at.the nature of that offense,like numerous others covered by the guidelines,required that the district court determine the precise amount of tax loss attributed to the defendant.see id.at.a larger tax loss corresponded with a higher sentencing range.see id.acknowledging a key component of the guidelines sentencing idea that there must be some precise incremental punishment for every identifiable increment of wrongdoing.due to a mathematical error,the district court incorrectly arrived at a tax loss figure of just over million which,when adjusted and combined with the defendant criminal history score,resulted in a sentencing range of to months.see id.at citing m.absent the erroneous calculation,however,the amount of loss would have come up just short of the million mark and resulted in,after adjustments,a lower range of to months.see id.
on appeal,we acknowledged that the ultimate sentence within the overlapping portion of both ranges.see id.nevertheless,we concluded that the district court mistake undoubtedly affected substantial rights within the meaning of rule,because it resulted in the defendant receiving a longer sentence than the district court intended to give him.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we added that the mistake was of the type that seriously affected the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,reasoning that one would be to think of a more senseless injustice than the deprivation of a citizen liberty for several months as a result of a clerical error.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.as a consequence,we found plain error and remanded for resentencing.see id.at.
in reaching our conclusion in,we rejected the government reliance on united states bermingham,cir,a error case in which a panel of this court explained that a sentence based on an incorrect guidelines range could be affirmed when that sentence also fell within the correct range,and the district court indicated that it would have imposed the same sentence under either range.see,at citing bermingham,at.distinguishing bermingham,we quoted the district judge who,in imposing sentence,observed that the defendant had been collaterally punished by the proceedings before it and that in good conscience he could not impose any sentence above the minimum.id.
with respect to the specific elements of plain error analysis,differs from arigbodi,keppler and diaz in its conclusion that the error affected the defendant substantial rights because the court was confident that the defendant would have received a different,shorter sentence absent the oversight.see,at.somewhat differently,the arigbodi line of cases expresses a reluctance on our part to find that a defendant substantial rights were affected where he or she could have received the same sentence under either guideli
