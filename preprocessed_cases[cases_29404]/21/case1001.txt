background 
because this appeal involves sentencing issues following a guilty plea,we take the background facts from the presentence report.united states brady,cir.
from august of until at least december of,jocel manufacturing corporation jocel manufactured and sold frozen desserts,including ones labeled caparra ice cream and rico,to restaurants and wholesale and retail customers in puerto rico.during most of that period,father,jorge,was the overall manager of jocel,and was jocel production manager with responsibility for the production of food products.
in and,the united states food and drug administration the fda warned and of the requirement that food labeled as ice cream contain not less than ten percent milk fat.a.notwithstanding this warning,and continued to produce and sell caparra ice cream with less than ten percent milk fat,and they misled the fda about the true content and labeling of the product.thus,while promised the fda that jocel would revise its formula so that its ice cream would contain at least ten percent milk fat,he and instructed jocel employees to use a mixture of coconut oil and milk fat for the caparra ice cream base that contained less than ten percent milk fat.they packed this product into containers with labels that failed to list coconut oil as an ingredient.ultimately,jocel sold caparra ice cream to the public without notifying customers that it contained less than ten percent milk fat or that it contained coconut oil.this conduct occurred over a period of at least months and is estimated to have resulted in a loss to consumers of at least.
on april,a federal grand jury indicted,and jocel manufacturing corporation,for conspiracy,adulteration of food,misbranding of food,and false,fictitious,and fraudulent claims against the united states.after discovery,entered into a plea agreement with the united states in which he agreed to plead guilty to counts one and six of the indictment and to adopt the government version of the facts.count one charged that he had unlawfully,knowingly,wilfully,and intentionally combined and confederated with others to cause,with the intent to defraud or mislead,food labeled as ice cream to be adulterated and misbranded while the food was held for sale,in violation of k,and that he had knowingly executed a scheme to defraud and obtain money by means of materially false and fraudulent representations and promises through the united states postal service,in violation of,and all in violation of.count six charged that he had,with the intent to defraud and mislead,misbranded ice cream while held for sale in interstate commerce,in violation of k and a.
in accordance with the agreement,entered a guilty plea.a presentence report was prepared and given to the parties,which calculated consumer loss to be.filed an objection to the amount of consumer loss.the district court referred the issue to magistrate judge gustavo gelphi,who,after an evidentiary hearing,concluded that was an appropriate figure.
on november,the district court held a sentencing hearing.as had violated two closely related counts,the district court grouped the two counts into a combined offense level.applying the sentencing guidelines the court determined that the count one offenses were governed by,which applies to conspiracies not covered by a specific offense guideline.rather than providing its own offense level,a states that courts should apply the base offense level from the guideline for the substantive offense.accordingly,the district court determined that both substantive offenses in count one were governed by the district court further determined that the count two sentences were also governed by 
based on,the district court concluded that the base offense level was six.since provides for increases in the offense level according to the amount of loss resulting from a crime if those losses are above,the district court,using the consumer loss figure of,increased total offense level six levels.b.accordingly,it assessed total guideline sentence at twelve the district court further determined that had a criminal history category of 
applying this offense level and criminal history to the sentencing table,the district court then determined that the applicable guideline imprisonment range was from ten to sixteen months zone c with a fine range of to plus a term of supervised release of at least two but not more than three years.table.the district court imposed a fine of for each of the two counts and stated that appellee was to be 
committed to the custody of the bureau of prisons to be imprisoned for a term of five months and pursuant to guideline d the court will substitute one day of home confinement for one day of incarceration and said term of imprisonment is to be served concurrently as to counts one and six.in other words,the court,although it imposes a term of imprisonment of five months,which is at the lower end of the guideline range of ten,pursuant to guideline e substitutes one day of home detention for one day of imprisonment.upon completion of said term of five months he shall be placed on supervisory release for a term of three years as to each count to be served concurrently under the following conditions he shall be placed in home detention and comply with the conditions of the home confinement program for a period of five months.
when asked for clarification of the sentence by the government counsel,the district court explained 
and that is a type of sentence that i impose when i am in zone c at.you are correct d provides that if the court must sentence the defendants to imprisonment provided that at least one half of the minimum term is satisfied by imprisonment.i have imposed a term of imprisonment of five months as to each count concurrently then i move on to e which states that,that is the schedule of substitute punishment and i have substituted one day of home detention for one day of imprisonment so although he has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment as to each count,five months,it is half of the minimum of the guideline,nevertheless the court substitutes one day of home confinement for one day of imprisonment.
the government objected,without avail,that the substitution provision of e could not be used to override the guidelines minimum sentence requirements.
on november,the district court entered the announced sentence.the government filed a timely notice of appeal.several months later,on april,under the jurisdiction of the probation office of the united states district court for the district of puerto rico,began serving the five months of home detention associated with his term of supervised release,wearing an electronic monitoring device as required.on september,his home detention ended,the electronic monitoring device was removed,and proceeded with the balance of his term of supervised release.
