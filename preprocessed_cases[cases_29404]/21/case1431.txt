defendant andre green,who,pursuant to a plea bargain,pleaded guilty to possessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute,in violation of a b c,and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c,and was sentenced agreed with the months imprisonment,appeals from an initial order and a final amended order of the united states district court for the western district of new york,charles siragusa,judge,denying his motion pursuant to c for a reduction of his prison term to less than months in light of amendments by the united states sentencing commission commission or sentencing commission to the advisory sentencing guidelines guidelines which lowered the recommended imprisonment ranges for offenses related to crack cocaine.in its final amended order,the district court denied green motion on the ground that the sentence imposed had already effectively reduced green guidelines offense level.on appeal,green seeks a remand for reconsideration of his c motion,contending that the denial of the motion was procedurally flawed because the court a in its final amended order failed to determine green guidelines offense level and imprisonment range in light of the crack cocaine guidelines revisions,b in each order relied on an erroneous articulation of fact,and c in both orders failed to take into account an error in the calculation of his original sentence.for the reasons that follow,we conclude that these contentions are moot.as we conclude that the district court sentenced green pursuant to a plea agreement governed by.c c,we affirm the denial of green motion in light of this court ruling in united states main,cir main,cert.denied,that a defendant who has been sentenced pursuant to a rule c c plea agreement is ineligible for a reduction of sentence under c.
background 
on april,green was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of possessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute,in violation of a b a count,conspiring to do so,in violation of count,and possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime,in violation of c count.on march,green had been sentenced in state court in steuben county,new york,following his plea of guilty to narcotics trafficking in violation of state law.for his state offense,green was sentenced to to years imprisonment and was incarcerated in state prison.
green plea and sentencing in the present case 
in may,with respect to the federal indictment,green and the government entered into a plea agreement.the parties agreed that green would plead guilty to count,the firearms charge that in satisfaction of the count charge of possessing crack cocaine with intent to distribute,he would plead guilty under b c,which carries no statutory minimum prison term,rather than under b a,which carries a mandatory minimum and that the government would move to dismiss count.with regard to sentencing,the parties agreed that under the advisory guidelines,the range of imprisonment for green on counts and combined was months.they agreed that n otwithstanding that calculation,
it is the agreement of the parties pursuant to rule c c of the federal rules of criminal procedure that the court at the time of sentence impose a month term of imprisonment as part of the appropriate sentence in this case.the parties further agree pursuant to rule c c that the month sentence be imposed to run concurrent to the sentence imposed against the defendant in steuben county court on march,for his plea of guilty to criminal possession of controlled substances,with intent to sell.if,after reviewing the presentence report,the court rejects this agreement,the defendant shall then be afforded the opportunity to withdraw the plea of guilty and the parties shall then be afforded the right to void the agreement.
plea agreement emphases added.
on the day the plea agreement was entered into,green appeared in district court before judge michael telesca,to whom the case was then assigned,to enter his plea of guilty.the parties disclosed the terms of the plea agreement in open court.see transcript of plea hearing,may,plea tr,at.judge telesca,after requiring the government to state the factual basis for the plea and engaging green in a colloquy to ensure that his plea was knowing and voluntary,accepted green plea of guilty and scheduled sentencing for august,see id.at.the court postponed its ruling on whether to accept or reject the plea agreement until it received and reviewed a presentence report on green,stating that it would go along with the parties understanding on sentencing as set out in that agreement unless there wa s something startling in that presentencing report.id.at.
green sentencing hearing was eventually held on november,before judge siragusa,to whom the case had been reassigned.prior to that date,green completed service of his sentence.given that green could no longer serve any part of his federal sentence concurrently with his state sentence,his robert napier wrote to everardo rodriguez,the assistant united states attorney ausa handling the prosecution,and proposed that the parties agree that the appropriate federal prison term for green would be months.see from robert napier to ausa everardo rodriguez,dated september,napier.although it does not appear that the government made a written response,the record indicates that the government agreed to napier proposal and that the parties met with judge siragusa to seek his approval.thus,at the sentencing hearing,judge siragusa informed green as follows 
i at napier request,had an extensive meeting with napier on your behalf and rodriguez on behalf of the government.we just met again in chambers.i wanted to make sure i recalled the details of the meeting.napier says that despite the fact that you and the government agreed to months in front of judge telesca d espite the fact that the sentencing you were recommending with you and the government of months,napier said if i went along with that it would be inequitable because the understanding or belief would be that you would somehow get credit for the state sentence.to his credit,rodriguez was also convinced by napier argument.
sentencing transcript,november,at.the court stated that it approved the change to months 
the long and the short,i will accept the c c agreement,which is saying i can go along with months,but having been presented with napier statement,i will give you credit for the state sentence and i sentence you to a combined total of months.
id.at.pointing out that,at the plea hearing,the ruling on whether to accept or reject the plea agreement had been postponed until green presentence report could be reviewed,judge siragusa stated that he had reviewed the presentence report and i can go along with the recommendations and,in fact,as i told you,the sentence that you will receive,because of napier efforts,will even be less,do you understand that id.at.green stated that he understood.
the court noted that the advisory guidelines range of imprisonment for green crack distribution and firearms offenses was to months.it stated that,h owever,as you know,and as i explained,i will give you credit for the time that you already done on your plea on the state side and reduce your combined incarceration on these federal counts to months.id.at.accordingly,the district court sentenced green to,inter alia,a prison term of months,comprising months on the narcotics count,to be followed by months on the firearms count.
green c motion 
in november,the sentencing commission amended the advisory guidelines with respect to offenses related to crack cocaine,reducing the base offense level for such crimes the crack amendments,see,guidelines supplement to appendix c,amendment,as amended by amendment eff,and it thereafter provided that the courts could consider whether,and to what extent,to apply the crack amendments retroactively,see id.amendment eff.if the amended crack guidelines had been in effect when green was sentenced,the range of imprisonment for his combined offenses would have been to months rather than to months.in june,green moved under c for a reduction in his sentence in light of the crack amendments.
