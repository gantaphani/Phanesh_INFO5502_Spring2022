aldeen now challenges his sentence on both procedural and substantive grounds.for the reasons set forth below,we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in august,aldeen was convicted,following a guilty plea,of one count of possession of child pornography,in violation of.a and b.in his plea allocution,aldeen admitted that in the course of downloading adult pornography,he came into possession of two videos of child pornography,which he kept and viewed even after discovering they contained child pornography.the district court sentenced him to months imprisonment and three years supervised release.the judgment contained the standard conditions of supervision,see c,as well as five special conditions,see id.d,including a ban on using a computer or similar electronic device to access pornography of any kind,and notifying the probation department of any computer to which he had access.
after being released from prison,aldeen began serving his initial term of supervised release in february.on september,the probation department charged him with violating several of his conditions of supervised release,including by failing to notify the probation department that he had certain access to the internet.he eventually pled guilty to failing to report to his probation officer.on august,the district court sentenced him to ten months imprisonment,the top of the guidelines range,as well as three additional years supervised release.the judgment,however,was not entered until january.
for this second term of supervised release,the district court imposed the standard conditions of supervision and three special conditions.relevant to this appeal are the following 
standard condition t he defendant shall not associate with any persons engaged in criminal activity,and shall not associate with any person convicted of a felony,unless granted permission to do so by the probation officer 
special condition the defendant shall participate in a mental health treatment program,which may include participation in a treatment program for sexual disorders 
special condition the defendant is not to use a computer,internet capable device,or similar electronic device to access pornography of any kind the defendant shall also cooperate with the united states probation department computer and internet monitoring program.cooperation shall include identifying computer systems,internet capable devices,similar electronic devices the defendant has access to the defendant may be limited to possessing only one personal internet capable device,to facilitate our department ability to effectively monitor his internet related activities 
in,one year into this second term of supervised release,aldeen was again charged with violating the conditions of supervision.according to the probation department,aldeen allegedly spoke with another member of his treatment group,also a convicted felon,on the subway following a group treatment session,in violation of standard condition.probation stated that it had received information that aldeen had asked his fellow group member for assistance with leaving the country undetected.id.at.the probation department also charged aldeen with violating special condition,which barred certain possession and uses of computers and other internet capable devices,by,among other things,possessing an unreported cellphone that contained pornographic images.the probation department additionally charged aldeen with committing a state crime by failing to disclose all internet accounts and identifiers,including social networking accounts,in violation of his level registered sex offender obligations under the new york state electronic security and targeting of predators act.
pursuant to an agreement with the government,aldeen pled guilty on april,to the first charge associating with a person convicted of a felony.he allocuted that he spoke to one of his group at the subway,knowing the person had been convicted of a felony,and knowing that he was not supposed to have contact with other group members outside the treatment program.id.at.
the first charge was a grade c violation,as defined by.a.because aldeen was in criminal history category ii when he was originally sentenced,the guidelines range for the violation was four to ten months imprisonment per a.because his original offense of possession of child pornography in violation of was a class c felony,see b,a,the maximum statutory sentence that could be imposed on revocation was months,see e.
on april,the district court sentenced aldeen to eighteen months imprisonment and an additional term of supervised release of three years the district court explained its sentence as follows 
aldeen,you have even tried.you lie to everybody.i looked back through my notes.when i accepted your guilty plea,i did so and i said even though i know he lied about parts of this,and you continue to do that.you used this unauthorized electronic device,this cell phone.you lied to your probation officer,and it was just totally unbelievable to me that you came to probation with that telephone,and you gave it to the officers downstairs and then picked it up as you were going out the door.
i mean,you just ignored the conditions that have been set for you.you admitted contact with a felon outside of the treatment facility.you lied in treatment y ou took a polygraph examination which indicated that you lied in your denial of contact with minors.i just and this is your second violation of supervised release.i just find that in order to deter you and hopefully cause you to really think about this and stop committing these offenses,you are the guidelines for the violation in charge one is those guidelines are four to ten months.that is far too short a term to afford deterrence in this case.
i do find that my sentence,which will hopefully get to you,must be above the advisory guideline range,just to try to a ffect you,in causing you to obey the conditions of supervised release.
app.at.the district court concluded that aldeen abidance of the conditions of supervised release,ha s been almost nil in this case.id.at.judgment was entered on july.
this appeal followed.

procedural reasonableness 
applicable law

the court must state in open court the reasons for its imposition of a particular sentence,c,and where the sentence is outside an advisory guidelines range,the court must also state the specific reason for the sentence imposed,in open court as well as in writing with specificity in a statement of reasons form that is part of the judgment,id.c.see generally united states sindima,cir.the sentencing court statement of reasons must at least explain in enough detail to allow a reviewing court,the defendant,his or her counsel,and members of the public to understand why the considerations used as justifications
