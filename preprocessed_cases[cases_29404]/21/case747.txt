appellant david cadieux was convicted as a of a firearm in violation of g and sentenced to months under the armed career criminal act acca,e.on appeal,he contends that the trial court admission of a recording of a call made by a declarant whom appellant did not have the opportunity to violated the confrontation clause and the trial court improperly classified appellant conviction for indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen.laws ch,as a violent felony under the acca because his conviction was for a crime that covered both violent and conduct.
a.the call for help 
on may,the police responded to a call reporting that a drunken cadieux was brandishing a shotgun during an argument with his girlfriend,theresa nye,at his home in rural maine.a convicted felon since the,cadieux lived on the property with nye and her children.when nye returned home from work around,she found cadieux in the barn drunk and angry,apparently having been kicked by a horse.they argued,and eventually nye asked cadieux to leave.during this exchange,cadieux picked up a shotgun lying nearby in the barn.at this time,jolene nye,theresa daughter,arrived home with her boyfriend and child.theresa told jolene not to get involved in the argument and to go into the house because there were guns in the barn.hysterical,jolene entered the house and called the police.as she spoke with the dispatcher,her mother tried to persuade her to hang up the phone.
jolene had the following exchange with the dispatcher 
jolene um,i have,i do care mom,he 
police hi,hello 
jolene hello 
police talk with me,try to calm down,what going on hi

jolene huh 
police are you the first house on the right 
jolene i think the second,my mom wants to talk to you.
she then handed the phone to her mother.at some point,cadieux fled into the nearby woods.
when the police arrived,they set up a tactical team around the perimeter of the house and searched for cadieux.he was discovered hours later,around midnight,as he attempted to enter the barn through a locked rear door.the police found the shotgun,which was missing a clip,and an antique rifle stuffed into a crawlspace underneath the barn foundation.the police also found a shotgun shell in the barn near where the horses were kept.a search the next day revealed the missing shotgun clip in a vest hanging in the barn close to many of cadieux possessions.
cadieux was arrested for being a felon in possession of a firearm.when he was taken into custody,cadieux insisted that he had a firearm identification card issued in massachusetts and could have guns on his property if he wanted.
b.the failed plea agreement and trial 
on july,cadieux entered into a plea agreement under.c c.the agreement specified a base offense level and criminal history category ii,which resulted in an initial guidelines range of months.at the hearing on september,probation informed the court that cadieux was subject to a sentencing enhancement as an armed career criminal because cadieux had three prior violent felony convictions.see e.among other things,he argued that his conviction for indecent assault and battery on a minor did not qualify as a third strike because the statute captured consensual sexual touching that could not be deemed violent within the meaning of the acca.the presentence report,to which cadieux did not object,stated that cadieux was born on september.in a opinion,the court below found that a comparison between the indictment and the elements of the statute as illuminated by applicable case law established that cadieux,as an adult,had committed an indecent sexual touching of a child which,under our precedent,was a violent felony under the acca.see united states cadieux,d,the court permitted cadieux to withdraw his plea,and the case went to trial.
at trial,over cadieux objection,the district court allowed the government to introduce a recording of jolene statements to the dispatcher.jolene did not testify.the court concluded that the recording was admissible either as a business or public record that the statements themselves,though hearsay,could be introduced either as excited utterances or present sense impressions and that the statements were nontestimonial and therefore exempt from confrontation clause challenge.
after a trial,cadieux was convicted on one count of being a of a firearm.the court subsequently imposed a sentence of months incarceration,the minimum term applicable under the acca.see e.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
confrontation clause 
appellant first challenges the admission of the statements to the operator.in crawford washington,the supreme court held that the sixth amendment confrontation clause bars admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify,and the defendant had a prior opportunity for,d.appellant objects to the district court classification of jolene nye statements as nontestimonial.
we review de novo the question of whether or not a given statement,in context,should be deemed testimonial.united states brito,cir.in crawford,the court offered no precise definition of which statements were to be regarded as testimonial and which were not.brito,at.instead,the court set out,for illustrative purposes,a trio of formulations that comes within the core class of testimonial statements.id.quoting crawford,at.
the first formulation encompasses ex parte testimony or its functional is,material such as affidavits,custodial examinations,prior testimony that the defendant was unable to,or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially.the second encompasses extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials,such as affidavits,depositions,prior testimony,or confessions.the third encompasses statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.
id.quoting crawford,at.
the supreme court has clarified the circumstances under which the admission of a recording of an absent witness will offend the sixth amendment.see davis washington,d.the davis court held that statements made to a operator are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.id.emphasis added.by contrast,such statements are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency,and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.id.
the davis court identified several factors that should guide courts in this objective inquiry,including 
was the declarant speaking about current events as they were actually happening,requiring police assistance rather than describing past events 
would a reasonable listener conclude that the declarant was facing an ongoing emergency that called for help 
was the nature of what was asked and answered during the course of a call such that,viewed objectively,the elicited statements were necessary to be able to resolve the present emergency rather than simply to learn what had happened in the past 
what was the level of formality of the interview for example,was the caller frantic,in an environment that was neither tranquil nor safe 
see id.at emphasis in original.
under the davis guideposts,the statements recorded during the call are nontestimonial hearsay.the daughter is speaking about events in real time,as she witnessed them transpire through a window in her home at no point is there a description of past events.she specifically requests police assistance.the dispatcher questions are tailored to identify the location of the emergency,its nature,and perpetrator.finally,jolene nye is hysterical as she speaks to the dispatcher,in an environment that is neither tranquil nor,as far as the dispatcher could reasonably tell,safe.the exchange was not part of a formal police interrogation designed to elicit statements for the purpose of a later prosecution.the emergency did not end until cadieux was apprehended,hours after jolene nye spoke to the dispatcher.
nonetheless,appellant insists jolene was quite aware that her statements would be recorded by the police and used for a prosecutorial purpose because of her mother pleas to hang up so that cadieux would not get into trouble.therefore,in appellant view,her statements fall within the core class of testimonial statements made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.crawford,at.this argument is unavailing.the court in davis specifically directs courts to examine the nature of both what was asked and answered.at.the dispatcher questions were made with the object of procuring information relevant to providing emergency police assistance.jolene statements,though at times muddled by her mother interventions,were similarly directed towards that end.ordinarily,statements made to the police while the declarant or others are still in personal danger can not be said to have been made with consideration of their legal ramifications.brito,at.theresa nye desire not to involve the police does not alter the fact that jolene call was plainly a call for help,relating to events transpiring in real time,while danger was still present.as such,in the totality of the circumstances,they were nontestimonial.the district court admission of the call is affirmed.
sentencing 
appellant contends that the court erred when it classified his conviction for indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen as a violent felony under the acca.whether a crime constitutes a violent felony under the acca is a question of law,reviewed de novo.united states sacko,cir.
the acca provides that anyone convicted as a felon in possession of a firearm is subject to a term of incarceration for not less than fifteen years if he has three prior convictions for a violent felony.e.the statute defines violent felony as any crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year which 
i has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or 
ii is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
id.e emphasis added.appellant concedes that he has two prior convictions that qualify as violent felonies within the meaning of the statute.the question presented here is whether his conviction falls within the acca residual provision for crimes that otherwise involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
the trilogy 
the supreme court has undertaken the difficult task of determining whether a prior conviction under state law constitutes a violent felony under the acca in a trilogy of cases beginning with taylor united states,d.in taylor,the supreme court instructed sentencing courts to take a categorical approach,which generally looks only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.id.at.in order to impose an acca enhancement based on a defendant prior conviction under state law for burglary under clause ii,a sentencing court must refer to the statutory elements of the prior offense to ensure that the defendant was in fact convicted of generic is,the unlawful or unprivileged entry into,or remaining in,a building or structure,with intent to commit a crime.id.at.where the state law definition of burglary was broader than the generic offense,under a nongeneric burglary statute,the categorical approach permits the court to examine the record of conviction to determine whether a jury was actually required to find all the elements of generic burglary.id.at.the court explained,
for example,in a state whose burglary statutes include entry of an automobile as well as a building,if the indictment or information and jury instructions show that the defendant was charged only with a burglary of a building,and that the jury necessarily had to find an entry of a building to convict,then the government should be allowed to use the conviction for enhancement.
id.we have called this a categorical approach.united states miller,cir.
in shepard united states,d,the supreme court addressed this categorical approach in the context of a prior guilty plea to an offense under a nongeneric burglary statute,holding that an inquiry 
under the acca to determine whether a plea of guilty to burglary defined by a nongeneric statute necessarily admitted elements of the generic offense is limited to the terms of the charging document,the terms of a plea agreement or transcript of colloquy between judge and defendant in which the factual basis for the plea was confirmed by the defendant,or to some comparable judicial record of this information.
id.at.the court,however,rejected the use of a police report as a basis for judicial because permitting a sentencing judge considering an acca enhancement to make a disputed finding of fact about what the defendant and state judge must have understood as the factual basis of the prior plea raises sixth and fourteenth amendment concerns.id.at.
recently,the supreme court again used the categorical approach to determine whether an offense qualifies as a violent felony under the acca residual clause.in james united states,d,the court considered whether florida attempted burglary statute presented a sufficient potential risk of injury to qualify as a violent felony within the meaning of the acca residual provision.in so doing,the court stated that the specific offenses enumerated in section e ii provide one baseline from which to measure whether other similar conduct otherwise presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.id.at.the court found that the risk posed by attempted burglary under florida that posed by its closest clause ii analogue,completed from 
the possibility of a confrontation between the burglar and a third an occupant,a police officer,or a comes to investigate.that is,the risk arises not from the completion of the burglary,but from the possibility that an innocent person might appear while the crime is in progress.
id.at citing united states payne,cir.indeed,the court reasoned,encounters may occur much more frequently during attempted burglaries than the completed sort because it is precisely due to such encounters that many planned burglaries do not progress beyond the attempt stage.id.at.thus,because attempted burglary under florida law presented at least as much risk as completed burglary,the court concluded that it qualified as a violent felony under the residual clause.id.at.
the supreme court articulated the categorical approach as follows w e consider whether the elements of the offense are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the residual provision,without inquiring into the specific conduct of th e particular offender.id.at
