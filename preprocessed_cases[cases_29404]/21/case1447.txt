we consider several challenges to the trial and sentencing of john rigas,the former ceo of adelphia communications adelphia,and his son timothy rigas,adelphia former cfo together,the rigases,including the rigases claims that their sentences were procedurally and substantively unreasonable.
background 
the history of massive corporate fraud that forms the background of these proceedings has been set forth exhaustively in united states rigas,cir.we supply here only a brief summary of the relevant procedural history.
trial and sentencing 
in september,the rigases were with michael rigas,james brown,and michael mulcahey,who were also executives at multiple counts of securities fraud,wire fraud,bank fraud,and criminal conspiracy.in june,following a trial in the united states district court for the southern district of new york leonard sand,judge,a jury convicted the rigases of conspiracy,bank fraud,and securities fraud but acquitted them of wire fraud.michael rigas was acquitted of conspiracy and wire fraud,with the jury remaining deadlocked on the other counts he later pleaded guilty to a charge of making a false entry in the books and records of adelphia in violation of e.brown pleaded guilty prior to trial and testified as a government witness.mulcahey was acquitted of all charges.see rigas,at.
for each of the rigases,the initial presentence investigation reports psr,prepared by the united states probation office probation office,calculated,under the united states sentencing guidelines guidelines,a base offense level of six and recommended multiple sentencing enhancements levels because the loss exceeded million four levels because the offense involved more than fifty victims two levels because the offense involved sophisticated means two levels because defendants derived more than million in gross receipts from financial institutions as a result of their offenses two levels because defendants abused the public trust and four levels because appellants were leaders of criminal activity that involve five or more participants.based on these calculations,the psrs concluded that the total offense level for each of the rigases was,their criminal history category was i,and the resulting sentencing range under the guidelines was life imprisonment.however,the probation office recommended a term of ten years imprisonment and five years supervised release for john rigas,and twenty years imprisonment and five years supervised release for timothy rigas.
at a sentencing hearing on june,the district court announced that it would consider the guidelines and the factors in a,and stated that,in its view,the psr calculations were accurate.after hearing argument from counsel,the district court imposed sentences that were more severe than those recommended in the psr,but which nonetheless fell significantly below the recommended guidelines ranges of life imprisonment.specifically,the district court sentenced john rigas principally to an aggregate term of fifteen years imprisonment.the court divided his sentence as follows 
years on each of two counts of bank fraud,the sentences to run concurrently with each other 
years on one count of conspiracy and years on one count of securities fraud,the sentences to run consecutively to each other and concurrently with the bank fraud sentence and 
years on one count of securities fraud,the sentences to run concurrently with each other and the other sentences.
the district court sentenced timothy rigas principally to an aggregate term of twenty years imprisonment,according to the following criteria 
years on each of two counts of bank fraud,the sentences to run concurrently with each other 
years on one count of conspiracy,years on one count of securities fraud,and years on another count of conspiracy,the sentences to run consecutively to each other and concurrently with the bank fraud sentence and 
years on each of the other securities fraud counts,the sentences to run concurrently with each other and the other sentences.
in addition,the rigas family and the government reached a settlement of other matters,under which the rigases forfeited over billion in assets to adelphia.the liquidated value of these assets was million.
appeal and resentencing 
the rigases appealed their convictions,and on may,another panel of our court affirmed the convictions on all counts except one count of bank fraud count for which it found insufficient evidence.see rigas,at.however,the panel concluded that there was sufficient evidence to support a related count of bank fraud count.id.at.the panel remanded the cause for resentencing.id.at.
no new psr was prepared for resentencing,but at the district court request,the probation office informed the district court by letter that the appropriate sentence under the guidelines was still life imprisonment because the aggregate of the statutory maximum terms of the remaining counts of conviction was years,reduced from years.special app.the district court conducted a resentencing hearing on may,and issued a written opinion and order on june.the district court held that it was not required to resentence defendants de novo because count was a small part of the overall conviction and ran concurrently with count,which this court upheld.accordingly,the district court concluded that the reversal was akin to a sentencing error rather than a conviction error,and that only a limited resentencing was required.special app.the district court expressly rejected the rigases argument that under united states quintieri,cir,resentencing had to be de novo because the reversal was based on a conviction error,not a sentencing error,and characterized this distinction as a mechanical test.id.
nevertheless,the district court concluded in an alternative holding that even under de novo or holistic resentencing,there was no basis for a reduction of a sentence which is broader than the relatively minor adjustment occasioned by the reversal of count.indeed,the sentence previously imposed was fully justified under all of the circumstances.special app.in reaching this conclusion,the district court addressed and rejected the rigases challenges to the level sentencing enhancement for loss in excess of million.the court also observed that the rigases made no claim that the reversal of the conviction on count affects the strength or substance of the convictions on the other counts as to which the court of appeals noted there was ample evidence.special app.indeed,the district court concluded that the reversal on count altered neither the applicable guidelines range,nor the seriousness of the ir crimes,nor the suffering which their conduct inflicted on so many people.special app.
despite observing that there was no basis for a reduction in the rigases sentences,special app,the district court in fact applied a minimal adjustment,reducing each sentence by three years,to and years for john and timothy rigas,respectively.special app.
motion for a new trial 
on july,to filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure on the basis of alleged newly discovered evidence of perjury by their former james brown,who had testified at the criminal trial as a government witness and later allegedly provided contradictory testimony in a civil proceeding.on november,the district court denied the motion on the grounds that brown did not commit perjury,see united states rigas,wl,at,dist.lexis,at,the depositions of brown and other witnesses in a civil proceeding were newly available,not newly discovered,since defendants could have pursued their testimony before or during the criminal trial,but did not do so,see id.at,dist.lexis,at and even if brown testimony were perjured or newly discovered,it would not have affected the outcome of the criminal trial,see id.at,dist.lexis,at.
motion to compel discovery 
on december,defendants filed a motion to compel the government to produce its notes from interviews with carl rothenberger,adelphia former lead outside counsel,and other witnesses not called by either party at trial.defendants argued that the notes should have been disclosed to them pursuant to brady maryland,d.the district court denied the motion on january,reasoning that,inter alia,the government had no obligation to produce notes of witnesses who did not testify at trial,and the defendants knew or should have known of rothenberger existence as a possible witness and the relevance of his testimony.see united states rigas,wl,at,dist.lexis,at.
in this appeal,defendants challenge all three of the decisions of the district court outlined above the june,resentencing order,the november,opinion and order denying the rigases motion for a new trial,and the january,memorandum and order denying the rigases motion to compel discovery.
discussion 
reasonableness of the sentences 
following united states booker,d,a district court has broad latitude to impose either a guidelines sentence or a sentence.united states sanchez,cir see also united states cavera,cir en banc.accordingly,the role of the court of appeals is limited to examining a sentence for reasonableness,which is akin to review under an standard.see cavera,at see also gall united states,d holding that courts of appeals must review all inside,just outside,or significantly outside the guidelines a deferential standard sims blot,cir a district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.alteration,citations,and quotation marks omitted.this standard applies both to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence itself and to the procedures employed in arriving at the sentence.united states verkhoglyad,cir.
the rigases allege that their sentences were procedurally unreasonable in several ways.principally,the rigases contend that the district court did not resentence them de novo but instead conducted only a limited resentencing hearing.alternatively,the rigases argue that even under the district court alternative which the scope of resentencing was de court committed several procedural errors,including failures to conduct the individualized assessment required by a make an appropriate calculation of loss to justify a sentencing enhancement exclude an enhancement for bank fraud find facts in support of a sentencing enhancement for leading a conspiracy and specify who exactly was harmed before imposing a fifty victim sentencing enhancement.defendants also argue that their sentences were substantively unreasonable because people convicted of more serious crimes,such as murder and terrorism,have been sentenced to only a few years more than the rigases.
scope of resentencing 
the rigases argue principally that,following our decision in quintieri,at,we have held that defendants must be resentenced de novo where a portion of a conviction has been reversed on appeal.the government asks us to affirm on the basis of the district court limited resentencing because defendants did not challenge their sentences on the initial appeal,thereby waiving any arguments that the sentences were unreasonable,and the sentencing considerations relating to count were entirely severable from the considerations on the other counts,appellee br.
in quintieri,we distinguished between conviction errors,for which de novo resentencing was the default rule,and sentencing errors,for which limited resentencing was the default rule.we held 
when the conviction on one or more charges is overturned on appeal and the case is remanded for resentencing,the constellation of offenses of conviction has been changed and the factual mosaic related to those offenses that the district court must consult to determine the appropriate sentence is likely altered.for the district court to sentence the defendant accurately and appropriately,it must confront the offenses of conviction and facts anew.
at see also id.at r esentencing usually should be de novo when a court of appeals reverses one or more convictions and remands for resentencing.quintieri created a default rule that de novo resentencing is required where a conviction is reversed in part on appeal.quintieri,at today we conclude that when a resentencing results from a vacatur of a conviction,we in effect adhere to the de novo default rule because multiple convictions are inextricably linked in calculating the sentencing range under the guidelines.emphasis added.
moreover,we recognized in quintieri that when a case is remanded for de novo resentencing,the defendant may raise in the district court and,if properly preserved there,on appeal to the court of appeals,issues that he or she had previously waived by failing to raise them.id.at.in clear contrast,we stated that limited resentencing was the default rule where there was a sentencing error de novo resentencing was required for a sentencing error only where one or more specific sentencing errors would undo the sentencing calculation as a whole or the spirit of the mandate otherwise requires de novo resentencing.id.at emphasis added.
accordingly,quintieri supplies two pertinent rules where a count of a conviction is opposed to an aspect of a must be de novo and de novo means anew,id.at,so that a defendant may raise issues even if they would otherwise have been waived.
here,an experienced and respected judge expressed the view that these rules are unduly mechanical.special app.it is nevertheless true that on more than one occasion since quintieri,our court has adhered to the de novo default rule,however characterized,in successive cases where a portion of a defendant conviction was overturned on appeal,even though the portion of the conviction that was overturned was unlikely to alter the ultimate sentence in any significant way.for example,in united states hertular we explained that,
although our reversal of the defendant conviction changes the constellation of offenses relevant to sentencing,the factual mosaic may be little altered.nevertheless,mindful that the law entrusts district courts,not courts of appeals,with the primary responsibility for weighing the totality of circumstances relevant to sentencing,we conclude that,even in these circumstances,we must vacate the defendant sentence and remand the case to the district court so that it may decide,in the first instance,whether a conviction on three rather than four counts affects its assessment of the sentencing factors detailed in a.
cir quoting quintieri,at see also united states draper,cir concluding,where defendants were convicted of witness retaliation,witness tampering,narcotics,and firearm charges,that because we are reversing the witness retaliation convictions,de novo resentencing is required and we are compelled to remand this matter to the district court in any event.emphases added.indeed,we have also observed that quintieri has particular salience in the regime,under which a district court must make an individualized assessment based on all the sentencing factors in a.see hertular,at gall.at,d see also a requiring an assessment of the nature and circumstances of the offense id.at a requiring an assessment of the seriousness of the offense,adequate deterrence,and just punishment.
in this case,the district court concluded that a de novo resentencing was not required because our court reversal of the conviction on count was more akin to a sentencing error than a conviction error.to reach this conclusion,the district court decided first that counts and were quite different from the remainder of the indictment,such that it was unlikely that the reversal of count would alter the appropriate sentence special app.accordingly,the district court ruled that it could,consistent with quintieri,conduct only a limited resentencing.see,quintieri,at we conclude that in this case,because we identified a particular sentencing issue necessitating the defendant total offense level on the conspiracy count was improperly enhanced as a result of double counting the remand was limited,not de novo.because the remand was limited,the defendant may not now raise arguments that he had an incentive and an opportunity to raise previously but did not raise,absent a cogent and compelling reason for permitting him to do so.emphasis added united states stanley,cir concluding that de novo resentencing is unnecessary when the remanding court identifies a only sentencing error and does not explicitly limit the scope of resentencing.
we disagree with the premise of the district court analysis.quintieri expressly created a default rule that resentencing is required where part of a conviction is reversed on appeal.quintieri,at holding that when a resentencing results from a vacatur of a conviction,we in effect adhere to the de novo default rule of the sixth,eighth,ninth,and eleventh circuit s,because multiple convictions are inextricably linked in calculating the sentencing range under the guidelines.emphasis added see also draper,at stating that because we are reversing the witness retaliation convictions,de novo resentencing is required emphasis added.in quintieri,we created a rule,not a guideline.to the extent that any language in quintieri or cases that quintieri suggest,quintieri,at r esentencing usually should be de novo when a court of appeals reverses one or more convictions and remands for resentencing.emphasis added united states atehortva,cir when a defendant challenges convictions on particular counts that are inextricably tied to other counts in determining the sentencing range under the guidelines,the defendant assumes the risk of undoing the intricate knot of calculations should he succeed.emphasis added we resolve any ambiguity today.in rigas,the court of appeals identified a conviction error,not a mere sentencing error,when it reversed the convictions on count.see rigas,at.accordingly,the rigases were entitled to be resentenced de novo at a plenary sentencing rehearing.
we also disagree with the government proposed interpretation of quintieri.according to the government,if a challenge to a sentence has been waived,the law of the case doctrine and quintieri require resentencing de novo only where the spirit of the mandate requires as much such as when the reversed portion of the conviction is inextricably linked to the remainder of the conviction,an issue became relevant only after appellate review,or there is a cogent or compelling reason for resentencing de novo,such as a change in controlling law.otherwise,the government argues,resentencing should be limited,not de novo.
the government assumes that these three considerations apply where an appellate court has reversed a conviction.however,it is clear from quintieri that the three considerations identified by the government apply only where an appellate court has reversed part of a sentence,not part of a conviction.see at discussing these exceptions under the heading implications of a limited remand.the spirit of the mandate and other considerations identified by the government are exceptions to limited resentencing following reversal of a sentence 
that resentencing usually should be de novo when a court of appeals reverses one or more convictions and remands for resentencing,then,does not deviate from the rule that absent explicit language in the mandate to the contrary,resentencing should be limited when the court of appeals upholds the underlying convictions but determines that a sentence has been erroneously imposed and remands to correct that sentencing error.to be sure,there may be circumstances when we reverse a sentence in which the spirit of the mandate requires de novo sentencing,for example when the reversal effectively undoes the entire knot of calculation,but this is not such a case.
quintieri,at final emphasis added see also id.at but when a resentencing is necessitated by one or more specific sentencing errors,unless correction of those errors would undo the sentencing calculation as a whole or the spirit of the mandate otherwise requires de novo resentencing,we in effect adhere to the default rule of limited resentencing.emphasis added id.at e ven when a remand is limited,an issue may be raised if it arises as a result of events that occur after the original sentence.
in quintieri,we determined that the basis for the prior reversal was the defendant,double counting,see id.at the defendant conviction.accordingly,we held that there was a presumption that resentencing would be limited,not de novo,but that the defendant would be entitled to de novo review if he could show that the spirit of the mandate requires de novo sentencing,an issue became relevant only after the initial appellate review,or there is a cogent or compelling reason for resentencing de novo,such as a change in controlling law.by contrast,the prior appeal in the instant case reversed a portion of the defendants conviction,and so defendants were entitled to be resentenced de novo and,as noted,to raise in the district court and,if properly preserved there,on appeal to the court of appeals,issues that he or she had previously waived by failing to raise them.id.at.
to reiterate,on remand,a district court that is required to resentence de novo must reconsider the sentences imposed on each count,as well as the aggregate sentence.in such circumstances,the court should determine whether the change in the constellation of offenses of conviction has altered the factual mosaic related to those offenses.quintieri,at.if so,the court must reconsider the sentence imposed on the count or counts affected by the vacatur of the conviction of another count,as well as on the aggregate sentence,in light of the sentencing factors in a.if the court determines that the factual mosaic related to a count of conviction has not been altered,no further proceeding as to that count is necessary,except to the extent it affects the aggregate sentence.
procedural reasonableness 
we turn now to the district court alternative holding,in which the court imposed a new sentence on the assumption that it was resentencing de novo.as noted above,the rigases offer multiple arguments in support of their contention that the district court de novo resentencing was procedurally wit,they argue that the district court failed to conduct the individualized assessment required by a make an appropriate calculation of loss to justify a sentencing enhancement exclude an enhancement for bank fraud find facts in support of a sentencing enhancement for leading a conspiracy and specify who exactly was harmed before imposing a fifty victim sentencing enhancement.although the rigases have offered additional reasons why their sentences were procedurally unreasonable,we confine our discussion to these arguments,which consumed the bulk of the briefing on procedural reasonableness.
regarding the statutory requirement of an individualized assessment of wrongdoing and appropriate punishment,see a,we observe that prior to the may,resentencing hearing,the district court solicited from the probation office revisions to the original psr.see special app.at the resentencing hearing,the district court stated on the record that it had also read the rigases sentencing memoranda and would consider the factors in a.in our view,the court written ruling reflects its informed consideration of these factors.see cavera,at stating that our review for procedural reasonableness requires that we be confident that the sentence resulted from the district court considered judgment as to what was necessary to address the various,often conflicting,purposes of sentencing.in addition to specifically mentioning the sentencing considerations,special app,the district court discussed the applicable guidelines range devoting considerable discussion to the level additur for loss causation the rigases continued argument that they engaged in no criminal conduct but were themselves victims the seriousness of their offenses and the suffering caused by the rigases crimes.special app.that the district court did not parse every sentencing factor individually or address in writing each of defendants sentencing arguments does not render the ultimate sentence procedurally unreasonable.see united states fernandez,cir we have imposed no requirement that a sentencing judge precisely identify either the factors set forth in a or specific arguments bearing on the implementation of those factors in order to comply with her duty to consider all the a factors along with the guidelines applicable range.as we have previously stated,we presume,in the absence of record evidence suggesting otherwise,that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors.id.at.
with respect to loss causation,the rigases argue at length that the losses in this case,including most notably the bankruptcy of adelphia,may reflect,not the rigases misrepresentation s,but changed economic circumstances,changed investor expectations,new or facts,conditions,or other events.appellant br.quoting dura pharm.broudo,d.the government argues that the amount of loss attributable to the rigases fraud may be measured in billions,not millions,and so even if the entire decline in adelphia market capitalization was caused by a number of factors,the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to demonstrate,by a preponderance standard,that substantially all of the decline was a reasonable estimate of the loss.appellee br.
in calculating the amount of loss under the guidelines,a sentencing court need only make a reasonable estimate of the loss.cmt.c.although d etermining this amount is no easy task,some estimate must be made for guidelines calculation purposes,or perpetrators of fraud would get a windfall.united states ebbers,cir.although it is true that t he loss must be the result of the fraud,id.at,as opposed to other,occurrences,we agree with the district court and the government that,regardless of the precise amount of the loss attributable to the rigases fraud,that figure easily exceeds million.for example,as we noted in our previous opinion in this case,
t he evidence at trial showed that throughout the period of the conspiracy,defendants took over million dollars from adelphia cash management system for personal expenses ranging from to purchase pairs of bedroom slippers for timothy rigas,to over million to produce a film by ellen rigas,to million to pay off rigas family margin loans.the missing money was obscured by the commingling of cash between adelphia and companies owned by the rigases.
rigas,at.in any event,the district court reasoned that even if a loss of only per share were attributable to the rigases fraudulent conduct,that would still satisfy the million threshold for the sentencing adjustment applied to the count.see special app.see also rigas,at noting that on the day that adelphia billion in previously unrecorded liabilities were disclosed,the company stock price dropped about percent to,and that adelphia filed for bankruptcy within months.accordingly,we have no trouble affirming the district court estimate of loss caused by the rigases fraud 
it is undisputed that,at resentencing,the government did not seek a enhancement for bank fraud in excess of million in gross receipts.the rigases contend that the district court considered it anyway,based on the district court comment in a footnote that the rigases arguments about the bank fraud enhancement were totally without merit.special app.on this basis alone,we can not conclude that the district court erroneously considered an abandoned sentencing enhancement for bank fraud.on resentencing,the district court agreed with the probation office that the rigases offense levels surpassed what was required under the guidelines for a recommended sentence of life maximum aggregate sentence then imposed sentences that were substantially below the applicable guidelines range.as a practical matter,even without the enhancement for bank fraud,the guidelines would call for life imprisonment.accordingly,whatever ambiguity exists in the record with respect to the district court consideration of the bank fraud enhancement is de minimis,and certainly does not render the sentence procedurally unreasonable.
we further disagree with the rigases that the district court erred in not making the necessary factual findings before adopting the psr recommendation that the rigases roles in defrauding adelphia warranted a sentencing enhancement.see authorizing a additur for organizing or leading a criminal activity.the thrust of the rigases argument here is that the district court failed to make adequate factual findings to support this enhancement.according to the rigases,had the district court scrutinized the record,it would have realized that the rigases merely oversaw employees who committed fraud and were not themselves criminally responsible for any misconduct.appellant br.we detect no error in the district court conclusion,which expressly adopt ed the position set forth by the government at the sentencing hearings,and satisfied its obligation to make factual findings.united states eyman,cir.for the same reason,we also reject the rigases argument that the district court failed to specify who exactly was harmed before imposing a fifty victim sentencing enhancement.
substantive reasonableness 
the rigases also argue that their sentences were substantively is,the sentences of twelve and seventeen years for john and timothy rigas,respectively,were greater than necessary to accomplish the purposes of sentencing just punishment,deterrence,rehabilitation.appellant br.quoting a.in particular,the rigases observe that their sentences for crimes are only slightly shorter than the sentences of some admitted or convicted terrorists.see appellant br.when,at oral argument,we inquired what a substantively reasonable sentence might be,counsel for the rigases replied that it was unclear but that any sentence must take account of the rigases culpability.
where,as here,we have identified no significant procedural error,a reviewing court then considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an standard,taking into account the totality of the circumstances,including the extent of any variance from the guidelines range.cavera,at raggi,concurring brackets omitted quoting gall.at.as the en banc court observed in cavera,w e will set aside a district court substantive determination only in exceptional cases where the trial court decision can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.at quoting rigas,at summarizing the standard.for example,
a t the substantive stage of reasonableness review,an appellate court may consider whether a factor relied on by a sentencing court can bear the weight assigned to it.to be sure,this review is deferential.as a result,we do not consider what weight we would ourselves have given a particular factor.rather,we consider whether the factor,as explained by the district court,can bear the weight assigned it under the totality of circumstances in the case.
cavera,at citations omitted accordingly,our role in sentencing appeals is to patrol the boundaries of reasonableness,while heeding the supreme court renewed message that responsibility for sentencing is placed largely in the precincts of the district courts.id.
our decisions addressing substantive reasonableness have focused more on the process of sentencing than on actually defining the boundaries of substantive reasonableness.insofar as we have defined as unreasonable a sentence that can not be can not be located within the range of permissible decisions,id.at quoting rigas,at,that definition is obviously is reasonable or unreasonable is what other cases have deemed reasonable or unreasonable.it is therefore unsurprising that several courts,including our own,have cautioned against converting review for substantive reasonableness into a rubber stamp.united states rattoballi,cir our review for reasonableness,though deferential,will not equate to a rubber stamp.see also united states pinson,cir u ntil the supreme court tells us otherwise,appellate review continues to have an important role to play and must not be regarded as a rubber stamp.united states moreland,cir although a reasonableness standard clearly requires us to afford a degree of deference to the sentencing decisions of the district court,reasonableness is not a for rubber stamp.
in other areas of the law,we employ various concepts that seek to capture the same idea represented in the phrase substantive reasonableness.for example,we held that in considering a motion for a new trial in a criminal
