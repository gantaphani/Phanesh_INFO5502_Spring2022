petitioner appellant john rivera rivera was convicted on september,of one count of depraved indifference murder in violation of new york penal law after his estranged wife died from a single gunshot wound to the head at range.in december,the appellate division rejected rivera direct appeal,people rivera,dep t,and,on april,judge rosenblatt of the new york court of appeals denied rivera leave to appeal to that court,people rivera.
rivera subsequently filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york townes,arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for depraved indifference murder.applying the new york law of depraved indifference in existence at the time rivera was convicted at trial in september,the district court denied relief.see rivera cuomo,cv,wl,at.rivera now appeals.in june,this court granted a certificate of appealability on the specific issue of whether,under the law as it existed when appellant conviction became final,the evidence was legally sufficient to support a conviction for depraved indifference murder.
on appeal,rivera raises two arguments.first,rivera argues that the district court erred in applying the law in effect when he was convicted at trial on september,rather than the law in effect at the time his conviction became final on july.second,rivera argues that,under the law in effect at the time his conviction became final,the evidence was legally insufficient to support a conviction for depraved indifference murder.
for the reasons that follow,we agree with both of rivera contentions.accordingly,rivera petition for a writ of habeas corpus must be granted.
background 
in its memorandum and order of december,the district court provided a detailed account of the factual background of the instant petition.see rivera,wl,at.we assume familiarity with the district court order and repeat the facts herein only to the extent necessary to explain our ruling.
on the night of january,kimberly cassas rivera cassas,rivera estranged wife,suffered a single,fatal gunshot wound to the head from a beretta handgun fired at range.rivera was ultimately indicted in new york state court on two counts of murder in the second degree intentional murder in violation of new york penal law and depraved indifference murder in violation of as well as lesser charges not relevant to this appeal.
in the summer of,rivera was tried on these charges in the supreme court for the state of new york,kings county.despite the dual indictment,at trial,the prosecution pursued a single theory of intentional murder.specifically,the prosecution argued that,after a short and tumultuous marriage,and angry that cassas was filing for divorce and seeking primary custody of their infant son,rivera,who had a history of violent outbursts and domestic abuse,lured cassas to his apartment with the intention of killing her and then,while the two were standing on the sidewalk outside the apartment,put a handgun to her head and pulled the trigger.all of the state evidence at trial was calculated to support this theory of intentional murder,including evidence that rivera was in possession of the beretta handgun used to kill cassas immediately before the murder,testimony from cassas divorce lawyer that rivera called her twice in the days and hours before the murder threatening to kill cassas with her gun,and testimony from rivera former employer that the day before the shooting rivera told his that he could take cassas,could stand her,and wished her dead.
indeed,in summation,the prosecutor told the jury 
the people maintain it was an intentional act e veryone agrees that when you take this gun,which they call a deadly weapon for a good reason,and when it is pressed against the head and the trigger is pulled and the gun is discharged,there can be no question in any reasonable person mind that whoever pulled that trigger intended to cause the death of the individual against whose head it was pressed.so i submit that is not an issue.this is an intent.an intent to kill.emphasis added.
throughout trial,rivera sole defense was that cassas committed suicide.according to rivera version,cassas,who had been depressed ever since their son birth eight months earlier,showed up on the night of her death distraught and,threatening to kill herself,pulled the beretta handgun from her car and put it to her head.although rivera attempted to take the gun away from her,while the gun was pressed near her temple,a distraught cassas pulled the trigger,inflicting upon herself a single gunshot wound to the head.in support of this theory,rivera presented,inter alia,both expert and eyewitness testimony suggesting that,at some point immediately before the gun went off,there had been a struggle between rivera and cassas for possession of the gun.
during the trial,defense counsel moved to dismiss the depraved indifference murder charge for lack of evidence.the court denied the motion and charged the jury on both intentional and depraved indifference murder,as well as on manslaughter in the first degree as a lesser included offense to intentional murder.manslaughter as a lesser included offense to depraved indifference murder,reckless manslaughter was not submitted to the jury.
the jury eventually found rivera not guilty of intentional murder,but guilty of depraved indifference murder and found rivera guilty of the remaining misdemeanor charges not relevant to this appeal.the court then sentenced rivera to years to life in prison on the depraved indifference murder charge.
on direct appeal,rivera challenged his conviction for depraved indifference murder on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of recklessness since all of the evidence adduced at trial went to a theory of intentional conduct.the appellate division rejected this argument and upheld rivera conviction.see rivera,at.
on april,judge rosenblatt of the new york court of appeals denied rivera leave to appeal to that court.see rivera,at.
in april,rivera filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to in the eastern district of new york,on the sole ground that,by affirming rivera conviction for depraved indifference murder,the state courts unreasonably applied federal law.see d.specifically,rivera argued that the evidence was legally insufficient in his case to support a finding of reckless and depraved conduct since all of the evidence adduced at trial went to a theory of intentional conduct,and therefore his conviction violated the rule of jackson virginia,d,requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of a crime to support a conviction.see rivera,wl,at.the district court disagreed,holding that,under the law of depraved indifference in effect at the time of rivera trial in september,the evidence was legally sufficient to support a conviction for depraved indifference murder.see id.at.rivera now appeals.
in june,this court granted a certificate of appealability on the specific issue of whether,under the law as it existed when appellant conviction became final,the evidence was legally sufficient to support a conviction for depraved indifference murder,and this appeal ensued.

standard of review 
we review the district court denial of habeas relief de novo,henry ricks,cir,accepting the district court factual findings unless clearly erroneous,drake portuondo,cir.
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,we may grant habeas relief only if the challenged state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d acosta artuz,cir.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of federal law if it correctly identifies the governing legal principle but unreasonably applies or unreasonably refuses to extend that principle to the facts of a particular case.richard carpinello,cir.
ii.governing federal law 
under the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments,no conviction may be sustained except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.henry,at quoting in re winship,d.a habeas petitioner is entitled to habeas corpus relief if it is found that upon the record evidence adduced at trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson,at.when reviewing the sufficiency of a state conviction,t his standard must be applied with explicit reference to the substantive elements of the criminal offense as defined by state law.langston smith,cir quoting jackson,at.
iii.applicable state law 
under new york law,a person is guilty of depraved indifference murder when u nder circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person,and thereby causes the death of another person.penal emphasis added.thus,recklessness has always been an element of the offense of depraved indifference murder,see,people sanchez,which the prosecution had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt in order to support rivera conviction,see langston,at.because one who acts intentionally in shooting a person to death can not at the same time act recklessly,people gallagher,under law,intentional murder and depraved indifference murder are mutually exclusive,fama comm r of corr,cir.
from to,the court of appeals understood depraved indifference to refer to neither the mens rea nor actus reus of the crime of depraved indifference murder,but to the factual setting in which the risk creating conduct must occur.people register,emphasis removed from original accord sanchez,at.under this formulation,the very facts establishing a risk of death approaching certainty and thus presenting compelling circumstantial evidence of intent for example,a point blank shooting of a victim in the head likewise demonstrated depraved indifference.policano herbert.
in,however,in people hafeez,the new york court of appeals departed slightly from this earlier understanding of depraved indifference,recognizing that certain murders are so quintessentially intentional that they can not properly be categorized as depraved indifference murder.see,see also people feingold,noting that the shift away from the formulation of depraved indifference murder began with hafeez.in that case,hafeez had plotted for months with a friend to get revenge on the victim with whom they had a previous altercation and had lured the victim out of a bar,where,after a brief struggle,the friend administered a fatal wound to the victim heart with a knife.see hafeez,at.at trial,the state pursued a theory of intentional murder the defendants plotted the murder for months in advance,lured the victim out of the bar to a place where he would be vulnerable to attack,and then killed the victim instantly by way of a single deliberate wound to his chest.see id.at.hafeez,on the other hand,insisted that the death was accidental he and his friend intended only to beat up the victim but,during a fistfight,the victim was accidentally stabbed.see id.at,dissent.the jury acquitted hafeez of intentional murder,but convicted him of depraved indifference murder.
on appeal,the court of appeals held that,despite some possible evidence of a struggle,because the overwhelming weight of the evidence suggested that hafeez and his friend had plotted the attack ahead of time,deliberately lured the victim out of the bar to effectuate their plan,and killed the victim by way of a single deliberate wound,the attack was quintessentially intentional,and therefore the heightened recklessness required for depraved indifference murder was simply not present.see id.at,quoting sanchez,at.as such,because the actions of both defendants were focused on first isolating,and then intentionally injuring,the victim,no reasonable jury could have found hafeez guilty of depraved indifference murder rather than intentional murder.id.at.
the court of appeals further eroded its prior case law in people gonzalez,decided in march.see.finding that defendant act of shooting his victim at close range could not be depraved indifference murder,the court explained 
depraved indifference murder differs from intentional murder in that it results not from a specific,conscious intent to cause death,but from an indifference to or disregard of the risks attending defendant conduct w here,as here,a defendant conduct is specifically designed to cause the death of the victim,it simply can not be said that the defendant is indifferent to the consequences of his or her conduct.
id.at.were it otherwise,the court cautioned,it would improperly convert every intentional homicide into a depraved indifference murder,id.at,since there is always some remote chance,if the jury wishes to so speculate,that a defendant who shot his victim point blank did so spontaneously or accidentally,see id.at.the court made clear,however,that such speculation can not convert an intentional homicide into depraved indifference murder.see id.
after rivera conviction became final in july,the new york court of appeals decided a number of additional cases that further recast the formulation of depraved indifference murder,see people payne,people suarez,until finally,in people feingold,the court formally overruled register and sanchez,see also id.stating that,in overruling register and sanchez,the court was simply confirming what was implicit in the line of cases beginning with hafeez.however,because these cases were decided after rivera conviction became final in july,we cite to them only to the extent that they provide a clarification of preexisting law.see henry,at people policano.in any event,as discussed further below,even in the absence of these additional cases,the new york court of appeals had made sufficiently clear by the time rivera conviction became final in july that facts such as those in rivera case could not support a conviction for depraved indifference murder.
iv.law to be applied on collateral review 
for habeas purposes,a new york conviction becomes final days after the new york court of appeals denies leave to appeal,which is when the petitioner time to apply for a writ of certiorari to the united state supreme court expires.see fernandez artuz,cir.
as a preliminary matter,the district court erred in finding that the applicable law of depraved indifference murder was the law in effect when rivera was convicted at trial on september.see rivera,wl,at.instead,the district court should have applied the law as it existed at the time rivera conviction became final,days after the new york court of appeals denied rivera leave to appeal to that court.see fernandez,at.applying this rule,rivera conviction became final on july.since,as we explain in further detail below,the date used to determine which version of new york law to apply is determinative in rivera case,we reverse the district court on this point.
turning to the merits,rivera asks us to find that,by the time his conviction became final in july and thus after hafeez and gonzalez had been decided the law of depraved indifference had so fundamentally changed that no,shooting could be depraved indifference murder.appellant br.the state,on the other hand,suggests that hafeez and gonzalez effected no change in new york law of depraved indifference murder because both of those decisions necessarily rest on the particular facts of those cases.appellee br.thus,the state argues,the decisions in hafeez and gonzalez have no bearing on rivera case.id.at.while we decline to go as far as rivera urges,neither do we accept the state position.rather,we find that,although perhaps some shootings could still have been categorized as depraved indifference murder when rivera conviction became final in july,people baptiste,dep t concluding that the law did not completely change until the new york court of appeals decided payne in october,by that time,under any reasonable view of the evidence adduced at trial,rivera shooting of cassas which,as explained in further detail below,was either undoubtedly intentional or accidental in the course of a struggle could not support a depraved indifference murder conviction.as such,by upholding rivera conviction for depraved indiffer
