harold evans garcía and eric joel carrión cruz are each serving life sentences without the possibility of parole for crimes they committed when they were younger than eighteen years old.after each of them unsuccessfully exhausted a direct appeal and a petition for habeas relief,the united states supreme court decided miller alabama.in miller,the supreme court held that the eighth amendment to the united states constitution forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders.miller.at.evans garcía and carrión cruz each now wish to pursue a new habeas petition,this time attempting to employ miller to secure a potential reduction in their sentences.under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act,stat,they can not pursue their new petitions unless we first certify that the proposed petitions satisfy the requirements of an exception to what is otherwise a bar on second or successive habeas petitions.h.for reasons described below,we grant certification to evans garcía but deny it to carrión cruz.
background 
evans garcía and carrión cruz crimes are described in our prior opinions.see united states evans garcía,f d united states carrión cruz.in brief,they were each convicted of a carjacking resulting in death.evans garcía committed his crime in,seven days before his eighteenth birthday,while carrión cruz was fifteen years and six months old at the time of his crime in.
at the time the petitioners were sentenced,the district court was bound to follow the federal sentencing guidelines,which had not yet been ruled advisory by the supreme court.see united states.booker.under the guidelines,the district court would first calculate an offense level between one and,and then place the defendant in one of six criminal history categories.see sentencing guidelines manual.based on the calculated offense level and criminal history category,the guidelines determined the applicable range within which the district court was required to fix a sentence.id.the court could impose a sentence above or below the range only if it found facts supporting any of several specified grounds for departure.id.
evans garcía offense level and criminal history led to a range including just one sentence life in prison without the possibility of parole.while the guidelines allowed for a potential downward departure from the otherwise mandated sentence for specified reasons not including youth,the court found none of those reasons applicable.for carrión cruz,by contrast,the guidelines provided for a lower sentencing range of to months in prison,primarily because he pled guilty.however,due to the sordid facts of the case,and even after considering the defendant youth and limited intellect,the district court decided to depart upward from the guidelines,imposing a sentence of life without parole.carrión cruz,at.
ii.legal standard 
like other federal prisoners seeking to file second or successive habeas petitions,evans garcía and carrión cruz must obtain certification from a court of appeals before presenting their petitions to the district court.see h.in deciding whether to grant certification in the absence of any newly discovered evidence,we ask whether the petition contain s a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously unavailable.see h.we follow the procedural requirements laid out in section,which governs state prisoners petitions but is in the section applicable to federal prisoners such as the petitioners here.see h a second or successive motion by a federal prisoner must be certified as provided in section.
section specifies that the court of appeals should ask whether the the application makes a prima facie showing that it satisfies the applicable requirements.b c.see also tyler cain,t he court of appeals must determine whether the application makes a prima facie showing that i t satisfies the second habeas standard.second and third alterations in original quoting b c.we have previously held that a prima facie showing at the certification stage is a sufficient showing of possible merit to warrant a fuller exploration by the district court.rodriguez superintendent,bay state corr,cir quoting bennett united states,cir.in other words,our task is not to decide for certain whether the petition has merit,but rather to determine whether it appears reasonably likely that the application satisfies the stringent requirements for the filing of a second or successive petition.id.quoting bennett,at.
consistent with the statute and our precedent,we find good reason to refrain from a full inquiry at this stage,even on a purely legal issue such as retroactivity.we generally do not rule on questions whether of fact or of law until a district court has done so,singleton wulff,a practice that enhances the quality of our decisions both by allowing us to consider the district court analysis and by allowing the parties to hone their arguments before presenting them to us.moreover,in ruling on certification requests,we often must strive to move more quickly than a full consideration of the merits might reasonably require.see rodriguez,at noting that section b d establishes a thirty day limit for certification decisions,but holding that the limit is not fully mandatory.
iii.analysis 
a.we accept the government concession that evans garcía may present his petition to the district court.
the government concedes that miller announced a new rule of constitutional law that was previously unavailable.in particular,miller held that the eighth amendment to the united states constitution forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders.miller alabama.this rule was new because it was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant conviction became final,graham collins,quoting teague lane,and it was previously unavailable because it was issued after the petitioners were sentenced in and,respectively and pursued their first habeas petitions in and,respectively.
whether the new rule announced in miller has been made retroactive by the supreme court presents a much closer question we need not answer that question,however,because the government has also conceded that miller has been made retroactive,at least under the prima facie standard.two circuits have certified second or successive habeas petitions based on miller by relying,in whole or in part,on the same government concession.see johnson united states,cir the government here has conceded that miller is retroactive and we therefore conclude that there is a sufficient showing wang united states,cir.july,unpublished relying in part on the government concession to certify a second or successive habeas petition based on miller.the government plays a central role in criminal law enforcement.moreover,it is fair to say that the government is generally resistant to collateral review of criminal convictions and sentences.accordingly,one might conclude that where the government concedes that a rule favoring prisoners has been made retroactive,that position has at least possible merit warrant ing a fuller exploration by the district court.rodriguez,at cir internal quotation marks omitted.
c ourts are generally limited to addressing the claims and arguments advanced by the parties.henderson.at.see also castro,at scalia,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment our adversary system is designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them,and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief.this is not to say that a government concession necessarily results in an opinion adopting the conceded position.we have sometimes chosen not to accept such concessions,as where the government position is clearly erroneous and has been rejected by a lower court.see computervision,cir.here,though,the retroactivity issue is far from clear,we have no district court order to review,and our own de novo consideration is limited to ascertaining the presence of a prima facie demonstration.in short,the factor
