steven chin leung appeals from two judgments of conviction of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,judge.leung pleaded guilty to two counts of passport fraud in violation of,one count of bail jumping in violation of,and one count of obstruction of justice in violation of.the district court sentenced leung principally to a term of months imprisonment on each count,to be served concurrently.leung challenges his sentence.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for resentencing.
background 
in march,leung fraudulently attempted to obtain a passport at the honolulu passport agency in hawaii.a criminal complaint was subsequently filed in the district court for the district of hawaii,a warrant issued for leung arrest,and leung was arrested a month later in new york city.at leung initial appearance,his counsel inquired into the possibility of pleading guilty to the passport fraud charge in the southern district of new york.see.leung and the government subsequently reached an agreement concerning the plea and the rule transfer,and leung was released in new york on his personal recognizance.the government then filed an information in the district of hawaii charging leung with a single count of passport fraud in violation of,and the case was transferred to the southern district of new york.
after reviewing state department files,the government learned that leung also had fraudulently attempted to obtain a passport in new york in september.after the government discovered this information,the parties negotiated an agreement addressing both passport frauds,and the government alerted the court that the government anticipated filing a second information charging leung with the second passport fraud and that leung would plead guilty to both offenses.
shortly after the terrorist attacks on september,however,leung concocted an elaborate scheme to avoid prosecution for the frauds.pretending to be his own fictional brother,jeffrey leung,leung falsely reported to his attorney that steven leung had died in the attacks,a report that his attorney unwittingly relayed to the district court.shortly thereafter,leung again posed as another fictional brother,william leung,in an attempt to obtain a death certificate for steven leung from the new york city law department world trade center unit law department.in this effort,he telephoned the law department to report that steven leung had worked at the brokerage firm cantor fitzgerald in the world trade center and had died in the attacks.after his initial request for a death certificate was denied for lack of documentation,leung followed up by faxing a letter from william leung to the law department that included a fabricated email exchange between steven leung and scott schertzer,a deceased human resources manager at cantor fitzgerald whose name leung found by searching the internet.the phoney email exchange purported to show that steven leung had begun working at cantor fitzgerald a week before the attacks to establish the inference that he had died on september.
prior to a court conference scheduled for december,the district court received a suspicious telephone call from an individual who refused to identify himself and inquired whether,if leung failed to appear for the conference,the government would seek to dismiss the information pending against him or whether it would seek the issuance of an arrest warrant.leung did not appear at the conference.although no one knew for sure at that time whether leung was still alive,the district court granted the government request for an arrest warrant.
the marshals service expended a substantial amount of time and effort investigating the claim by leung purported brothers that leung had died in the attacks.at least two deputy marshals worked on the investigation for three to four hours each business day for over a month.working with the new york city police missing persons unit,the law department,and cantor fitzgerald insurance company,the deputy marshals interviewed family members,former employers,cantor fitzgerald employees,leung former landlords and neighbors,and others.they also obtained hundreds of documents from companies,including united airlines and the bellagio casino in las vegas,concerning leung travel.various teams of deputy marshals additionally conducted surveillance on eight different days.after eventually determining that leung was still alive,the marshals finally found and arrested leung in february.
in may,the government filed a second information charging leung with three additional counts count one charged him with committing passport fraud in violation of in connection with his september new york passport application.count two charged him with bail jumping for failing to appear as required on the hawaii passport charge in violation of,and count three charged him with obstruction of justice in violation of for attempting to fake his death.in june,leung pleaded guilty,without a plea agreement,to all four counts in the hawaii and new york informations.
the district court sentenced leung in november.it began by dividing the four counts into two groups.see.the first group contained the hawaii passport fraud count,the count,and the count.the second group contained only the new york passport fraud count.the court applied a enhancement to the first group for substantial interference with the administration of justice under section b,yielding an offense level of with respect to the second group,the court applied an obstruction enhancement under section,yielding an offense level of combining the groups,the court found that they constituted units because the offense levels for each group were levels apart and,accordingly,added level to the group with the highest offense level the hawaii passport group,resulting in a total offense level of.see id.b.it then reduced that level by but not points to,after finding that leung had accepted responsibility under section a.but it also granted the government request for an upward departure pursuant to sections and,increasing the offense level by,to.the resulting imprisonment range,with a criminal history category i,was months,and the court sentenced leung principally to months imprisonment on each count,to be served concurrently.leung appeals.
discussion 
leung lodges four challenges to the district court guidelines calculations.he contends that the court erroneously applied a enhancement for substantial interference with the administration of justice under section b failed to group together the hawaii obstruction and new york passport charges under section c failed to give an additional reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to section b and departed upwardly levels under sections and.we review legal interpretations of the sentencing guidelines de novo and factual findings supporting a district court offense calculation for clear error.e united states mcsherry,cir.
substantial interference with the administration of justice 
if an offense resulted in substantial interference with the administration of justice,then the offense level is enhanced levels.b.application note to section lists as an example of such substantial interference the unnecessary expenditure of substantial governmental or court resources.id,cmt.
in applying this enhancement,the district court largely based its findings on the additional expenditure of resources by the marshals involved in tracking down and arresting leung after he feigned his death and failed to appear in court.specifically,the court expressed its agreement with the government that the additional burden on the marshals was significant this is not the ordinary case,for lots of reasons,perhaps that the marshals service did make an extra effort to find leung,and i think that there was substantial interference with the administration of justice as a result of what leung did.tr.of,at.
in reviewing sentencing enhancements,we must give due deference to the district court application of the guidelines to the facts.e accord united states molina,cir.the factors underlying a sentence need only be proved by a preponderance of the evidence,and the district court findings of fact will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.united states desalvo,cir quoting united states jones,cir accord united states weissman,cir.
leung contends that the district court erred by applying the enhancement because the government did not show that,but for his conduct,the resources would not have been expended.he does not challenge the government description of the time and effort expended by the marshals,but claims that,since he had stopped faking his death by the time he failed to appear in court,and since he had violated his bail conditions and was separately charged with bail jumping,the efforts expended to arrest him were neither substantial nor unnecessary but simply the ordinary consequence of his jumping bail.leung also claims that the district court findings were too tentative and conditional with respect to the extent of the marshals efforts to support the enhancement.we disagree.
while there may have been some overlap between the expenditure of governmental resources due to leung obstruction and the expenditure of resources as a consequence of his,it is clear that,by faking his death,leung forced the government to expend substantial additional resources which otherwise would have been unnecessary.at the time of the december court conference,no one leung whether he was alive.to determine whether leung had,in fact,survived the september attacks,numerous marshals had to spend significant time consulting with the law department,the missing persons unit,and cantor fitzgerald as well as conducting interviews with family members,former employers,and others.assuming,as leung contends,that he stopped faking his death by the time he failed to appear in court,his contention overlooks the fact that the government had expended substantial time and resources in dealing with the consequences of his death since he took no steps to correct the misunderstanding he purposely created.we therefore find no error in the district court conclusion that leung actions caused the unnecessary expenditure of substantial government resources.
in addition,we find no fault with the specificity of the district court findings on this issue.the court expressly agree d with the government arguments set forth in its sentencing papers and at the sentencing hearing,which detailed the marshals efforts and it expressly stated its belief that the marshals service did make an extra effort to find leung as a result of leung faking his own death.tr.of,at emphasis added.these findings are sufficient to support the enhancement.
ii.grouping analysis 
under the sentencing guidelines,the offense level for a defendant convicted of multiple counts is calculated by grouping closely related offenses.specifically,a ll counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single group.id.a relevant example of counts involving substantially the same harm is a count that embodies conduct that is treated as an adjustment to the guideline applicable to a different count.id.c.the offense level applicable to such a group of offenses is equal to the level for the most serious offense within the group,including all adjustments thereto.id.a cmt.after the offense levels have been established for each group,they are consolidated into a single,combined offense level based on the relative severity of each group.see id.
here,as discussed earlier,the district court divided leung convictions into two groups the first consisting of the hawaii passport fraud,and obstruction counts,and the second containing solely the new york passport fraud count.the court arrived at an offense level of for the first group based on the obstruction count and,in calculating the offense level for the second group,applied a enhancement for obstruction to the new york passport fraud count based on the same behavior underlying the obstruction count in the first group.that calculation resulted in an offense level of for the second group,and because the offense levels for the two groups were levels apart,an additional level was added,resulting in a combined offense level of.
leung challenges this grouping analysis,contending that the district court erroneously failed to place all the counts into a single group.he contends that section c requires the obstruction count to be grouped with the new york passport count.the district court failure to do so,according to leung,resulted in impermissible double counting and in an improper increase in his combined offense level because the obstructive conduct was counted both to create the first group and then again to increase the offense level for the second group.we agree.
the district court enhancement of the new york passport count by two levels for obstruction of justice under section,while at the same time separately grouping an obstruction count predicated on the same underlying behavior,violated section c.that provision mandates the grouping of counts w hen one of the counts embodies conduct that is treated as a n other adjustment to the guideline applicable to another of the counts.id.c.as application note to section makes clear 
subsection c provides that when conduct that represents a separate count,bodily injury or obstruction of justice,is also a specific offense characteristic in or other adjustment to another count,the count represented by that conduct is to be grouped with the count to which it constitutes an aggravating factor.this provision prevents double counting of offense behavior.
id.c,cmt.this provision,as its commentary demonstrates,mandated the grouping of the obstruction count and the new york passport fraud count once the court enhanced the latter by levels based on the same obstructive behavior.
the government argues that passport offenses must always be separately grouped under subsection d of section,and it relies primarily on united states hersh,cir,and united states owolabi,cir,in arguing that the guidelines permit the enhancement of multiple groups for the same obstructive conduct,and that when imposing such an enhancement,otherwise separate groups need not be combined.
subsection d and the cases cited by the government,however,are inapposite.application note to section explains that s ubsections a d set forth circumstances in which counts are to be grouped together into a single group.counts are to be grouped together into a single group if any one or more of the subsections provide for such grouping.id.cmt.emphasis added.in other words,subsection d has no bearing on whether subsection c mandates grouping in this case.in addition,the cases cited by the government merely involve the tangential issue of applying section obstruction enhancement to separate counts and groups,but do not address the precise issue before application of section c where the obstructive behavior underlying one count is used to enhance a separately grouped count.see hersh,at,defendant did not challenge obstruction enhancement on appeal or raise issue of grouping under section c owolabi,at,obstructive behavior underlying section enhancement did not underlie any of the three counts involved.by contrast,where,as here,a count is predicated on conduct that is used to enhance a separately grouped count,and the two counts are not grouped together under section c,this court and others have found error.see,united states baez,cir finding error in district court failure to group counterfeiting and witness tampering counts under section c,where the court had enhanced the offense level for the counterfeiting count by levels under section for obstruction of justice based on the same conduct underlying the witness tampering count united states hankins,cir finding error in district court failure to group bank robbery and escape counts under section c,where court had enhanced bank robbery count by levels for obstruction of justice under section based on conduct underlying escape count for these reasons,we hold that the district court erred by failing to group the obstruction count with the new york passport count.
