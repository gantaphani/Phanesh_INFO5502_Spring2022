the defendant correct.
the court so what i going to do is i going to have a hearing at sentencing,and then i will have to decide whether you raped this woman or not,because i have to do the findings by a preponderance of the evidence pursuant to this plea agreement.
the defendant correct.
the court very well.i going to accept the plea agreement,subject to this hearing at sentence.
the court finds that your decision to plead guilty has been knowingly,intelligent sic,voluntarily and solemnly made,and that you have had the advice and counsel of a competent and experienced attorney with whom you say orally and in writing you satisfied with the way he has been representing you.
