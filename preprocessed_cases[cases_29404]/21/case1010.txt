ignacio appeals from his convictions for participating in a cocaine conspiracy.to resolve this appeal,we must consider whether,in the circumstances of this case,the district court lacked the authority to reject guilty plea and whether admissions that he made in a letter of confession written pursuant to his plea agreement were properly admitted against him at trial.on this second issue,we vacate the convictions and remand for a new trial.
background 
on december,a grand jury returned a indictment against numerous defendants describing an alleged cocaine smuggling and distribution conspiracy operating out of puerto rico.the indictment charged with two counts,participating in a conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine,see,and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine,see a.the government included in the indictment a compilation of overt acts which evidenced the existence of the conspiracy.concerning,the indictment alleged that on april,at the behest of other conspiracy members,he traveled to an airport in thomas,virgin islands with and a travel ticket to deliver to juan carlos pion,one of the leaders of the conspiracy.however,due to operational difficulties,he was unable to make the delivery.
on the morning of february,the day his trial was scheduled to begin,reached a plea bargain with the government.under the agreement,agreed to plead guilty to the first count of the indictment.the government in turn agreed that it would move to dismiss the second count.the government also agreed that it would provide the court with a sentencing recommendation of months of incarceration if qualified for a reduction under the.see f 
as an addendum to the agreement,admitted certain facts demonstrating his involvement in the conspiracy.the addendum contained the same facts that were alleged in the indictment.on the same afternoon that accepted the plea bargain,he appeared before the district court for a change of plea hearing.at that hearing,the court conducted the colloquy mandated by.the court reviewed the terms of the plea agreement with.it stressed to him that the agreement did not bind the court to impose the sentence recommended by the government.it then proceeded to describe the rights that would relinquish by accepting the plea bargain and to question him to assure that his waiver of these rights was knowing and voluntary.following this discussion,the court summarized the facts in the addendum,and the government described the facts that it would have proved if there had been a trial.acknowledged that these facts accurately summarized his involvement in the conspiracy.at that point,the court ruled that a basis in fact for the plea exists,and therefore,a judgment of guilty shall be entered as to count one.the court then concluded the hearing by requesting the preparation of a presentence report and by scheduling a sentencing hearing.the sentencing hearing was scheduled for june.
a few weeks after the change of plea hearing,beginning on february,met for several debriefings with special agents jose roman and aramis quinones of the drug enforcement agency the dea the purpose of the debriefings was for to provide the government with the information that he possessed about the conspiracy so that he could qualify for the reduction.
at the sentencing hearing,on june,the government opposed eligibility for the reduction because,in its estimation,had not been truthful in the debriefings.based on the government representation,the district court decided that it could not pronounce sentence until it determined if,in fact,was eligible for the reduction 
on february,the district court convened an evidentiary hearing to consider eligibility.maintained the burden of proving that he had been completely forthcoming.see united states marquez,cir.to meet this burden,he introduced the dea agents report memorializing the debriefing conversations.the government responded by introducing the testimony of agent roman.agent roman testified that told him that when he brought the to pion,he did have any knowledge they sic were involved in drug trafficking.agent roman also testified that told him that he has never been involved in drug trafficking,what he did on april,was a favor for a friend,and that he was unaware that pion was involved in drug smuggling until the date of his arrest.
the government also offered the testimony of dea agent hector colon,another agent involved in the investigation of the conspiracy.agent colon testified that he had interviewed pion as part of his investigation,and that pion had stated that was extensively involved in the conspiracy.pion also stated that had provided the vessels used for the drug smuggling.during the examination of agent colon,the government asked whether there was evidence showing that was a drug smuggler just like pion.the defense counsel immediately objected to the question,stating the evidence is that he is not.the district court understood the defense counsel objection to be an assertion that was not involved in drug smuggling.combining this understanding with agent roman earlier testimony that had claimed not to know that he was involved in a drug conspiracy,the court determined that there was no longer a factual basis for accepting guilty plea.the court,by its own motion,withdrew the plea of guilty entered by the defendant because it could not allow him to retain a plea of guilty when he did know that what was going on were drugs.
after rejecting the plea,the district court reinstated the indictment against and set a trial date.the evidence introduced at trial showed that was an active participant in the drug conspiracy headed by pion.role was to organize the maritime transport of the drugs from colombia to croix,thomas or maarten for storage.once the drugs were stored on of one these islands,coordinated with pion to transport the drugs to puerto rico.the government relied primarily on testimony from miguel couvertier,a paid informant,and ruben gomez,one of,who testified pursuant to a cooperation provision in his plea agreement.in addition to this testimony,the government called alma martinez,probation officer.through this witness,the government introduced a letter which had written implicating himself in the conspiracy.the jury convicted on both counts.the district court subsequently sentenced to life in prison,and he timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
we address two primary issues.first,we consider whether the district court maintained authority under the rules of criminal procedure to reject guilty plea after having accepted it over a year earlier.second,we consider whether the district court erred by admitting at trial the letter that wrote to his probation officer confessing his involvement in the conspiracy.
authority to reject guilty plea 
claims that the district court acted without authority in rejecting his guilty plea after having previously accepted it.specifically,he claims that.did not provide the district court with the power to reject his plea 
it is well settled that a defendant does not have an absolute right to plead guilty.santobello new york,d.the supreme court has stressed that the plea phase of the process of criminal justice,and the adjudicative element inherent in accepting a plea of guilty,must be attended by safeguards to insure the defendant what is reasonably due in the circumstances.id.rule provides a defendant with these essential safeguards.
before accepting a guilty plea,the district court must address the defendant personally to assure that he understands,inter alia,the charge against him,the possible punishment,that he has a right to an attorney,that he has the right to plead not guilty,that he has a right to a jury trial,and that if he pleads guilty,he waives the right to a trial.c.in addition,the district court must determine that the defendant plea is voluntary and not the result of force,threats,or promises.d.
under rule,the district court must also determine whether there is a factual basis for the defendant guilty plea.f.the purpose of this requirement is to protect a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge.advisory committee notes to the amendment to fed.crim.rule f provides that 
notwithstanding the acceptance of the plea of guilty,the court should not enter a judgment upon such a plea without making such inquiry as shall satisfy it there is a factual basis for the plea 
this rule provides the district court with continuing authority.as the plain language suggests,the district court obligations under rule f continue until it has entered judgment.united states smith,cir.thus,the rule permits the court to retrospectively reject the plea,after originally accepting it.moore federal practice,b ed see charles alan wright,federal practice procedure criminal,at ed.if a plea has been accepted and the court should later decide that it is not satisfied that there was a factual basis for the plea,it should vacate the plea and then enter a plea of not guilty on behalf of the defendant.see also smith,at noting that if the court decides that there was no factual basis for a guilty plea after accepting it,the court should vacate the plea and enter a plea of not guilty on behalf of the defendant.in this regard,the advisory committee notes to the amendment to rule state that the normal consequences of a determination that there is not a factual basis for the plea would be for the court to set aside the plea and enter a plea of not guilty.
as the rule makes clear,however,the district court authority to reject a plea under rule f is finite it terminates when the court enters judgment.rule d states,a judgment of conviction must set forth the plea the verdict or findings the adjudication and the sentence.emphasis supplied thus,in a criminal matter,a court must impose sentence before a judgment of conviction can issue.mitchell united states,d.accordingly,the factual predicate for the guilty plea must exist not only at the time that the court initially accepts the plea,but also when it imposes sentence.see united states bennett,cir see also howard united states,cir any finding of an adequate factual basis at the initial plea hearing is necessarily preliminary,cert.denied,d.
here,the district court initially accepted guilty plea after determining that there was a factual basis for his plea at the change of plea hearing on february.however,at the hearing on february,the court heard evidence that subsequent to the change of plea hearing claimed that he did not know that he was part of a drug conspiracy at the time that he committed the acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.because a defendant must know that his conduct was part of a drug conspiracy in order to be guilty under,see united states,cir,cert.denied,d,the court concluded that it could not accept guilty plea.since the district court rejected the guilty plea prior to entering judgment,the court acted within its authority under rule f 
relies on several cases in which this circuit and others have held that a district court exceeds its authority under rule by rejecting a guilty plea subsequent to having accepted it.see united states cruz,cir accord united states ritsema,cir united states skidmore,cir united states,cir united states blackwell.but in each case,the district court vacated the defendant guilty plea for a reason other than that the plea lacked a factual foundation.see ritsema,at reversing district court vacatur of plea because it thought mandated sentence in plea agreement was too lenient skidmore,at reversing district court modification of plea agreement to excuse defendants from asset forfeiture provision because court deemed provision unfair,at reversing district court vacatur of plea because plea agreement contained clerical error cruz,at reversing district court vacatur of plea because mandated sentence in plea agreement was inconsistent with sentences received by blackwell,at reversing district court vacatur of plea after defendant ignored admonishment that if she testified in favor of it would vacate plea.because none of these cases involved a court rejecting a plea because it lacked a factual predicate,the court authority to reject a plea under rule f was not implicated.
the ninth circuit explained the scope of the district court rule f authority in,at.there,the court noted that a district court generally may not accept a guilty plea and then subsequently reject it.id.however,it observed that rule f provides an exception to this general rule rule f implies that acceptance of a guilty plea does not foreclose a subsequent rejection of the plea if factual questions emerge,for instance at sentencing.id.that is exactly the circumstance here.during the sentencing process,the district court heard evidence that convinced it that there was no longer a factual basis to support guilty plea.it therefore rejected the guilty plea and entered a plea of not guilty in accord with rule f.see smith,at 
admission of confession 
second claim is that the district court erred by admitting into evidence,at his subsequent trial,the letter confessing guilt which he wrote to his probation officer as part of the process initiated after the court had accepted his guilty plea.he claims that the court decision to admit the letter violated principles of basic fairness guaranteed by due process because he tendered this confession under a belief that he was not protected by the privilege against.
plea agreement provided that he could receive a reduction in his sentence for acceptance of responsibility,see.to receive such a reduction,the agreement required to accept full responsibility for the offense committed.it also provided that he could receive an additional reduction under the provision,see,if he provided truthful and complete information and evidence to the united states about his crime and related events.at the change of plea hearing,the district court explained to these sentencing provisions and that by pleading guilty he was waiving his privilege against.
faced with the requirement that he provide incriminating information to receive a shorter sentence and a belief that he was no longer protected against,authored a letter of confession on may,to his probation officer the letter stated 
the first thing i want to tell you is that i accept full responsibility for what i have done in this case.during the early evening of april,i delivered some electronic equipment,a plane ticket,and to a man in the airport in the thomas,vi.this man was working for juan carlos pion and was going to travel to maarten.after this delivery,i received a call to pick up these items,since the trip to maarten had been canceled.this electronic equipment was eventually seized during arrests that were made in july of for cocaine trafficking.
i do not blame anyone but myself for my activity in this case.i was wrong and i suffer every day for the mistakes that i have made in this case what i did in this case goes against everything i believe in.i promise that i will never violate the law again.i am very,very sorry for what i have done.i look forward to the time when this problem is behind me,but the pain in my heart for what i have done will never leave me.
the district court vacated guilty plea several months after he wrote this letter.
moved to exclude the letter from his trial,but the district court denied his motion and admitted it over his objection.the court admitted the letter because it concluded that the rules of evidence only prohibited the introduction of statements made by a defendant as part of the plea negotiation process.see.in the court view,the fact that confessed after the plea negotiations had concluded rendered the letter admissible.
the admission of confession in these circumstances was erroneous.in similar circumstances,the ninth circuit reversed a conviction because it deemed that admitting the defendant confession was fundamentally unfair.see united states escamilla,cir.in escamilla,the defendant made incriminating statements as required by his plea agreement.id.at.the plea agreement also required the defendant to take a polygraph test.id.when the defendant failed the polygraph,the government withdrew from the agreement but used the defenda
