defendants michael romano and william kearney appeal from judgments of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york entered by sterling johnson,judge,following a jury trial before joseph bianco,judge,convicting defendants of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud in connection with the sale of coins,in violation of,and conspiracy to engage in money laundering,in violation of.a a i and h.romano was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release kearney was sentenced principally to months imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release defendants were ordered,jointly and severally,to pay restitution in the amount of and to forfeit.on appeal,defendants challenge their convictions principally on the grounds that the court failed to perform the necessary gatekeeping function before admitting the testimony of expert witnesses as to the grading and valuation of coins and that admission of one of the government exhibits violated their rights under the confrontation clause.kearney also argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that he knowingly and willingly participated in a conspiracy.defendants challenge their sentences as procedurally and substantively unreasonable and contend that the district court erred in failing to conduct de novo review of the magistrate judge recommendations for restitution and forfeiture.the government concedes that there should be a remand for consideration of defendants objections to the magistrate judge recommendations and the extent to which a certain property is forfeitable.
for the reasons that follow,we remand for de novo review of the magistrate judge recommendations for restitution and forfeiture,including forfeitability of the property in question in all other respects we affirm.
background 
the present prosecution focused on the operations of a succession of three companies owned by romano wall street rare coins or wsrc,which operated from approximately december until october,atlantic coin galleries acg,which operated from approximately october until august,and northeast gold and silver negs,which operated from approximately september until november collectively,the romano companies.kearney was a salesman and sales manager at all three companies and was also a percent owner of negs.romano and kearney were alleged principally to have engaged,through the romano companies,in a fraudulent scheme for sales of coins by telephone,making and causing the making of false representations to customers as to the grade and value of the coins they sold,the general profitability of coin sets,and the assistance the romano companies would provide to customers who later wished to sell coins bought from the romano companies.
a.the government evidence at trial 
the government evidence at trial consisted principally of testimony from several of the romano companies former salesmen salesmen,former suppliers suppliers,and customers government investigators and three expert witnesses who testified about the grading and valuation of coins.
general industry practice and procedures 
the government first expert witness,scott schechter,whose testimony is not challenged on these appeals,provided general information with respect to the rare coin market.schechter was a vice president of numismatic guarantee corporation ngc,an independent or coin grading service,an entity not in the business of buying or selling coins.he testified that ngc and its competitor professional coin grading service pcgs each have about to percent of the market.see trial transcript tr.he described general industry practices,and ngc procedures,in the grading and certification of rare coins as follows.
coins are generally graded on a point scale,though not all numbers are used,called the sheldon scale.the sheldon scale has been in fairly common use since the middle of the century.at ngc,each coin is graded seriatim by three experts who ultimately arrive at a consensus on the coin grade.in evaluating some coins,two graders can reasonably differ in their opinions as to grade at ngc a third grader examines all coins.the graders consider four attributes the coin luster,the sheen or vibrancy of its surface its strike quality,how well the coin has been struck between the two dies that give the coin its details the existence and number of contact marks,surface wear and its eye appeal,how attractive the coin is.eye appeal is the most subjective of these factors.
at the high end of the sheldon scale are mint state ms coins that can be assigned a number from through they are considered uncirculated because they show no evidence of metal loss from having been circulated.the next lower range is for coins near uncirculated condition they are called about uncirculated au coins and can be graded,or.in addition,a can be added to a coin grade to indicate that the coin is in the top percent of the pieces within that grade.small differences in a coin grade can result in substantial differences in the coin market value.
some collectors accumulate complete sets of coins that are of interest to them that is the most common way to collect coins.however,a set has no greater monetary value than the total values of its individual coins.
certified coins are coins that have been graded by a grading service such as ngc or pcgs.after grading a coin,the grading service normally places it in a protective capsule,or slab,that is then sealed and difficult to open without a tool.an unslabbed,or raw,coin is one that is not certified by a grading service.ngc gives a guarantee for any coin it has certified for so long as the coin remains in its slab,meaning that if a coin fails to trade in the marketplace for as much as the price associated with the grade given it by ngc,ngc either will buy the coin from the owner at the price associated with the certified grade or will regrade the coin,return it to the owner,and pay the owner the difference in value.ngc grading is relied on in transactions between and among dealers and collectors indeed,some buyers purchase coins sight unseen based solely on the grades given by ngc.pcgs gives similar guarantees.
testimony by romano companies suppliers or salesmen 
suppliers to the romano companies testified that before purchasing coins from them,romano examined the coins only briefly,if at all.see tr.for example,one supplier,who over the years sold some of coins to romano,testified that romano typically,without gloves or magnifier or other aid,would look at and purchase some coins in minutes.see id.at.romano would sometimes remove certified coins from their slabs and hand the coins to his secretary.when romano had asked the supplier for rolls of coins,the supplier brought rolls and romano bought them without looking at the coins the grades of the coins were not discussed.see,id.at.
romano periodically created a coin inventory for the use of his salesmen,and during that process he assigned grades to the coins he had purchased.former employees testified that when romano took inventory he would call a particular salesman,usually robert lepolszki,to learn the current prices for a given coin at different grades.lepolszki testified that once a week or twice a month,romano would call,tell him to grab his book and turn to a particular page,and would ask,what is the mint state grade condition,what is a grade condition.i would give him the prices tr.lepolszki would then hear romano telling the secretary to put it down mint state,or whatever the amount was id.at,but it was always at t he high end id.at.when romano had all the prices,an inventory sheet would be printed and distributed to all the salesmen.all of the coins romano and lepolszki discussed would be on the inventory sheet and they had been graded at the higher end of the prices lepolszki had relayed.see id.at see also id.at romano told one of the salesmen he marked up the coins to the max.
a former secretary testified that in five years of working for romano,she never saw him examine coins,either while he was taking inventory or at any other time.see id.at.romano salesmen used to joke about mike grading practice tr.see,id.at id.at it was a running joke,and even joke about customers,how gullible they we re id.at.
romano tended to assign particular grades for certain types of coins these included benjamin franklin half dollars,of which the romano companies sold many rolls.all or nearly all of the rolls of franklin half dollars sold by the romano companies were graded by romano as ms.however,suppliers testified that they never sold entire rolls of franklin half dollars to romano at grade or above,because such rolls are simply not available in the marketplace.see,id.at you wo buy a complete.the problem is it does exist.id.at they just do come that way.id.at generally on most of the dates they do exist on those grades.suppliers testified that the franklin half dollars they sold romano in rolls were typically graded lower,ms to see id.at,or ms to ms see tr,or ms to see id.at,or ms to see id.at.schechter testified that the proper grade for a roll of coins is the grade of the lowest included coin.see tr.
in addition,one supplier testified that romano evinced a preference for gold pieces in the au to ms grade range.the supplier testified that au coins are called sliders because they could be graded as ms or or,because to one untrained eye those coins may look uncirculated tr.generally,the market prices for gold pieces graded ms or ms were much higher than the prices for those in the au to ms range.customers submitted for analysis in this case gold pieces they had bought from the romano companies each of the for which the romano companies grading could be determined was sold as ms grade or higher.
romano and kearney closely supervised the companies sales force,and kearney,using an alias as did all of the salesmen also made sales calls himself.both men worked mostly from desks on the small sales floor see tr,one salesman testified that kearney was on the sales floor p robably percent of the time id.at.kearney,as the sales manager,trained the salesmen and provided them with sales pitches.see,id.at.he also directed salesmen to submit their own handwritten pitches for his approval he returned typed versions of the pitches he approved and gave feedback on those he did not.according to deposition testimony from romano that was read into the trial record,everything the salesmen said ha d to be sanctioned by management,and w e monitor ed them to ensure compliance.id.at.salesmen also testified that romano and kearney regularly listened in to sales calls and critiqued them,sometimes feeding them lines during calls or even taking over calls and pitching to customers directly.
the sales pitches contained numerous false representations,with salesmen stating that they were offering bargains,coins priced below the normal retail price for coins of the same type and grade,when in fact the quality of the offered coins was simply lower than represented.the salesmen represented that they could offer such bargains because the company was operating as a wholesaler,which it was not see id.at,or because they were liquidating another dealer inventory,which they were not see id.at or because they had just returned from a coin show,though the salesmen never actually attended coin shows see id.at.salesmen were also instructed by kearney to tell customers that by collecting a complete set of certain coins,they could reap a set premium,that t he set is worth more than the sum of its parts id.at anywhere from five to percent above the total value of the coins individually see id.at.salesmen testified that they used to joke about this pitch and knew it was false because the romano companies had in inventory entire sets listed at prices below the aggregate prices of the individual coins in the set.see,id.at.nonetheless,the salesmen,and kearney himself,used the set premium pitch to persuade customers to buy coins toward completion of sets and multiple customers testified that they heard and relied on it.
salesmen also used to joke about the fact that as far as the romano companies were concerned,t here really was no complete set tr.they were instructed by romano and kearney to keep changing the parameters for what would constitute a set it depend ed on what the customer bought originally,but it would always change y ou could make up whatever you wanted as a set.and you would never let them complete the set,so the customer would always have to buy more.see id.at.the salesmen would sing a little ditty that went,this is the set that never ends,yes,it goes on and on my friends,and romano and kearney would laugh or join in.see id.at.
kearney also instructed salesmen to tell customers that the romano companies employed three graders see tr,that the coins were graded in accordance with the highest standards of the american numismatic association ana see id.at,and that their grading process was similar to those used by ngc and pcgs see id.at.kearney himself,and all of the salesmen,made such representations in sales calls.see,id.at.customers testified that they relied on these representations about the grading process.but in fact the only grader was romano,and he did not examine the coins.
several salesmen testified that they not only knew that their descriptions of the companies grading process were false,but also knew that the grades themselves were inflated.one testified that he repeatedly overheard romano ordering uncirculated franklin half dollars with no specification as to their grade nonetheless,the romano companies represented nearly all of the franklin half dollars they sold to be ms.that salesman also sold morgan silver dollars that the romano companies graded ms he did not believe that grading was accurate,given the high volume and large profit margins on these coins,as well as the constant customer complaints about quality.tr.on one occasion when he failed to sell a coin that romano had graded ms,because the customer wanted a coin graded ms,romano instructed him to call back and sell that coin by simply telling the customer he had an ms.see tr.
in addition,although romano and kearney required their salesmen to sign a form promising that they would not hype the coins as an investment,and did not allow them to use that specific word see,tr,the salesmen viewed the form as a big joke id.at that had no real effect on their sales pitches,even when romano and kearney were listening in see id.at,see also id.at.indeed,sales pitches distributed by kearney instructed salesmen to tell customers that buying franklin half dollars from the romano companies was a ca miss situation id.at and to say,if these coins do half as well as they done in the past,believe me,you going to wish you have of them id.at.thus,despite knowing that the romano companies falsely inflated the coins value,kearney and the other salesmen regularly told customers that owning the coins would be profitable.
kearney and the salesmen also told customers that if the customers decided to sell the coins in the future,the romano companies would buy the coins back or help customers with resale several customers testified they relied on this representation.see tr.however,kearney trained the salesmen on how to push customers off until a later time when they wanted to sell,and one salesman testified that he overheard kearney telling customers who made such requests that it was a good time right now and we should wait.id.at.thus,one customer testified that when she contacted a salesman about selling some coins,the salesman became evasive,told her i t was not a good time to sell,and said he would get back to her,which he never did.id.at.and when another customer tried to contact acg to try to get them to buy the coins back,he discovered that acg had closed shop and disappeared.id.at.
salesmen and secretaries testified that they forwarded customer complaints to romano and kearney,including complaints that coins were overgraded and not worth what the customers had paid.see,e,tr.one customer,williams,testified that she complained to kearney that he had misrepresented the value of the coins he had sold her,and that kearney responded by saying that grading companies were not necessarily reliable and reiterating that the romano companies had three graders.williams testified that kearney who used the alias ed thompson had sold her a walking liberty half dollar proof coin as an ms but when she had it appraised by ngc,ngc graded it a proof.so instead of being worth almost,it was worth.id.at.williams also testified that kearney consistently steered her away from buying certified coins when she requested them.
romano and kearney made extensive efforts to conceal their business practices from potential law enforcement agents and from customers.one salesman testified that kearney repeatedly worried aloud about the possibility of undercover police officers infiltrating the sales staff see tr,as did romano,and that in fact there was a general concern in the office about that id.at.romano twice renamed his company and relocated it within the same geographic area,for no apparent reason other than to conceal its business practices.the entity,its personnel,and its practices remained the same.romano and kearney instructed salesmen and secretaries to shred invoices or letterheads bearing the name of the prior company and to deny any affiliation with it unless they thought the affiliation would help make a sale.see,tr.
in addition,one supplier testified that romano asked him to change items listed on some invoices to reflect coins different from the ones romano had actually purchased.see tr.and kearney instructed the secretaries not to put any coin grades on invoices for particularly expensive orders see id.at he argued to romano that the company should not put grades on invoices see id.at,and came up with the idea to stamp some orders as nonreturnable special orders id.at,which the companies used for customers who were considered problematic or who had returned coins in the past id.at.
william hessle,who as a postal inspector had participated in the investigation into the romano companies,testified that bank records showed that,between and,the companies sold coins to approximately customers and generated revenue of some million.of that sum,romano personally received approximately million,and kearney personally received approximately million.
expert testimony as to romano grading 
the government introduced the testimony of two numismatic experts,richard montgomery and anthony swiatek,who respectively testified with regard to,inter alia,the grading and the valuation of coins sold by the romano companies.defendants had moved for an in limine ruling under.precluding such testimony and precluding evidence as to the sheldon scale,arguing that the grading of coins is inherently subjective and thus an inappropriate subject for expert testimony.that motion was denied.see part.below.
richard montgomery was president of ngc and had been president of pcgs.he had been trained as a coin grader and authenticator in the early he was employed as a grader by pcgs from to and by ngc from to.as a grader,he graded at least coins a day he estimated that he had personally graded several million coins.montgomery also taught seminars on coin grading,and he continued to grade coins while serving as the president of each organization.he described the industry grading scale and the grading practices and procedures at ngc in the same way schechter had.
in connection with the present case,ngc had examined numerous coins sold by the romano companies the government introduced a spreadsheet,government exhibit gx,which listed a total of such coins.among the coins examined by ngc were coin rolls of franklin half dollars.as indicated in part.above,nearly all of the franklin half dollars that the romano companies sold were represented to be ms or above.however,montgomery testified that not one of the romano companies rolls was graded by ngc as high as ms.indeed,ngc graded all but one roll below.in addition to the rolls of franklin half dollars,ngc had examined several hundred other individual coins sold by the romano companies.with respect to such coins,only were graded the same by both romano and ngc.and only of the were graded higher by ngc than by romano were graded lower by ngc than by romano.montgomery cited examples of coins that the romano companies sold as coins,but which ngc graded in the about uncirculated range,including one gold coin that the romano companies sold as an ms,which ngc graded au,and one walking liberty half dollar sold by the romano companies as an ms,that ngc graded au.
montgomery acknowledged that coin grading is an art rather than a science and that it is a subjective measure but stated that it is built around a core set of principles.tr.at.he testified that attributes such as luster and strike quality,though difficult to articulate,can be illustrated through visual examples id.at,and that ngc maintains coin samples of various grades that can be consulted for reference.montgomery testified that grading discrepancies of one or two points could occur occasionally but that three or discrepancies would be quite unusual.see id.at.
anthony swiatek testified that he was a professional numismatist who had studied with leading numismatists to learn the trade and had been engaged in buying and selling coins full time since.he had written books about coins,lectured at major coin shows,written for the industry magazine coin world,and contributed to price guides or coin valuation books he was a member of the professional numismatist guild an organization of coin dealers and a coin grading consultant for ngc,pcgs,and the ana grading service.he was a former president of the ana and member of its board of governors in the latter capacity he had served on a committee that handled frauds and coin improprieties.he had graded and valued at least a million coins.
swiatek testified that in order to determine the value of a graded coin,he typically consults at least one of two periodicals.one is a weekly publication called the coin dealer newsletter and known as the greysheet,which lists bid and ask prices for various types of coins at various grades.the other is the certified coin dealer newsletter,known as the bluesheet,which lists bid and ask prices for coins certified by ngc or pcgs.
swiatek gave his opinions as to the proper valuations of approximately coins sold by the romano companies.in determining such valuations,he did not examine the actual coins but relied on the grades given to them by ngc.to determine the market value of the coins,swiatek relied in part on the bid and ask prices listed in the greysheet bluesheet as of the time the romano companies sold each coin where the difference between ngc grade and romano grade was particularly substantial,swiatek used the bid price.swiatek testified that he generally relied on the greysheet rather than the bluesheet except in instances where he knew that,at the time of the romano companies sale,buyers and sellers in the industry were using the bluesheet to determine prices for that type of coin.swiatek also relied in part on auction prices,especially for coins that were particularly rare,and on his own experiences as a dealer.using these sources,swiatek determined a the market prices for the coins using the grades assigned by romano and b the market prices for those coins as graded by ngc swiatek compared those market prices against the prices at which the romano companies actually sold the coins.his resulting spreadsheet showed that those coins,sold by the romano companies for a total of,were,as graded by ngc,worth a total of,approximately percent of their aggregate sales price.thus,with respect to those coins,the romano companies had overcharged their customers by.
for example,the romano companies had sold a gold coin that romano graded an ms for.although the market price for a coin of that type and grade was according to the greysheet or auction records,the coin sold by the romano companies was graded only an au by ngc.at the latter grade,the coin value was.another coin sold by the romano companies for as an ms would,at that grade,have had a market price of according to swiatek analysis but it was graded an au by ngc and as such was worth just.yet another coin sold by the romano companies as an ms for would,at that grade,have had a market price of it was graded ms by ngc and as such was worth.
swiatek conceded that he had made errors in entering some of the numbers on his spreadsheet,but he stated that he had thoroughly checked the numbers for the rarer coins and that his methodology was sound.swiatek stated that of the coins he had considered,he had made errors as to,all of which were franklin half dollars and having overvalued some of those coins and undervalued others,the cumulative effect of his errors was that the amount by which his spreadsheet showed the romano companies had overcharged their customers was overstated by just.
b.the defense case 
defendants presented the testimony of an investigator,josh leicht,who was not a coin expert or collector or buyer or seller.see,tr.based on the spreadsheets introduced at trial by the government,leicht had performed a comparative analysis of the grades assigned by romano and those assigned by ngc.according to his analysis,ngc had graded of coins determining that the remainder could not be graded.leicht testified that the spreadsheets showed disagreements between the first and second ngc grader as to coins,including involving a discrepancy of two or more points as to whether a coin fell in the ms or au range.
as to some of the coins graded by ngc,romano grade was unknown there were thus approximately coins for which ngc grade and romano grade could be compared.leicht testified that as to coins,romano had given a grade one point higher than ngc and coins had been graded by romano two points higher than ngc.leicht testified that romano had given the same grade as ngc to coins however,leicht had rated grades of by romano as equal to grades of by ngc,because defense counsel had instructed him to disregard pluses.leicht also testified that romano grade was lower than ngc grade on coins.however,as to of those coins depicting the liberty bell,with lines along the bottom of the bell,leicht had found ngc grade higher than romano only because it bore the notation fbl,knowing that that stood for full bell line s tr,but not being aware that an fbl notation is merely descriptive of the continuity of lines on the coin and did not enhance the grade given to it see id.at.leicht calculations apparently left coins that romano had graded three or more points higher than ngc had.
c.the verdicts and the motions for a new trial 
the jury found romano and kearney guilty on each of the counts against them,conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud in the sale of coins,and conspiracy to engage in money laundering through financial transactions involving the proceeds of their mail and wire fraud conspiracy.defendants moved pursuant to,inter alia.for a new trial on the ground that the testimony of swiatek did not meet the.standard for the admission of expert testimony.the motions were denied,see united states romano,d,and after a fatico hearing,defendants were sentenced as indicated above.
ii.challenges to the convictions 
on appeal,defendants contend principally that they are entitled to a new trial on the ground that the district court should have excluded the testimonies of montgomery and swiatek pursuant to rule as unsuitable for expert testimony,and should have excluded gx on confrontation clause grounds.romano also contends that he was denied due process because he received no notice that the lawfulness of his conduct depended on whether his grades were similar to those assigned by ngc romano brief on appeal at and kearney contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that he knowingly and willingly participated in a conspiracy.for the reasons that follow,we find no merit in defendants challenges to their convictions.
admission of the testimony of montgomery and swiatek 
prior to trial,defendants moved for an in limine ruling precluding the government from calling montgomery,swiatek,and schechter as witnesses and from giving expert testimony as to the grading and valuation of coins and the sheldon scale.defendants contended that the coin grading and valuation processes are subjective and unreliable and that the proposed testimony was inadmissible under rules and of the federal rules of evidence.on appeal,they seek a new trial,arguing that the district court wrongly denied the rule motion as to montgomery and swiatek and that their testimony was based on insufficiently reliable methods that were unreliably applied to the facts of this case.we disagree.
rule,as it read during the pretrial and trial proceedings in this case,provided that 
i f scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education,may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.
the fact that the subject matter is not scientific is no bar to admissibility of expert testimony.united states kayne,cir,cert.denied.rule itself refers to other specialized knowledge,and there are many different kinds of experts,and many different kinds of expertise and in some cases,the relevant reliability concerns may focus upon personal knowledge or experience,kumho tire carmichael.
rule imposes on the trial judge an obligation to determine whether the expert specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact,will be not only relevant,but reliable.see,id.at,daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals.daubert,which dealt with a scientific theory,stated that factors the district court could consider included the theory testability,the extent to which it has been subjected to peer review and publication,the extent to which a technique is subject to standards controlling the technique operation,the known or potential rate of error,and the degree of acceptance within the relevant scientific community.at internal quotation marks omitted.but the rule inquiry i s a flexible one,and daubert makes clear that the factors it mentions do not constitute a definitive checklist or test.kumho,at quoting daubert,at,emphasis in kumho.and daubert adds that the gatekeeping inquiry must be tied to the facts of a particular case.kumho,at quoting daubert,at.
a court of appeals is to apply an standard when it review s a trial court decision to admit or exclude expert testimony.kumho,at quoting general electric joiner.that standard applies as much to the trial court decisions about how to determine reliability as to its ultimate conclusion.kumho,at.w hether daubert specific factors are,or are not,reasonable measures of reliability in a particular case is a matter that the law grants the trial judge broad latitude to determine.kumho,at see,e,general electric joiner,at.
in the present case the district court held a hearing on defendants in limine motions daubert hearing and heard testimony from montgomery and swiatek.their testimony at that hearing as to,inter alia,their credentials in the rare coin industry,the industry use of the sheldon coin grading scale,ngc process for grading coins,and swiatek process in valuing the coins sold by the romano companies,was essentially the same as their trial testimony,described in part.above.see,hearing transcript,april,daubert hr g,at.
in montgomery at the daubert hearing,defendants brought out,inter alia,that ngc website stated that discrepancies in grading of one to two points in coins at ms and higher are not uncommon.montgomery responded that he viewed discrepancies as scarce,occurring only occasionally.daubert hr g.he testified that a difference between graders with respect to a particular coin is quite extreme,t hree points is also extreme,a difference happens once in a blue moon,and differences are not improbable at all,which is why services use consensus grading.id.at.
defendants pointed to descriptions by ana and pcgs that differed as to the characteristics of an ms grade coin.montgomery responded that although the ana and pcgs descriptions were not identical they were not inconsistent.see id.at.defendants also pointed out that an article published by coin world in reported disparities in the grades assigned by different grading services to coins the magazine had submitted for grading.montgomery responded that coin grading has become increasingly more refined since,and that even the author of that article viewed a sample of coins as too small to be meaningful.see id.at.
in swiatek,defendants brought out,inter alia,that he was generally unaware of romano business practices and did not know whether the romano companies sold coins wholesale or retail,and that he did not use full retail prices in estimating the value of the coins romano sold.see daubert hr g.defendants also sought to bring out that the methods used by swiatek,which included his reliance on his own personal experiences,could not be scientifically replicated.
after hearing the testimony and receiving briefing,the district court denied defendants motion to preclude the testimony of montgomery,swiatek,and schechter,stating principally as follows 
i find it certainly relevant under the rules of evidence.and i have conducted a balancing,as romano trial counsel urged the court to do.
and,in addition,i find,in terms of the daubert challenge,that the government has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the facts and data and the principles and methods relied upon by both montgomery and swiatek were sufficient under daubert to allow the testimony to be admitted.
the issue that romano counsel has raised both in the hearing and in his submissions,these disparities as to grading,go to the weight of the evidence and not to its admissibility.
and given the evidence that i heard at the hearing with respect to the opinion of swiatek,again,the failure to assign a range of values,the use of the blue sheet versus the gray sheet,wholesale versus retail,i believe all of those issues go to the weight to be given his testimony,not to its admissibility.
a ll the issues that have been raised can be the proper subject of,but i think to just submit gray sheets and blue sheets to a jury as business records would not be sufficient to have them understand how the industry works and how the grading plays into the ultimate evaluation of the coins within the industry.so i going to allow them to testify.
hearing transcript,may,ruling,at emphases added.
in its posttrial ruling denying defendants motion for a new trial based on the admission of the swiatek testimony,the district court adhered to the views stated in the ruling.the court stated that despite the undisputed fact that both grading and valuation have a subjective component,both montgomery and swiatek at the daubert hearing had demonstrated that the system for coin grading and valuation rests on industry standards,publications and market trends,which are sufficiently reliable to form the basis of expert testimony.f.supp d at.
having noted that a new trial may be granted pursuant to.if the interest of justice so requires,see d at,and that t he ultimate test on a rule motion is whether letting a guilty verdict stand would be a manifest injustice,id.at quoting united states ferguson,cir,the court found no basis for a new trial,see d at.
we see no abuse of discretion in either the district court decision to admit the testimony of the experts or its decision that the admission of their testimony does not warrant a new trial.although we have not directly addressed the need for expert testimony with respect to alleged fraudulent conduct in the rare coin industry,we think it clearly was appropriate for the court to find that such testimony was relevant and would be of assistance to the jury,for we agree with the first circuit that o ne could hardly expect a lay jury to form conclusions about such an esoteric subject as the value of rare coins without the help of experts,united states kayne,at see generally united states kail,cir approving admission of expert testimony that ana grading standards enjoyed almost acceptance,and that the gray sheet is recognized as the chief guide to the current price of rare coins.see also united states numisgroup int l,d,t he grade of a coin is the predominant factor in a consumer decision to purchase a coin it is what the customer is bargaining for,and coin grading involves various factors,including some that are subjective,that are beyond the knowledge and experience of the unsophisticated purchaser emphasis added,aff,cir affirming the denial of motions for acquittal for substantially the reasons stated by the district court in its thorough decision,rev on other grounds sub nom.dupurton united states.
in the context of this industry,it was also well within the bounds of the district court discretion to conclude that the experts testimony was sufficient to show that the grading of coins provides a reliable indicator of their worth.the testimony in the record including that of schechter,which defendants do not challenge on appeal showed that the point sheldon scale has been in fairly common use since the middle of the century and that grading using that scale is relied on in the industry.both ngc and pcgs,which together account for percent of the independent grading service industry,use the sheldon scale,and they give guarantees for the grades they assign to coins.and many purchases of coins are made on the basis of the certifications by ngc and pcgs without the buyers viewing the coins themselves.further,there was evidence that the romano companies salesmen were instructed by kearney to tell customers who expressed concern about quality and value that the company had graders who used a grading process similar to that used by ngc and pcgs thereby confirming the general acceptance of those processes as reliable indicators of value.
while defendants argue that expert testimony is inherently unreliable because of the subjective aspects of coin grading,the lack of unanimity as to the grade a particular coin should be given is not a basis for a conclusion that use of the sheldon scale is unreliable or leads to wild disparities.defendants own trial witness study of the government spreadsheets revealed that when ngc graded coins sold by the romano companies,ngc first two graders agreed on the proper grade for percent of the coins.
defendants also argue that swiatek testimony should have been excluded because his methodology was incapable of replication and hence was untrustworthy.but at the daubert hearing,swiatek explained how he used the greysheet,the bluesheet,and auction prices,as well as his own experience,to value the coins that were examined in the present action.although defendants highlight some portions of the trial transcript that indicate descriptions of swiatek methods see kearney brief on appeal at,swiatek trial testimony as a whole described his methods coherently and was consistent with his testimony at the daubert hearing.to be sure,it is possible that swiatek methods are not entirely replicable because they are based in part on his personal experience as a coin dealer for several decades but rule itself provides that the court may admit evidence that will assist the jury based on the witness specialized knowledge.we see no abuse of discretion in the district court conclusion that the criticisms raised by defendants went to the weight of the evidence,not to its admissibility,and were matters for and argument to the jury.
finally,although defendants argue that swiatek valuations should have been excluded on the theory that it was absurd to believe that romano would pay his suppliers three times as much as swiatek opined the coins were worth,that theory too was a matter for argument to the jury,not a basis for excluding swiatek evidence.as discussed in part.above,suppliers testified that romano gave little or no attention to the coins themselves before buying them.and the jury was entitled to infer that,as romano was driven by a profit motive,the price he paid for a coin was of no concern to him as long as he could market it for substantially more.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of montgomery and swiatek or in denying a new trial.
b.other challenges to the convictions 
defendants also raise other challenges to their convictions,including a confrontation clause claim,a due process claim,and an insufficiency claim.these challenges do not require extended discussion.
the present confrontation clause challenge to gx 
defendants argue that the admission of gx,the spreadsheet setting out the grades that ngc assigned to coins submitted in this case by customers of the romano companies,violated their confrontation clause rights because the ngc graders were not themselves witnesses at trial and therefore were not subject to romano brief on appeal at.the right to confrontation may,of course,be waived,melendez diaz massachusetts,and we conclude that it was waived here.
defendants acknowledge that they did not make a confrontation clause objection to the district court see romano brief on appeal at,but they argue that they are entitled to review because they only explicitly disclaimed a hearsay argument,and did not disclaim the confrontation clause argument id.at.the record does not support their argument,for a strategic decision that is evidenced not merely by silence but by a negative response on the record to a district court invitation to voice objection,does more than forfeit the unraised objection it waives it,united states agrawal,cir emphasis added.
in the district court,defendants objected to the introduction of gx on the basis of their contention that coin grading is not an appropriate subject for expert testimony,characterizing the exhibit as a compendium of expert opinion.tr.although defendants did expressly agree that they were not objecting to this as a hearsay document,they also answered no to the court far more elemental question whether defendants were objecting to gx on the ground that each individual grader needs to come in.id.at.their no answer to that question waived their right to have the individual graders themselves come in to testify as witnesses.
the due process challenge 
romano argument that he was denied due process because he had no notice that he could be convicted of conspiracy to commit mail or wire fraud merely for selling coins whose grades as he represented them were not similar to those assigned by ngc romano brief on appeal at is merely a repackaging of his objection to the admission of expert testimony about the grading standards in the rare coin industry,and is meritless.the jury was properly instructed that 
t he government does not allege that the defendants engaged in criminal conduct merely because they allegedly charged more for certain coins than their actual value in the opinion of an expert witness and that even if you should determine that in some cases the amount the subject companies charged customers for coins exceeded swiatek value for those coins,you may not convict the defendant you are considering of the charges contained in the indictment unless all of the elements of the crimes charged have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
sufficiency of evidence supporting kearney convictions 
kearney argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that he was a knowing participant in the conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud because,he asserts,there was no evidence that he knew romano was grading coins fraudulently.and he argues that since that conspiracy charge was the basis for the charge of money laundering conspiracy,the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction on either count.these arguments are meritless.there was ample evidence that kearney knew of romano fraudulent misgrading and given the many other respects in which the romano companies defrauded their customers,there was abundant evidence that kearney participated in the mail and wire fraud conspiracy even if he had not known the coins were misgraded.

here,the record shows that customers of the romano companies were defrauded in several ways in addition to the misgrading of the coins they bought.as described in part.above,the salesmen fraudulently told customers and prospective customers that the coins would increase in value that sets of coins were worth more than the total value of the individual coins in the set that the romano companies employed coin graders and that the romano companies would help the customers sell the coins they bought if they so desired.all of the salesmen were trained by kearney he directed them to make all of these fraudulent statements.he also,having trained them to say the romano companies would help customers sell their coins if they so requested,trained the salesmen to deflect any such request.
further,kearney himself made sales calls and included in his sales pitch the same material misrepresentations that he required the salesmen to make and he even embellished on some of them.kearney told one customer,for example,that wsrc had graders and that each grader was independent of the others.they had all worked for grading companies and had come to work at wall street rare coins now,and that they looked at the coins independently and graded them independently,and that the lowest grade was chosen to represent the coin.tr.
second,there was ample circumstantial evidence from which the jury could infer that kearney knew romano was engaging in fraudulent grading.salesmen testified that all of the salesmen were aware of romano method of selecting grades for the coins in inventory he would call lepolszki or one other salesman to learn the book prices for various grades of a certain coin,and romano ensuing inventory sheet would show that coin at the high end of the prices lepolszki had reported.the salesmen were aware of this process because they could hear lepolszki responses to romano inquiries,as they all worked in a small office at desks merely five or six feet apart.kearney desk was one of them,and he was there percent of the time.
further,in addition to kearney making and orchestrating the false representations about having graders which the jury was entitled to infer constituted a knowing effort to conceal false grading customers complaints that their coins were not of as high a grade as the romano companies represented them to be were referred to romano and to kearney.one of kearney solutions was to instruct that grades not be shown on invoices.
the evidence was more than sufficient to permit the jury to find that kearney knew of the false grading of the coins.
