carlos mulero d√≠az appeals the district court revocation of his term of supervised release and imposition of a term of imprisonment for violations of the conditions of that supervised release.we affirm.
on december,mulero pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute narcotics in violation of,and.he was sentenced to seventy months imprisonment and eight years supervised release.the conditions of supervised release required mulero to,among other things,not commit another federal,state or local crime,not possess a firearm or ammunition,and notify the probation officer within hours of being arrested or questioned by a law enforcement officer.
after mulero was released from his term of imprisonment and while he was on supervised release,the united states probation office requested that the district court issue an arrest warrant and conduct a hearing as to why mulero supervised release should not be revoked as a result of his violations of his conditions of supervised release.the district court granted the probation office requests.
at the hearing,mulero conceded that he had violated the terms of his supervised release.he admitted that he had been arrested on two occasions once for driving while intoxicated,and a second time for driving without a driver license and without a vehicle registration sticker.he also admitted that he had failed to report the arrests to his probation officer and that he had,in fact,driven while intoxicated and without proper license or registration.
mulero contended that this conduct warranted a finding that he had committed a grade c violation of his conditions of supervised release the least serious type of supervised release violation,and one that permits but does not require revocation.see.but the government argued that mulero had also engaged in more serious offenses domestic violence and possessing a weapon.the government argued that,due to those offenses,mulero should be found to have committed a grade a violation a violation that would result in mandatory revocation of his supervised release and a greater guidelines sentencing range than would a grade c violation.see id.
to make that case,the government at the hearing introduced the testimony of puerto rico police officer juan la santa soto,as well as the testimony of miriam morales martinez,mulero probation officer.la santa testified that,on a morning in april,the puerto rico police department received an anonymous call concerning a domestic violence incident in reparto flamingo,in bayamon,puerto rico.la santa testified that upon arriving at the scene to investigate,he found two couples arguing on the street.one of those couples,la santa recounted,was mulero and a woman named jamie.jamie was later identified at the hearing as jamie figueroa.
la santa testified that he told mulero that he was investigating a domestic violence incident,and that mulero told him,among other things,that he should go to hell and that mulero wanted to hit la santa in the face.la santa said that he then called his supervisor,and that when his supervisor came,mulero challenged the supervisor to a fight.la santa further stated that mulero then left,at which point figueroa told la santa that mulero owned a firearm,and that the firearm was in the apartment where they were both living.
la santa recounted figueroa retrieving the firearm and turning it over to la santa.according to la santa,the firearm was a caliber pistol,and it was loaded.la santa testified that he then arrested mulero after mulero had returned,and found one caliber bullet in mulero pocket.
mulero probation officer,morales,testified regarding a second incident.she stated that in may she received a call reporting domestic violence between mulero and figueroa.morales testified that she interviewed figueroa,who according to morales complained that mulero had appeared at her house on may with wilfredo sandoval ayala.according to morales,figueroa said that mulero had been aggressive and had broken a window,and so figueroa had fled her home.morales said that figueroa told morales that figueroa had gone to a neighbor for help,and that when the neighbor opened the door for her,mulero had spilled gasoline on figueroa.and,morales testified,figueroa had requested a restraining order after this incident and her request had been granted.
in addition,morales testified that she had spoken with figueroa neighbor,who had corroborated figueroa story.according to morales,the neighbor reported that figueroa had asked him to let her into his house because mulero was being aggressive against her.morales said the neighbor also told her that mulero had been bothering the neighbors by yelling,threatening,firing shots in the air,and fighting with figueroa.
the district court credited the testimony of la santa and morales.the district court found that there was no doubt about the domestic violence incidents,and no doubt about mulero possessing that weapon and possessing ammunition.the district court thus concluded that there was sufficient evidence to find a g rade a violation.
despite so concluding,the district court classified mulero conduct as a grade c violation.because mulero had a criminal history category of i,the resulting guidelines sentence was three to imprisonment.see.but the district court did not sentence mulero to a term of imprisonment within the three to range.instead,the district court concluded that the guidelines do not provide the punishment that is necessary for deterrence.characterizing mulero violations as blatant,clear,in clear disregard for the law and the conditions of supervised release,constituting a threat to the life of individuals,and constituting a threat to the neighborhood in which you live,the district court imposed a sentence of three years imprisonment.see e.
mulero appeals.
mulero first argues that the district court erred in admitting hearsay evidence at the hearing without balancing mulero right to confront witnesses with the government cause for denying confrontation pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure b c.specifically,mulero argues that the district court should have asked the government for some explanation for why figueroa,the unnamed neighbor who observed the alleged gasoline incident,and sandoval the man who went to figueroa home with mulero just before the gasoline incident,were not called to testify.
mulero is correct that a defendant who faces revocation of his term of supervised release does have a limited confrontation right under federal rule of criminal procedure b c.and,under that rule,mulero was entitled to an opportunity to question any adverse witness unless the court determines that the interest of justice does not require the witness to appear.b c.we have said,moreover,that i n conducting this analysis,a court should consider the reliability of the hearsay testimony and the government reason for declining to produce the declarant.united states rondeau,cir.
the record does not reveal that the district court expressly engaged in such a weighing.but mulero at no point invoked rule at the hearing.as a result,the government contends that mulero has waived any argument premised on the rule or,at the least,forfeited it,such that we may review his challenge only under the demanding plain error standard.mulero argues that he did generally contest the reliability of the testimony that the government offered at the hearing.he also notes that he objected that one witness testifying for the government officer la santa lacked personal knowledge of some of the facts to which he testified.
but when the district court overruled the objection by mulero on the ground that the federal rules of evidence did not govern the hearing,mulero did not then assert that he had an independent right under rule to have the court balance the reliability of the testimony against the government interest in not having the declarant appear before admitting the hearsay testimony.nor did mulero renew his objection when la santa testified at the district court direction regarding the basis of his knowledge of the facts to which mulero had objected.and at no point in the hearing did
