background 
the facts underlying this appeal are largely uncontested.on july,kilkenny waived indictment and pled guilty to each of three counts in a felony information.the plea agreement that defendant entered into with the government on that date included a detailed set of stipulated facts that formed the factual predicate for the guilty plea.although kilkenny admitted to having fraudulently obtained over a dozen bank loans and to having committed various other crimes,only three criminal counts were charged against him in the information.
count one charged him with executing a scheme f rom in or about september through on or about may,to defraud m t bank.the government alleged,and defendant admitted,that on september,he applied for and subsequently received a loan from m t bank in the amount of.in his loan application,kilkenny grossly overstated his assets and income,submitted fraudulent personal and corporate income tax returns,and failed to report more than million in debts.as a result of these misrepresentations,m t bank was forced to foreclose on the loan on may,and in so doing suffered a monetary loss of more than.count two charged defendant with defrauding individuals of by inducing them to invest in panamanian bonds which kilkenny was not authorized to issue and which were not valid instruments.the government alleged and defendant admitted that this scheme took place from february through june.finally,in count three of the information,the government charged defendant with structuring certain cash deposits on july,to avoid currency reporting requirements.
following defendant guilty plea,the united states probation office prepared a presentence investigation report psr using the version of the guidelines.the psr calculated a level of six pursuant to a and recommended five enhancements a enhancement for the amount of loss,id.at b k a enhancement for the number of victims,id.at b b a enhancement for obtaining more than million from financial institutions,id.at b a a enhancement for obstruction of justice,id.at and a enhancement for defendant supervision of a criminally responsible participant,his bookkeeper,melanie ramsey,id.at c.the resulting total offense level was,with a guidelines range between and months imprisonment.
at a sentencing hearing on december,defense counsel made several objections to the psr.first,defense counsel took issue with the version of the guidelines used to calculate defendant sentence.kilkenny contended that instead of the guidelines,the guidelines should have been applied because all of the conduct relating to the offenses of conviction occurred before november,when the version of the guidelines went into effect.second,defense counsel objected to the enhancement for kilkenny supervision of a criminally responsible participant.third,the defense asserted a reduction was warranted for acceptance of responsibility.the sentencing court was not persuaded by these objections.applying the version of the guidelines,which are in all relevant respects identical to the version,the court sentenced kilkenny to months in prison,followed by five years of supervised release,and restitution in the amount of.
while defendant first appeal to this court was pending,the supreme court handed down united states booker,d,which rendered advisory the sentencing range calculated under the guidelines.in a summary order,we remanded the case for resentencing pursuant to booker and declined to reach the other issues defendant raised on appeal.united states kilkenny.cir.march.
defendant was resentenced on november.the district court again applied the version of the guidelines,finding that the offense of conviction continued through may.in particular,it concluded that,although kilkenny applied for and received the m t bank loan in september,his subsequent failure to make payments on the loan extended the offensive conduct until the bank initiated foreclosure proceedings in.the trial judge stated that in applying the date he was relying on the entire range of conduct and that kilkenny conduct of fraud and deception extended actually even into in relation to additional individual victims which were not specifically charged but detailed in the presentence report.the court also noted that the may,date is specifically charged in count one of the information.applying the guidelines,it resentenced kilkenny to a total term of months imprisonment,months less than the sentence it had originally imposed,followed by five years of supervised release,restitution of,and a special assessment of.
from this judgment,kilkenny appeals.for the reasons set forth below,we remand the case to the district court with instructions to resentence defendant under the version of the guidelines.
discussion 
i standard of review 
we review a sentencing court interpretation and application of the guidelines de novo.united states sloley,cir.findings of fact are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard.id.a finding is clearly erroneous if,although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.anderson bessemer city,d.
ii ex post facto laws 
the premise of this opinion rests on an application of that provision in article i of the united states constitution that prohibits congress from passing any ex post facto law.see const.art.i,cl.see also art.i,cl.prohibiting states from passing any ex post facto law.for that reason it is helpful to state first our understanding of what that constitutional clause means.it is hard to improve on the definition of the ex post facto clause set out in an early supreme court case,calder bull,dall.in that case justice chase described the following kind of legislation as prohibited 
every law that makes an action done before the passing of the law,and which was innocent when done,criminal and punishes such action.
every law that aggravates a crime,or makes it greater than it was,when committed.
every law that changes the punishment,and inflicts a greater punishment,than the law annexed to the crime,when committed.
every law that alters the legal rules of evidence,and receives less,or different testimony,than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence,in order to convict the offender.
the reason for the clause adoption in the constitution was,as the supreme court has explained,to restrain congress from enacting arbitrary or vindictive laws.see miller florida,d.the clause also ensures that individuals are given fair warning of a law effect.id.at.examples from history vividly illustrate the importance of these dual functions.perhaps the most dramatic example of a vindictive law unconstrained by any ex post facto prohibition occurred in war ii germany.after an arsonist burned the reichstag in berlin in february,the newly empowered nazi government authorized increasing the punishment for arson from imprisonment to death.see morris ploscowe,crime and criminal law.the arsonist was duly executed.id.blackstone illustrates the second purpose of the ex post facto clause,providing fair warning,by looking to the policies of the roman despot caligula.see willia
