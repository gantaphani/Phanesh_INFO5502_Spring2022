simeon stefanidakis pleaded guilty to four counts of transporting and one count of possessing child pornography.the district court imposed sentences on all five counts.in this venue,the appellant argues that these multiple sentences violate the double jeopardy clause.see const.amend.v.after careful consideration,we reject the appellant importunings.
because this appeal follows a guilty plea,we draw the background facts from the colloquy,the plea agreement,the presentence investigation report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states santos,cir.
on october,the appellant entered an internet chat room.unbeknownst to him,an undercover law enforcement officer was surveilling the site.the officer engaged the appellant in a chat in which the pair discussed a mutual interest in child pornography.the appellant then offered the officer access to his pornography collection through gigatribe,a file sharing program.using his undercover gigatribe account,the officer learned that the appellant was sharing gigabytes of content.
after recording the appellant internet protocol ip address,the officer downloaded nine files from the appellant digital library.four of these files three still images and one video contained visual depictions of different young boys engaged in sexually explicit conduct.the appellant does not contest the pornographic nature of these materials.
the federal bureau of investigation fbi tracked the ip address.its investigation led to the appellant,and fbi agents obtained a warrant to search his residence in brookline,massachusetts,for child pornography.on march,the agents executed the warrant.the appellant waived his miranda rights,see miranda arizona,d admitted that he was the person at the residence who had possession of the child pornography and handed over the external hard drive that he had used to store the forbidden images.
forensic analysis of the hard drive subsequently revealed a log file a record of the computer activities.the log file documented the appellant earlier interactions with the undercover officer.it also verified the existence of thousands of images depicting child pornography.
soon thereafter,a federal grand jury handed up a indictment against the appellant.counts one through four charged interstate transportation of child pornography,a,and count five charged possession of child pornography,id.a b.in due course,the appellant agreed to plead guilty to all five counts.among other features,the plea agreement contained a provision,which precluded the appellant from challenging either his conviction or any sentence of sixty months or less.
at the hearing,the appellant acquiesced in the prosecutor factual account of the five charged crimes.the court accepted the guilty plea as tendered.it later sentenced the appellant to concurrent month incarcerative terms on each of the five counts of conviction.this timely appeal ensued.
the appellant principal plaint is that the district court failed to realize that he should have been sentenced either for transportation of child pornography or for possession of child pornography,but not both.in his view,sentencing him on the entire array of charges offended the double jeopardy clause.
the appellant labors to couch his argument as a sentencing argument.he emphasizes that the transportation counts each carry a mandatory minimum sentence,see id.b,whereas the possession count carries no minimum sentence,see id.b.the district court failure to recognize the double jeopardy violation,he insists,led it to conclude erroneously that it had to apply the mandatory minimum when doing so was optional.if this were so,it arguably would mean that the court failed to consider all legally available sentences as required by a.
the appellant effort to spin his double jeopardy claim as a claim of sentencing error is a thinly veiled attempt to evade the plea agreement provision a provision that precludes an appeal of his conviction but that allows an appeal of a sentence of months duration.we need not dwell on the efficacy of this sleight of hand because the double jeopardy claim,however it is configured,represents an elevation of hope over reason.
to begin,the appellant failed to raise any double jeopardy issue below.consequently,his claim is forfeited,and we examine it through the prism of review.see united states olano,d united states cothran,cir.review for plain error entails four showings that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.we discern no error,plain or otherwise,in the court imposition of sentence.
the law surrounding double jeopardy has special nuances where guilty pleas are involved.in menna new york,d per curiam,much bruited by the appellant,the supreme court allowed the defendant to raise a double jeopardy claim notwithstanding his earlier entry of an unconditional guilty plea.id.at.the court reasoned that when the government is precluded by the united states constitution from haling a defendant into court on a charge,federal law requires that a conviction on that charge be set aside even if the conviction was entered pursuant to a counseled plea of guilty.id.
but menna is not the court final word on the subject.in united states broce,d,the court made pellucid that the ability to attack a guilty plea on double jeopardy grounds is severely constrained.id.at.the court explained that b y entering a plea of guilty,the accused is not simply stating that he did the discrete acts described in the indictment he is admitting guilt of a substantive crime.id.at.it follows that a defendant who pleads guilty to the full panoply of the crimes specifically and distinctly alleged in an indictment has relinquished the right to claim at a later date that he had committed fewer crimes.see id.at.consequently,a guilty plea forecloses a double jeopardy claim unless on the face of the record the court had no power to enter the conviction or impose the sentence.id.at.
this means that once a defendant has pleaded guilty,he can not either revisit the factual predicate upon which his conviction rests or venture outside the record to support his argument.see id.at.nor can he maintain a claim of constitutional breach that is inconsistent with admissions that he made in the course of the proceedings.see id.at.jackson coalter,cir.
these principles are dispositive here.the appellant primary argument is that he could not be sentenced for both possession and transportation of child pornography because all of the charges are predicated on the same facts and,therefore,the possession charge is a lesser included offense of the transportation charges.as framed,this argument draws its essence from blockburger united states,which prohibits charging the same conduct under two separate statutes unless each statute requires proof of a fact that the other does not.id.at.
in a case in which conviction and sentencing follow the acceptance of a guilty plea and this is such a case our inquiry into the bona fides of a double jeopardy argument reduces to whether the alleged double jeopardy violation is evident on the face of the record.see broce,at.united states pollen,cir collecting cases.to carry out this task,we must look to whether the record contains facts sufficient to supply a rational basis for a finding that the possession and transportation counts were predicated on different conduct.see united states pimentel,cir united states matos qui√±ones,cir.
in the case at hand,the record establishes that the transportation and possession counts were based on different conduct.in the indictment,each of the four transportation counts is grounded on one of the four specifically identified files that the appellant transmitted to the officer on october.the possession count,however,is based on other files,five of which are specifically identified,that were stored in the external hard drive discovered during the residential search on march.these divergent scenarios were not merely alleged in the indictment and then forgotten during t
