on july,a jury found dennis brown brown guilty of being a felon in possession of four firearms and rounds of ammunition in violation of g.before trial,the district court had denied brown motions to suppress certain evidence and exclude certain testimony.brown claims error in these denials,and in the manner in which the district court empaneled the jury.

after careful consideration,we affirm brown conviction.we also affirm his new sentence,but for a reason other than that given by the district court.
background 
on june,scott devlaminck was arrested when he attempted to sell four firearms with ammunition to a cooperating witness.as police officers converged upon devlaminck,he immediately identified dennis brown as the source of the guns.he stated that brown had offered to pay him half the proceeds of the sale,and that brown expected him to return immediately with the money.devlaminck told the officers that brown had retrieved the guns from his garage at forest street in salisbury,massachusetts.
thomas coffey and david had participated in a major drug investigation involving brown in the early,and knew him and his voice from personal debriefings and from listening to hundreds of hours of intercepted communications.coffey instructed devlaminck,who had been placed under arrest,to call brown on devlaminck cell phone and pretend the buyer had demanded a lower price.as coffey and huddled close to devlaminck and listened in,brown instructed devlaminck to return with as much money as he could get from the buyer.shortly thereafter,five police cruisers converged upon the brown family compound,which contained several buildings including a house owned by brown brother,and a garage with a workshop brown used as a business.brown resided permanently in a trailer near the garage.the complex of buildings was obscured by vegetation and was thus not visible from the road the only access to it was an unobstructed gravel driveway leading to the rear of the home.no signs directed visitors to the home or the shop.as the officers reached the complex of buildings,brown emerged from the garage carrying a cell phone.coffey placed brown under arrest and seized the phone.the officers did not have an arrest warrant there is conflicting and contested evidence that,at some point that evening,coffey called brown cell phone from his own with the number devlaminck had provided,and that brown cell phone rang.
the government filed a indictment charging brown with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.brown claimed that his arrest was illegal,and moved to suppress the cell phone,any information on the cell phone,and any statements made by him at the scene or at booking.the district court held a hearing at which coffey,and another officer testified.in their testimony,coffey and stated that,during the controlled cell phone conversation,they recognized brown voice as the one they had heard hundreds of times over the course of the drug investigation involving him in the early had also had many conversations with brown.the district court denied the motion to suppress in a written decision,finding that there was probable cause to arrest brown the officers did not need a warrant to arrest brown because he was not in his home or the curtilage thereof and even if he were in the curtilage,the officers reasonable fear that he would conceal evidence if devlaminck did not return quickly provided exigent circumstances and dispensed with the need for an arrest warrant.
brown made a number of motions in limine,two of which are at issue in this appeal.in the first motion,brown sought to exclude the anticipated testimony of coffey and that they recognized him as the person speaking with devlaminck during the controlled cell phone conversation.brown claimed that evidence of these officers identification of his voice would be unreliable and unfairly prejudicial,particularly considering that he had,in the interim,undergone cancer surgery resulting in the removal of parts of his tongue.the district court denied the motion.in the second motion in limine,brown sought to exclude coffey anticipated testimony that he called brown cell phone and that it rang.the district court also denied this motion.
on july,the jury found brown guilty of possessing the guns and ammunition seized from devlaminck.in the presentence report psr,the probation officer calculated that brown guidelines sentencing range gsr was to months.the psr also took into account what the probation officer determined were three prior convictions a conviction for intimidation of a witness,in violation of.laws ch,a conviction for assault and battery on a police officer abpo,in violation of.laws ch,and a federal conviction for distributing cocaine.as a result of these three predicate for a serious drug offense and two for violent felonies,see e the psr concluded that brown qualified as an armed career criminal acc under the acca.brown was accordingly subject to a mandatory minimum sentence.id.brown vigorously challenged his status as an acc before the district court,arguing on both legal and factual grounds that neither the conviction nor the abpo conviction could be considered as acca predicates among brown arguments was that the government had failed to prove the fact of his abpo conviction 
on february,the district court adopted the psr recommendations and sentenced brown as an acc to fifteen years.on march,the supreme court handed down shepard,and on april,brown moved for resentencing.he argued that,in determining that he committed the violent varieties of witness intimidation and abpo,the district court had engaged in judicial factfinding of the type now prohibited by shepard.the district court agreed,quashed brown sentence,and ordered that a resentencing hearing be scheduled.
at the ensuing november,resentencing hearing,the parties debated whether brown could still be considered an acc,and the focus was on whether brown abpo conviction qualified as an acca predicate the government argued that brown could be sentenced as an acc because,according to united states fernández,cir,massachusetts abpo is categorically a violent felony for acca purposes,and shepard had not rendered fernández obsolete.the district court rejected this argument and held that,since it could not determine whether brown crime was violent or nonviolent,it could not count it as an acca predicate.the court consequently sentenced brown to the original gsr maximum of months.
ii.the motion to suppress 
brown appeals the denial of his motion to suppress.he does not now claim that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him,but maintains that he was in the curtilage of his home and that the police lacked exigent circumstances to arrest him without a warrant.we affirm the denial of the motion.
standard of review 
when considering whether a certain location qualifies as curtilage for fourth amendment purposes,we review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo.united states diehl,cir.we will uphold a denial of a motion to suppress if any reasonable view of the evidence supports it.united states pierre,cir quoting united states kornegay,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
discussion 
with one apparent exception discussed below,brown does not challenge the district court factual findings with respect to the motion to suppress,and our examination of the record reveals no error in these findings,much less clear error.we thus turn immediately to whether,in light of these facts along with those adduced at trial the district court erred in determining that brown was not in the curtilage of his home.
the fourth amendment protects persons from warrantless arrest inside their homes or other places where they have a reasonable expectation of privacy.see payton new york,d united states cruz jiménez,cir.one such place is the curtilage of the home.bilida mccleod,cir.brown argues that he was standing in the curtilage of his home when he was arrested,and since the police lacked a warrant,the arrest violated the fourth amendment.
when determining whether a given location falls within the home curtilage,we look to whether it is so intimately tied to the home itself that it should be placed under the home umbrella of fourth amendment protection.diehl,at quoting united states dunn,d internal quotation marks omitted.the supreme court has identified four specific criteria to guide the analysis 
the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home,whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home,the nature of the uses to which the area is put,and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by.
id.at quoting dunn,at.we take these factors in turn.
the first dunn factor would seem to favor a finding that brown was in the curtilage when arrested he was arrested at the top of his driveway,adjacent to the garage.the record is unclear on precisely how far this location was from the trailer in which brown resided.yet even assuming the two were close together,proximity to the dwelling house is not dispositive.united states french,cir.application of the second dunn factor is unhelpful in the circumstances there appears to be no evidence on record as to whether there was an enclosure surrounding all or part of brown property,or internal enclosures around individual buildings or groups of buildings.
notwithstanding the fulfillment of the first dunn factor,an examination of the third and fourth factors leads us to a different conclusion.although determining whether a given area falls within the curtilage depends on the facts of a case,rosencranz united states,cir see also diehl,at rejecting the notion that driveways can never fall within the curtilage,our past cases reveal a number of general principles with respect to driveways.if the relevant part of the driveway is freely exposed to public view,it does not fall within the curtilage.see,united states roccio,cir this holds true even where the relevant part of the driveway is somewhat removed from a public road or street,and its viewing by passersby is only occasional.see,united states hensel,cir.hence,in order for a part of a driveway to be considered within the home curtilage,public viewing of it must be,at most,very infrequent.the remoteness of the relevant part of the driveway and steps taken by the resident to discourage public entry or observation militate toward a finding that it falls within the curtilage.see diehl,at,relevant part of driveway fell within curtilage where it was reached only by proceeding feet along discontinued town road and then feet along the driveway residents had posted no trespassing signs at its entrance,had their mail delivered to a post office box in town,and had instructed united parcel service to leave parcels at a store and members of the public hardly ever entered.
it is clear that the area where brown was arrested was not visible from the public street,due in part to the length of the driveway and vegetation between the street and the relevant area.nevertheless,the brown family had erected no barriers,had posted no signs,and had taken no other action to prevent or discourage public entry.smith,at no fourth amendment protection for area of driveway near defendant house,some to feet from public road with no barrier preventing or discouraging entry.indeed,although there were also no signs directing visitors to the business located in brown garage,brown admits that he allowed patrons onto the property to drop off and pick up motors the brown property thus contrasts sharply with that in diehl,where the residents went to extraordinary lengths to fashion a locus as free from observation by passersby as one could conceive.diehl,at.this,in our view,is the critical distinction between this case and diehl brown could have no reasonable expectation of privacy in an outdoor area to which members of the public were given ready access 
we conclude that,when brown was placed under arrest,he was not within an area coming under his home umbrella of fourth amendment protection.diehl,at.as a consequence,the police did not need a warrant to arrest him,see united states,cir,and we need not address brown further contention that the district court erred in finding exigent circumstances vitiating the warrant requirement.we therefore affirm the denial of brown motion to suppress.
iii.the motions in limine 
brown made two motions in limine that are at issue in this appeal.the first concerns coffey and trial testimony that they recognized brown voice during the controlled cell phone conversation between brown and devlaminck.brown claims these identifications were unreliable and unfairly prejudicial.the second concerns coffey trial testimony that he called brown cell phone with the number devlaminck provided and that it rang.brown claims the government failure to turn over in discovery coffey cell phone records from the night in question violated brady maryland,d.we address the motions in turn.
standard of review 
we review the district court rulings on whether to admit or exclude evidence,including rulings on motions in limine,for abuse of discretion.united states guerrier,cir.the same standard applies to review of the district court determination that the risk of unfair prejudice does not substantially outweigh the probative value of a given piece of evidence.united states frabizio,cir see also united states simon,cir district court given considerable leeway.a n abuse of discretion occurs when a relevant factor deserving of significant weight is overlooked,or when an improper factor is accorded significant weight,or when the court considers the appropriate mix of factors,but commits a palpable error of judgment in calibrating the decisional scales.frabizio,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
discussion 
the first motion in limine 
brown argues that evidence of coffey and identification of his voice should not have been placed before the jury because the identification was unreliable.we consider the totality of the circumstances to determine whether testimony is sufficiently reliable to be allowed into evidence.united states panico,cir see also.due process requires the exclusion of such testimony only where there is a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.panico,at quoting united states henderson,cir.
the district court did not state the reasons for denying brown motion in limine,although it remarked on the reliability of coffey and evidence in its earlier decision on brown motion to suppress 
while defendant objects to the fact that neither or coffey are trained in voice identification,their prior familiarity with brown voice,gleaned from hours of listening to his telephone conversations and debriefing him in person is more than sufficient to establish the reliability of their recognition of his voice.
brown,d at.
we agree with these observations.there is abundant evidence on record that coffey and had spent a great deal of time listening to brown voice.they transcribed hundreds of hours of tapes from wiretaps during the drug investigation involving brown in the early,and met brown in person several times after brown decided to cooperate with that investigation.also testified that he saw and spoke to brown in a courthouse parking lot a few months prior to the events at issue here.given the degree of contact between these two officers and brown,we accord very little weight to the fact that most of it occurred ten or twelve years prior to brown arrest.indeed,testified that listening to brown voice during the phone conversation with devlaminck was like listening to a friend,and brown himself confirmed his apparent acquaintanceship with by uttering in open court,as was being led to the witness stand,david,my boy,how are we doing 
brown argues that the voice identifications were unreliable because coffey and had not heard him speak for perhaps ten or twelve years,and his voice had changed dramatically in the interim as a result of cancer surgeries on his tongue.as support,brown submitted to the district court the affidavit of an otolaryngologist stating i t is likely that dennis brown speech differs today specifically his articulation of words would be comparatively diminished.we are unconvinced that brown tongue surgeries altered his voice to the dramatic extent he claims in any event,even if brown voice had changed so substantially as to render it unrecognizable,identification of brown would probably still be reliable,as the two men had met and spoken in january,after the surgeries.finally,there is more to voice identification than the degree of articulation of words.stated that he recognized brown during the phone conversation with devlaminck not only because of the sound of his voice,but also because of the distinct manner in which brown speaks.
our opinion in ricci urso,cir,cited by brown as support for his position,is easily distinguishable.there,police officers suspected ricci of being a gambler who was under investigation,and whose voice they had recorded from wiretapped conversations.one of the officers called ricci and taped a conversation with him of less than a minute,and compared the tape with an recording of the gambler voice.the officer concluded the voices were similar,and that ricci was therefore the gambler.ricci,at.we found this voice identification unreliable the officer made the recording on a recorder,he had no expert training in voice identification,and the entire conversation with ricci lasted less than sixty seconds.we concluded that the voice analysis appears no more reliable than the identification of a suspect from a brief visual glimpse.id.at.
as in ricci,nothing in the record indicates that either coffey or had special training in voice identification,and devlaminck cell phone records from the night in question show that the conversation with brown was very brief,perhaps under a minute.nevertheless,in contrast to the officer in ricci,coffey and had extensive experience listening to brown voice,and had met with brown personally and recently.their familiarity with brown voice was much more akin to that of the defendant and friend in united states gilbert,cir there,we held identifications made by the and friend of the defendant voice from the audio tape of a bomb threat to be sufficiently reliable,despite some suggestive elements in the procedure.see id.at.coffey also testified that he had put the volume of the cell phone on the loudest setting,so that the person on the other end would be audible even without placing one ear to the receiver according to coffey,w e could all hear it as clear as day.
while we acknowledge that the conditions three men huddled together listening to the same cell not the best for making a voice identification,the defects were not so grave as to render the district court ruling on reliability an abuse of discretion.the totality of the circumstances make it quite plausible that coffey and could hear brown clearly,and could recognize and remember his voice upon hearing him.
brown also claims that the district court abused its discretion in failing to grant the first motion in limine under federal rule of evidence if coffey and were to testify as to why they were familiar with brown voice,they would have to discuss how brown was the subject of an extensive investigation by a drug taskforce,and such testimony would leave the jurors with the unfair impression that he was a career criminal.according to brown,this danger substantially outweighed any probative value the officers testimony may have had.see.
in our view,coffey and identifications of brown voice in the cell phone conversation had considerable probative value to an issue directly in dispute whether brown was the man on the other end of the line,instructing devlaminck to sell the guns and return with the money,tends to show that brown was the owner of the guns,or at least had a significant stake in their sale.on the other side of the equation,any risk of unfair prejudice resulting from testimony on brown criminal past was greatly attenuated by the cautious way in which the parties fashioned their arguments and elicited testimony at trial.while both parties closing arguments referred to the wiretap investigation,neither stated the purpose of the investigation or even that it involved suspected criminal activity.similarly,coffey testified that brown had been the subject of a wiretap investigation,but did not reveal its purpose or any details of it,or that brown was suspected of committing a crime.likewise testified that brown had been wiretapped and recorded as part of a law enforcement initiative.
brown stipulated at trial that he had previously been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year.the district court informed the jury of this stipulation,and cautioned the jurors not to speculate on the nature of the crime of which brown had been convicted.while the wiretap testimony may have led some jurors to speculate as to why brown was investigated in the early,it is difficult to imagine any significant danger of unfair prejudice accruing to brown that would outweigh the probative value of the testimony.any such juror probably simply assumed the investigation related to the crime brown had stipulated to committing.it is highly unlikely that any juror based all or a substantial portion of his or her decision regarding brown guilt on the fact that he had been the subject of a wiretap investigation.see united states flemmi,cir evidence is unfairly prejudicial if it invites the jury to render a verdict on an improper emotional basis.quoting united states varoudakis,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in any event,we need not strike the rule balance ourselves,but need merely determine whether the district court abused its discretion in striking the balance.it is clear that there was no abuse of discretion here.see united states charles,cir reversal of district court rule judgment called for only rarely and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances quoting flemmi,at internal quotation marks omitted.
we accordingly conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying brown motion in limine to exclude the testimony of coffey and.
the second motion in limine 
at the motion to suppress hearing,coffey testified that he confiscated brown phone when brown was arrested,called it from his own phone using the number devlaminck had provided,and that it rang.on,brown confronted coffey with brown phone records from that evening,which show one call at and the next at coffey testified that he must have called at,while still at the brown property.brown then showed coffey a booking sheet indicating that brown had been booked at,and that a cell phone had been inventoried as one of brown possessions.coffey responded that this entry did not necessarily mean that brown phone was seized at 
three days later,brown counsel sent a letter to the assistant attorney asking to be provided with records of coffey cell phone showing the telephone call to dennis brown cell phone.the government did not provide such records.brown then filed the motion in limine,claiming that any testimony on coffey confirmatory phone call should be excluded on the ground that it is contradicted by affirmative undisputed evidence in the record,including brown cell phone records,the booking sheet,and police records that show coffey was at the salisbury police station interrogating devlaminck between and brown also asserted that the testimony should be barred because the government failed to hand over coffey phone records in spite of brown request.
at trial,prior to coffey testimony,brown reminded the district court of the motion in limine,emphasizing that it should be granted because the government had failed to hand over coffey phone records.the government responded that it did not have the records.the district court issued a brief oral ruling disposing of the motion the records were equally accessible to both sides.brown could have issued a subpoena for them.so the motion is denied.
testimony at trial on this issue was predictably confused.an officer who was present at brown arrest testified that coffey dialed brown number immediately after confiscating the phone and that it rang.coffey testified on direct examination that he called the phone and it rang,but that he did not remember whether he called while still at brown property or sometime later.on,coffey testified that,despite what was reflected in the booking entry,we were still looking at brown personal property,that the phone was sent to another police station,and that the salisbury police did not have physical possession of that phone at.when shown evidence that he was at the salisbury police station interrogating devlaminck between and,coffey acknowledged that he was not still at the brown property at,when brown phone records show an incoming call.
brown now appeals the district court denial of his motion in limine.he argues that coffey phone records were brady material because they would have directly contradicted coffey testimony on a key issue the fact that coffey called the number devlaminck provided and brown phone rang bolstered the government claim that it was brown with whom devlaminck had been speaking during the earlier controlled phone conversation.evidence that no phone call was made would also tend to discredit coffey in general.
the supreme court holding in brady requires the government to disclose exculpatory evidence in its possession that is material either to guilt or to punishment.brady,at.information is material if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different.united states,cir quoting united states,cir.to vacate a conviction because of a brady violation,the defendant must make a showing the evidence at issue was favorable to him,either because it is exculpatory,or because it is impeaching that evidence was suppressed by the s tate,either willfully or inadvertently and prejudice ensued.united states josleyn,cir quoting strickler greene,d.
the government maintains that coffey phone records are not,and never have been,in its custody or control,and that it therefore has no obligation to seek them out and disclose them.see united states bender,cir.yet even assuming for the sake of argument that coffey phone records were in the actual or constructive possession of the government,and that they would indicate that coffey made no call to brown phone on the evening in question,brown has still failed to satisfy the third element of the strickler is,that prejudice ensued.see united states,cir brady does not provide grounds for relief unless the exclusion or failure to produce prejudiced the defense.the jurors heard coffey testimony and that of the other officer,had the booking sheet and brown phone records before them,and still decided the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that brown possessed the guns recovered from devlaminck.they obviously believed coffey notwithstanding the implausibilities in the relevant portions of his testimony,or disbelieved him but believed the considerable quantum of other as devlaminck and brown to the guns.it is highly unlikely that the verdict would have been any different had coffey phone records been in evidence,no matter what they may have indicated,or that the records or coffey testimony in response to them would have put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.united states casas,cir see also united states dumas,cir impeachment evidence,even that which tends to further undermine the credibility of the key government witness whose credibility has already been shaken due to extensive,does not create a reasonable doubt that did not otherwise exist where that evidence is cumulative or collateral.quoting united states shelton,cir.the failure to provide the purported brady material did not prejudice brown,and the district court refusal to exclude coffey testimony on the confirmatory phone call was accordingly not error.
iv.the allocation of peremptory challenges 
brown next argues that his conviction should be reversed or retrial granted because the district court,in its manner of selecting alternate jurors,violated federal rule of criminal procedure and diluted the proportion of peremptory challenges to which he was entitled the government 
standard of review 
the government argues for plain error review because brown failed to make a timely objection to the district court method of selecting alternate jurors.we agree.see united states mcfarlane,cir.under the plain error standard,brown must prove an error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights,and that the error seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states connolly,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
discussion 
the district court seated fourteen jurors using the struck method.during jury empanelment,the court gave brown eleven peremptory challenges the ten from rule b plus the one from rule c.it gave the government seven the six from rule b plus the one from rule c.at the close of trial,before sending the jury to deliberate,the district court drew the names of two of the fourteen jurors by lot and designated them as the alternates.
brown claims that this method of empaneling alternate jurors and allocating peremptory challenges violated rule.he is correct.the mandate in rule c that additional challenges may be used only to remove alternate jurors implies that these alternates must be designated at voir dire,when the parties still have the opportunity to use peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors,and not by lottery at the end of trial.this conclusion comports with that reached by other circuits.see,united states brewer,cir united states love,cir.
brown then mounts an imaginative but ultimately unavailing argument as to how he was harmed by this violation.had the district court followed rule,brown would have had ten peremptory challenges to use against the pool of persons from which the twelve regular jurors were be drawn,while the government would have had only six in other words,brown would have had percent of the government challenges.by lumping each party extra peremptory challenge for the two alternates together with the original challenges,the district court gave brown eleven challenges and the government seven brown thus had only percent of the government challenges to use against a pool of persons from which twelve regular jurors and two alternates would be drawn.brown contends that his loss of advantage over the government was significant because the trial was very short,and it was unlikely that any alternate would end up stepping in for a regular juror indeed,as it turned out,the alternates were not used.although he concedes that he can point to no concrete prejudice,he argues that prejudice should be presumed because the variation may have reverberate d throughout the process of challenging jurors and result ed in a dramatically different panel deciding his case.
brown greatly exaggerates the consequences of the district court error,and the remedy he asks or far out of proportion to the harm he claims he suffered.we addressed this very question more than years ago under an earlier version of rule.in united states flaherty,cir,the district court empaneled two alternates,and each defendant was thus entitled to one additional peremptory challenge in addition to the original ten.disregarding the rule express mandate that t he additional peremptory challenges may be used against an alternate juror only,and the other peremptory challenges allowed may not be used against an alternate juror,the district court combined the original and additional peremptory challenges together to be used against a pool containing both regular jurors and alternates.we held as follows 
despite the clear transgression of the rule,we do not perceive how defendants exercise of their peremptory challenges was curtailed in any way we do not think that combining the regular and alternate challenges amounts to a violation of defendants substantial rights this,however,does not put our imprimatur on the court procedure for the exercise of peremptory challenges.
id.while rule has since been amended,its substance remains the same with respect to the prohibition on combining regular and alternate challenges in this manner.as in flaherty,while we regret the district court failure to follow the rule,we can not imagine how brown substantial rights could possibly have been prejudiced there was no prejudice here and certainly no plain error.
having concluded that brown conviction stands,we turn now to the sentence imposed by the district court.
v.the sentence 
the government appeals the district court sentence of months.it argues that both abpo and witness intimidation in massachusetts law are categorically violent felonies for purposes of the acca,and that the district court erred in not sentencing brown as an acc.
standard of review 
we review de novo whether a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony for purposes of the acca.united states pratt,cir see also united states santos,cir same standard for.
discussion 
recently,in united states holloway,cir,we addressed nearly the same question as the one at issue in brown resentencing hearing,and adopted a position substantially in line with that of the government notwithstanding shepard,assault and battery under massachusetts law is still categorically a violent felony for acca purposes.see id.at.this holding strongly suggests what,in other circumstances,may have been the outcome in this case.in light of what we say below,however,we do not reach this question,nor need we address whether massachusetts witness intimidation is categorically a violent felony.
the record suffers from an infirmity that renders us unable to hold the acca applicable.as brown points out,the evidence concerning his abpo conviction is extraordinarily sparse.the relevant paragraph of the psr lists the following pieces of information that brown was charged with the offense of abpo in newburyport district court that the date of brown arraignment was august,that brown was represented by counsel and that the matter was disposed of on june.next to this date,fine appears.see psr.where a description of the facts would normally appear,the psr states that n o information was available regarding this offense.id.brown concedes that he was charged with this offense,but contends that,on his recollection,there was no guilty finding,and the case was dismissed upon payment of the fine.the government has not has apparently been unable to documentation or other evidence relating to this offense,apart from the psr entry.
brown contests the accuracy of the psr entry in question,and has consistently maintained,both in the district court and before us,that the government failed to satisfy its burden of proving the fact of the massachusetts abpo conviction.we reject the government contention that brown somehow conceded his abpo conviction by arguing at various points that it did not qualify as an acca predicate because the underlying circumstances were nonviolent.we read these merely as arguments in the alternative,in case the district court found over brown objection that the three proffered predicates in fact existed.brown objection to the existence of the abpo conviction was spelled out in a sentencing memorandum to the district court dated january,and the point was debated at some length during the february,sentencing hearing.at that hearing,the district court acknowledged that t he awkward aspect of this case is that all the records have been lost,as best as anyone can tell.it nonetheless held it was satisfied with the accuracy of the records that have been presented confirming the three prior convictions,and sentenced brown to the acca minimum 
this determination was in error.the government burden of proving a predicate conviction for sentencing purposes is admittedly a modest one that can be satisfied in divers ways,including by introducing a certified copy of the judgment,or by a statement in the psr.united states cordero,cir accord united states barbour,cir.however,when a defendant challenges a conviction laid out in the psr,more is required.this case provides ample reason why.brown was sentenced to five years and three months in prison.he was arrested and taken into custody on june,and has presumably served all or most of his five years and three months by now.the mandatory minimum under the acca is fifteen years.e.the government would have us keep brown in prison for ten more years based on nothing more than the letter g in paragraph of the psr.indeed,as the psr itself states,no information was available regarding this offense.psr.in the face of this reality,the government can not be said to have met even its modest initial burden when it can produce nothing more.this was also the conclusion of the district of columbia circuit 
t he government may not simply rely on assertions in a presentence report if those assertions are contested by the defendant.thus,when the defendant calls into dispute a presentence report description of an alleged prior conviction,the government must demonstrate that the description in the report is based on a sufficiently reliable source to establish the accuracy of that description.
united states price,united states dueño,cir contested psr entry,where none of the evidence supporting the entry appeared in the record,insufficient on its own to prove existence of guilty plea for purposes of guidelines enhancement 
accordingly,we hold that the acca is inapplicable in the circumstances because the government has proven,at most,just two prior convictions that qualify as predicates under e.we consequently arrive at the same conclusion reached by the district court when it resentenced brown,albeit for a different reason,and see no need to disturb the court sentence of months.see bristol energy pub.utils.comm n,cir court of appeals may affirm on any theory supported by the record.since we hold the acca inapplicable,we need not address brown various challenges to its constitutionality.
vi.conclusion 
brown conviction is affirmed.brown sentence is affirmed,but on different grounds.
we recite the facts relating to the denial of brown motion to suppress as found by the district court,consistent with record support.see united states romain,cir see also united states brown,d,district court factual findings.
based in part on a description of devlaminck arrest and his statements incriminating brown,the police were able to obtain a warrant to search brown garage,which was executed later that night.the search produced a bag containing rounds of ammunition.the district court denied brown motion to suppress this ammunition.brown,at.in a form,the jury acquitted brown of possessing this ammunition.
brown concedes that the conviction for distributing cocaine qualifies as an acca predicate because it is a serious drug offense.e.
while the government eventually managed to come up with certified documentation concerning the conviction,it was never able to locate any documentation for the abpo conviction beyond the short entry in the psr itself.see psr.
brown conviction was not discussed at the resentencing hearing,and it is not clear why.the district court based its decision not to apply the acca on the ground that at least one of the three necessary abpo not qualify as a violent felony.
we are not restricted to reviewing the record as it stood at the time the district court took its decision on the suppression motion.relying on carroll united states,our sister circuits have taken the view that,if facts presented at trial support the district court denial of the motion to suppress,the appellate court may consider them.see,united states,more or less,in funds,cir united states bradford,cir united states han,cir united states,cir united states martin,cir united states perkins,cir united states corral,cir united states hicks,virgin islands williams,cir united states pearson,cir rocha united states,cir.we have acknowledged that this rule apparently is settled law,united states vargas,cir
