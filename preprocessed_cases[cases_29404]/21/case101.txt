the defendant,james stile,pled guilty to robbery of a controlled substance from a pharmacy by use of a dangerous weapon,in violation of a and c.the district court sentenced him to months in prison.he now appeals that sentence on both substantive and procedural grounds.for the following reasons,we affirm.
background 
we summarize the facts briefly,drawing on the presentence report psr and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.see united states jiminez,cir.we reserve further discussion of the facts for where they become relevant to each issue raised by stile appeal.
in the early evening of september,stile entered the moore son pharmacy in bingham,maine.he wore a baseball cap,sunglasses,a dust mask,and purple rubber gloves.as he entered the store,he pulled a shotgun from his pants.he walked to the pharmacy counter at the back of the store and ordered three employees to lie on their stomachs.when a customer walked in,stile forced him behind the pharmacy counter with the employees.stile handed the owner of the pharmacy a black duffel bag and ordered him to fill it with drugs.stile tied the hands and feet of the owner,the customer,and the employees with zip ties.he then departed the store,taking worth of drugs and in cash.
after initially pleading not guilty and going through several preliminary proceedings including a suppression hearing,stile pled guilty to robbery of a controlled substance from a pharmacy by use of a dangerous weapon,in violation of a and c.after conducting a sentencing hearing,the district court calculated stile advisory sentencing range under the united states sentencing guidelines,and,to be to months imprisonment based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of i.the district court sentenced stile to months of imprisonment.
at sentencing,the district court did three things that stile now claims were procedural error.first,the district court applied a enhancement to what would have otherwise been a total offense level of.the basis for the enhancement was a finding of obstruction of justice under.second,the district court denied stile requested reduction for acceptance of responsibility under a.third,the district court did not give the evidence of stile drug addiction the weight and effect that stile claims it warrants.we discuss in turn each of these asserted errors,plus stile catchall argument that his sentence was substantively unreasonable.
ii.discussion 
obstruction of justice 
the district court may apply a enhancement to a defendant offense level 
i f the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice with respect to the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction,and the obstructive conduct related to the defendant offense of conviction and any relevant conduct.
covered conduct includes threatening,intimidating,or otherwise unlawfully influencing a witness or attempting to do so.id.cmt.a.
in calculating stile guidelines sentencing range,the district court applied this enhancement for two independent reasons.first,the court found that stile had assaulted another inmate in an attempt to intimidate that inmate from testifying against stile.second,the court found that stile had committed perjury during a suppression hearing in december.stile challenges both findings,either of which is independently sufficient to sustain the enhancement.we begin and end by explaining why we see no cause to reverse the witness intimidation finding.
that finding arose out of stile incarceration prior to sentencing.a fellow inmate informed authorities that stile had confessed to having committed the robbery,relating many specific details that the inmate could not have made up.the government thereafter gave to stile a report of the informant allegations,excluding the informant name.just over a month later,a prison video camera captured stile assaulting the informant.authorities found in stile cell a copy of the report given to his counsel chronicling the information received from the inmate.for obvious reasons,the psr flagged this incident as warranting an obstruction of justice enhancement.
in stile sentencing memorandum,stile counsel previewed the prospect of an alternative motive for stile attack on the informant the inmate had supposedly made sexual advances toward stile.the memorandum acknowledged that there was an informant and that stile had learned as much.it also made no claim that anyone other than the inmate stile assaulted was the informant or that stile had related facts of the robbery to anyone other than the inmate he assaulted.rather,it challenged the adequacy of the government proof that stile knew that the inmate he assaulted was the informant because the report did not contain the informant name,and that the fight occurred because the inmate was a potential witness.
the district court commenced the sentencing hearing by explaining to stile that the court would hear from counsel and from you if you wish to speak to me.after receiving into evidence the psr and assorted exhibits including a video of the assault,the district court asked stile counsel,is there anything that you wish to present replied counsel no,sir.no evidence,only argument.defense counsel,consulting in the process with stile,then argued that the government evidence was insufficient to show obstruction.immediately after hearing this argument,the district court issued its findings,ruling that stile had assaulted the inmate to punish him for informing and to deter him from testifying and noting the absence of any actual evidence of a contrary motive 
after the court announced its ruling,stile lawyer stated that stile wished to reopen the evidence on the assault and give his own testimony.the court explained that stile request was a little late in the day,and that,typically,people put their evidence in front of the judge before he makes the decision,not after the judge makes the decision.stile attorney nevertheless asked that the court consider the request to be a motion to reconsider and to reopen the evidence.such a motion is directed to the court discretion.united states peterson,cir.generally,if the defendant wishes to testify at trial,he must do so before he rests his case otherwise,he can move the trial court to reopen the evidence,but the choice whether to reopen is left to the court sound discretion.
before ruling on that motion,the district court warned stile that if the court reopened the evidence to allow stile to testify belatedly and found that stile was not telling the truth,then stile would receive a harsher sentence.the court explained that it had already gone through the evidence,given stile counsel an opportunity to argue in his favor,and found the evidence against stile so strong that it would have made that same finding beyond a reasonable doubt had it needed to do so.the court indicated that stile would have a very,very difficult time convincing the court that he had not assaulted the inmate because the inmate had informed on him.after hearing of this potential downside to testifying,stile ultimately declined to testify.the court,in turn,relied on the finding of witness intimidation to support the enhancement for obstruction of justice.
stile does not argue that the foregoing record lacks sufficient support for the district court finding of witness intimidation.he argues,though,that the finding must be vacated because the district court prevented him from offering exculpatory evidence that would have cast his behavior in a different light and led an factfinder to a different conclusion.in this respect,stile says,the district court violated his due process rights and federal rule of criminal procedure by threatening him with a harsher sentence if he testified untruthfully during the sentencing hearing.stile did not raise this argument below so we review the court actions for plain error.united states,cir.to establish plain error,stile must show that the court below committed an error that the error was plain that the error affected the substantial rights of the defendant and that the error seriously affects the fairness,integri
