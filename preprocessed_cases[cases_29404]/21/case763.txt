in,defendant casey fisher was convicted by a federal jury of the use of facilities in interstate commerce in the commission of,and of solicitation of a crime of violence.fisher had hired an undercover government agent to kill a witness in a federal case against his brother,john.fisher was sentenced to serve months in prison.
fisher now appeals his convictions and sentence on a number of grounds.assisted by counsel,fisher argues that he is entitled to acquittal of the charge because the government failed to show that the planned murder was in violation of a state or federal law,as required by the federal statute.pro se,fisher makes an additional argument that the government failed to meet its burden on the charge,as well as arguments that trial errors require that we remand for a new trial and that errors at sentencing require that we vacate his sentence.we reject all claims of error and affirm his convictions and sentence.
on april,alain brousseau,a canadian truck driver,attempted to enter the united states at champlain,new york.authorities found approximately kilograms of hydroponic marijuana in brousseau truck and arrested him.brousseau agreed to cooperate with law enforcement,and later that day he performed a controlled delivery of the drugs to an auto repair shop in lakeville,massachusetts.
at the time,the repair shop was operated by fisher.george otero,a marijuana dealer from new hampshire,paid fisher to receive shipments of drugs at the garage,and most of the shipment delivered by brousseau was intended for otero.when brousseau arrived at the garage,fisher and his brother john helped him unload the drugs.when law enforcement agents moved in,fisher and his brother fled into the woods and escaped.
in october,john fisher was arrested and charged in federal court in new york with marijuana conspiracy.the following year,in august,fisher met with otero,who in the meantime had agreed to cooperate with the government.at that meeting,which was recorded,fisher discussed the pending charges against his brother and indicated that he believed the only evidence against john was brousseau testimony.fisher stated that he wanted to get rid of brousseau so that there was no evidence,and he stated that he had spoken with raymond aucoin about tak ing care of brousseau.
around the same time,fisher met with aucoin and asked him to kill brousseau.fisher stated that killing brousseau would keep him and his brother from going to prison.fisher told aucoin that he did not yet know brousseau name,but that he was trying to find out.several days later,fisher and aucoin met again,and fisher gave aucoin a piece of paper with brousseau name on it.
after his meetings with fisher,aucoin discussed the proposed murder with his wife and decided that he did not want to commit it.when aucoin relayed this decision to fisher,fisher told him to find somebody else who would.on september,aucoin,afraid of going to prison on pending charges and feeling in over his head,contacted police and reported that fisher had asked him to kill someone.thereafter,aucoin met with police and agreed to cooperate with law enforcement.aucoin then described for police what had happened with fisher and gave them the piece of paper with brousseau name on it.
on september,at the direction of law enforcement officers,aucoin met with fisher and told him that he had found a professional hit man who would kill brousseau.fisher and aucoin discussed the hit man price and how fisher would come up with the money.they also discussed whether the hit man would be able to get to brousseau,who was at that time in jail.this conversation was recorded.
on september,massachusetts state police sergeant michael grassia,posing as the hit man,met with fisher.the meeting was recorded.grassia told fisher that he could take care of the problem,and fisher responded that what i want to hear grassia told fisher that he needed fisher to put up half of his fee,as a showing of good faith.fisher stated that he was trying to get the money together,and that it might take him some time.he assured grassia,however,that he would get the required.
fisher was arrested four days later,on september.he was charged with using facilities in interstate or foreign commerce with the intent that a murder be committed in violation of state or federal law,in violation of a,and with solicitation to commit a crime of violence,in violation of.the particular crime of violence specified in the indictment was the murder of a cooperating federal witness.see a a 
on december,after a trial,a federal jury returned a verdict of guilty as to both counts.thereafter,fisher filed a motion for acquittal of both counts pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure.the motion raised,inter alia,two arguments concerning fisher conviction that the murder was intended to take place in canada and therefore did not violate any state or federal law,and that the government had failed to show that fisher had used any facility in interstate commerce,as required by a.on april,the district court denied the motion.
on december,fisher was sentenced to months imprisonment,to be followed by four years of supervised release,and a special monetary assessment of.
fisher primary argument is that the district court erred in denying his rule motion for acquittal of the charge because the government failed to show that brousseau murder would violate state or federal law.the federal statute,a,requires an intent that a murder be committed in violation of the laws of any state or the united states.fisher argues that a murder committed in canada does not violate state or federal law.within this broad argument,he also argues more narrowly that the government failed to introduce evidence as to what state or federal law would have been violated by brousseau murder.

fisher does not meet his burden here.the jury explicitly found that brousseau murder would have violated federal law.like the charge,the charge of solicitation to commit a crime of violence was based on the plan to kill brousseau.that second count charged that fisher did solicit a person to engage in a federal crime of violence,that is,to kill a cooperating federal witness,in violation of a a.the indictment was read to the jury,and the jury was instructed that the specific crime of violence in question was the killing of a cooperating federal witness.in finding fisher guilty on the solicitation count,the jury necessarily found that fisher intended that another person kill brousseau in violation of federal law,specifically a a.subsection h of specifically provides for extraterritorial federal jurisdiction.that the murder was to have taken place in canada is of no moment.
moreover,there was ample evidence to support the jury finding that fisher intended that brousseau be killed in violation of.fisher spoke to otero about the fact that brousseau was cooperating with law enforcement,and he talked repeatedly of his desire to have brousseau killed so that there would be no evidence against him or his brother john.
fisher briefly makes a related counseled argument that he could not have been convicted on the charge because the jury was not asked to make a special finding as to what state or federal law would have been violated by the planned murder.we bypass the potential waiver on appeal.see united states zannino,cir.fisher did not object to the jury instructions or verdict form,so we review for plain error.jones united states,d united states,cir.to satisfy the plain error standard,fisher must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.
fisher has not shown plain error here,either with respect to the instructions or the verdict form.the district court read to the jury the portion of the indictment charging that fisher intended that the murder be committed in violation of the laws of any state or the united states,as required by a,and the court instructed that the jury needed to find every element of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt.the jury supportably found that brousseau murder would have violated federal law,specifically,which precludes fisher from making out the fourth prong of a plain error showing.see united states cormier,cir.
fisher also raises a host of claims pro se.he argues that the evidence is not sufficient to sustain his conviction on the count because the government failed to prove the jurisdictional element of,that various errors at trial entitle him to a new trial,and that errors at sentencing require that we vacate his sentence.
sufficiency claim 
fisher argues that the district court erred in denying his rule motion for acquittal of the charge because no evidence presented at trial indicated that he used a telephone or cellular phone in interstate or foreign opposed to having used a facility of interstate or foreign charged.
at the time of fisher indictment and conviction,a defined as an element of the crime use of a facility in interstate or foreign commerce,while b defined a facility of interstate or foreign commerce as including means of communication.fisher argues that the use of the word in in a is significant.he urges that while the language use of a facility of interstate commerce encompasses intrastate usage of a telephone,the use of a facility in interstate commerce requires interstate or usage.fisher thus argues that the government was required to prove interstate or usage,and that it failed to do so 
fisher claim is really a claim of instructional error because it is premised on a reading of the statute that differs from the instruction given to the jury at trial,the district court instructed the jury that intrastate use of a telephone or cellular phone was all that the statute required.fisher did not object to this instruction and has not raised the issue of the instruction on appeal.at best,this instructional claim is subject to plain error review.jones,at.
as to the legal question,this circuit has not previously determined whether the version of a in effect at the time of fisher conviction requires the government to show interstate or activity,or whether intrastate usage of a means of communication such as a telephone will suffice.the other circuits to have ruled on the issue have held that a showing of intrastate usage of a requisite facility,such as a telephone,suffices.see united states perez,cir united states richeson,cir united states cope,cir united states marek,cir en banc.when congress revised a in to require use of a facility of interstate or foreign commerce,it titled the provision making the alteration clarification of definition.see intelligence reform and terrorism prevention act of,stat.the revision thus lends support to the interpretations of the second,fifth,sixth,and seventh circuits.
we need not decide the question here.there was no plain error there was not even any harm.see cormier,at see also neder united states,d collecting supreme court cases applying harmless error analysis to improper jury instructions on an element of an offense.there was evidence that when fisher was in maine,he called an individual by the name of norman ouimette at home and on his cell phone in an attempt to learn brousseau name.although there was no direct evidence as to where ouimette lived or where he was at that time,there was evidence that he was the canadian connection from whom otero and fisher got marijuana after a previous supplier had been arrested.moreover,during his testimony,otero referred to ouimette and others as the canadians in canada.there also was testimony by a government agent that ouimette was a canadian national and that he was charged in canada and vermont with the related drug trafficking conspiracy this evidence strongly supported the reasonable inference that ouimette lived in canada and was in canada when he spoke to fisher,and that fisher therefore made calls to contact him.the evidence was more than sufficient to sustain fisher conviction 
claims of trial error 
fisher raises three claims of trial error,each of which he says entitles him to a new trial.
fisher first argues that the government and the district court engaged in ex parte contact.this argument is based on a statement by the court,with which the government apparently agreed,that one of fisher friends had made threats on the life of a government witness.fisher infers that because there is no record of the prosecutor informing the court of these threats,the government must have engaged in ex parte contact with the court.
fisher next argues that the district court judge improperly admitted propensity evidence,as well as evidence whose probative value was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.see.id.b.this claim relates to various recordings in which fisher makes reference to unrelated drug trafficking activity,other criminal activity,and a murder investigation of which he was the target,and in which he uses the word nigger.
finally,fisher argues that the district court failed to provide a requested jury instruction on his theory of defense.see mathews united states,d.fisher states that his theory of defense was that his initial arrangement with aucoin did not involve payment for brousseau murder,but rather was conceived as an exchange of would murder brousseau,and later fisher would do a comparable favor for aucoin.fisher argues that such an exchange of favors does not violate the federal statute.see b united states frampton,cir.
we have reviewed all of fisher claims of trial error,and they are without merit.we comment very briefly.there is no evidence,only mere speculation,that the government and the district court engaged in ex parte contact,or that the district court was in any way biased against fisher.as to the recordings admitted at trial,early in the trial,the court granted fisher motion in limine to exclude those portions of the recordings that referenced the unrelated drug trafficking and murder investigation.the court thus did not permit the government to play those portions of the tapes for the jury on the fifth day of trial,however,the government sought to admit the full tapes into evidence.when asked whether he objected,fisher counsel stated that he consented to the admission of the tapes subject to his prior objection.there is no indication as to what counsel prior objection was,and we can not reasonably interpret the response to mean that counsel consented only to the admission of those portions of the tapes that already had been admitted into evidence even if we were to apply plain error review,see united states flemmi,cir,however,fisher does not prevail.the evidence against fisher,which included a recorded conversation in which he agreed to pay grassia to kill brousseau,was very strong.as a result,fisher can not demonstrate that the admission of the recordings referencing the unrelated drug trafficking and murder investigation seriously impaired the fairness of his trial see cormier,at.finally,whether or not fisher intended to pay aucoin with money or a favor,he agreed to pay grassia cash to kill brousseau.
claims of sentencing error 
as to the alleged errors at sentencing,fisher first argues that the district court improperly refused to consider his sentencing memorandum,which was not timely filed second,fisher argues that the district court improperly relied on the report,in violation of shepard united states,d,to determine that he had been serving a criminal justice sentence at the time of the offenses.third,fisher argues that the district court failed to rule on disputed issues as required by federal rule of criminal procedure.fourth,he asserts that the district court did not give meaningful consideration to the sentencing factors articu
