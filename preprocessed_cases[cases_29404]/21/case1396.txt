ivy woolf turk appeals the sentence imposed on her by the united states district court for the southern district of new york buchwald,after she pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud in violation of.the district court sentenced woolf turk principally to months imprisonment and ordered her to pay in restitution to the victims of the mortgage fraud she perpetrated.
on appeal,woolf turk main argument is that the district court,in applying the united states sentencing guidelines,erred in calculating the amount of loss that woolf turk fraud caused.specifically,she argues that the loss amount should be treated as zero because,at the time her fraud was discovered,there was still market value in the real property that purportedly collateralized the loans she had fraudulently obtained,and if that property had been sold before the collapse of the housing market,her victims could have been made whole.she also argues that the district court erred in finding that there were more than victims failing to conduct an individualized assessment of the factors in a and imposing a substantively unreasonable sentence.
for the reasons that follow,we emphatically reject woolf turk principal argument.we also find no merit in her other claims of error,and thus affirm her sentence.
background 
except where noted,the following facts are not disputed.woolf turk and her partner,michael hershkowitz,owned a real estate development company,the kingsland group,and several related entities collectively,kingsland.between and,woolf turk and hershkowitz persuaded approximately people,most of whom invested as individuals,to loan them a combined million,purportedly for purposes of renovating sixteen apartment buildings in upper manhattan,as well as the construction of another condominium in manhattan and the purchase of a home in nassau county.each loan required kingsland to make interest payments on a monthly basis,with repayment to be made in full between months and three years from the date of issuance.woolf turk and her partner told these individual investors that,as collateral for their loans,they would hold recorded first mortgages in the buildings.this was a lie.in truth,no mortgages were recorded for the individual investors hereinafter,the victims,and they to what they were led to believe when they agreed to invest with woolf creditors.woolf turk and hershkowitz also obtained loans from banks,and the liens securing those loans were recorded.
woolf turk fraud was brazen.for example,as she admitted in open court when she pleaded guilty,she spoke in by telephone with one of the victims,who lived in florida,and told her that her investment had been secured by a first mortgage on the properties and that the mortgage had been recorded as promised.at the time she made this statement,woolf turk knew that no mortgages had been recorded for the individual investors.she also admitted attending investors meetings in manhattan at which she made similar false statements.between april and may,kingsland began to default on the victims loans,making interest payments on those that had not yet matured but failing to repay the outstanding principal on those that had come due.when some of the victims became suspicious and asked kingsland to confirm that their mortgages had been recorded,woolf turk and hershkowitz forged a recording sheet from new york city automated city registration information system acris and sent it to one of the victims,along with reassurances that the mortgages were in first position and that i f anything were to happen to us,your group would own these properties and be able to refinance or sell them for an amount far greater than the amount of the mortgages.presentence report at.that investor,however,checked acris online and discovered that the acris sheet sent by woolf turk was bogus.
from there,the scheme inexorably unraveled.a group of the victims filed a civil action against kingsland in new york state court and obtained a lis pendens.only then did they discover that not only were their loans unrecorded,but as unsecured creditors their interests in the properties if any were secondary to the recorded interests of precise opposite of the priority of interest woolf turk and hershkowitz had assured them they possessed.what followed is unfortunate but not terribly surprising attempts at settlement of the civil case failed because kingsland could not promise the victims a substantial recovery of their investments,and,a day after woolf turk and hershkowitz were arrested on fraud charges,a hedge fund called real estate acquisitions,llc withdrew from its contemplated purchase of some of the buildings.kingsland went into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.all of its holdings were liquidated for approximately million,with million used to repay the secured interests of the banks and most of the remainder used to pay bankruptcy costs and fees,taxes,utilities,and regulatory expenses.to date,the bankruptcy trustee has been able to distribute a little more than half a million dollars to all of the unsecured creditors combined.the result is that the victims have lost nearly all of the aggregate million that they loaned to woolf turk.
the government commenced this criminal case with the filing of a sealed complaint in july.a superseding information filed in february charged woolf turk with a single count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and mail fraud,in violation of,and woolf turk pleaded guilty soon thereafter.there was no plea agreement,but in advance of the plea hearing the government sent woolf turk a pimentel stating that,in its view the base offense level was,pursuant to a a enhancement was warranted pursuant to b l because the loss amount was greater than million but not greater than million a increase was warranted pursuant to because the offense involved or more victims a increase was warranted pursuant to.a ii because the offense involved the use of an authentication feature namely,forged the recording sheet from acris that included the seal of the city of new york and purported to show that the nonexistent first mortgages had been recorded a reduction would be warranted for acceptance of responsibility and with the resulting offense level of and a criminal history category of i,an advisory guidelines range of to months imprisonment would result.after conducting a hearing in accordance with rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure and hearing woolf turk allocution to the basic facts of her fraud,the district court accepted her guilty plea.
the district court held a sentencing hearing in november.woolf turk argued,in an extensive presentation by counsel,that the foreseeable loss is the difference between the value of the properties on the day the fraud was found out and ceased.sent.tr.at.woolf turk view was as follows at the time the investors filed a civil suit and obtained a lis pendens against woolf turk and hershkowitz in may,the housing market was still stable enough that a deal could have been reached to cover her debts to both the institutional investors and the individual investors.in particular,defense counsel represented that by may,there had been an agreement in principle for to purchase kingsland uptown portfolio for million,which by defense counsel calculations would value the total real estate portfolio at million.counsel added that was open to the deal even after it learned of the fraud,and emphasized that whether or not that particular deal should have gone through,it served as a mechanism to show the court the value of the properties before the catastrophic events of later in the year and in the next year,the crash.id.at.thus,reasoned woolf turk counsel,it was the housing crash and other extrinsic factors that caused the individual investors loss,and not woolf turk.id.at.
a number of victims spoke at the sentencing hearing,explaining how woolf turk fraud had devastated their lives,some describing how their losses had left them without retirement savings or the ability to pay for health care or their children education.evan schwartz,who with his late father had invested million with woolf turk and hershko
