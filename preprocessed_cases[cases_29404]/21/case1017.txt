on september,a grand jury returned a indictment against defendants jerome capelton and gary white.the grand jury indicted white on nine counts of illicit drug activity,including one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine,one count of distribution and possession with intent to distribute cocaine powder,and seven counts of distribution and possession with intent to distribute cocaine base.capelton was also charged with the conspiracy count,and additionally indicted on three counts of actual distribution of cocaine base two of which were charged against white as well.
the district court denied capelton motions to suppress evidence and statements obtained by law enforcement,and sever the proceedings into separate trials for each defendant.the trial commenced on september.the proceedings were briefly halted in response to the events of september,but the trial resumed on september and concluded on september.after the case was submitted,the jury convicted the defendants of all counts in the indictment.the court sentenced capelton to a term of months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release,and sentenced white to a term of months and five years of supervised release.
the defendants filed timely appeals from their convictions and sentences,raising a plethora of challenges to the district court case management,evidentiary rulings,and sentencing determinations.after a careful review of the record,we find no basis for overturning the defendants convictions or vacating their sentences.
at trial,the government portrayed capelton and white as links in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine powder and cocaine base over the period from december,to august,the of the conspiracy were exposed in an elaborate sting operation orchestrated by undercover police officer alan fisher of the chicopee,massachusetts police department,and aided by the drug enforcement administration dea.fisher launched the operation by contacting christopher weeks,a cooperating informant with whom he had worked on several occasions in the past.weeks,who was incarcerated with white in the ludlow house of correction in,introduced the officer to white on december.over the conspiratorial period alleged in the indictment,fisher purchased cocaine from white on numerous occasions.on december,white sold fisher half an ounce of powder cocaine for.two weeks later,fisher purchased four ounces of crack cocaine for.fisher also arranged drug transactions with white on march,march,and may for one ounce of crack cocaine,ounces of crack cocaine,and five ounces of crack cocaine respectively.
white modus operandi was established from the early stages of the conspiracy.he acted strictly as a middleman,and kept no drugs,money,weapons,or drug paraphernalia on his person or in his residence.when fisher expressed an interest in purchasing a specified quantity of cocaine,white contacted various suppliers with whom he associated,obtained the requested quantity,and conveyed the drugs to fisher.capelton entered the conspiracy as white primary drug supplier after the may transaction.on june,capelton supplied white with ten ounces of crack cocaine that fisher purchased for.fisher purchased another worth of crack cocaine from capelton through white on july,and bought ounces of crack cocaine from the defendants on august.
after the august transaction,capelton purchased some gasoline for his car,picked up two passengers in a parking lot,and started driving south on route in connecticut.dea agents,who had been following capelton,contacted the connecticut state police and asked them to pull capelton over.they did so after he changed lanes without signaling,and the dea agents parked their cars behind the police cruiser.the police frisked capelton and found in marked bills matching those that detective fisher gave to white.after the dea agents informed capelton that they were going to seize that money,he followed them to the state police barracks to get a receipt for the funds.the agents did not arrest capelton until september.white was also arrested on september,while he was negotiating another cocaine sale with officer fisher.
the execution of the sting operation was controversial in two respects that are relevant to these appeals.first,white insisted that weeks coerced him into procuring drugs for fisher through threats,intimidation and harassing phone calls both to him personally and to his mother,who was living at a different address during the relevant period.although white conceded at trial that he had participated in each drug sale to fisher,he argued that he was the victim of unfair entrapment resulting from weeks tactics.the government efforts to counter white entrapment defense were complicated by its inability to locate christopher weeks and subpoena him as a witness.fisher admitted at trial that weeks recruitment of white was not choreographed or closely supervised by law enforcement officials,and white mother testified that weeks made repeated efforts to contact white by telephone.
the frequent malfunctioning of surveillance equipment over the course of the sting operation was also a source of dispute at trial.the participating law enforcement officers and agencies went to considerable lengths to both video and fisher encounters with white and capelton.however,equipment failures and quality control problems with the audio and visual recordings limited the probative value of those recordings,and forced the prosecution to rely heavily on the eyewitness accounts of the police officers and dea agents who conducted the surveillance.
we begin by addressing the objections raised jointly by both defendants,and conclude with an analysis of the challenges raised separately by each defendant.
a.the september tragedy 
on september,after opening statements,the district court informed the jurors of the events that had transpired in new york city and washington that morning,and suspended the proceedings because the courthouse in springfield was closed for security reasons.the courthouse remained closed the next day because of a bomb threat.when the defendants trial resumed on september,capelton and white immediately moved for a mistrial on two grounds.as a general matter,they asserted that the jurors would be unable to maintain their focus on their case given the chaos and uncertainty arising from the events of the previous two days.more importantly,counsel argued that the media portrayal of the attacks and the military response as a battle of good versus evil established a particularly prejudicial environment for defendants accused of committing evil acts.in counsels view,this prejudice was exacerbated by defendants reliance on a strategy of discrediting law enforcement officers and federal agents whose colleagues were perceived as heroes in the aftermath of the world trade center attacks.
a district court denial of a motion for mistrial is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states lee,cir united states,cir.in response to defendants request,the judge voir dired each juror individually,and excused the only juror who indicated that the september attacks might alter his attitude toward the case.the court also issued a lengthy instruction to the jury as a whole both before resuming the proceedings,and again at the close of the evidence.these instructions admonished the jurors that the events of september 
can not influence how you evaluate witnesses,and you may not permit these events to influence your deliberations or decision in any way.both the defendants and the public expect that you will fairly and impartially consider all the evidence in the case,follow the law as stated by the court and reach a just verdict.
the court proceeded with an abundance of caution in the wake of september.in the absence of particularized allegations of prejudice from defendants,we find no evidence that they were denied their sixth amendment right to an impartial jury,and accordingly conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants motion for a mistrial.
b.the government opening statement and closing argument 
in his opening statement,the prosecutor referred to white and capelton as drug dealer number one and drug dealer number three while describing a scene in front of white residence that he would later show to the jurors on videotape.the government also explained that defendant capelton voice was never caught on because he was a pretty clever drug dealer.
assuming arguendo that defendants properly preserved their objection to the prosecution opening remarks,we find no manifest abuse of discretion,united states mooney,cir,in the court refusal to grant a mistrial after the government opening statement.to prevail on this ground for a new trial,defendants must demonstrate that the prosecutor comments so poisoned the well that the trial outcome was likely affected.united states,cir.defendants allegations fall considerably short of this threshold.
it is true that a lawyer may not,in the presence of the trier of fact,state a personal opinion about the the guilt or innocence of an accused.restatement third of law governing lawyers.ideally,to preclude any argument of error,the prosecutor might have used the locution that the evidence will show that the defendants were drug dealers.such a locution avoids any suggestion that the prosecution is offering a personal opinion about the guilt of the defendants.however,the opening statement of the prosecution was preceded by the reminder from the trial judge that 
the words of counsel are not evidence,and if there any difference between this prediction of what the evidence will show and what you actually hear from the witness stand,you of course are to be guided by and consider only evidence as it comes in through the testimony of the witnesses or other documents or exhibits in the case.
in fact,the government introduced substantial evidence proving that capelton and white were drug dealers.under these circumstances,even if the prosecution conclusory references to drug dealers could be deemed inappropriate expressions of opinion on guilt an issue we do not decide,those references did not unfairly inflame or prejudice the jury against the defendants.
capelton also alleges that the government inflamed the jury by misrepresenting statements made by his counsel during closing argument.while commenting on inconsistencies in the testimony of the two police officers who stopped capelton car on august,his attorney recalled one officer testimony that only one child was in the backseat of capelton car when he was pulled over by the connecticut state police 
now,everybody else said two,every officer said two.let assume that it two,he remembers one.why does he remember one because he lost his police report.how does that bear on other testimony because all the officers that testified rely on other people reports.
the prosecutor apparently understood capelton attorney to say that all the officers that testified will lie on other people reports,and argued to that effect in his rebuttal to the defendants closing arguments.capelton immediately objected to that statement and requested a mistrial.on appeal,he claims that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor attribution of those comments to his attorney.
we apply abuse of discretion review to a district court refusal to grant a mistrial on the basis of an inappropriate remark by the prosecution in its closing argument.united states hernandez,cir.here,capelton does not claim that the government intentionally misrepresented defense counsel statements,or otherwise acted in bad faith.while the transcript produced on appeal contains the word rely,even the court was unable to discern what capelton attorney actually said.nevertheless,the judge issued the following curative instruction to the jury 
first of all,as you heard the closings i believe newhouse the prosecutor made reference to his recollection of a statement made during black closing.his recollection of this statement was that black said,all officers will lie on other officer reports.during the break i wanted to make sure you understand that black recollection of what he said,and his intent was to say,all the officer rely on other officer reports.i passed that on to you so that you will know it,but remind you again that it your recollection of what is said that controls,not mine or the attorneys recollection of what was said.
this corrective instruction refutes any argument that the district court abused its discretion in denying the request for a mistrial.
defendant capelton claims 
motion to sever 
capelton moved the district court for a severance after white disclosed in a hearing that he would be presenting a defense of entrapment.anticipating that white would implicitly concede his participation in the course of presenting this defense,capelton argued that white entrapment defense would undermine his own strategy of denying participation in the conspiracy and putting the government to its proof.
we review the denial of a severance motion for manifest abuse of discretion.united states deleon,cir,cert.denied,d.capelton acknowledges on appeal that the standard for severance is a strict one and the defendant must show that he could not have received a fair trial.indeed,we have previously recognized the general rule that defendants charged in the same indictment should be tried together,united states houle,cir,cert.denied,d,and expressed reluctance to reverse a denial of severance where the defenses at issue are only somewhat antagonistic,united states serafino,cir,and not so irreconcilable as to involve fundamental disagreement over core and basic facts,united states,cir internal quotations omitted.
without elaborating at pointless length,we conclude that capelton skeletal argument for reversal on this ground is unavailing in light of his failure to point to any specific testimony at trial that prejudiced his own defense,and the court explicit instruction to the jury that 
you must consider the counts and the defendants separately.white and capelton are charged with several different counts in the indictment.the counts,and the defendants,have been joined for trial.however,the counts and the defendants must be considered separately.
motion to suppress 
at on august,connecticut state troopers jeffrey campbell and john tollis received a cell phone call in their police cruiser from a federal surveillance team monitoring capelton movements.dea agents provided the officers with a description of capelton vehicle,and informed the troopers that the defendant was traveling south on interstate,having just left the scene of a drug transaction in springfield.the officers positioned their vehicle behind capelton,and pulled the defendant over after observing him switch lanes without using his turn signal.a pat frisk of the defendant revealed a large wad of money in his front pocket that matched,upon examination,the serial numbers of the buy money that fisher had earlier used to purchase crack cocaine from white.because the government surveillance tapes failed to record capelton actually exchanging drugs for money,the marked bills found on defendant person were the linchpin of the government circumstantial case against capelton.
not surprisingly,capelton argues on appeal that the district court erred when it denied his motion to suppress this physical evidence.we will review this claim by considering whether the connecticut state police had sufficient cause,apart from the traffic violation to stop capelton vehicle and whether they had probable cause to search his person and to seize the serialized money.
our review of the ultimate determinations of probable cause and reasonable suspicion on a motion to suppress is de novo.review of subsidiary factual findings is for clear error.united states scott,cir citations omitted.the connecticut state police needed an articulable and reasonable suspicion that capelton was engaged in criminal activity to justify a terry stop of his car.united states trueber,cir upholding a terry stop of a pickup truck.while this involves more than a mere hunch,terry ohio,d,the level of suspicion required for a terry stop is obviously less demanding than for probable cause.alabama white,d.
detective fisher detailed testimony during the pretrial evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress recounted the dea agents close surveillance of capelton before,during and after the august drug transaction.the knowledge may be imputed from the dea agents to the state police who actually effectuated the stop under the fellow officer rule.united states winchenbach,cir t he focus is upon the collective knowledge possessed by,and the aggregate information available to,all the officers involved in the investigation.in a case very similar to this one,we concluded that there was no doubt that the police were justified under terry in stopping the defendant vehicle after observing him sell drugs to an undercover officer,united states schiavo,cir,and we reach the same conclusion here.the police observed capelton engage in illegal drug sales and then pulled him over.as was the case in schiavo,there is no doubt that the terry stop was justified.
the next inquiry is whether the officers warrantless search of capelton front pocket and their seizure of the serialized currency was justified.while it would have been permissible for the police to search capelton car incident to the stop,t he search of one person is more intrusive on the rights protected by the fourth amendment than the search of an automobile.schiavo,at.therefore,we will only uphold the search if the police demonstrated that they had probable cause and that exigent circumstances justified the search in the absence of a warrant.
we can easily dismiss the second factor.the district court concluded that the officers did not need a warrant to conduct this search in light of the exigent circumstance that capelton was mobile at the time the police developed probable cause.this created a risk that the evidence would be spirited away,florida white,d,if the officers delayed the search until a proper warrant could be secured.on appeal,capelton does not question the existence of exigent circumstances.thus,we will confine our review to the issue of probable cause.
probable cause for a search can be demonstrated by facts and circumstances sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that he was observing criminal activity and the fruits of criminal activity.united states ferrara,cir quoting carroll united states.the district court felt that the police surveillance on august provided sufficient probable cause to execute the search 
the defendant was positively identified by two officers,both of whom had an ample opportunity to observe him and who had seen him on previous occasions.further,he was identified by gary white as the source of the drugs,and the pattern of activity clearly indicated that it was the defendant who provided white with the crack cocaine given the undercover agent that day.
teams of surveillance agents continuously followed capelton after the sale.other than getting out to pump his gas,he did not leave the car between the time of the sale and when he was stopped by the officers.therefore,the police were justified in believing that the fruit of his criminal activity,the serialized currency,was in his possession.this belief provided them with sufficient probable cause to justify the search.
hearsay statements of admitted under rule d e 
federal rule of evidence d e excludes from the category of hearsay statement s by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.d e.as a predicate for admitting evidence under this rule,the trial court must conclude that it is more likely than not that the declarant and the defendant were members of a conspiracy when the hearsay statement was made,and that the statement was in furtherance of the conspiracy.united states petrozziello,cir.in our circuit,this determination is referred to as a petrozziello ruling.significantly,the trial court is not required to decide the petrozziello question prior to admitting hearsay statements under rule d e,but may admit the statement s provisionally,subject to its final petrozziello determination at the close of all the evidence.united states isabel,cir.generally,we review the trial court determination that statements were coconspirator statements under the clear error standard.united states marino,cir citing united states,cir.this deferential standard of review places a heavy burden on a defendant seeking to overturn a trial court petrozziello ruling.reich newspapers of new england,cir.
in united states sepulveda,cir,we held that a coconspirator statement,standing alone,is insufficient to meet the preponderance standard of rule d e a dmitting the statement into evidence requires some extrinsic proof of the declarant involvement in the conspiracy.id.at.capelton unpersuasively argues that the government failed to produce any extrinsic proof linking the.marked bills from the august,transaction between fisher and white were found on capelton person when he was arrested.the record also indicates that surveillance videos introduced by the government depict capelton arriving at white residence,and show white walking back and forth between fisher car and capelton car during the july and august drug transactions.this evidence easily satisfies the extrinsic proof requirement of sepulveda,and we accordingly find no clear error in the district court petrozziello ruling 
sentencing 
capelton claims that the district court erroneously denied him a downward departure under of the united states sentencing guidelines,and argues that this provision allows for a downward departure for unusual family circumstances.at capelton sentencing hearing,the court took note that the defendant grew up with drug addicted parents,and was forced to live on the streets and provide for his younger brother from the time he was twelve years old.the court commented that it had rarely encountered a childhood as horrendous as this,and acknowledged that the defendant situation,as he was growing up,was almost unimaginably difficult.
the judge nonetheless rejected capelton motion for a downward departure,citing the defendant extensive criminal background and his failure to take advantage of numerous opportunities to rehabilitate himself i am persuaded that the defendant has had an awfully large number of bites of the apple and,unfortunately,this is the time when the chickens come home to roost u nfortunately,i do think there any basis for downward departure in this case.
our prior jurisprudence establishes that we lack jurisdiction to review a discretionary decision not to depart from the sentencing guidelines.united states mejia,cir see united states louis,cir.we may review a sentencing court conclusion that it does not have legal authority to depart from the sentencing guidelines,mejia,at however,the court recognized that it had such authority here.therefore,we will not review the court discretionary decision.
defendant white claims 
entrapment 
the entrapment defense protects an otherwise citizen who,if left to his own devices,likely would have never run afoul of the law.jacobson united states,d.as we have previously noted entrapment is called a defense,but it is settled that once the defendant has made a threshold showing,the burden shifts to the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt either that there was no undue government pressure or trickery or that the defendant was predisposed.united states acosta,cir.since this is a disjunctive test,the entrapment defense fails if the government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt either that it did not improperly induce the illegal activity or the defendant was otherwise predisposed.see,mathews united states,d united states gendron,cir.white claims that there was insufficient evidence to prove either the absence of improper inducement or predisposition.we disagree with both contentions given the disjunctive nature of the test,we can fulfill our appellate function by elaborating our disagreement on either inducement or predisposition.we choose to focus on inducement.
as we held in gendron,inducement means more than simply organizing a sting operation and giving the defendant the opportunity to commit a crime.gendron,at.see also united states gifford,cir neither mere solicitation nor the creation of opportunities to commit an offe
