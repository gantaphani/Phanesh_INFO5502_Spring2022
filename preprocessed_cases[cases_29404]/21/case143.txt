elvin torres estrada pleaded guilty on march,to two conspiracies.one was a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute controlled substances within feet of public housing,between about and.that conspiracy was charged on september,with a second superseding indictment filed on april.the second conspiracy was to import five kilograms or more of cocaine and one kilogram or more of heroin from the dominican republic,between about march and july.that conspiracy was charged later,on february.
there is no need for an extensive discussion of facts.we give only a brief overview to explain the context for the issues of law.at the time of the indictment and second superseding indictment,torres estrada was a fugitive.on june,torres estrada was arrested and ordered temporarily detained.attorneys raymond granger and edward sapone filed a motion to appear pro hac vice on behalf of torres and represented him at a july,bail hearing along with local counsel zelma dávila carrasquillo.on july,a local puerto rico attorney,ramón garcía garcía garcía,filed a notice to appear as counsel on behalf of torres estrada along with dávila carrasquillo,granger,and sapone.torres estrada says that his counsel did not actually coordinate their representation.
after granger and sapone received a plea offer on september,from assistant united states attorney timothy henwood,plea negotiations ensued with granger,sapone,and garcía representing torres estrada.according to granger,garcía interfered with negotiations by,inter alia,making a counteroffer for a sentence lower than what torres estrada had authorized,and communicating with the government without consulting with granger or sapone.on october,granger,sapone,and dávila carrasquillo withdrew from representing torres estrada.granger and sapone motion to withdraw stated that they were lead counsel and that torres estrada has advised us that he no longer wishes to utilize the services of our respective firms and has requested that we move to withdraw as counsel of record.
plea negotiations over the indictment as to the first conspiracy failed,with negotiations being cut off by the government when it realized torres estrada was involved with the second conspiracy to import drugs from the dominican republic.that conspiracy had been charged on february,and it is clear the government cut off negotiations sometime before then.the march plea agreement,which led to this appeal,covered both conspiracies.torres estrada was sentenced to months of imprisonment for the conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute various controlled substances,concurrent with a sentence of months of imprisonment imposed for the importation conspiracy.
torres estrada makes two arguments here on direct appeal.the first is that he is entitled to the benefit of the government plea offer made in the first round of negotiations,though he had not accepted that offer.in his brief,torres estrada argues that he is the victim of ineffective assistance from garcía during plea negotiations and that granger and sapone had a conflict of interest.missouri frye,d lafler cooper,d.the latter part of this argument was modified at oral argument.see infra note.the other argument is that the district court judge was required to recuse himself.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
torres estrada executed a waiver of appeal as part of his march,plea agreement.the waiver states the defendant hereby agrees that if this honorable court accepts this agreement and sentences him according to its terms and conditions,defendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the conviction and sentence in this case.we find that he has waived his appeal of the ineffective assistance of counsel iac claim 
as an initial matter,torres estrada failed to address the waiver of appeal clause in his opening brief,which would ordinarily be enough to enforce that waiver.see united states arroyo blas,cir.in his reply brief,torres estrada first implies that he was caught by surprise in learning that the government would attempt to enforce the waiver that was because as of october,it was the written policy of the department of justice doj not to enforce waivers of appeal involving iac claims under certain conditions.the memorandum to which torres estrada refers states,in relevant part,that f or cases in which a defendant ineffective assistance claim would be barred by a previously executed waiver,prosecutors should decline to enforce the waiver when defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance resulting in prejudice or when the defendant ineffective assistance claim raises a serious debatable issue that a court should resolve.
the government,in turn,correctly reminds us that such a policy,promulgated after the plea agreement in this case,creates no rights in defendants and that courts typically play no role in the prosecutorial choices made by the doj.see,united states craveiro,cir.
torres estrada next points to the district court statement at sentencing that he could appeal the iac issue.torres estrada does not argue that he was not fully advised of the waiver of appeal clause when entering his plea.the district court judge statement at sentencing,made nearly four years after torres estrada guilty plea,does not serve to invalidate torres estrada earlier waiver.sotirion united states,cir.interpretation of the waiver of appeal clause is for the court of appeals,and the district court comments,at least under these circumstances,do not excuse torres estrada from compliance with the agreement he signed.see united states gil quezada,cir united states teeter,cir.
torres estrada attempts to use sotirion to argue that the government waived any argument that the waiver of appeal clause can be enforced,based on the government failure to respond to the district court statement at sentencing.we reject the argument.in sotirion,the court discussion of government waiver related to the government failure to raise a procedural default defense to a petition in the district court.at.sotirion held that the government waived the procedural default argument and then reached the merits of the waiver of appeal argument.id.at.as torres estrada attempted direct appeal here does not come to us on review of a petition and the question of government waiver in sotirion is distinct from what is before us,we decline to extend sotirion holding.
and so,torres estrada is left with an argument that his assertions meet the miscarriage of justice exception to enforcement of waivers of appeal,as discussed in teeter.at.however,torres estrada explicitly says that he is not challenging his sentence or his guilty plea or the rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure inquiry at all,and that he is not seeking to vacate his guilty plea.further,other than pointing to the doj policy and the district court statements at sentencing arguments that we have just rejected develops no argument explaining how a miscarriage of justice would result from enforcing the waiver of appeal clause.
in any event,we can not conclude that there would be a miscarriage of justice from enforcing the waiver of appeal clause because even if we did not enforce the waiver of appeal clause,we would decline to hear torres estrada claims on direct appeal.the record underlying torres estrada arguments is not sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of an ineffective assistance claim,and this is not the rare case where we will review an ineffective assistance claim on direct appeal.united states laplante,cir see united states santiago rivera,cir explaining that our general rule is that iac claims must originally be presented to the district court as a collateral attack under quoting united states colón torres,cir united states mala,cir we have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that claims of ineffective assistance can not make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions,but,rather,must originally be presented to,and acted upon by,the trial court.
finally,we reject the argument that the district court judge erred when he denied torres estrada motion to recuse.torres estrada argues that at least one between the district cou
