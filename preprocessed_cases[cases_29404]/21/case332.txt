the district court found that the defendant had obstructed justice by lying to federal agents and others in order to protect his girlfriend.using this finding as a fulcrum,the court applied a sentencing enhancement.the enhancement contributed to a stiffer sentence,which the defendant now appeals.
while some may admire the defendant misplaced gallantry,shading the truth in the course of a criminal investigation,whether or not under oath,is a matter of considerable consequence.where,as here,the defendant mendacity was material and significantly impeded the investigation and prosecution of his criminal conduct,a sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice is a fitting response.consequently,we uphold the imposition of the enhancement and affirm the resulting sentence.
we start with the travel of the case.on june,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of maine returned a indictment against william quirion and his girlfriend,sherri mancos.the indictment charged the defendant with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute count and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon count after some preliminary skirmishing not relevant here,the defendant pleaded guilty to both counts without any plea agreement.
in due course,the district court convened the disposition hearing.after taking testimony,the court made a series of findings.it set the base offense level at,see ussg a a,and then applied three enhancements,see id.b a offense involving three or more firearms id.b b possession of firearms in connection with another felony offense id.obstruction of justice.pairing the adjusted offense level with the defendant criminal history category v yielded a guideline sentencing range of months.the court proceeded to impose an month term of immurement.this timely appeal followed.
the sole issue on appeal is whether the sentencing court erred in applying the enhancement for obstruction of justice.to impose such an enhancement,a sentencing court must supportably find that the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice with respect to the investigation,prosecution,or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction.id.m aking false statements,not under oath,to law enforcement officers,without more,will not trigger the enhancement.id,comment.b.the enhancement is triggered,however,if a defendant provid ed a materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense.id,comment.g.

in the case at hand,the lower court found that the defendant obstructed justice by making materially false statements to law enforcement officers and others,which statements significantly impeded the government ongoing investigation and later prosecution of the defendant criminal conduct.to put this finding into perspective,we must rehearse the relevant facts.
the record reflects that on february,federal agents investigating a marijuana distribution operation executed a search warrant at a residence shared by the defendant and mancos in caribou,maine.the search turned up kilograms of marijuana,drug paraphernalia,and four firearms.the firearms included a winchester model rifle,a new england firearms pardner model shotgun,and a cbc imported by fie miami fl gauge model shotgun the long guns.the fourth firearm was a davis industries model d auto chrome derringer handgun.
the agents arrested the defendant on the spot.they interviewed him on three occasions.we summarize the pertinent portions of those interviews.
the first interview took place at the time of the search.this audience focused on the marijuana trafficking,and the defendant admitted his participation in that enterprise.
the agents conducted the second interview in july of.on that occasion,the defendant made unsolicited statements about the long guns among other things,he declared that he had inherited the three long guns after his father death some years earlier.following a string of burglaries,he retrieved the inherited firearms from his mother house.
the third interview took place a month later.the defendant reiterated that he had inherited the long guns from his father.he added that,after taking physical possession of them,he kept them at a friend home near monson pond he brought them home,however,roughly a month before his arrest because of burglaries in the monson pond neighborhood.
we from the three interviews to the hearing,held on august.during the plea colloquy,the defendant affirmed that he had inherited the long guns from his father.
the defendant story,relatively straightforward to this point,changed dramatically after he received and reviewed the presentence investigation report the psi report.in his objections to the psi report,the defendant asserted for the first time that he had gotten the three long guns not through inheritance but,rather,in a pawn transaction that took place in.he admitted that this account contradicted the statements that he had repeatedly made to the agents during the serial interviews.he explained that he had concocted the apocryphal tale about a fictitious inheritance because he did not want to implicate the person who had pawned the guns.
further details began to emerge.in connection with defense counsel preparation of a sentencing memorandum,a defense investigator henry dusenbery spoke with the defendant.the defendant told dusenbery that,in late,the guns were pawned by one dennis daly.in the pawn transaction,he allegedly received the three long guns as collateral for a loan.
dusenbery attempted to confirm this account.he spoke with the defendant sister,who verified that the defendant did not inherit the long guns.dusenbery also interviewed daly,who acknowledged that he had given two of the long guns to mancos as collateral for a loan.
at the disposition hearing,the district court heard testimony from various witnesses,including dusenbery and daly.dusenbery testified as to what his investigation had disclosed.daly testified that he had given mancos two guns the winchester and the shotgun as collateral for a loan daly gave these guns to mancos at the residence that she shared with the defendant.daly made it pellucid that the pawn transaction was between him and mancos,but he could not recall whether the defendant was present when he transferred the collateral.
at the conclusion of the evidentiary presentation,the district court,lauding daly credibility,accepted his version of the pawn transaction.the court further found that the defendant told the government agents twice and erroneously in the summer of that those were guns that he received from his deceased father,and that was a lie.the court noted that the defendant misled dusenbery as well,mischaracterizing the pawn transaction in an apparent attempt to protect mancos.the court concluded that the defendant has,from the outset of this investigation,deliberately and continually attempted to mislead the investigation as to the true facts involving the pawning of those guns and that the defendant mendacity significantly impaired the government investigation and prosecution of the case.the court therefore found him liable for obstruction of justice.
credibility determinations made at sentencing are peculiarly within the province of the district court and will rarely be disturbed on appeal.see united states cyr,cir.this principle is the starting point for our appraisal of the district court findings.
