christopher mullins appeals his conviction and sentence for conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine,in violation of.a.he presses three primary arguments on appeal the record lacks sufficient evidence to convict him of the charged conspiracy the district court plainly erred in instructing the jury on the conspiracy charge and the district court clearly erred in calculating the drug quantity attributable to mullins.finding all three arguments unpersuasive,we affirm the conviction and the sentence in all respects.
background 
a.the evidence 
because mullins challenges the sufficiency of the evidence after a jury found him guilty,we view the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states adorno molina,wl,at cir.
in september,maine drug enforcement agency mdea agents investigated a drug trafficking organization operating out of ohio street in bangor,maine.the leaders of this organization shipped crack and powder cocaine from the new york city area to maine via greyhound bus.as part of the investigation,mdea agents,using a confidential informant ci conducted a controlled purchase of worth of powder cocaine from mullins.ci wore a body wire an electronic transmitting device that transmits all audio within earshot.after ci arrived at mullins apartment,mullins called the ohio street organization.during the call,mullins mentioned someone named bullet,a member of the organization.
shortly after mullins called,a green lexus pulled up to his apartment.fish,another member of the organization,came inside mullins apartment.mullins and fish met alone for about two minutes,and then fish left.mullins then handed ci eight bags of powder cocaine.ci had purchased ten bags,but only received eight,because mullins kept two as a fee.
two months later,on november,mdea agents arrested mullins.on that same day,they searched ohio street and an apartment located on garland street also used by the conspirators to store drugs,seizing approximately grams of crack from the garland street location.after receiving miranda warnings,mullins provided mdea agents with a recorded statement,during which he communicated the following he started working for the members of the organization to whom he referred as the dominicans in november.by june,he had four or five customers to whom he regularly sold crack and powder cocaine.mullins reported that he purchased from the dominicans,on average,worth of crack and powder cocaine per week,and,on occasion,as much as in a single night he would resell the drugs for his own profit,either by taking some portion of the sale,as he did in the controlled purchase,or by reselling at a higher price.mullins referred to himself as a runner for the dominicans.he also said that there were times when customers would try to purchase drugs directly from the dominicans,but the dominicans would tell them,no,go see chris mullins.
trial and sentencing 
a grand jury indicted mullins for conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and more than grams of cocaine base from september through november.at trial,the key evidence against him was his own statement to the mdea agents,the testimony of ci,and the testimony of pari proffitt,a roommate of the dominicans.proffitt testified that percent of the sales made by the ohio street organization were crack,and that mullins was a frequent purchaser.a law enforcement officer testified that a runner is a middleman,a the larger dealer and the typical user.a jury convicted mullins after the trial.
at sentencing,the district court ultimately held mullins responsible for grams of crack.the court conservatively calculated that mullins worked for his suppliers for only ten weeks,from june until the end of september subtracting weeks when he was out of town.the court found that he bought about worth of drugs per week,percent of which was crack.the court found that crack goes for approximately a gram,and that mullins kept percent of the purchases for himself.the court did not hold mullins accountable for the estimated percent of his sales that were cocaine,because both parties agreed that it would have no effect on the applicable sentencing range.based on a base offense level of and criminal history category vi,the district court determined that the guideline sentencing range was months.c id.ch,pt.a.the district court sentenced mullins to months in prison.
ii.analysis 
sufficiency of evidence 
mullins contends that the evidence was so lacking that it at best showed he was a frequent purchaser of crack and cocaine an addict who independently resold drugs to sustain his habit.we review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo.united states rosado pérez,cir.we draw all reasonable inferences in the prosecution favor.id.if a reasonable jury could find mullins guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of all elements of the charged offense,we must affirm the conviction.id.
to establish guilt on a conspiracy charge,the government must prove that an agreement existed to commit the underlying substantive offense,and that the defendant elected to join the agreement,intending that the underlying offense be committed.united states gómez rosario,cir internal quotation marks omitted.mullins own statement was more than enough to support a finding that he was,as he put it,a runner for the ohio street organization,rather than just a user who independently resold drugs on his own.mullins argues that his concession that he was a runner is nebulous.perhaps.but any ambiguity would seem to be irrelevant,since it matters only that he had a role in the conspiracy,and not that the role be some particular type of runner.moreover,the remainder of mullins statement fleshed out further details that amply supported a finding that he was a member of the conspiracy that operated out of ohio street he obtained on average worth of crack per week,and some of his retail customers were referred to him by the organization leaders.in short,he described himself in substance as a knowing and regular retail middleman for his suppliers see united states boidi,cir continuing purchase and sale relationship along with upstream dealer knowledge of defendant redistribution permits a jury to infer agreement that defendant possess and distribute drugs to advance common conspiratorial goal united states moran,cir.the details of the sale to ci,and evidence that mullins called the organization order number times in four months added further substantial support for the jury conclusion.in short,the evidence was more than sufficient to support the verdict 
jury instructions 
mullins argues that the district court should have sua sponte provided additional jury instructions on the principles of separate conspiracies.mullins failed to object below,so we review only for plain error.united states colon,cir.plain error requires mullins to meet a heavy burden of showing that an error occurred that was clear or obvious that the error affected his substantial rights and that the error also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
mullins is correct that a defendant charged with a conspiracy is entitled to an instruction that he must be convicted of the conspiracy charged,and not another conspiracy that might be supported by the evidence,whenever the evidence would support a finding of an illicit conspiracy other than the one charged.united states díaz,cir.but the district court did provide such an instruction.in pertinent part,the district court instructed that 
for you to find mullins guilty of conspiracy,you must be convinced that the government has proved each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt first,that the agreement specified in the indictment,and not some other agreement or agreements,existed between at least two people to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base and,second,that the defendant willfully joined in that agreement.
t he government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that those who were involved shared a general understanding about the crime.mere similarity of conduct among various people or the fa
