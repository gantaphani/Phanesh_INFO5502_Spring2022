roberto francisco appeals his conviction and sentence for conspiring to possess cocaine and heroin with the intent to distribute.we affirm.
the events leading to garcía conviction took place in october.early in the month,the united states customs service,with the help of a confidential informant,infiltrated a drug smuggling enterprise,operating out of maarten,headed by an individual named tocayo.the confidential informant,a shipping captain,worked with tocayo to transport a large shipment of drugs to puerto rico and deliver it to distributors located on the island.
later in the month,one of tocayo distributors contacted the informant and arranged to meet in the food court of a shopping mall to discuss the logistics for transferring the narcotics.attending this meeting were garcía,who was introduced as el viejo,an individual named javier,the confidential informant,and an undercover customs service agent named luis carmona.at this meeting,the informant stated that the drugs would arrive in puerto rico the next day.javier and garcía told carmona and the informant that they had brought a dodge caravan in which they planned to deliver the drugs.the participants agreed to effectuate the transfer at the plaza carolina shopping center in carolina,puerto rico.garcía turned the caravan keys over to carmona.
the next day customs service agents seized the drugs and arranged a controlled delivery to garcía.two days later,carmona drove the caravan,containing a sham load of the seized narcotics,to the shopping center parking lot where he met garcía and another individual named domingo peña.at the mall,carmona gave the caravan keys to garcía,who passed them on to peña to drive the caravan.garcía followed closely behind in his car.a few minutes later,garcía stopped at a restaurant and was arrested.
garcía raises three main issues on appeal.first,he argues that the district court abused its discretion by permitting the government to open its case with overview testimony from the agent heading the investigation.second,he claims that the district court improperly permitted this same agent to provide expert testimony on the structure and operation of a typical drug smuggling and distribution conspiracy.finally,he contends that the district court committed clear error by applying a adjustment in calculating his sentence.
overview testimony 
the government first witness was special agent yariel ramos,the customs service agent in charge of the investigation.to open his testimony,ramos stated the investigation ultimate conclusion that garcía was the recipient of the narcotics,the distributor.ramos then provided an overview of the investigation.during this overview,ramos described several events about which he had personal knowledge.in addition,he provided a summary of a conversation,at which he was not present,between the informant and tocayo in which the informant agreed to transport the drugs to puerto rico.
garcía contends that ramos overview testimony undermined the fairness of the trial because it permitted the jury to draw an inference of guilt before the jury heard from a witness with personal knowledge.we agree that the portions of ramos testimony which were not based on personal knowledge should have been excluded at least at the stage of trial.but we also conclude that this error was harmless.
we recently criticized the prosecutorial practice of opening a case by calling a government agent as an overview witness 
the use of overview testimony is inherently problematic such testimony raises the very real specter that the jury verdict could be influenced by statements of fact or credibility assessments in the overview but not in evidence.there is also the possibility that later testimony might be different than what the overview witness assumed objections could be sustained or the witness could change his or her story.overview testimony by government agents is especially problematic because juries may place greater weight on evidence perceived to have the imprimatur of the government.

portions of ramos testimony constitute the sort of testimony that we criticized in casas and mazza.ramos was allowed to testify that garcía was a member of the drug conspiracy,even though the prosecution had not yet introduced evidence supporting this conclusion.see casas,at concluding that it was error to permit agent to testify that,based on the government investigation,the defendant was a member of a drug organization before evidence to this effect had been admitted.further,ramos provided a summary of the informant conversation with tocayo,even though the informant did not testify,and ramos was not present for this conversation.see mazza,at concluding that it was error to allow government agent to summarize informant conversations with defendant.thus,the prosecution was able to use ramos hearsay testimony as a substitute for calling the informant.hearsay does not become admissible merely because it is provided by a government agent in the form of an overview of the evidence.see casas,at.
nevertheless,while this testimony should have been excluded,its admission was harmless in this case.in this case,the admission of improper testimony is harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.see united states piper,cir.the government bears the burden of establishing harmless error.see united states rose,cir.the harmless error inquiry is.among other factors,it requires consideration of the centrality of the tainted evidence,its uniqueness,its prejudicial impact,the use to which the evidence was put,and the relative strengths of the parties cases.see united states sepulveda,cir.
the admissible evidence against garcía clearly established his participation in the charged conspiracy.the most damning testimony came from agent carmona.carmona described,in detail,his initial meeting with garcía and javier,in the shopping mall food court,where the parties planned to transfer the narcotics to garcía.he testified that during this meeting javier referred to tocayo as the supplier of the drugs and garcía claimed that he was responsible for the shipment.carmona also testified that garcía provided him with the keys to the caravan in which he was to deliver the drugs.
carmona testimony was corroborated by ramos,who observed the meeting from across the food court.through ramos properly admitted testimony,the government introduced several photographs of garcía meeting with the informant and carmona.
carmona also described garcía participation in the transfer of the drugs at the plaza carolina shopping mall.during this encounter,garcía asked carmona if he had spotted any police in the area and explained that they had to avoid unexpected encounters with law enforcement.after assuring garcía that he had not seen any police,carmona gave garcía the caravan keys and told him the location of the vehicle.garcía then told carmona that,on leaving the mall,they should walk in opposite directions.
ramos,who was part of the surveillance team following the caravan,testified that,after leaving the mall,garcía gave the keys to peña,who drove the caravan while garcía followed behind in a toyota corolla.as further evidence of garcía involvement,the government introduced his personal telephone book,seized during his arrest,which contained listings for the informant and tocayo.
while the government case was strong,garcía defense was relatively weak,consisting entirely of of the prosecution witnesses to challenge their credibility.see sepulveda,at finding error harmless where the defendant evidence was a drop in the proverbial bucket.moreover,the prejudice from ramos testimony was minimal.ramos summary of the initial conversation between the informant and tocayo,while providing context for the subsequent investigation,was not essential to proving garcía involvement in the conspiracy.see united states figueroa,cir united states cintolo,cir.javier identified tocayo as the supplier of the drugs,rendering ramos testimony cumulative.see rose,at.further,ramos conclusion that g
