the supreme court has made clear that a pretrial detainee enjoys a due process right to be free from punishment.bell wolfish.at the same time,a state has a valid interest in promoting the security of detention facilities for the safety of detainees and staff.id.at.this case,concerned with an individual inmate,illustrates one way in which these two interests might come into conflict.
albert ford was held in disciplinary segregated confinement throughout a period of pretrial detention and into a subsequent criminal sentence as punishment for conduct that had occurred while he was imprisoned during a prior criminal sentence.the district ruled that ford punitive disciplinary confinement violated due process,and the court also largely denied two prison officials claims of qualified immunity,awarding ford partial money damages and equitable relief as well as attorneys fees and costs.
we reverse the denial of qualified immunity,and therefore reverse the award of money damages against the prison officials in their individual capacities,because we find that the defendants did not violate ford clearly established rights.we also vacate on mootness grounds the declaratory and injunctive relief ordered by the district court.we remand for the district court to determine appropriate attorneys fees and costs as to any equitable relief not moot when issued.
background 
a summary of the facts and procedural background of the case suffices.greater detail is amply provided by the district court numerous opinions.see ford bender ford v,d ford bender ford iv,wl,ford bender ford iii,wl,ford bender ford ii,wl,ford clarke ford i,d.
factual background 
in,ford was sentenced in state court to fifteen to years imprisonment in the custody of the massachusetts department of correction doc at the massachusetts correctional institution at cedar junction mci cedar junction,a state penitentiary in walpole,massachusetts while serving his sentence,ford was repeatedly housed in the department disciplinary unit ddu,a segregated maximum security housing unit,for offenses committed during confinement.these included being in possession of a weapon,conspiring to introduce heroin,and conspiring to assault other inmates.
in,while housed in the ddu,ford violently attacked two officers and took a nurse hostage.the officers had escorted ford to a triage room and adjusted his handcuffs to allow him to test his blood sugar and administer his insulin.while his right hand was,ford produced a inch shank from his clothing,stabbed both officers twice,and held the weapon to the nurse throat until other staff arrived.one officer required immediate medical attention for the puncture wounds in his mid and lower back.in january,after a full disciplinary hearing,ford was given the administrative sanction of a term in the ddu,the maximum ddu sanction possible.the hearing officer explained that inmate ford is a danger to staff and his continued placement in the department most secure setting is warranted.at that point,ford had years left on his state sentence of fifteen to years imprisonment.
ford misconduct in prison had state law criminal consequences as well.in,he was charged with and indicted for armed assault with intent to murder.see.laws ch.
ford completed his original criminal sentence on january,less than the year maximum the record is unclear as to why.he remained,however,in the custody of the doc as a pretrial detainee for the new criminal assault with intent to murder charge.see id.ch.the deputy commissioner of correction at the time,james bender,made the decision to keep ford in the ddu to continue serving his sanction without a new hearing,despite the change in ford status from sentenced inmate to pretrial detainee.bender testified that,b ased on his entire history,my serious concerns about safety and security of staff and inmates,i felt that the most appropriate placement for him at that time was at ddu.
in march,ford was granted bail in the pending assault case,and he was released from the doc custody.on june,however,the state court revoked his bail based on a charge that he had mailed heroin to an inmate.he was returned to mci cedar junction.bender once more consigned ford,still a pretrial detainee on the pending assault charge,to the ddu to continue serving the previously imposed sanction,without any new hearing on whether that sanction should be enforced.
in july,ford first protested his continued confinement in the ddu.peter amand,the superintendent of mci cedar junction,advised ford in a written communique that he was properly housed in the ddu serving the remainder of a ten year ddu sentence that he received in.the communique further averred that ford status as a pretrial detainee did not bar the doc from requiring him to serve out the previously imposed disciplinary sanction.
on april,ford pled guilty to the pending criminal charges of assault with intent to murder and mailing heroin to an inmate.by pleading guilty to assault with intent to murder,ford admitted to the same conduct for which the ddu sanction had been imposed.the court sentenced ford to four to five years in prison with credit for time served.bender kept ford,now a convicted and sentenced inmate,in the ddu to serve out the balance of the sanction.no additional hearing was held after ford guilty plea.
unsurprisingly,the record reflects that conditions in the ddu are considerably more onerous than conditions of confinement for the general population at mci cedar junction.while confined in the ddu,an inmate is kept for hours a day in a cell measuring seven by twelve feet.each cell has a solid steel door with a small inset window a narrow window to the outdoors a cement bed,desk,and stool and a toilet visible through the inset window.a ddu inmate typically leaves his cell for only one hour a day to exercise five days a week and to shower three days a week.he is subject to strip searches whenever he enters or leaves his cell.when a ddu inmate is out of his cell for any reason,he is manacled and placed in leg chains.
ddu inmates are socially isolated.each inmate receives his meals through a slot in the steel door and is given only twenty minutes to eat.the prison library is,although a ddu inmate may receive law books from a book cart,which requires a formal request and typically results in a wait of eight days.communication with other inmates,guards,and the outside world is severely restricted at a maximum,four monthly noncontact visits and four monthly telephone calls may be earned as a privilege for good behavior.
while any prisoner would suffer under these severe conditions,ford was particularly unsuited to them due to his type i diabetes.ford required regular insulin shots and,while in the ddu,he received fewer shots than needed.this shortfall resulted in blood sugar spikes causing headaches,dizziness,a racing heart,shakes,and tremors.diabetic neuropathy led to burning,tingling,and numbness in his feet and ankles.the leg irons cut his ankles and the numbness exacerbated these cuts,which often became infected.
procedural background 
on july,ford filed a pro se complaint in the district court for the district of massachusetts.the court appointed pro bono counsel.
in ford second amended complaint,filed on july,he invoked,charging doc officials acting in both their representative and personal capacities,including bender and amand,with violating his substantive and procedural due process rights.the parties later filed for summary judgment on the liability issues.the district court rendered a mixed decision.it ruled that bender and amand had violated the plaintiff substantive due process rights by confining him in the ddu as a pretrial detainee,and that bender had violated the plaintiff procedural due process rights by continuing to confine the plaintiff in the ddu,both as a pretrial detainee and as a sentenced inmate in,without a new hearing.ford i,d at.in connection with these rulings,the court largely denied the defendants quest for qualified immunity,although the court ruled that qualified immunity protected bender from individual liability for the period during which ford was a sentenced inmate.id.at.relying on its rulings in the summary judgment memorandum,the court entered a formal declaration that the defendants actions were unconstitutional.see ford ii,wl,at.the court rejected a number of other claims against bender,amand,and other defendants.
a bench trial on the issue of damages and injunctive relief took place on july,and.on january,the district court awarded the plaintiff in money damages against the defendants in their individual capacities.ford iii,wl,at.it also issued equitable relief,requiring the defendants in their official capacities to ensure the plaintiff access to transitional programs during the remainder of his sentence and to deem the disciplinary sanction satisfied.see id.at.
the plaintiff,as the prevailing party,see b,moved for attorneys fees and costs.the defendants not only opposed this motion but also sought to vacate the judgment.the district court denied the motion to vacate,ford iv,wl,at,and awarded the plaintiff in attorneys fees and in costs,ford v,d at.
ii.analysis 
the defendants filed two appeals,which we consider together.the defendants challenge whether the doc defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on ford substantive and procedural due process claims whether the prison litigation reform act plra physical injury requirement for recovering damages is satisfied whether the equitable relief ordered by the district court is rendered moot by ford conviction on the assault charge or,alternatively,by his ultimate release from prison and whether the award of attorneys fees should be reversed.given our holdings on qualified immunity,we need not address the defendants contention under the plra.the other issues we take up in turn.
qualified immunity 
the district court decided the qualified immunity issue on summary judgment,holding that the defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity for their conduct during the period that ford was a pretrial detainee see ford i,d at.we review de novo a district court entry of summary judgment,considering whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.see morelli webster,cir see also.a.that standard is unaffected where,as here,for summary judgment are in play.see alliance of auto.mfrs.gwadosky,cir.as with all determinations made at the summary judgment stage,in determining whether qualified immunity is appropriate,we view the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant.tolan cotton.
qualified immunity is a doctrine designed to curtail the legal liability of public officials.see pagán calderón,cir.all state actors except the plainly incompetent and those who knowingly violate the law,are shielded from individual liability for damages under this doctrine.malley briggs.
a framework governs whether a defendant is entitled to qualified immunity.see haley city of boston,cir.first,we inquire whether the facts,taken most favorably to the party opposing summary judgment,make out a constitutional violation.see pearson callahan.second,we inquire whether the violated right was clearly established at the time that the offending conduct occurred.see id.the second,clearly established,step itself encompasses two questions whether the contours of the right,in general,were sufficiently clear,and whether,under the specific facts of the case,a reasonable defendant would have understood that he was violating the right.maldonado fontanes,cir.
federal courts have discretion to bypass the first step of the qualified immunity framework and to focus instead on the second step.id.at.the defendants ask us to do so here.they state that the issue before the court is whether reasonable prison officials would have understood that continuing a lawful ddu sanction during a subsequent period of pretrial detention constituted impermissible punishment proscribed by bell and that the ddu sanction did not provide adequate process for ford pretrial ddu placement.we find that reasonable officials in the defendants shoes would not have understood that their actions violated the plaintiff constitutional rights.since the law was not clearly established,the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.
in reaching this conclusion,we consider the plaintiff substantive and procedural due process claims separately the right to substantive due process implicates the essence of state action rather than its modalities.amsden moran,cir.this right protects individuals from state actions that are arbitrary and capricious,run counter to the concept of ordered liberty,or appear shocking or violative of universal standards of decency.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the heartland of the right to procedural due process,as the name implies,is a guarantee of fair procedure.zinermon burch.this right assures individuals who are threatened with the deprivation of a significant liberty or property interest by the state notice and an opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.amsden,at citing armstrong manzo.the merits of the deprivation itself are immaterial to the procedural due process analysis.carey piphus.we discuss separately the substantive and procedural due process claims before us to determine whether ford can make out a violation under either of a right that was clearly established in.
substantive due process 
by definition,pretrial detainees have not been convicted of the crime or crimes with which they are charged.consequently,they receive constitutional protections superior to those afforded sentenced inmates.bell,at.chief among these distinctions is that a pretrial detainee has a substantive due process right to be free from punishment.see id.at n surprenant rivas,cir.
punishment in the present context,however,is a term of art.what is prohibited is punishment in the constitutional sense,not mere restrictions and conditions accompanying pretrial detention.bell,at.in bell,the plaintiffs challenged their general conditions of confinement,such as the practice of double bunking detainees and restrictive rules on receiving packages from outside the facility.the supreme court declared in bell that the test of whether a condition is in fact punishment is whether the disability is imposed for the purpose of punishment.id.a punitive purpose may be demonstrated through either expressed intent or through inference,for example if a rule or regulation is disproportionate to,or not reasonably related to,a legitimate,goal.id.at see also surprenant,at.
here,the defendants have repeatedly admitted that ford pretrial detention in the ddu had a punitive purpose.for example,bender acknowledged forthrightly in testimony before the district court that his decision to confine ford to the ddu in was a bsolutely intended to punish.the purpose of the ddu confinement,he declared,was to punish ford for the assault for which he was awaiting trial.similarly,amand communique noted that the purpose of ford segregated pretrial confinement was to continue serving his punitive ddu sanction.the district court relied on the defendants plain expressions of punitive intent to find that the plaintiff tenure in the ddu as a pretrial detainee constituted impermissible punishment and,therefore,abridged his right to substantive due process.
while bell provides clear guidance about the constitutional bounds of conditions of confinement for pretrial detainees,bell does not clearly address whether and when punishment is permitted as an individualized disciplinary sanction for a pretrial detainee misconduct.in collazo leon united states bureau of prisons,cir,we upheld a disciplinary sanction confining a pretrial detainee in the ddu for ninety days because he tried to bribe his way out of jail.id.at.we noted that bell was not written to address a situation where discrete sanctions were imposed on individual pretrial detainees as discipline for specific violations.when it comes to individualized discipline,we held that t he inquiry does not end with the designation of a condition of confinement as punishment.id.at.instead of relying on a distinction between whether this discipline was punishment or not,which we deemed semantic,we stated that we did not find that there is any meaningful distinction between the terms punishment and discipline in the context of an individualized disciplinary response,and upheld the punitive ddu sanction of the detainee as a valid exercise of reasonable disciplinary power.id.at.
ford argues that collazo leon concerned a very different factual scenario,one in which the disciplinary infraction and the disciplinary hearing occurred during the pretrial detention itself,whereas ford ddu confinement in was punishment for an offense committed years earlier when he was serving a prior criminal sentence.ford might be right that the timing of a disciplinary infraction during the pretrial detention itself as opposed to during a prior period of incarceration affects the question of whether pretrial disciplinary segregation violates substantive due process the critical inquiry in deciding this appeal,however,is whether any reasonable official in these circumstances would have understood that the continuing disciplinary sanction,imposed when ford was a pretrial detainee on different charges,for conduct that occurred during a prior period of incarceration,violated ford constitutional right to substantive or procedural due process.
collazo leon does not definitively answer whether ford detention was constitutional or not.it does,however,plainly hold that determining whether an act is punitive does not end the constitutional inquiry in the case of an individualized disciplinary process.collazo leon thus illustrates why bell alone does not show that the right at issue here was clearly established.
the defendants rely on cases that address the nature of disciplinary sanctions,pointing to authorities holding that prison disciplinary sanctions are civil proceedings that are distinct from criminal punishment,at least for purposes of the double jeopardy clause,see commonwealth forte,and that disciplinary sanctions may be continued during nonconsecutive criminal sentences,see,pletka nix,cir en banc in re pridgett,p,wl.while these cases may be read as providing some support for the defendants position,they do not concern pretrial detainees specifically.
in addition to these cases,however,the defendants also rely on a state court ruling that addressed a situation involving pretrial detention under facts nearly identical to those in ford case.karnes nolan,was a decision issued by the massachusetts superior court in favor of mci cedar junction,the same facility where ford was housed,just two months before ford original sentence ended and his pretrial detention began.in karnes,a sentenced prisoner at mci cedar junction committed an assault for which he received a disciplinary report,slip op.at.before a disciplinary hearing was held,karnes completed his sentence and was released to the custody of middlesex county to await trial on pending unrelated charges.id.karnes was then also criminally charged with the assault that he had committed at mci cedar junction,and was returned to mci cedar junction as a pretrial detainee to await trial on both new charges.id.prison officials held the previously scheduled disciplinary hearing,and karnes received a disciplinary sanction of five years in the ddu.id.karnes filed a complaint in the massachusetts superior court for a declaratory judgment that the superintendent had violated his due process rights and for injunctive relief 
the superior court rejected karnes argument that his commitment to the ddu based on a disciplinary infraction committed during an elapsed independent sentence was improper because of his status as a detainee.id.at.the court did not cite bell,collazo leon,or any other precedent concerning impermissible punishment,stating instead only that c ommitment to the ddu is a civil proceeding that is separate and independent from the criminal process according to which the plaintiff was detained.id.at citing commonwealth bloom,n.the court concluded that confinement in the ddu did not violate the pretrial detainee due process rights.
although the reasoning of karnes may not be robust,the facts are nearly identical to this case.the superior court ruling in karnes would have appeared to be relevant guidance to officials at mci cedar junction in,and it would have been reasonable for the defendants to have relied on it whether or not we agree with the holding of karnes,i f judges thus disagree on a constitutional question,it is unfair to subject officials to money damages for picking the losing side of the controversy.wilson layne.
the supreme court statement in bell that d ue process requires that a pretrial detainee not be punished,at,must be scrupulously honored.but that statement does not foreclose consideration of important institutional interests,as set forth in collazo leon,concerning disciplinary sanctions that may properly be imposed on a pretrial detainee.see brady dill,cir for purposes of qualified immunity,courts must define the right at an appropriate level of generality.the right at issue here is not the right of a pretrial detainee to be free from punishment generally,but rather the right of a pretrial detainee to be free from punishment that was validly imposed while serving a prior criminal sentence.neither bell nor collazo leon clearly answers this question.viewed at the appropriate level of generality,particularly in light of the decision that mci cedar junction had just received in karnes,we can not say that all reasonable prison officials would have known that holding ford in the ddu during his pretrial detention for an offense that occurred during a prior criminal sentence was unconstitutional.any violation of ford right to substantive due process was not a violation of clearly established law as of.we conclude,therefore,that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the alleged violation of the plaintiff right to substantive due process.
procedural due process 
the district court also concluded that defendant bender violated the plaintiff right to procedural due process by confining him in the ddu as a pretrial detainee without a fresh hearing and that bender was not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to that violation.see ford i,d at.bender disputes these conclusions,contending that the hearing constituted adequate process for the entire disciplinary confinement that followed,regardless of ford change in status.
even when prison officials permissibly may punish a pretrial detainee for discrete violations of facility rules,they must provide him with adequate process.see surprenant,at.bender does not contest that ford had a liberty interest sufficient to trigger procedural safeguards.
it is,moreover,well established that the process that a pretrial detainee must be afforded at a disciplinary hearing is that set forth by the supreme court in wolff mcdonnell.see surprenant,at benjamin fraser,cir mitchell dupnik,cir.this is the same process to which ford was entitled as a convicted inmate.see smith.dep t of,cir.withal,ford was given a disciplinary hearing prior to being placed in the ddu in and has not challenged that process as inadequate.nor does ford identify any different or additional procedures to which he may have been entitled as a result of his change in status.while it was clear in that ford had to be given a hearing before being punished for rules violations,the question we must answer is whether it was clearly established that an otherwise adequate hearing held when he was a convicted inmate would not suffice.
the purpose of a disciplinary hearing is to allow the accused be it a convict or a pretrial detainee to contest whether he in fact committed the infraction.see wolff,at.ford identifies no practical purpose that would be served by holding a second,redundant hearing to establish his culpability.at any rate,given the dearth of case law suggesting that pretrial detainees are entitled to anything more than the procedures set forth in wolff,reasonable prison officials could have concluded that the hearing constituted adequate process.accordingly,bender is entitled to qualified immunity on ford procedural due process claim.
equitable relief 
in addition to money damages,now reversed,the district court issued declaratory and injunctive relief.on september,the district court held that bender and amand had violated ford substantive due process rights by confining ford in the ddu as a pretrial detainee as punishment for his conduct,bender had violated ford procedural due process rights in by confining him in the ddu without a new hearing as a pretrial detainee on the state criminal assault charge,and bender had violated ford procedural due process rights in by confining him in the ddu without a new hearing as a convicted felon serving a sentence.ford i,d at.the district court entered declaratory judgment along the same lines in an order dated november,ford ii,wl,at.on january,after a bench trial,the district court issued an injunction ordering the doc to ensure that ford has,and continues to have for the remainder of his sentence,opportunities to participate in any transitional programs that are available to the general population inmates,and deem satisfied ford year ddu sanction that was issued in.ford iii,wl,at.
on august,ford was transferred from the ddu to the general population at mci cedar junction.on april,ford was released from doc custody altogether.the defendants argue that the equitable relief was moot when entered,or rendered moot by ford release ford responds that the injunctive and declaratory relief was properly entered by the district court but was subsequently rendered partially moot by ford release from custody and the doc cancellation of ford ddu sanction.as a result of ford release from doc custody,we conclude that ford claims for equitable relief no longer present a live case or controversy.we therefore vacate the district court judgment.
the baseline doctrinal principles of mootness are familiar.the constitution confines the jurisdiction of the federal courts to actual cases and controversies.barr galvin,cir internal quotation marks omitted.see const.art.iii.a case generally becomes moot when the controversy is no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.shelby superformance int l,cir internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.events subsequent to a district court entry of judgment may render a case moot and preclude appellate review of the merits.see libertarian party of gardner,cir diffenderfer gomez colon,cir.when this occurs,courts of appeals normally will vacate the judgment below.see diffenderfer,at.the incidence of mootness presents a purely legal question and,therefore,engenders de novo review.see culhane aurora loan servs.of,cir.
a prisoner challenge to prison conditions or policies is generally rendered moot by his transfer or release.see,jordan sosa,cir rendelman.rouse,cir oliver scott,cir scott district of columbia.in incumaa ozmint,the fourth circuit persuasively reasoned that,
once an inmate is removed from the environment in which he is subjected to the challenged policy or practice,absent a claim for damages,he no longer has a legally cognizable interest in a judicial decision on the merits of his claim.any declaratory or injunctive relief ordered in the inmate favor in such situations would have no practical impact on the inmate rights and would not redress in any way the injury he originally asserted.
cir.following this reasoning,the fourth circuit found that a prisoner challenge to a publication ban in the maximum security unit became moot when the prisoner was released from the unit.id.
in this case,ford release from doc custody rendered moot all of his claims for equitable relief.once released from custody,ford lost any legally cognizable interest in a declaration that the doc actions had been unconstitutional or an injunction related to his prior confinement.there is no live case or controversy to decide,nor any meaningful relief to provide,now that ford has been released.with limited exceptions,not present here,issuance of a declaratory judgment deeming past conduct illegal is also not permissible as it would be merely advisory.am.civil liberties union of conference of catholic bishops,cir.
ford concedes that the first injunction,ordering the doc to provide him with access to transitional programs for the remainder of his sentence,expired,by its own terms,upon ford release.ford agrees that he no longer has a legally cognizable interest in this relief and that vacatur is proper.
ford likewise concedes that he no longer has an interest in a declaration related to his detention in the ddu as a sentenced inmate without a new hearing.ford concedes that the mootness actually occurred when defendants voluntarily transferred ford to the general population prior to the expiration of his year ddu sanction.but ford argues against vacatur since it was defendants own acquiescence that caused the declaratory relief to become moot.the argument fails.vacatur is appropriate in this case since the issue would have become moot when ford was released from custody even if the doc had not voluntarily released him from the ddu.see diffenderfer,at declining to address the possibility that the case was rendered moot by voluntary action before intervening,independent event and vacating judgment below.
as to his remaining claims for equitable relief,ford invokes an exception to the mootness doctrine for conduct that is capable of repetition,yet evading review.he bears the burden of establishing this exception.to do so,ford must show the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration and there is a reasonable expectation or a demonstrated probability that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.libertarian party of,at quoting fec.right to life.ford assertions fail to satisfy the exception second requirement,since there is no reasonable expectation that he will again be confined to the ddu as a pretrial detainee,without a hearing,as an administrative sanction for conduct that occurred while he was serving a prior sentence.
ford argues that he faces,as a matter of law,a reasonable probability of b ecause he has a criminal record.ford was convicted in,and then again in for a crime committed while imprisoned on the original charge.we disagree that this criminal record provides a reasonable expectation or demonstrated probability that he would again once he was released from confinement for the conviction.the supreme court has advised that,for purposes of assessing the likelihood that state authorities will reinflict a given injury,we generally have been unwilling to assume that the party seeking relief will repeat the type of misconduct that would once again place him or her at risk of that injury.honig doe.ford two prior convictions are thus insufficient to establish a reasonable expectation that he will and his remaining claims for equitable relief are not saved from mootness.
attorneys fees 
finally,we turn to the defendants separate appeal of the district court award of attorneys fees and costs.ford v,d at.to reiterate,all claims for damages have been dismissed and all claims for equitable relief are moot.ford may,nevertheless,remain a prevailing party for the purpose of attorneys fees and costs under if he clearly succeeded in obtaining the relief sought before the district court and an intervening event rendered the case moot on appeal.diffenderfer,at.we analyze the declaratory judgment and the subsequent injunction separately.
on april,ford pled guilty to the charges of assault with intent to murder and mailing heroin to an inmate,and remained in the ddu as a convicted inmate.on november,the district court entered declaratory judgment relating to ford rights as a pretrial detainee and as a convicted inmate.
the declaratory judgment related to ford rights as a pretrial detainee was moot when issued.at this point in time,ford was no longer a pretrial detainee.the declaratory judgment amounted to an advisory opinion concerned with past alleged wrongs.the district court tried to escape this conclusion by finding ford challenge capable of repetition,yet evading review.ford i,d at.the district court analysis clearly conflicts with our holding today,and we reverse for the same reasons explained above.ford can not retain the stat
