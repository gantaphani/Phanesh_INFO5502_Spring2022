appellant frank arbour pled guilty to five counts in an indictment that charged him with conspiring to possess with the intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base,a being a felon in possession of firearms,g and possessing stolen firearms,j.the district court sentenced arbour to months imprisonment.he appeals his sentence only.
this case presents one issue whether the sentencing court erroneously concluded that arbour was a leader or organizer of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.see a.the district court affirmative finding resulted in a increase in arbour offense level.
arbour argues that the district court conclusion was erroneous for two reasons.first,he asserts that he was not involved in a single criminal activity but rather in a number of separate,unconnected criminal activities.none of these criminal activities standing alone,arbour says,satisfy a requirement that the criminal activity involve five or more participants or be otherwise extensive.second,he argues that even if he was involved in a single criminal activity that satisfied a numerosity or extensiveness requirement,he could not be properly characterized as a leader or organizer of five participants in the criminal activity.we disagree with arbour contentions and affirm his sentence.
because arbour conviction resulted from a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the plea colloquy,the presentence investigation report and the transcript of the sentencing hearing.see united states graciani,cir.
for a period of roughly eighteen months,arbour trafficked in powder cocaine and crack cocaine in maine.arbour supplied a number of individuals with drugs for purposes of both resale and consumption.included among these individuals was roy dubreil,who sold both forms of cocaine to others,often from his home.at some point,arbour moved in with dubreil.
while arbour was operating his drug trafficking business,he collected a number of firearms.because he was a convicted felon,arbour was prohibited from purchasing the firearms himself and therefore he enlisted three others to purchase the weapons for him.two of these straw men,john jackson and john giannelli,were familiar to arbour from his drug trafficking business.jackson was one of arbour customers and also occasionally delivered drugs for arbour.giannelli frequently bought drugs from dubreil.for their services in purchasing firearms for him,arbour paid both jackson and giannelli with drugs.arbour paid baron thompson,a third person he enlisted to purchase firearms,in cash.
the three ersatz buyers acquired a total of six firearms from a hardware store in maine.thompson alone purchased three firearms.unable to purchase firearms himself because of his age,jackson acquired two weapons indirectly,by enlisting a woman of age,crystal landry,to purchase the firearms for him.arbour was directly involved in giannelli purchase from the hardware store,accompanying giannelli to the store and discretely identifying the firearm he desired 
the firearms that thompson,jackson and giannelli acquired for arbour soon left arbour possession.giannelli testified that,on the date of his purchase of the weapon,he witnessed a number of people from out of state arrive at dubreil home.according to giannelli,the visitors supplied arbour with drugs from massachusetts,receiving money or goods in exchange.giannelli observed the men going into a room with arbour and dubreil.afterward,when giannelli asked dubreil where the firearm he had purchased for arbour was,dubreil told him that it was already gone.of the three weapons thompson had purchased,two of them were discovered in the possession of a massachusetts resident during a search of that person home by law enforcement.that individual was also in the possession of seventy bags of cocaine.the firearms acquired by jackson and landry were never found,either in arbour possession or anywhere else.
eventually,the authorities investigated arbour drug trafficking operation,ultimately searching arbour and dubreil residence.in arbour room,the police discovered bedroom scales,plastic baggies with cocaine residue,three firearms,and ammunition.in dubreil room the authorities found ten firearms and ammunition.many of the firearms had been stolen,including the three firearms found in arbour bedroom.arbour subsequently pled guilty to five drug and firearms related charges.
at arbour sentencing hearing,a number of witnesses testified about his drug trafficking business and acquisition of firearms.in addition to this testimony,defense counsel conceded at sentencing that arbour had traded guns for cocaine on at least one occasion.
on the basis of sentencing hearing testimony and other record evidence,the district court determined that arbour was a leader or organizer of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.see a.although the court explicitly found that arbour criminal activity involved five or more participants,the court also observed that the criminal activity involved both arbour drug dealing and his illegal acquisition of firearms.the district court also found that arbour held a leadership or organizational role within the criminal activity.when discussing arbour status as a leader or organizer,the court addressed the factors set forth in application note four of the guidelines commentary accompanying a.see,cmt.although the court observed that not every factor counseled in favor of designating arbour as a leader or organizer,it found that many of them supported such a designation.in addition to noting the nature of arbour participation in the commission of the offenses,the court found that arbour recruited accomplices and exercised authority over both jackson and giannelli.
ii.discussion 
in order to invoke a,a district court must make a finding as to the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise a finding as to the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of the criminal activity.united states,cir.the district court findings must satisfy the preponderance of the evidence standard.united states pierre,cir.
arbour challenges both the scope and status findings of the district court.because both findings are factbound,we review each for clear error.pierre,at united states,cir determinations are innately.the court of appeals must,therefore,pay heed to the sentencing judge views.quoting united states rostoff,cir.we will not find clear error unless on the entire evidence we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states brown,cir quoting anderson city of bessemer city,d.
scope determination 
arbour argues that he was not involved in a single criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.rather,he contends that he was involved in four separate clusters of criminal activity,none of which individually met a numerosity or extensiveness requirement.arbour identifies these four clusters by their direct participants arbour,jackson,and landry arbour,giannelli and jeremy messer arbour and thompson and arbour,giannelli,dubreil,and dean james in arbour view,each group was associated with separate instances of criminal first three were involved in the procurement of firearms and the fourth,in drug trafficking.
for a to apply,the criminal activity that the defendant led or organized must have involved five or more participants or been extensive.a.the disjunctive language of a is criminal activity may be extensive even if does not involve five or more participants.id.cmt.in assessing whether a criminal activity is otherwise extensive,all persons involved during the course of the entire offense are to be considered.thus,a fraud that involved only three participants but used the unknowing services of many outsiders could be considered extensive.see also united states laboy,cir the five or more participants and otherwise extensive elements are alternative means of finding the required scope under.united states,cir citing rostoff,at.
in addition,a court may look beyond the specific crimes for which the defendant was convicted when determini
