at sentencing,the court found that base offense level was under a.the court determined,over objection,that his prior conviction under florida law for lewd and lascivious assault on a child constituted an aggravated felony,thus warranting a sentencing enhancement under the relevant sentencing guideline in effect at the time.see b a.in doing so,the court stated 
defendant has objected to the presentence report claiming those points should have been added,and that where the dispute is in this case,was his conviction in florida in for an aggravated felony.it an aggravated felony if he was guilty of a crime the equivalent of sexual abuse of a minor.in florida,he was charged with lewd and lascivious assault on a child.a key word.he pleaded guilty,according to his own admission,and he received five years of probation with certain conditions.the statute under which he was convicted is broad,and it can involve conduct upon a minor,or in the presence of a minor.in order to determine what conduct was involved here the court must look to the information,the charge.the charge is assault on a child.that what he pleaded guilty to,and it was a lewd and lascivious assault.in other words,it involved sexual conduct.so,in effect,what he was convicted of,what he pleaded guilty to,was a sexual assault on a minor.that is an aggravated felony under federal law.it not necessary for the court to get in the specific facts of the particular conduct.his plea to that particular charge is sufficient to determine that it was an aggravated felony.
also received a reduction for acceptance of responsibility under.he requested a downward departure on grounds that he satisfied the requisite elements of,application note that departure request,however,was denied.
accordingly,the applicable criminal history category was i,and the total offense level was,yielding a sentencing range under of to months imprisonment.the court sentenced defendant to months of imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release with the deportation condition 
argues on appeal that the district court erred when it concluded that his conviction constituted an aggravated felony under the federal sentencing guidelines.he also claims that the sentencing court erred in its refusal to grant his motion for a downward departure.
a.the aggravated felony determination 
at the time of sentencing,the sentencing guidelines imposed a enhancement in illegal reentry cases on offenders with a prior conviction for an aggravated felony.b a.the question of what constitutes an aggravated felony for purposes is controlled by a.see,cmt.for purposes of a ggravated felony is defined at a without regard to the date of conviction of the aggravated felony.our review of such determinations is de novo.see united states,cir reviewing de novo what qualifies as aggravated felony under.
section a provides in relevant part that the term aggravated felony means,inter alia,murder,rape,or sexual abuse of a minor.a a.the district court concluded that prior conviction qualified as sexual abuse of a minor and therefore constituted an aggravated felony under b a.on appeal,asserts that the district court reached that conclusion by improperly considering facts underlying his prior conviction,contrary to the categorical approach set forth by the supreme court in taylor united states,d.we explore that contention.
the taylor categorical 
under the taylor approach,a sentencing court should look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense for sentencing enhancement purposes.id.at.see also united states harris,cir.where the statutory definition encompasses both predicate and offenses,however,it may be necessary to go beyond the statute and the fact of conviction.see harris,at see also united states sacko,cir.in those situations,a sentencing court may look to the indictment or information and jury instructions in order to discern which type of crime the offender was convicted of perpetrating.sacko,at citing taylor,at.if the charging papers simply contain the boilerplate statutory formulation and there are no jury instructions because of a guilty plea,it is appropriate for the sentencing court to 
look to the conduct in respect to which the defendant was charged and pled guilty,not because the court may properly be interested in the nature of that particular conduct,but because that conduct may indicate that the defendant and the government both believed that the predicate crime rather than the crime was at issue.
harris,at.the inquiry should focus on the meaning of the defendant guilty plea that is,whether the defendant plea constitutes an admission to the predicate offense under a statute that encompasses both predicate and offenses.united states shepard,cir.
we begin our analysis with the language of the statute to which pled guilty.stat.ann.
a person who 
handles,fondles,or assaults any child under the age of years in a lewd,lascivious,or indecent manner 
commits actual or simulated sexual intercourse,deviate sexual intercourse,sexual bestiality,masturbation,sadomasochistic abuse,actual lewd exhibition of the genitals,or any act or conduct which simulates that sexual battery is being or will be committed upon any child under the age of years or forces or entices the child to commit any such act 
commits an act defined as sexual battery under h upon any child under the age of years or 
knowingly commits any lewd or lascivious act in the presence of any child under the age of years,without committing the crime of sexual battery,commits a felony of the second degree,punishable as provided in,or.
section thus criminalizes,inter alia,sexual offenses that do not rise to the level of rape or sexual battery and which are committed against children under the age of sixteen.it encompasses acts involving physical contact between the perpetrator and child victim,as well as acts that do not involve any such physical contact.
argues that the charged offense under florida law does not constitute sexual abuse of a minor within the meaning of a a.albeit difficult to decipher,his argument seems to rest on the following logic a given a sentence that involved no incarceration,he must have been charged only as a flasher under clause,which explicitly provides that the crime may be committed in the presence of the child without committing the crime
