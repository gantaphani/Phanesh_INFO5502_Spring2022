on appeal from a final order entered in the united states district court for the western district of new york larimer,defendant challenges the determination that he is ineligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to c because,although a retroactive amendment to the sentencing guidelines range lowered the guidelines range identified by the district court at defendant initial sentencing,the amended range was not lower than the range agreed to by the parties pursuant to fed.crim.c c,which the district court accepted and within which it sentenced defendant to a prison term.defendant argues that the range,which was itself based on the guidelines,albeit calculated differently from the district court,became his applicable range for purposes of determining c eligibility.we conclude that defendant applicable guidelines range as defined by a is the range identified by the district court before accepting the parties c c agreement.because that range was lowered by guidelines amendment to to months,however,defendant is eligible for a reduction in his sentence,but to no lower than months.
vacated and remanded.
defendant jamahl leonard was convicted in in the united states district court for the western district of new york david larimer,judge,after pleading guilty to conspiracies to distribute or more kilograms of marijuana,see a,b b,and to launder the proceeds of that illegal trafficking,see h.presently incarcerated,serving a prison term,leonard appeals from a final order entered by the same court on june,which concluded that he was ineligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to c.the court reasoned that,although a,retroactive amendment to the sentencing guidelines had lowered the guidelines range identified by the court at leonard initial sentencing,the amended range was not lower than the range agreed to by the parties in their plea agreement under fed.crim.c c.leonard challenges this conclusion,arguing that,once the district court accepted his c c plea agreement,the sentencing range specified therein became his applicable range for purposes of determining c eligibility.and because the amendment lowered that range to to months,leonard maintains he is eligible for a sentence reduction to that extent.
the government defends the district court ineligibility determination,maintaining that leonard sentence was based on his c c agreement,not the sentencing guidelines as required by c and,in any event,leonard sentence is within the applicable range,a precluding a finding that his applicable range was lowered by a subsequent amendment as required by a,or b at least rendering any ineligibility error in this case harmless.
neither party argument is completely persuasive.contrary to the government,we conclude that leonard is eligible for a c sentence reduction because his original sentence was based on the sentencing guidelines as that statutory phrase has been construed by the five justices in the majority in freeman united states,plurality opinion id.at sotomayor,concurring in the judgment.at the same time,however,we conclude that the extent of the reduction for which leonard is eligible is narrower than he urges because his applicable guidelines range,as defined by cmt.a,was the range calculated by the district court before accepting what was effectively a downward variance to the range prescribed in the parties c c agreement.because the relevant guidelines amendment reduced leonard originally applicable range to a range,leonard is eligible for a reduction of his sentence,but to no less than months incarceration,the low end of the amended range.see b a.whether to grant any reduction is,of course,a matter entrusted to the district court discretion.see united states christie,cir.nevertheless,because we conclude that leonard is at least eligible for such a reduction,we vacate the challenged order and remand for the district court to decide whether or not to exercise its reduction discretion in this case.
background 
leonard pleads guilty pursuant to a rule c c agreement 
on may,leonard pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute at least but less than kilograms of marijuana,and to laundering the proceeds of that criminal activity in an amount more than but less than.app x.in a written plea agreement,leonard and the prosecution noted their agreement to certain sentencing guidelines calculations,specifically,to a base offense level of with a upward adjustment for aggravating role and a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.with further agreement to a criminal history category of i,the parties calculations yielded a guideline sentencing range of to months imprisonment.id.at.pursuant to fed.crim.c c,the parties agreed that leonard should be sentenced within this guidelines range and that,if the district court were to reject that part of the plea agreement,defendant shall then be afforded the opportunity to withdraw the plea of guilty.app x 
sentencing 
prior to sentencing,the district court received a presentence investigation report psr from the probation department probation,which calculated leonard sentencing guidelines range at to months rather than the range referenced in the parties c c agreement.while probation agreed that leonard base offense level was and that he was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,it recommended a increase for possession of firearms by a,and a four rather than three level increase for leonard organizing role.further,because leonard had committed the crimes of conviction while under conditional discharge from an earlier conviction,probation calculated his criminal history category at ii rather than 
at sentencing,the district court rejected the recommended firearms enhancement,but adopted the role enhancement,as well as the higher criminal history category to yield a guidelines range of to months.while the district court acknowledged that the parties had some issue with these enhancements,it reiterated its conclusion that the guidelines are as i indicated,to months.app x.nevertheless,it stated that it was prepared to accept the parties c c agreement and to sentence leonard within the range of to months identified therein,which it deemed sufficient in my view,but not greater than necessary,to meet statutory sentencing objectives.id.at.accordingly,the district court sentenced leonard to months imprisonment,four years supervised release,a fine,and a special assessment.
amendments to applicable guidelines range 
almost six years after leonard sentencing,the united states sentencing commission issued two relevant guidelines amendments.amendment,which took effect in,amended the drug quantity table in to reduce the offense levels associated with certain controlled substances crimes by two levels.see,supp.to app.c,amend.thus,the base offense level for the quantity of marijuana involved in leonard drug crime of conviction was reduced from to.see id.c.amendment,which also took effect in,provided for retroactive application of amendment.see id.at supp.to app.c,amend.
motion to reduce sentence 
on may,leonard invoked the two aforementioned amendments to move pro se for a sentence reduction pursuant to c the district court denied the motion on june,concluding that leonard was ineligible for a sentence reduction.the court reasoned that,although it had determined the applicable guidelines range to be months,and the amendments had reduced that range to to months,it had in fact sentenced leonard within the latter range pursuant to the plea agreement,such that amendment did not have the effect of lowering the defendant applicable guideline range.app x see a b.
leonard timely appealed from the decision 
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
where,as here,a defendant seeks a sentence reduction based on a retroactive guidelines amendment,a district court must determine whether the defendant is eligible for a reduction pursuant to c,and whether a reduction is warranted in light of the factors listed in a.see dillon united states.because the initial eligibility question the only one here at issue depends on statutory interpretation,our review is de novo.see united states williams,cir.
leonard eligibility for a sentence reduction 
congress has pronounced a convicted defendant eligible for a sentence reduction if he has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered,and such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.c emphasis added.the pertinent policy statement conditions reduction eligibility on the guideline range applicable to that defendant ha ving subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the guidelines manual listed in subsection d.a emphasis added.thus,two requirements must be satisfied for a defendant to be eligible for a sentence reduction the original sentence must have been based on the sentencing guidelines,and the amendment must have lowered the guidelines range applicable to the defendant at the time of the original sentencing.see united states pleasant,cir.observing that applicable to language from policy statement and based on language from statute require separate analysis see also united states martinez,cir.holding defendant convicted of crack conspiracy ineligible for sentence reduction based on amendment lowering crack guidelines because guidelines applicable to defendant sentence were those pertaining to career offenders,which were not lowered.
leonard sentence was based on a subsequently lowered guidelines range 
in deciding whether leonard sentence was based on a subsequently lowered guidelines range,we are guided by the supreme court ruling in freeman united states.in that case,the court considered whether a sentence imposed pursuant to a c c agreement could ever be said to have been based on on the sentencing guidelines for purposes of c.five justices answered that question in the affirmative,but for different reasons.the plurality reasoned that because the guidelines must be consulted,in the regular course of imposing any sentence,including a sentence identified in an c c agreement,an c c sentence was likely to be based on the guidelines.id.at,plurality opinion,kennedy,joined by ginsburg,breyer,kagan,jj.explaining that requires district judge to evaluate recommended sentence in light of defendant applicable guidelines range before accepting c c agreement,see id.at.five justices specifically rejected this view,concluding that an c c sentence is based not on the sentencing guidelines but on the parties plea agreement.see id.at sotomayor,concurring in the judgment id.at roberts,dissenting,joined by scalia,thomas,alito,jj.this led the dissenters to conclude that c c sentences were categorically ineligible for c reductions.see id.at roberts,dissenting.justice sotomayor,however,joined in the plurality favorable eligibility determination,explaining that if an c c agreement expressly uses a guidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged offense to establish the term of imprisonment,and that range is subsequently lowered by the united states sentencing commission,the term of imprisonment is based on the range employed and the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction under c.id.at sotomayor,concurring in the judgment.the concurrence reasoning,as applied in freeman,created little practical tension with the plurality because the sentencing range identified by the parties in their c c agreement was the guidelines range calculated by the district court,and the defendant agreed to have his sentence determined pursuant to the sentencing guidelines.see id.at plurality opinion id.at sotomayor,concurring in the judgment.
this case is different.although leonard and the prosecutors agreed to an c c sentence based on their sentencing guidelines calculation,that calculation yielded a lower range than the applicable range identified by the district court.thus,we must consider whether the controlling rationale for decision in freeman supports leonard claim that his sentence,although imposed pursuant to that lower range,was nevertheless based on the guidelines for purposes of a c reduction.
generally,w hen a fragmented supreme court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds.marks united states,internal quotation marks omitted.this court has not identified in a published opinion which freeman rationale is controlling.we have only assumed the controlling effect of justice sotomayor concurring opinion in a number of our unpublished summary orders.see,united states howell,app x,cir.united states kinsey,app x,cir.the parties appear to urge that conclusion here.the matter gives some pause,however,because the one point uniting eight members of the court in freeman is their rejection of justice sotomayor rationale for decision.see freeman united states,at plurality opinion observing that concurrence,by shifting focus of based on inquiry from reasons for judge sentence to terms of parties plea agreement,risks arbitrary and disparate identification of defendants eligible for reductions from c c sentences id.at,dissenting agreeing with plurality that concurring opinion approach is arbitrary and unworkable.
further,our sister circuits have divided in identifying freeman controlling rationale.in published decisions,eight courts of appeals have recognized justice sotomayor concurring opinion as the narrower and,therefore,controlling,rationale for decision.see united states benitez,cir.united states graham,cir.united states browne,cir.united states dixon,cir.united states thompson,cir.united states,cir.united states smith,cir.united states brown,cir.a ninth court has done so summarily.see united states cover,app x,cir.only one of these courts,however,reached that conclusion in circumstances akin to those presented here,that is,an c c agreement to a guidelines range that turns out to be lower than the applicable range calculated by the district court.see united states smith,at.meanwhile,two courts of appeals one sitting en banc have observed that justice sotomayor rationale for decision in freeman is not necessarily narrower than that of the plurality and,therefore,declined to accord it controlling effect.see united states davis,cir.en banc concluding that freeman plurality opinion is actually the narrower one in certain respects united states epps,cir.suggesting that two rationales for decision are incompatible insofar as focus of plurality inquiry is judge and focus of concurrence inquiry is parties according to these two courts,only the freeman result that c relief is not invariably barred when a sentence was imposed pursuant to a rule c c plea agreement is binding,united states epps,at,leaving lower courts free to follow the more persuasive rationale for that result,which both courts decided is that of the plurality opinion,see accord united states davis,at.
we need not here decide which of the freeman rationales for decision is the narrower,or which is more persuasive,because we conclude that leonard sentence is properly recognized as based on the sentencing guidelines under the reasoning of either the plurality or the concurrence.
to explain,we begin with the plurality,which recognized that even c c sentences that varied from the guidelines range calculated by the district court could be based on the guidelines even where the judge varies below the recommended guidelines range,if the judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to explain the decision to deviate from it,then the guidelines are in a real sense a basis for the sentence.freeman united states,at plurality opinion.this reasoning appears to recognize the possibility that a sentence can be based on the guidelines even if departing or varying from the applicable guidelines range.
that describes this case.the district court here began its consideration of leonard sentence by independently calculating his applicable guidelines range,adopting certain recommendations by probation as to role and rejecting others as to firearms possession,without regard to the parties c c agreement.only after thus identifying the applicable guidelines range and then considering it together with all the factors under section a did the court effectively decide to vary from the guidelines and to sentence leonard within the lower range agreed to by the parties.app x see united states kuhlman,cir.characterizing acceptance of parties sentence as effectively a downward variance from guidelines united states pleasant,at viewing imposition of sentence pursuant to plea agreement as equivalent of downward variance.in explaining its acceptance of the c c agreement,the district court referenced the parties agreement,but relied in the main on reasoning that would inform a sentence in any event,specifically,that the agreed upon range was sufficient in my view,but not greater than necessary,to meet those a sentencing objectives.app x see a requiring court to impose sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary,to comply with the purposes set forth in this subsection kimbrough united states,recognizing overarching statutory obligation,even within guidelines regimen,to impose sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary,to accomplish the goals of sentencing internal quotation marks omitted.the court then proceeded to explain in some detail spanning seven pages of transcript how the a factors,as applied specifically to leonard,warranted a sentence of months incarceration.see app x.
on this record,we conclude that,under the freeman plurality rationale for decision,leonard sentence was based on the sentencing guidelines because the district court used his guidelines range as the beginning point for its sentencing analysis,even though ultimately deciding to vary below that applicable range.freeman united states,at plurality opinion.
turning to justice sotomayor concurrence,its rationale for decision focused not on the sentencing judge consideration of the guidelines but on the terms of the parties agreement.see id.at sotomayor,concurring in the judgment rejecting idea that district courts could reduce a term of imprisonment pursuant to c simply because the court itself considered the guidelines.it concluded that,if an c c agreement call ed for the defendant to be sentenced within a particular guidelines sentencing range,and the district court accepted the agreement,thereby obligating it to sentence the defendant accordingly,then there can be no doubt that the term of imprisonment the court imposes is based on the sentencing range within the meaning of c.id.at.justice sotomayor reached the same conclusion with respect to c c agreements providing for a specific term of imprisonment if they made clear that the basis for the specified term is a guidelines sentencing range applicable to the offense to which the defendant pleaded guilty.id.at.
this case falls within the concurrence first category.in their c c agreement,the parties here not only called for leonard to be sentenced within the guidelines range of to months,but also detailed the guidelines calculation producing that range,identifying the particular guidelines providing for a base offense level of,see a,c a upward adjustment for aggravating role,see id.b and a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,see id.a,b as well as identifying the guidelines criminal history category of see app x.under the concurrence reasoning,when an c c agreement thus expressly uses the guidelines to identify the sentencing range,a district court acceptance of the agreement and its imposition of the sentence satisfies the based on requirement of c.
further,under the concurrence rationale for decision,no different conclusion is warranted because,in the agreement,the parties acknowledged that the district court was not bound by the sentencing guidelines.id.at.whatever options were available to the district court before it accepted the parties agreement,the freeman concurrence specifically states that,once the court indicated acceptance,it was obligate d to sentence the defendant accordingly,that is,according to the guidelines calculation,so that its sentence was based on the guidelines sentencing range.freeman united states,at sotomayor,concurring in the judgment.
a question arises,however,as to whether the concurrence rationale supports that based on conclusion even where,as here,the guidelines sentencing range agreed to by the parties is not the guidelines range independently calculated by the district court.in short,can a miscalculated range be deemed based on the guidelines for purposes of c the freeman dissenters posed that question as a challenge to the concurrence reasoning.see id.at roberts,dissenting.justice sotomayor,however,did not hesitate to answer in the affirmative because it is the parties agreement that controls in the c c agreement context,even if the district court had calculated the range differently than the parties,freeman would still be eligible for resentencing,as long as the parties chosen range was one that was subsequently lowered by the sentencing commission.id.at sotomayor,concurring in the judgment alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.the dissenters characterized the answer as surprising given that the governing guidelines provision specifies that a defendant is only eligible for sentence reduction if the amended guideline has the effect of lowering the defendant applicable guideline range presumably the correct applicable guideline range.id.at roberts,dissenting emphasis in original quoting a b.
because the district court in freeman did not calculate defendant applicable guidelines range differently from the parties,these exchanges about a circumstance not before the court can be viewed as dicta.see united states santos,stating that speculations as to a case that is not before the court are the purest of dicta.further,as we explain infra at part,a amendment to a commentary clarifies how a defendant applicable guidelines range is to be calculated.we need not here decide whether or how this clarification might prompt the supreme court,and justice sotomayor in particular,to refine their analysis of the based on requirement for c relief.we conclude only that justice sotomayor,like her plurality colleagues,reasoned that sentences not within the guidelines range calculated by the district court could be based on the guidelines for purposes of c.
thus,although the freeman concurrence and plurality employ different rationales for decision,under either,leonard sentence is properly understood to be based on the sentencing guidelines even though the parties calculated those guidelines in their c c agreement differently than did the district court.thus,leonard satisfies the first eligibility requirement for a c sentence reduction.
the guidelines range applicable to leonard was lowered by amendment from to months to to months 
although leonard sentence is based on the guidelines,he is only eligible for a sentence reduction to the extent the guideline range applicable to him has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the guidelines.a emphasis added see id.b stating that whether,and to what extent defendant sentence may be reduced is determined by amended applicable guidelines range united states pleasant,at denying c relief to defendant because,although he satisfied statute based on requirement,crack guidelines amendment did not lower career offender guidelines applicable to him.the parties here agree that amendment lowered the guidelines ranges for most drug crimes,including leonard.they dispute,however,what guidelines range was applicable to leonard when he was sentenced.
leonard argues that his initial applicable range was to months,the range specified in his c c agreement,which the district court accepted.because amendment lowered that range to to months,leonard submits he is eligible for a reduction to that extent.
the government maintains that leonard applicable guidelines range was to months,the range calculated by the district court before accepting the parties agreement.it argues that because amendment lowered that range to to months the range within which leonard was sentenced pursuant to his c c agreement he is not entitled to any further reduction.
we agree that leonard applicable guidelines range was to months,but we do not agree that he is ineligible for any reduction from his sentence.that applicable range having been lowered to to months,the district court in its discretion could reduce leonard sentence to anywhere from to months.thus,leonard is at least eligible for a sentence reduction to that extent.
to explain our conclusion,we begin with the commentary to,which explicitly defines the applicable guideline range that must be lowered to allow for a c reduction as the guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to a,which is determined before consideration of any departure provision in the guidelines manual or any variance.cmt.a.two parts of this definition defeat leonard argument that the range agreed to by the parties in their c c agreement became his applicable range when the district court accepted the agreement.
first,a,referenced in the definition,states that t he court shall determine the kinds of sentence and the guideline range as set forth in the guidelines,whereupon it proceeds to specify the order in which a court is to apply various guidelines provisions.id.a emphases added.in short,the highlighted language plainly assigns responsibility for determining the applicable guidelines range to the court,not the parties,and requires the court to make that determination as set forth in the guidelines,not by reference to the parties agreement.id.
second,and more compelling,the quoted definition states that the applicable guideline range is identified before consideration of any departure or any variance.id.cmt.a.the sentencing commission explained that it added this language to the guidelines commentary to resolve a circuit split on the issue of whether the applicable guidelines range is determined before or after any departure or variance.see id.at app.c,vol.iii,amend,at.the definition makes plain that it is determined before.our court has acknowledged as much in abrogating our own precedent at odds with the commentary definition.see united states steele,cir.observing that definition makes clear that applicable amended guidelines range does not incorporate any guidelines departures or variances,thus abrogating united states rivera,cir.using sentencing range calculated after departure in determining defendant eligibility for c reduction see also united states garrett,cir.stating that applicable guidelines range is produced after a correct determination of the defendant total offense level and criminal history category but prior to any discretionary departures emphasis in original.
as we have already explained,when a district court accepts an c c sentence or sentencing range that is lower than its calculated guidelines range,what the court effectively does is grant a departure or variance.see supra part.there is no doubt as to the court authority to do so.but that does not transform the lower range into the applicable guidelines range.as the commentary to makes plain,the applicable guideline range for purposes of determining a defendant eligibility for a c reduction is always that determined by the court as set forth in the guidelines,without regard to the parties agreement to a different calculation,and before the exercise of any departure or variance discretion.see united states pleasant,at.
that conclusion is reinforced by c,which states that the court may accept an c c agreement if the sentence agreed to therein is either within the applicable guideline range or outside the applicable guideline range for justifiable reasons.c,policy statement.the second option plainly recognizes that an c c sentence or sentencing range may not fall within or equate to the applicable guideline range as that term is defined in the commentary to and identified pursuant to a.see generally brown gardner,presuming that given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute accord united states steele,at applying principle to guidelines.thus,although c approves c c sentences outside the applicable guideline range for justifiable reasons,it does not thereby transform the applicable guideline range to whatever the parties agree to in their c c agreement.it simply recognizes,as we have here,the court authority to impose c c sentences that depart or vary from the applicable guidelines range.see united states pleasant,at.
leonard maintains that the freeman concurrence compels a different conclusion insofar as it states that,in the context of c c sentences,it is the parties agreement that controls,so that even if the district court had calculated the range differently than the parties,defendant would still be eligible for resentencing,as long as the parties chosen range was one that was subsequently lowered by the sentencing commission.freeman united states,at sotomayor,concurring in the judgment emphasis added see also united states smith,at holding that range was applicable because freeman makes clear that where the parties have entered into a rule c c plea agreement that is based on the sentencing guidelines,the applicable guidelines range for purposes of c is the one provided in the plea agreement.we are not persuaded that freeman compels the result leonard urges.
first,freeman did not have to decide what constitutes the applicable sentencing range for purposes of a c reduction.the defendant c c sentence was there within the guidelines range calculated by the district court,and there was no question that that range had been lowered by retroactive amendment.see freeman united states,at plurality opinion.thus,the only question for decision was whether such an c c sentence could be deemed based on the guidelines as required for a c reduction.a majority answered that question in the affirmative,see id.at plurality opinion id.at sotomayor,concurring in the judgment a minority in the negative,see id.at roberts,dissenting.
in these circumstances,whatever authority the freeman concurring opinion commands under marks united states,at,with respect to identifying c c sentences based on the guidelines,that authority would not extend to identifying the guidelines range applicable to a defendant when the district court calculates that range differently from the parties in their c c agreement.the concurrence even if conclusion about such a circumstance not then before the court is at best dictum.see united states martino,cir.construing narrowest grounds under marks test as ground that is most nearly confined to the precise fact situation before the court,rather than to a ground that states more general rules.to the extent leonard invokes such dictum to extend reasoning unanimously rejected by all other members of the court,we understandably hesitate.see freeman united states,at plurality opinion id.at roberts,dissenting.in any event,there is a second,compelling reason for rejecting leonard applicable to argument.
specifically,the construction leonard infers from the freeman concurrence is now at odds with a subsequent amendment to the guidelines that explicitly defines the applicable range that must be lowered for a party to be eligible for a c reduction.see cmt.a.as already discussed,that definition provides for the court to calculate the applicable range according to the sentencing manual.see supra part.it does not contemplate that the parties will themselves identify the applicable guidelines range,much less that they will do so differently than the district court.nor does that definition permit a departure or variance which is effectively what the court grants when it accepts an c c agreement specifying a lower guidelines range than that calculated by the district court to reduce the applicable guidelines range.rather,the commentary defines the applicable guideline range as the guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined pursuant to a that is,by the court as set forth in the guidelines,a which is determined before consideration of any departure or variance,id.cmt.a emphasis added.
because this definition was added to the guidelines on november,id.at app.c,vol.iii,amend,at,some four months after the freeman decision,it supersedes any contrary understanding of the applicable guidelin
