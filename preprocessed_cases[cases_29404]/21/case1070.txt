the,fred awon awon was convicted of arson and mail fraud arising from the orchestration,on two occasions,of the arson of a building and the submission of insurance claims.following conviction,awon moved for a new trial and to vacate his sentence pursuant to,citing newly discovered evidence and a lack of federal jurisdiction.the newly discovered evidence contained in five,allegedly exculpatory affidavits.the district court,after holding an evidentiary hearing,denied both motions and,upon awon request,issued a certificate of appealability under c.finding no error,we affirm.
background 
awon and his father owned rental income property located at ames street the ames street property in brockton,massachusetts,that consisted of unimproved rental space on the first floor and two apartments on the second floor.on september,the brockton fire department extinguished a fire in the vacant first floor space before significant damage occurred.the awons filed a claim with their insurance company for the damage from this fire and were paid in settlement for the damage.in the early morning hours of january,another fire at the building resulted in the destruction not only of the awon building but of three adjacent buildings as well.the awons again filed a claim with their insurance company and negotiated a settlement of for the loss of the building and demolition expenses,and for lost rental income.
investigation of the two fires resulted in an eight count indictment charging awon and two,james louis and joaquim neves joaquim with arson and mail fraud.in counts i through iv,awon and james louis were charged with arson,in violation of i count i,mail fraud in violation of counts ii and iii,and use of a fire to commit a felony,in violation of h count iv.those four counts related to the september,fire and the subsequent filing of an insurance claim.awon,james louis and joaquim were charged in counts v through viii with four corresponding offenses,arson count v,mail fraud counts vi and vii and use of fire to commit a felony count viii.the latter four counts pertained to the january,fire and the filing of the second insurance claim.prior to trial,joaquim pleaded guilty to counts v,vi,and vii count viii was dismissed and,pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the government,testified at trial as a witness against his two,awon and james louis.
a.the trial 
joaquim,testifying pursuant to a plea agreement,stated at trial that,in the summer of,anse louis had asked him,purportedly on awon behalf,if he would burn the ames street property.although initially hesitant,he agreed to commit the arson and solicited the help of james louis.joaquim further testified that he had several conversations directly with awon about the arson and the promised.according to joaquim testimony,awon agreed to pay him for committing the arson.just prior to the first fire,however,joaquim was detained by the immigration and naturalization service ins which had begun deportation proceedings against him.
jorge neves jorge,joaquim brother,testified at trial that while joaquim was in ins custody,james louis sought jorge help to burn the ames street property.jorge said that james louis promised that they would be paid by awon for the arson.jorge testified,however,that he never spoke directly to awon regarding the fire or payment.jorge further testified that,on september,he and james louis spread gasoline around the first floor of the building,ignited it,and fled in james louis car.the fire was quickly extinguished.because nothing happened,jorge testified that he was never paid for the arson.as the result of his cooperation and testimony,jorge was not prosecuted for his involvement in setting the september,fire.
joaquim testified that,after his own release from ins custody in november,he was again approached by anse louis,on behalf of awon,with the request that he burn the ames street property.joaquim said he agreed and that he again solicited james louis to help him.according to joaquim,joaquim was to receive a cash payment for his involvement while james louis had directly negotiated with awon for the receipt of a used ford taurus from awon car dealership.on january,joaquim and james louis drove to the ames street property in the car of joaquim girlfriend,sandy casamiro,and set the building on fire.the two men returned to joaquim house,placed their soiled clothes in a bag,awakened casamiro,and had her drive them to a nearby dumpster to discard their clothing.casamiro corroborated joaquim testimony about the late night excursion to discard the clothing worn at the time of the arson.the next day,according to the records of awon used car dealership,awon transferred a ford taurus to james louis for.joaquim testified that,a week later,he received in cash from awon.
testifying on behalf of awon,anse louis said that he never spoke with awon or joaquim about the burning of the ames street property.awon parents testified that they were the owners and actual parties in interest with respect to the building and that awon involvement was limited to responding to maintenance requests and showing the building to prospective tenants.in essence,it was their testimony that awon had no financial stake in the property.awon testified that he believed that joaquim had set the fire in retaliation for awon refusal to post bail for joaquim when he was in ins custody and in reaction to an argument between the two men prior to the second fire.
the jury found awon guilty of all counts.james louis was acquitted of the first four counts,those related to the september,fire,and found guilty of the remaining four counts.awon was sentenced to a term of imprisonment,which represented a downward departure from the applicable guideline sentencing range of to months.awon was also ordered to pay restitution to the scottsdale insurance company in the amount of.this court affirmed his conviction on february.united states awon,cir.
proceedings 
on february,pursuant to,awon filed a motion to set aside,vacate,or correct sentence and,in an essentially duplicative pleading,he filed a motion for a new trial.in the two motions,awon pursued identical claims that evidence warranted a new trial and that with respect to count v of the indictment the government evidence at trial was insufficient to satisfy the federal jurisdictional element of i 
the evidence was set out in five affidavits.in their affidavits,jorge neves and joaquim neves recanted their trial testimony implicating awon in the fires.joaquim averred that he had falsified his testimony in the hopes of gaining favor with law enforcement officials and avoiding deportation.jorge disavowed any statement he made on the stand implicating awon and stated he had fingered awon to avoid prosecution.james louis,who did not testify at trial,averred that he was solely responsible for the planning of the second fire and that awon played no part in the arson.roberto neves,the brother of jorge and joaquim neves,stated that he and his family were threatened by the police that if joaquim did not implicate awon,their sister children would be taken away and roberto would be jailed.roberto also reported that joaquim had confessed to roberto that he,joaquim,had lied about awon involvement to save himself and receive a lower sentence.roberto did not testify at trial.finally,awon submitted his own affidavit denying any involvement in the planning or execution of the fire and averring that james louis had confessed to him that he and joaquim had set the january,fire.
the district court held an evidentiary hearing on awon two motions.through counsel,joaquim notified the court that he withdrew his affidavit and recanted the statements he had made therein.thereafter,at the hearing,the government called joaquim to testify.during his testimony at the evidentiary hearing,joaquim described a four and hour meeting with awon attorney that only ended when joaquim agreed to sign the affidavit compiled by awon attorney.joaquim stated that awon attorney informed him that he would not submit the affidavit to the court until joaquim had signed and returned a typed copy of the affidavit.when joaquim received the typed copy he discarded it and assumed the matter was closed.he reported being surprised when he discovered that awon attorney had filed the handwritten copy.awon himself did not testify at the hearing on his two motions nor did james louis or jorge testify concerning the facts they had averred in their affidavits.roberto,having been deported,was unavailable to testify.although awon attorney was available to testify he did not take the stand to counter joaquim description of the events leading to the submission of joaquim affidavit.awon presented no other testimony or documentary evidence to support his motions.
the government submitted an affidavit of emanuel gomes,the investigating officer from the brockton police department.gomes averred that he had neither threatened the neves family nor had he made promises regarding joaquim or jorge cooperation in the investigation.in addition,the government submitted two reports compiled by special agent thomas wlodyka wlodyka of the bureau of alcohol,tobacco and firearms wlodyka had interviewed both joaquim and jorge following the submission of their affidavits in support of awon motions.wlodyka reported that the brothers recanted their affidavits.jorge stated that awon attorney presented him with an affidavit to sign that awon attorney told jorge that the statement was basically what you said at the trial and that he did not review it prior to signing it.joaquim statement to wlodyka was consistent with his testimony at the evidentiary hearing.both men informed wlodyka their trial testimony was truthful.
following the evidentiary hearing,the district court denied both motions.the court did not consider roberto neves affidavit to be newly discovered.according to the district court,the fact that defense counsel failed to interview roberto neves prior to trial did not support a finding that his testimony was unknown or unavailable.further,it found that jorge affidavit did not support a new trial because the portion of his trial testimony recanted in the affidavit was not critical to the prosecution case.thus,even if it were omitted it was unlikely to result in a different outcome for awon.as to james louis affidavit,which was viewed with great skepticism,the court found it incredible on its face.the district court acknowledged that joaquim affidavit was the most supportive of a new trial.at trial,joaquim had provided the most damning testimony against awon.in the end,however,it found joaquim testimony at trial,and his testimony at the evidentiary hearing recanting his affidavit,credible.finally,without discussion,the district court stated that it considered awon argument that the government evidence was insufficient to meet the jurisdictional element of i unpersuasive.
the district court order denying the two motions was filed on july.awon filed a notice of appeal on august.this court held the appeal in abeyance pending the issuance of a certificate of appealability for an appeal of the denial of a motion under as required by c.on january,the district court ordered a certificate of appealability.
ii.discussion 
motion for a new trial 
awon failed to file a timely appeal from the denial of his motion for a new trial.consequently,that appeal must be dismissed.united states rapoport,cir stating that compliance with time limits set forth in fed.b is mandatory and jurisdictional.
the new trial motion,brought pursuant to,was denied on july,the day the district court also denied awon motion to vacate sentence,brought pursuant to.although awon cited the same grounds for both motions,they are subject to different time limitations for the filing of a notice of appeal.unless the district court grants an extension of time,which it did not do here,a party must appeal within ten days from the denial of a motion for a new trial made pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.fed.b a united states serrano,cir.awon filed his notice of appeal well out of time,on august,thirty days after the court order denying the new trial motion.
motion to vacate sentence 
the only appeal properly before us is from the denial of awon motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to.the issues,as identified in the certificate of appealability,are whether to vacate awon sentence because of the alleged newly discovered evidence in the five affidavits and whether the district court lacked jurisdiction under the federal arson statute.bui dipaolo,cir,cert.denied,d.
on an appeal from the denial of a motion,we review the district court legal determinations de novo and the court factual findings for clear error.united states,cir.
newly discovered evidence 
awon contends that the purported newly discovered evidence establishes his actual innocence.assuming arguendo that awon claims of actual innocence based on the evidence in question can establish some legally cognizable basis for a motion under section,the evidence proffered by awon falls far short of demonstrating his innocence.
we quickly eliminate awon and roberto affidavits because they do not meet the standard for newly discovered evidence.united states desir,cir.this court has held that a defendant seeking a new trial based on newly discovered evidence must prove four elements the newly discovered evidence was unknown or unavailable at the time of trial the defendant was duly diligent in trying to discover it the evidence was material and the evidence was such that it would probably result in an acquittal upon retrial.id.awon failed to prove that the information was either unknown or unavailable at the time of trial.
the new information in awon affidavit,james louis confession to awon that he was solely responsible for the second fire,was plainly available at the time of trial.united states,cir.in the affidavit itself awon asserts that on the day after that fire james louis had confessed committing the arson to him.why awon did not reveal the confession at trial but instead suggested that joaquim had set the second fire is best known to him.in any event,the concealed confession of his can not be deemed newly discovered.
roberto testimony was also available at the time of trial.awon argues that he had no reason to suspect that roberto had information germane to his defense and thus can not be penalized for failing to unearth and present roberto testimony.a defendant,however,must have been duly diligent in attempting to procure exculpatory evidence prior to trial.united states conley,cir.simply because it may not have occurred to awon and his counsel that roberto had information regarding the crime that does not mean they were duly diligent on the facts of this case.roberto was known to awon as the brother of joaquim and jorge,the government primary witnesses,both of whom were implicated in the crime.roberto and his sister,helena neves,were interviewed by the police during the investigation.indeed,it was helena neves,who was dating james louis,who contacted the police and informed them that louis and jorge were involved in the arson.moreover,the credibility of roberto affidavit was severely undermined,insofar as it related to conversations with joaquim,by joaquim later repudiation of his own affidavit and testimony at the evidentiary hearing.similarly,roberto averments that he and his family were threatened by the police were neutralized by the affidavits of detective thomas enos and special agent thomas wlodyka.enos and wlodyka,the officers primarily responsible for investigating the arson,denied that they had threatened roberto,or his family,with adverse consequences if they did not implicate awon.
on the other hand,james louis averments in his affidavit may indeed be deemed newly discovered.united states,cir concluding that,in the context of a rule motion,a willingness to testify may be newly discovered if he had invoked amendment privilege at trial.but like the district court,we view james louis affidavit as lacking in credibility for reasons apparent on its face and from the record.id.the trial court described james louis affidavit as incredible on its face.louis averred that he had conceived,planned,and committed the arson on his own based upon his unverified hope that awon,who
