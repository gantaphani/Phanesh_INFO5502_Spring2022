we conclude that the assistant united states attorney ausa erred in her statement that this is not a search for reasonable doubt,this is a search for truth we find no other error in the prosecutor summations and no procedural defect rising to the level of plain error.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment of conviction and sentence.
background 
the government case 
the evidence at trial,which we review in the light most favorable to the government,see united states gaskin,cir,established that williams,having previously been convicted of a felony,was found in possession of a weapon on july,when two new york city police department nypd officers heard gunshots coming from the area of marcy and lexington avenues in brooklyn and,upon arriving at the scene in an unmarked car,saw williams standing on the street,firing a gun.
officer kevin brennan and lieutenant christopher devaney were the principal prosecution witnesses.they were in an unmarked vehicle at the corner of marcy and lexington avenues in brooklyn at around on the night of july,when they heard about six gunshots,followed by as many as fifteen shots,coming from lexington avenue.as they turned onto lexington,they observed dozens of people running into buildings and jumping behind and under cars on the residential street.the officers first observed williams firing his gun as they drove up lexington avenue.they then saw him run across the street,in front of their car.williams,apparently unaware of the vehicle,next walked in their direction with the gun in his right hand.
officer brennan and lieutenant devaney testified that as williams approached,he eventually made eye contact with the officers.at this point,williams pinned his right hand to his side as if to conceal the weapon he was carrying.he then gestured toward the corner of tompkins and lexington avenues,as if to guide them there.when officer brennan responded by jumping out of the car and identifying himself as a police officer,williams began to run.
officer brennan pursued him.as he chased williams from six to eight feet behind,brennan saw williams toss his weapon to the ground in front of lexington avenue.brennan,who never lost sight of williams from the moment he first observed him,overtook williams only a few blocks away.officer brennan thereafter recovered a caliber pistol from the area where he had seen williams weapon discarded.the officers also found five spent caliber shell casings in the area where they had observed williams shooting casings shown at trial to have been fired from the pistol they had recovered.officer brennan testified that at the precinct that night,during arrest processing,williams asked him,in substance,why williams had been arrested when there was at least five guns out there.
the defense case 
in her opening statement,defense counsel predicted that officer brennan and lieutenant devaney would commit perjury about the events of july,when they testified at trial,and that their stories would defy common sense.the defense called two witnesses of its own.the first,lashanda haynes,testified that she was playing cards with her sister,williams,and a friend at a table outside lexington avenue when the shooting began.she ran,as did williams.she never saw him shoot a firearm,although she could not rule out the possibility that he had a concealed weapon.next,phillip martin,a retired nypd detective,testified that if someone is firing a weapon,police procedure requires that officers take cover and notify other officers of a description of the shooter and the direction of his travel.
the summations 
the prosecution initial summation began with a detailed discussion of officer brennan testimony,and how it alone was sufficient to establish that williams had possessed the gun and ammunition,as charged.the prosecution then reminded the jury about the defense contention,in its opening statement,that the officers testimony would defy common sense.after summarizing and criticizing arguments put forward by defense counsel in the cross examination of various witnesses such as that the officers testimony should not be believed because they never radioed a description of the man they saw or called for backup,the ausa said 
ladies and gentlemen,it the defendant suggestions that defy logic here.and you know why,because the evidence in this case is overwhelming.and so the defense has to grasp at straws,has to focus on distractions and that why you see a whole parade of these suggestions that just do hold any water.
they are distractions from the facts that are relevant and critical to the decision that you need to make in this case and that is whether the defendant possessed that gun and ammunition on july.
now,we just talked about a number of the irrelevant and distracting ways in which the defense has attempted to take your eyes off of the ball,to divert your attention from the real question that you have to decide.
now let talk about how it is that you know that officer brennan is telling you the truth.
app.the ausa then canvassed several reasons that officer brennan testimony should be believed,pointing,among other things,to the corroborating testimony provided by lieutenant devaney and to the forensic evidence.the ausa concluded by asserting that all the evidence,considered together,proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.
in the defense summation,counsel argued that a number of putative inconsistencies in the testimony of the prosecution witnesses rendered that testimony incredible and that the infirmities in this testimony,when combined with other alleged shortcomings in the prosecution case,precluded the government from meeting its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.the defense focused,among other things,on the supposed unlikelihood that officer brennan would chase after williams without ensuring the discarded weapon had been secured the absence of dna or fingerprint evidence the alleged failure of the officers to radio for help and the fact that no civilian witnesses had been called to testify for the prosecution.the defense concluded by telling the jury that after hearing all the evidence,you know what missing,a credible story,a story you can trust any assurances they got the right guy,any proof beyond a reasonable doubt.app.
on rebuttal summation,the ausa began by saying 
f aced with what is overwhelming evidence in this case,the defense just did the only thing that they can do,which is again to focus on distractions,things that do really bear on the fundamental question that you need to decide.let walk through some of the defense arguments and talk about why they do hold any water.
after going back through the arguments,evidence,and testimony in the case,the ausa closed with the following statement 
the defense has focused on distraction arguments to take your eyes off the ball.do do it.this is not a search for reasonable doubt.this is a search for truth and the truth is that the defendant possessed that gun on july.hold the defendant accountable with the only verdict that consistent with the evidence you have seen and heard in this case,a verdict of guilty.
app.defense counsel did not object to these statements.

after a short break following summations,the district
