defendant juan jos√© santiago was sentenced to twelve months in prison and ten years supervised release after pleading guilty to one count of failing to register as a sex offender.the terms of santiago supervised release included a series of special sex offender conditions,which he now seeks to vacate.there is merit to some,but not all,of santiago claims of error.in short,while a waiver of appeal serves to defeat the bulk of santiago challenges,we vacate one of the conditions of supervised release,which was imposed in santiago absence.
i.the start of things 
santiago story,inasmuch as it is relevant to this appeal,begins over a decade ago in florida.on march,a mulberry,florida police detective responded to a hospital emergency room for the reported rape of a girl.the girl mother,who was santiago girlfriend at the time,told the detective that the girl had said that her daddy,referring to santiago,had touched her privates.two days later,the girl was interviewed by the florida department of health child protection team.she told them that her daddy would take her and his pants off,would get on top of her and move around like in the movies she had seen with him and that he touched and licked her privates.santiago girlfriend confirmed that there were two pornographic videos in the couple night stand and consented to a search,which turned up both videos.santiago was arrested.
santiago was charged,under florida law,with one count of sexual battery on a person less than twelve years of age,and one count of lewd molestation.the sexual battery charge was later reduced to child abuse.santiago pleaded nolo contendre to both the lewd molestation and the child abuse charge.on july,santiago was sentenced to five years of probation for the child abuse charge,and ten years of probation for the lewd molestation charge,to be served concurrently.pursuant to the sex offender registration and notification act sorna,santiago was required to register as a sex offender,and keep his registration current,in all jurisdictions where he resided.
over the next couple of years,santiago repeatedly had trouble abiding by the terms of his probation.first,in july,santiago missed his court ordered curfew an arrest warrant was issued,but later withdrawn.a year or so later,in september,santiago moved from his approved residence to another residence without prior permission from his probation officer,and failed to pay his monthly cost of supervision.santiago admitted to the violations,and served days in county jail.upon release,his probation was restored.
the stint in county jail did little to improve santiago compliance.shortly after his release,in november,an arrest warrant issued because santiago had failed to register as a sex offender,neglected to report to the probation office,and had not paid court costs.a few weeks later,santiago probation officer reported additional violations santiago had once again moved from his approved residence without prior approval,had failed to successfully complete his sex offender treatment program,and had failed to pay court costs and restitution.
having exhausted the system goodwill,santiago had his probation revoked on august.he was sentenced to just over seven years in florida state prison for the child abuse charge,and five years for the lewd molestation charge,to be served concurrently.santiago was released from prison on november.at some point following his release,santiago moved from florida to puerto rico.
ii.the instant offense 
once in puerto rico,santiago again failed to register as a sex offender.law enforcement caught up with him and,on april,a federal grand jury indicted santiago on one count of violating for traveling through interstate commerce and knowingly failing to register with puerto rico authorities as required by sorna.
santiago decided to work with the government and he entered into a plea agreement.the agreement indicated that the sentencing guidelines yielded a recommended sentence of twelve to eighteen months,and that the government,in exchange for a guilty plea,would be satisfied with the bottom end of that range.the agreement also noted that the penalty for the offense charged included a term of supervised release that could range from five years to life.pertinent to our purposes,the plea agreement contained a waiver of appeal provision,which provided that should the court accept the agreement and sentence santiago according to its terms,santiago would be waiv ing and permanently surrender ing his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.
at the change of plea hearing,the magistrate judge explained to santiago the implications of the plea agreement,including the fact that santiago would be giving up his right to appeal the judgment and sentence.she also explained the penalties he faced,noting the applicable term of supervised release and the fact that santiago release would be subject to some conditions.santiago confirmed that he understood,and his attorney vouched for santiago competence to enter into the plea agreement.the court accepted santiago guilty plea only sentencing considerations remained.
on december,the probation office issued its presentence investigation report psr.the psr recommended in addition to less relevant things that a variety of special sex offender conditions be imposed,which generally speaking placed limitations on santiago contact with minors and required sex offender treatment with compliance monitoring.
santiago sentencing hearing took place on january.after some skirmishing not relevant to this appeal,the district court judge sentenced santiago to twelve months in prison followed by a term of supervised release.in accord with the psr recommendation,the judge,at the hearing,imposed a number of special sex offender conditions as terms of santiago supervised release.the court inflicted the conditions over the objection of santiago attorney,who argued that the record was bereft of any justification for such conditions the judge disagreed,finding the fact that santiago had pleaded nolo contendre to lewd molestation of his daughter in sufficient to warrant the special conditions.
the court issued its written judgment the same day as the sentencing hearing.in addition to the special sex offender conditions announced at the hearing,the judgment contained one additional condition,numbered thirteen in the judgment,which provided that santiago could not use or possess sexually explicit material or frequent any establishments providing pornography or sexual services.
iii.this appeal 
santiago comes to us with a circumscribed advancement.he does not challenge his sentence,his term of supervised release,or the general conditions of that release.rather he solely takes issue with some of the special sex offender conditions imposed by the district court.
first,he claims that a handful of the conditions were unwarranted because they were not reasonably related to his failure to register which is not a sex offense or any of the overarching goals of supervised release.the disputed conditions can be summarized as follows.santiago must have no unapproved contact via mail,phone,or electronically with minors undergo sex offender evaluation and treatment avoid entering,loitering,or working near any areas frequented by minors without probation approval not live near any area frequented by minors and finally refrain from living with minors unless probation gives the okay next,santiago argues that condition thirteen of the judgment recall this was the condition relating to sexually explicit materials and establishments,in addition to not being justified,was in violation of his right to be present because it was not announced at his sentencing hearing.
the government does not think we need to reach the merits of either claim.it retorts that pursuant to the waiver of appeal provision in his plea agreement,santiago gave up his right to appeal his sentence,including the special terms of his supervised release.
the multiple special sex offender conditions that santiago claims were baseless given the circumstances,and the unannounced condition thirteen,suggest distinctive concerns.and ultimately they require different results.as such,we take them independently.
iv.the supposed unwarranted conditions 
with respect to the conditions santiago claims were groundless,our inquiry,as the government suggests,starts and ends with the waiver of appeal contained in santiago plea agreement.santiago does not dispute that because he was sentenced in accordance with the plea agreement he is precluded by the waiver from appealing his term of imprisonment.rather,he attempts to draw a distinction between the prison term and his supervised release conditions.because,he says,the plea agreement was silent as to which conditions of supervision were to be imposed,and it did not make any recommendation one way or the other,the conditions fall outside the waiver scope.our jurisprudence is at odds with santiago position.
the waiver at issue here explicitly stated that santiago was giving up his right to appeal the judgment and sentence in this case.emphasis added.significantly,a supervised release term is part of a sentence.see united states brown,cir providing that a supervised release term is an integral part of a sentence and that a defendant can rarely claim unfair surprise when the resultant conditions of supervised release are imposed united states mandarelli,cir breyer,supervised release is part of a prison sentence,to be served after imprisonment.internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original the court,in imposing a sentence to a term of imprisonment for a felony or a misdemeanor,may include as part of the sentence a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release.
consistent with this prescript,we have routinely applied appellate waivers to preclude defendants from appealing their conditions of supervised release,where the waiver extended to the defendant power to appeal the judgment and sentence.see united states rodr√≠guez santana,cir defendant could not appeal special sex offender conditions in light of appellate waiver united states rivera l√≥pez,cir waiver of appeal precluded this court from reviewing defendant nightly curfew and electronic monitoring conditions united states nguyen,cir finding appellate review of a drug testing condition foreclosed by a waiver of appeal.as we said in rodr√≠guez santana,while addressing special sex offender conditions not unlike the ones santiago challenges here,a supervised release term is an integral part of a sentence generally encompassed within any agreement not to appeal a sentence.x at quoting brown,at.
given all this,we have no trouble concluding that the word sentence in santiago waiver encompasses every component of the sentence,including the term of supervised release and its attendant conditions,thus bringing the instant action within the waiver reach.having established the waiver scope does not,however,bring things to an end.the question of enforcement of the waiver remains.the general rule is that when knowing and voluntary,an appellate waiver is generally enforceable,absent an indication that the waiver would work a miscarriage of justice.rivera l√≥pez,at united states teeter,cir.
to assess how santiago waiver was we look to the plea agreement and the colloquy.see teeter,at.the plea agreement contained a clearly worded waiver of appeal,which explicitly stated that santiago was giving up his right to appeal the judgment and sentence should the court accept,and sentence him in accord with,the plea agreement.the plea agreement set forth both the potential term of incarceration,and the term of supervised release,faced by santiago.at the change of plea hearing,the magistrate judge clearly explained to santiago the implications of his entering into this agreement.she articulated the maximum penalties for the crime,including the applicable term of supervised release,and then explained that this term would be subject to some conditions,and that,should santiago violate those conditions,he would go back to jail for the full term.santiago confirmed that he understood.the judge also informed santiago that,by virtue of the waiver of appeal provision,he was giv ing up his right to appeal both the judgment and sentence.again,santiago understood.santiago attorney indicated that she had gone over the plea agreement with him,including the rights he would be relinquishing.she described their conversations as and intelligent.the magistrate judge found,and santiago attorney confirmed,that santiago was competent to enter the plea.
taking into consideration the exchange at the change of plea hearing and the language of the waiver itself,it is apparent that santiago relinquishing of his appellate rights was knowing and voluntary.the waiver of appeal itself was unambiguous and the judge sufficiently called the waiver to santiago attention while making sure he understood its ramifications.the fact that the plea agreement does not specify santiago conditions of supervised release is inconsequential a defendant need only understand how the right he is giving up would likely apply in the general sense,rather than the specific consequences of invoking it.see rodr√≠guez santana,x at citing united states ruiz,d.
that leaves santiago with just one more shot at sidestepping the waiver of appeal.and it is not a task easily accomplished.in our sound discretion,we may refuse to honor the appellate waiver if denying santiago a right of appeal would result in a miscarriage of justice.teeter,at.this exception is meant only for egregious cases and is to be applied sparingly and without undue generosity.sotirion united states,cir quoting teeter,at.
aware by his own admission of the difficulty of establishing a miscarriage of justice,santiago devotes little time to this issue on appeal.he only argues that it would be unreasonable to expect him to anticipate special conditions at the time he waived his right to appeal because he was not warned by the district court of the possibility of receiving harsh sex offender conditions of supervised release.this offering falls short.to successfully invoke the miscarriage of justice exception,a error will not suffice,rather there must be,at a bare minimum,an increment of error more glaring than routine reversible error.united states chambers,cir internal quotation marks omitted.no such error garden variety or otherwise invaded the proceedings here.
under ordinary circumstances,the district court has significant discretion in formulating conditions of supervised release.nguyen,at.the conditions must just be reasonably related to one or more of the goals of supervised release,the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,the need to deter criminal conduct,the need to protect the public,and the needed training,care,or treatment of the defendant.see rivera l√≥pez,at citing b u.d.at the same time,the conditions must involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary.d.with respect to conditions of supervised release,the hallmark that separates the permissible from the impermissible is whether,given the facts,a certain restriction was clearly unnecessary.brown,at.
while the conditions imposed on santiago were undoubtedly stringent,especially since the underlying offense was not a sexual one,the conditions were not so obviously unwarranted as to constitute a miscarriage of justice.santiago plead nolo contendre to lewd molestation in.since then,he violated the terms of his probation several times,and,in violation of sorna,failed to register as a sex offender in two jurisdictions.at the time the court imposed the disputed conditions,santiago living arrangements mirrored those from when the offense occurred,in that he was living in a home with his girlfriend and her minor children.couple this fact with santiago apparent inability to abide by or blatant disregard of the terms of his probation,his failure to register as a sex offender on more than one occasion,and the high recidivism rate for sex offenders,see smith doe,d united states sebastian,cir,the district court determination that special sex offender conditions were necessary to further the goals of supervised release most fitting,the protection of the
