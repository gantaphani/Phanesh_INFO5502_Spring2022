in this appeal we consider whether a plea was voluntary,as required by federal rule of criminal procedure b even though the united states district court for the northern district of new york norman mordue,judge did not inquire into a separate confidential cooperation agreement before accepting defendant plea.on the facts of this case,we conclude that the district court did not plainly err by accepting defendant plea in open court without referencing the separate confidential cooperation agreement.we also reject defendant claim that the government breached the confidential cooperation agreement by failing to move for a downward departure in his sentence.finally,we dismiss his claim that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective during the sentencing phase of the proceeding without prejudice to the filing,in due course,of a petition.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
huey tarbell tarbell or defendant appeals from a july,judgment of conviction entered by the district court.tarbell was indicted on april,along with numerous,for conspiring to distribute and possess,with the intent to distribute,kilograms or more of marijuana,in violation of b a and.on december,tarbell entered into separate plea and confidential cooperation agreements with the government relating to his role in the drug conspiracy.
the plea agreement provided that,in exchange for tarbell pleading guilty,the government would charge tarbell by information with one count of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute and to distribute kilograms or more of marijuana,in violation of a,b b,and.pursuant to that charge,and due to his prior felony conviction for a drug offense,tarbell would face a mandatory minimum term of ten years imprisonment,rather than a mandatory minimum term of twenty years imprisonment that he faced under the original indictment.
on the assumption that tarbell would assist the government investigations of drug trafficking activity,the confidential cooperation agreement stated that 
a t or before the time of sentencing,the attorney office will advise the court of the nature and extent of the cooperation and assistance provided by the defendant pursuant to this agreement.if the attorney office determines,in its sole discretion,that the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of other persons who have committed offenses,it may,in its sole discretion,credit the defendant in one or more of the following ways i move for a downward departure pursuant to either or both e or ii move to dismiss one or more allegations filed pursuant to concerning the defendant conviction for one or more felony drug offenses that trigger the enhanced penalty provisions of b.however,the attorney office has not promised that such motion s for departure or to dismiss will be made.whether and how to credit any proffered cooperation and assistance is within the sole discretion of the attorney office.
cooperation agreement,c.
both agreements were sent to the district court,but the confidential cooperation agreement was not filed,either on the court public docket or under seal.tarbell then pleaded guilty,in open court,before the district court on january.pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure b,the district court engaged in a colloquy with tarbell to determine whether his plea was knowing and voluntary.in particular,the district court told tarbell that as it stands right now it was bound to sentence him to a statutory minimum of months imprisonment after informing tarbell of this fact,the district court asked him whether,having been informed of the penalties,he was still pleading guilty freely and voluntarily.def.app x.tarbell responded that he was.id.the district court also asked whether there had been anybody at all,apart from the plea agreement,that made some promise to you in return for pleading guilty id.at.defendant answered no.id.defendant responded that he understood that,as part of the plea agreement,he would waive any right to appeal a sentence of months.id.at.the confidential cooperation agreement was not mentioned during the plea proceeding.
on july,prior to defendant sentencing,the government filed a confidential letter with the district court that it would not move for a downward departure under or e,because tarbell had not provided substantial assistance to the government drug trafficking investigations.the government explained that 
t o date,the defendant has provided no assistance to the dea or any government entity substantial or otherwise.the defendant has neither made controlled purchases of narcotics nor introductions of undercover agents to drug traffickers he has provided no information that has led to the execution of search warrants or even the identification of drug trafficking locations.thus,the government has not and can not move this court for a downward departure,pursuant to and e,from the statutory mandatory minimum sentence and advisory sentencing guidelines range in this case at sentencing as the defendant did not provide any assistance in spite of the numerous opportunities provided to him by law enforcement.
gov t letter to the district court ltr,july,emphasis removed from original.consistent with this view,the government requested that the district court impose the mandatory minimum sentence on tarbell.the district court sentenced tarbell to a term of months imprisonment on july.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,tarbell argues that his guilty plea must be revoked,insofar as it was not voluntary,as required by rule b,see note,ante,because the district court did not question him about the confidential cooperation agreement during his guilty plea tarbell also argues that the government breached the confidential cooperation agreement by not allowing him to cooperate and that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective during the sentencing phase of the proceeding.we address these arguments in turn.
the nature of the inquiry required by rule must necessarily vary from case to case,and is not subject to any general guidelines other than those expressed in the rule itself.mccarthy united states,d.by its terms,a variance from the requirements of rule is harmless error if it does not affect substantial rights.h.where a defendant never sought to withdraw his plea,and did not object at any time or in any way to the alleged rule violation in the district court,we review his claims on appeal for plain error.united states espinal,cir.the supreme court has instructed that a finding of plain error requires that 
there is an error the error is clear or obvious,rather than subject to reasonable dispute the error affected the appellant substantial rights,which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings and the error seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.

having conducted a de novo review of the record,we conclude that tarbell has not met his burden of demonstrating plain error with respect to the district court acceptance of his plea.the district court made it clear at the plea proceeding that it was bound to apply a mandatory minimum sentence under the plea agreement and the sentencing guidelines,and there is no evidence that the plea agreement was superseded by the confidential cooperation agreement,or otherwise dependent on the latter instrument.indeed,the plain terms of the confidential cooperation agreement,which,like the plea agreement,we examine under principles of contract law,see united states woltmann,cir plea agreements united states g
