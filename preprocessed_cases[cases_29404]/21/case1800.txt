defendant george campbell appeals from a judgment of conviction entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,raymond dearie,judge,following a jury verdict finding him guilty on four counts of armed robbery of banks,in violation of,three counts of armed robbery of post offices,in violation of,one count of conspiracy to commit those offenses,in violation of,and seven counts of using and carrying a firearm while committing a crime of violence,in violation of c.campbell was sentenced principally to a total of years imprisonment however,in light of an applicable extradition treaty,see treaty between the united states and costa rica for the mutual extradition of fugitives from justice,stat.the treaty or extradition treaty,and a condition imposed by the costa rican government in granting extradition of campbell,the district court ordered the bureau of prisons to release campbell after he completes an imprisonment period of years.on appeal,campbell contends principally that his overall sentence violates the terms of the costa rican government extradition decree,that his prosecution on the firearms counts was not authorized by the treaty or the decree,that the sentences imposed on six of the firearms counts violate the principles of apprendi new jersey,d,and that the sentences imposed on the conspiracy and substantive robbery counts exceed the statutory maxima for those offenses.campbell also makes,and challenges to his conviction.for the reasons that follow,we reject most of his contentions,affirm his conviction,and uphold the district court ruling that sentence may be pronounced in accordance with the sentencing guidelines guidelines so long as it is made clear by court order that campbell is not to be held in prison for more than years.however,there are flaws in the calculation and transcription of the sentence,and we therefore vacate and remand for recalculation and the entry of a corrected judgment.
background 
in october,members of a violent gang of robbers known as the forty thieves were arrested following a spree of armed robberies of more than banks and post offices in new york and connecticut.campbell,a core member of the gang,was arrested in maryland in december,but he escaped some weeks later by posing as another inmate who was scheduled for release.he remained at large while four of the gang members were convicted after a jury trial in he was finally arrested in costa rica in the summer of.
a.the extradition 
the united states submitted a formal request to the republic of costa rica seeking the extradition of campbell,also known as roland lavar campbell.the request was supported by an affidavit by assistant united states attorney ausa charles gerber dated june,ausa affidavit,together with,inter alia,a copy of the superseding indictment indictment,which included counts against campbell a copy of the warrant issued for campbell arrest and the affidavit of a postal inspector describing the investigation and the evidence that led to the indictment.the ausa affidavit described,inter alia,the elements of and maximum penalties for the charges against campbell,including the charges on which he was ultimately convicted,and it provided excerpts from the pertinent substantive and sentencing provisions of title of the united states code.
in a decree dated october,the costa rican criminal court granted extradition,except with respect to possible charges of concealment and evasion that it would deem,and imposed the condition,inter alia,that campbell would not be sentenced to more than years imprisonment.as translated,the decree stated,in pertinent part,as follows 
the extradition proceedings initiated by the government of the republic of the united states against ronald lavar campbell,george campbell,ramadan and ronald cutler are approved,subject to the following conditions that country representative must give a formal promise covering the following the person extradited will not be subject to life imprisonment.the person extradited will not be sentenced to death.a copy of the sentence,duly translated and authenticated,will be sent to this country.he will not receive a sentence of more than years.he will not be tried for crimes different from the ones for which this extradition is granted.the extradition is not granted for the crimes of concealment and evasion,which are time barred.
decree of third criminal court of san jos√© dated october,extradition decree quoted in order of costa rican superior court of criminal cassation dated december,court of criminal cassation order,at.the extradition decree was in all respects confirmed on appeal by the court of criminal cassation order.
the united states department of state,through the united states embassy in costa rica,provided assurances to the costa rican government in a diplomatic note state department note stating,inter alia,that campbell will not be sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment greater than years.state department note.in addition,the united states district court for the eastern district of new york issued an order stating the following assurances 
should the defendant be convicted of any of the crimes charged in the pending indictment in this district,the court,having sole discretion over the sentence to be received by the defendant,agrees that it will not sentence the defendant to a term of life imprisonment.nor will the court impose any sentence pursuant to which the defendant would serve a term of imprisonment of greater than fifty years.
order dated january,denis hurley,judge order,at.campbell was extradited to the united states in march.
b.the conviction and sentence 
following extradition,several counts against campbell were dismissed either before or at trial.of the remaining counts,the jury found him guilty on and not guilty on two.he was found guilty on one count of conspiracy to commit robberies of banks and post offices,in violation of count four counts of armed bank robbery in violation of counts,and,together with four counts of using and carrying a firearm in committing those bank robberies,in violation of c counts,and and three counts of post office robbery in violation of counts,and,together with three counts of using and carrying a firearm in committing those postal robberies,in violation of c counts,and.
following the jury verdict of guilty in march,and prior to campbell sentencing,the government sought clarification of the costa rican government position concerning the permissible form of campbell sentence.in response,the legal director of the costa rican ministry of foreign affairs legal department costa rican ministry sent the costa rican consulate in washington,a letter dated june,costa rican ministry letter,stating,as translated,that 
the guilty verdict issued in the united states against a person who was extradited from costa rica may make reference to the general amount of jail time to be imposed.however,both the dispositive part and the explanation of purposes must establish in a clear and manifest fashion that the maximum sentence to be served is fifty years,as provided by article of the costa rican criminal code.
costa rican ministry letter emphases added.the costa rican consulate forwarded that letter in spanish to the united states attorney office for the eastern district of new york,with a cover letter in english that stated that 
the verdict in the united states against an extradited person can refer to the total years that the accused can be indicted for.nevertheless,the sentence must state,in a clear and manifest way,that the maximum time the accused must serve is years.this would be the real serving time.
letter from costa rican consul general to united states attorney office dated june,costa rican consul general letter.
a presentence report psr was prepared on campbell.it stated that the maximum prison term on the conspiracy count was five years and that the maximum prison term on each of the seven robbery counts was years.on count,the first weapons charge,c required the imposition of a prison term,consecutive to any other sentence imposed.the psr stated that the convictions on the remaining gun charges,counts,and,would properly be treated as second and subsequent convictions under c,and thus would require prison terms each,to be served consecutively to each other and to any other sentence imposed,for a total of years,see c supp.ii.the psr concluded that campbell total offense level was,that his criminal history category was iv,that the resulting prescribed guidelines range was months years to life imprisonment on the conspiracy and robbery counts,and that that range must be imposed consecutive to counts,and which require a total of years pursuant to c,resulting in a total of years.the psr noted,however,that a s a result of the extradition treaty with costa rica,the defendant sentence appears to be restricted to a maximum of fifty years.
at the sentencing hearing in july,campbell argued,inter alia,that the costa rican criminal court specification t hat he will not receive a sentence of more than years meant that the sentence the court was to pronounce could not exceed years.the government argued that the letters of clarification received from the costa rican ministry and the costa rican consul general made it clear that a sentence of more than years could be pronounced,so long as the controlling decretal provisions made clear that campbell could not be kept in prison for more than years.
the district court rejected campbell argument and interpreted the extradition decree as meaning that campbell simply could not be required to serve more than years in prison.the court concluded that the appropriate course would be to impose the sentence as called for by the guidelines and lay all the facts out.sentencing transcript july,at.
after hearing from campbell himself,the court imposed sentence as follows 
the court sentences the defendant on counts,and,to months imprisonment subject,of course,to the statutory limitations with respect to the specific counts.
and on the firearm counts,which are counts,and,to a total sentence of years to run consecutively to the sentence imposed on the counts.
did i state that correctly 
philips ausa yes,your honor.
the court i intend to include on the judgment,and more likely than not,on the government has suggested to leave nothing to chance,an appropriate order making it absolutely clear what i believe the government obligations to be consistent with the terms of the treaty.and that will issue simultaneously,and in fact,be appended to the judgment as well.
the concurrent sentences of months years on the conspiracy and robbery counts,with a total of years imposed on the firearm counts to run consecutively,resulted in a sentence of a total of years imprisonment.the court appended to the judgment of conviction an order stating as follows 
p ursuant to the extradition agreement between costa rica and the united states,and the assurances made by the united states pursuant to an order issued by the honorable denis hurley,united states district judge,eastern district of new york,on january,which mandate d that the defendant serve a period of incarceration not greater than years,the court hereby orders the bureau of prison s to release the defendant after he serves a period of incarceration of years.any credit,except prior custody credit,shall only affect the term and not the maximum term of incarceration as established by the extradition agreement between the united states and costa rica.therefore,the defendant shall be released after he serves a period of incarceration not greater than years as established by the extradition agreement between the united states and costa rica,with no adjustments for good conduct time,or the sentence,with adjustments for good conduct time,whichever is earlier.
order dated july,judgment addendum,at.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,campbell argues principally that his conviction on the firearms charges and his overall sentence violate both the terms of the extradition treaty between the united states and costa rica and the costa rican government grant of extradition that his sentences on six of the firearms charges violate the principles of apprendi and that the sentences on the conspiracy and substantive robbery counts exceed the statutory maxima for those offenses.he also makes a variety of constitutional challenges to his conviction.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the conviction,and we see no violation of the treaty or the extradition decree but we remand for corrections in the calculation of the sentence.
compliance with the treaty and the grant of extradition 
campbell contends that his convictions on the firearms charges should be reversed,and those counts of the indictment dismissed,because the extradition treaty does not list firearms offenses within the scope of c as extraditable crimes.he also contends that those charges should be dismissed because it was not made clear to the costa rican government that the penalties for c convictions would be five years for the first conviction and years for every other conviction,to run consecutively to each other,and thus costa rica did not knowingly grant the extradition request with respect to those crimes and he contends that,in any event,his sentence violates the conditions of the grant of extradition.we reject all of these contentions.
compliance with the treaty 
it is well established that,under the international principle of specialty,an extradited defendant may not be tried for a crime not enumerated in the applicable extradition treaty.see united states rauscher.united states flores,cir.however,the question of whether an extradition treaty allows prosecution for a particular crime that is specified in the extradition request is a matter for the extraditing country to determine.see johnson browne.in johnson,in affirming the grant of a writ of habeas corpus for the release of a person who had been extradited by the dominion of canada for one offense but was imprisoned for a different offense that canada had held was not an extraditable crime,the united states supreme court stated that w hether the crime came within the provision of the treaty was a matter for the decision of the dominion authorities,and such decision was final by the express terms of the treaty itself.id.at.whether or not express terms in a treaty make the extraditing country decision final as to whether an offense is extraditable,deference to that country decision seems essential to the maintenance of cordial international relations.it could hardly promote harmony to request a grant of extradition and then,after extradition is granted,have the requesting nation take the stance that the extraditing nation was wrong to grant the request.
thus,although courts of the united states have authority to determine whether an offense is an extraditable crime when deciding whether an accused should be extradited from the united states,see,shapiro ferrandina,cir,we interpret johnson browne to mean that our courts can not another country grant of extradition to the united states.accord united states van cauwenberghe,cir,cert.denied,d mcgann united states board of parole,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d see also casey department of state,id.at a t a minimum,johnson means that an american court must give great deference to the determination of the foreign court in an extradition proceeding.giving the required deference,we will presume that if the extraditing country does not indicate that an offense specified in the request is excluded from the extradition grant,the extraditing country considers the offense to be a crime for which extradition is permissible.
in the present case,costa rica rendered its decision to extradite campbell to face all of the charges set forth in the indictment.see extradition decree.the indictment included the charges that campbell had committed offenses in violation of c.we must infer,therefore,that costa rica found the c offenses to be extraditable crimes,and we may not that decision.
the scope of costa rica grant of extradition 
it is also well established that even if the extradition treaty explicitly lists as extraditable crimes the offenses with which a defendant is charged,prosecution on those charges is barred if the extradition request did not list those charges or if the extraditing state declined to grant extradition for those crimes.see johnson browne,at.united states levy,cir united states flores,at shapiro ferrandina,at.this principle is reflected both in the treaty at issue here,see extradition treaty,art.iv,stat,no person shall be tried for any crime or offense other than that for which he was surrendered,and in the costa rican criminal court decree granting the extradition request,see extradition decree requiring an assurance from the united states that campbell would not be tried for crimes different from the ones for which this extradition is granted.
although our courts have authority to determine whether a prosecution in the united states for a given crime is within the scope of the extraditing country extradition decree,see,united states flores,at united states court may determine whether certain offenses which the government seeks to prosecute fall outside the contemplated scope of the foreign sovereign extradition decree fiocconi attorney general,cir.essential to determine,as best one can,whether the surrendering state would regard the prosecution at issue as a breach of its agreement to extradite the defendant in question,cert.denied,d,campbell contention that his prosecution on c charges went beyond the costa rican government extradition grant is meritless.
the united states government formal extradition request to the costa rican government attached a copy of the indictment,which included counts alleging that campbell violated c.the supporting affidavit explicitly addressed the c counts,inter alia,stating that they charged campbell with the use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence namely,the various armed bank and post office robberies charged in the superseding indictment ausa affidavit,outlining what the government would be required to prove to establish guilt on those counts,explaining what the c penalties were,and attaching copies of the applicable statutory and sentencing provisions.for example,the affidavit stated that 
i n order to convict roland lavar campbell of the offense charged in those counts,the united states must prove at trial that he knowingly and wilfully,during an sic in relation to a crime of violence the various robberies charged in the superseding indictment,used and carried a firearm.the penalty for a violation of section c of title united states code is a mandatory minimum term of five years imprisonment consecutive to the sentence imposed for the crime of violence for an individual s first conviction,and a mandatory minimum consecutive twenty years imprisonment for each subsequent conviction for violating the statute.
ausa affidavit.
presented with this affidavit and copies of the indictment and the statutory provisions,the costa rican criminal court granted extradition,and its decision was affirmed on appeal.we thus reject campbell contention that the costa rican government did not knowingly consent to his extradition to face c charges carrying cumulative penalties.
compliance with the condition 
campbell also contends that his sentence violated the terms of the costa rican government grant of extradition,which included the condition that the united states would not sentence him to a prison term longer than years.given the record of the communications between the two nations,and the district court judgment as a whole,we see no violation.
in the initial grant of extradition,as translated,the costa rican criminal court imposed the condition that the united states must promise that campbell will not receive a sentence of more than years.extradition decree.in response to that condition,the united states department of state promised that campbell would not be sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment greater than years state department note emphasis added,and the united states district court for the eastern district of new york gave the assurance that that court would not impose any sentence pursuant to which the defendant would serve a term of imprisonment of greater than fifty years order at emphasis added.
in light of the possible lack of congruence between the phrases will not receive a sentence and will not be sentenced to serve,the united states,following campbell conviction,sought clarification as to whether the judgment could permissibly announce a longer term,so long as campbell release was guaranteed after no more than years.the costa rican government plainly responded in the affirmative.the costa rican ministry stated that 
the guilty verdict issued in the united states against a person who was extradited from costa rica may make reference to the general amount of jail time to be imposed.however,both the dispositive part and the explanation of purposes must establish in a clear and manifest fashion that the maximum sentence to be served is fifty years,as provided by article of the costa rican criminal code.
costa rican ministry letter emphasis added.we think it plain that the costa rican government reference to verdict given its conception of a document that would not only announce guilt but would also impose a reference not to the jury finding but rather to the judgment of conviction.and plainly the costa rican ministry stated that so long as the dispositive part of the judgment made clear that campbell could serve no more than years,the judgment could permissibly make reference to the amount of jail time that would generally be applicable.our interpretation of the costa rican ministry letter is confirmed by the language of the accompanying letter from the costa rican consul general,which stated that 
t he verdict in the united states against an extradited person can refer to the total years that the accused can be indicted for.nevertheless,the sentence must state,in a clear and manifest way,that the maximum time the accused must serve is years.this would be the real serving time.
costa rican consul general letter emphasis added.
in accordance with these clarifications,the district court,after announcing a sentence of years,stated that in order to comply with the terms of the extradition decree the judgment would be clarified by an accompanying order making clear that campbell was to serve no more than years of that sentence.the court then attached to the judgment of conviction an order stating that campbell shall be released after he serves a period of incarceration not greater than years.judgment addendum at.that order constitutes an integral part of the judgment,and it clearly and dispositively establishes that the maximum sentence to be served by real serving time is years.accordingly,the sentence imposed complies with the terms of the costa rican government grant of extradition.
finally,we note that it was well within the discretion of the district court to impose its sentence in the form of a sentence with an order that exactly years be served,without any diminution for,good time credits,in order to ensure that campbell would be incarcerated for the full years permitted by the extradition decree.see,united states casamento,cir extradition decree requiring only that the maximum period of imprisonment may not in any event exceed years not violated by judgment sentenc ing the defendant to prison for years but order ing that he be released after thirty years internal quotation marks omitted,cert.denied,d.
b.the apprendi challenge to the c sentences 
at the time of campbell offenses,c,which prohibits the use or carrying of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence,provided that a defendant first c conviction requires imposition of a prison term of five years and that i n the case of his second or subsequent conviction under this subsection,such person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for twenty years.c supp.ii.campbell was convicted of c violations in counts,and of the indictment.because it was proper to treat campbell conviction on count as his first such conviction and his convictions on the other six counts as second or subsequent convictions under that section,see deal united states,d first,second,and subsequent firearms convictions may be established in the same trial,the district court sentenced campbell to terms on each of counts,and.campbell contends that the imposition of the sentences on those six counts violated the principle announced in apprendi because the status of these convictions as second or subsequent offenses was neither alleged in the indictment nor found by the jury.we disagree.
the apprendi court,though holding that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt,stated that that requirement is applicable only to facts o ther than the fact of a prior conviction.at.and this court has held that the fact of a prior conviction is not an element of a c offense.see,united states anglin,cir per curiam.thus,there was no requirement that the existence of prior convictions be alleged in the indictment or that any of the multiple firearms convictions returned by the jury be described by the jury as second or subsequent.
c.the guidelines calculations and the statutory maxima 
campbell contends that his sentences on the conspiracy and substantive robbery counts exceed the statutory maxima for those offenses.he also complains that the psr,relied on by the district court,misstated his adjusted and total offense levels and,independently of that error,invoked the wrong guidelines range.these contentions have some merit.we address them in reverse order.
first,the psr calculated that campbell total offense level was,that his criminal history category was iv which is undisputed,and that the prescribed guidelines range of imprisonment was therefore months to life.the correct guidelines range for that offense level and criminal history category,however,is to months.
second,the government concedes that the psr conclusion as to campbell adjusted and total offense levels was also incorrect.the psr initially calculated that his adjusted offense level was,the highest level for any one of his offenses.however,in an apparent clerical error,the psr later copied the adjusted offense level figure as rather than.this error,after the psr addition of five steps pursuant to guidelines in grouping campbell offenses,gave him a total offense level of rather than.the imprisonment range prescribed by the guidelines for the correct offense level of,with a criminal history category iv,is to months.
finally,the district court sentenced campbell to concurrent prison terms of months years on the conspiracy charge and each of the seven substantive armed robbery counts,stating that those terms were subject,of course,to the statutory limitations with respect to the specific counts.the statutory maximum for conspiracy under is five years months,and the statutory maximum for each of the postal robbery counts and the bank robbery counts is years months.none of the counts of conviction carried a statutory maximum as high as months.
campbell asks us to amend the judgment to reflect concurrent sentences,rather than sentences,on the substantive robbery counts,which would reduce his overall sentence from to years.the government urges us instead to remand to the district court for resentencing,pointing out that under guidelines b,the sentencing judge determines the total punishment to be imposed by selecting an appropriate punishment within the guidelines range,see,united states mcleod,cir,cert.denied,d,and reasoning that it is within the court power to sentence campbell to up to months the top of the correct guidelines range by imposing concurrent sentences of months on all but one robbery count,and one consecutive sentence of up to months on the remaining robbery count.given the plethora of errors in the calculation or pronouncement of campbell sentence,we conclude that it is preferable to remand to the district court for the imposition of a clear sentence that is correctly calculated under the guidelines and does not exceed any statutory maximum,with the eventual sentence again accompanied by an explicit instruction that the bureau of prisons must release campbell after he has served years in prison.
d.other contentions 
campbell also challenges his conviction,contending principally that he was denied effective assistance by his trial attorney,that his right to testify in his own defense was infringed,that certain of the trial court discovery and evidentiary rulings denied him a fair trial,and,in a brief filed pro se,that his prosecution and conviction on multiple firearms charges violated the double jeopardy clause.these contentions are meritless.
the performance of counsel 
campbell argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in various aspects of his performance,including failing to object to the seating of a bank security guard as a juror failing to call campbell brother as a witness to testify that he had regularly seen campbell in costa rica between may and october of,the period of the charged conspiracy failing to introduce snapshots of campbell in costa rica failing to conduct an effective of certain witnesses and failing to object to the mention of campbell escape from jail.in order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,a defendant must show that his counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness judged by prevailing professional norms,and that but for the deficiency,there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.see strickland washington,d.both prongs of the test must be met in order for the defendant to prevail.campbell has not met this test with respect to any of the challenged aspects of counsel performance.
jurors are presumed to be free of bias,see,united states brown,cir.bank employee not presumed to be biased with respect to a prosecution for robbery of a different branch of the same bank,cert.denied,d,and campbell has made no showing that seating the bank security guard in this case was prejudicial.
nor did campbell make any showing that either photographs of him in costa rica or his brother testimony that campbell was in costa rica at various times would have materially advanced his defense.the government did not contend that campbell was never in costa rica,but simply that he was present at the robberies in the united states on the dates alleged in the indictment.most of the testimony of whose omission campbell complains consisted of general statements that he had been in costa rica,apparently without pinpointing any particular date.in only one instance has campbell pointed to testimony that placed him in costa rica on a day on which he was alleged to be in the united states committing a robbery,and that testimony was in fact put in evidence.
finally,we see no substandard performance in counsel of the witnesses,which was intensive with respect to matters that tended to impeach their testimony,or in his decision to forgo objection to a witness reference to campbell escape from jail rather than have a parade of government witnesses testify about the escape.
the right to testify 
campbell also contends that the district court erred in failing to find that his trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by not advising him that he had a right to testify even if counsel recommended against it.it is established that counsel must inform the defendant that the ultimate decision whether to take the stand belongs to the defendant,and counsel must abide by the defendant decision on this matter.brown artuz,cir,cert.denied,d.
here,the district court conducted a hearing at which campbell trial attorney testified that he had told campbell that campbell could testify at trial if he wished and that campbell was fully aware of that right.the district court credited the attorney testimony and discredited that of campbell,noting that campbell had been aggressively involved in every aspect of his case and that it would be unreasonable to conclude that he was uninformed or had suddenly become docile regarding his right to testify.giving due deference to the court assessments of credibility,we see no error in its conclusion that counsel did not fail to render correct advice.
the discovery and evidentiary contentions 
campbell also co
