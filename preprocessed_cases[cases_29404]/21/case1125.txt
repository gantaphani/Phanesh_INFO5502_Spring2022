kenneth eirby complains that the district court impermissibly attributed to him,for sentencing purposes,a quantity of crack cocaine cocaine base greater than that described in the indictment and plea agreement.in his view,the resultant sentence and the methodology used to arrive at it intrude upon the prerogative of the grand jury and,in the bargain,offend the principles enunciated in apprendi new jersey,d.in a more global attack on his sentence,he also asseverates that the federal criminal statutes and sentencing guidelines are unconstitutional to the extent that they afford widely disparate treatment to cocaine in its base and powder forms.discerning no reversible error,we affirm.
background 
the facts are virtually undisputed.in late,law enforcement officers caught the appellant as he endeavored to peddle cocaine base.a federal grand jury sitting in the district of maine thereafter returned a indictment against him.the appellant eventually agreed to plead guilty to the first count of the indictment which charged him with conspiracy to distribute cocaine base and the government agreed to dismiss the second count which charged a specific distribution offense.like the indictment itself,a plea agreement the agreement,entered into between the appellant and the government under the aegis of.e b,mentioned b b and described the penalty which may be imposed upon conviction as a term of imprisonment of not less than five years or more than forty years the precise parameters limned in section b b.
based on the presentence investigation report,the district court,over objection,found the appellant responsible for grams of crack cocaine enough to subject him to a different penalty contained in b a because the indictment and the agreement each referenced section b b rather than section b a,the district court recessed the disposition hearing and offered the appellant an opportunity to withdraw his plea.
after considering the court offer for approximately five weeks,the appellant decided to proceed,but reserved the right to appeal the determination that section b a applied.the parties subsequently stipulated,for sentencing purposes,that the appellant was responsible for at least grams,but less than grams,of cocaine base,and that his base offense level was.
when the district court reconvened the disposition hearing,it rejected the appellant constitutional challenge to the disparity between cocaine base and cocaine powder.moving from the general to the specific,the court found that the appellant relevant criminal conduct consisted of distributing grams of crack cocaine cocaine base.after applying an appropriate reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see ussg,the court arrived at an adjusted offense level of.in conjunction with the appellant criminal history category ii,the adjusted offense level yielded a guideline sentencing range gsr of months.the court determination and its invocation of section b a brought into play a mandatory minimum sentence of months which,coincidentally,was within the gsr.starting from that baseline,the court departed downward for substantial assistance,ussg,and sentenced the appellant to serve a incarcerative term.this appeal followed 
discussion 
the appellant best argument is that the district court usurped the grand jury province by impermissibly substituting b a for b b.while this argument obliquely involves apprendi,he places his next three arguments squarely under the apprendi umbrella.he asserts that,drug quantity no longer can be treated as a sentencing factor,but,rather,must be treated as an element of the therefore must be charged in the indictment and proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the lower court determination,made pursuant to a standard,exposed him to a higher mandatory minimum sentence and,thus,offended apprendi and that apprendi requires a distinction,not drawn by the court below,between the quantity of drugs involved in an offense for the purpose of ascertaining the applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence and the quantity of drugs for which a defendant is responsible for the purpose of determining the applicable gsr.the appellant last argument assails,on constitutional grounds,what he deems the draconian nature of the criminal penalties that congress has attached to crack cocaine.
standards of review 
we pause at the onset to delineate the standard of review.the appellant squarely challenged the district court invocation of section b a and argued below that he should have been sentenced under section b b.since that argument presents an abstract legal question,our review is plenary.united states conley,cir.the same holds true for the appellant cocaine powder disparity argument.see united states gifford,cir holding that questions involving the constitutionality of statutes engender plenary review.in contrast,the appellant three claims are raised for the first time on appeal.as such,our review of those claims is for plain error.this entails a quadripartite showing that there was error that it was plain that the error affect ed substantial rights and that the error affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states gomez,cir.
necessary background 
before grappling with the appellant contentions,we offer some background,this court had held that the delineations contained in b were not elements of the corresponding offense,but,rather,sentencing factors relevant only for determining the penalty.united states lindia,cir.under that holding,specific drug quantities did not have to be charged in the indictment and the drug weights necessary to implement section b penalty scheme could be determined by the sentencing judge under a standard.id.at.the court decision in apprendi requires some rethinking of this approach.see united states robinson,cir explaining that apprendi shifted the tectonic plates insofar as criminal sentencing is concerned.
the core holding of apprendi is that,apart from the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must both be charged in the indictment and submitted to a jury for a determination under the standard.apprendi,at.under this holding,a finding of drug quantity which increases a defendant sentence beyond the otherwise applicable statutory maximum must be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.united states westmoreland,cir.to that extent,then,the notion that the quantity determinations demanded by section b are merely sentencing factors is no longer completely true.see united states duarte,cir united states doggett,cir.
still,apprendi does not call for full abrogation of our prior practice.in particular,the apprendi doctrine offers no advantage to a defendant who is sentenced to a term less than the otherwise applicable statutory maximum.we expounded on this point in united states caba,cir 
by its own terms,the holding in apprendi applies only when the disputed fact enlarges the applicable statutory maximum and the defendant sentence exceeds the original maximum.for this reason,apprendi simply does not apply to guideline findings including,inter alia,drug weight calculations that increase the defendant sentence,but do not elevate the sentence beyond the lowest applicable statutory maximum.
id.at citations omitted.this means that when a defendant is sentenced to less than the default statutory maximum for violating section a twenty years in prison,see b c apprendi is irrelevant.see united states terry,cir.in such circumstances,judicial determination of drug quantity under a standard remains a viable option.see caba,at united states baltas,cir.
the argument 
apprendi bears only a glancing relationship to the appellant first argument.the count of text of which is annexed as an appendix to this the appellant with participation in a conspiracy in violation of.that statute,as pleaded here,looks to b as the source of applicable penalties.since the appellant actually received a sentence below the default statutory maximum,a sentence less than the maximum delineated in b c,the sentence would withstand apprendi scrutiny even if the count of conviction mentioned no d
