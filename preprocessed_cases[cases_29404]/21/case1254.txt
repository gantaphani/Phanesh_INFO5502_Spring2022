this case requires us to decide whether a significantly sentence may be imposed in view of earlier sentencing leniency that turns out,after the fact,to have been unjustified.we conclude that sentences must be justified by reference to specific reasons that place the case outside the run of ordinary cases,and that the further the sentence departs from the typical sentence imposed for the conduct of conviction,the greater the justification that is required.in the particular circumstances of this case,we conclude that defendant sentence was reasonable.
background 
douglas arrest and prosecution 
from to,cameron douglas distributed methamphetamine and cocaine on behalf of suppliers in california.during that time,he was addicted to heroin and relied on the proceeds of his illegal activity to satisfy his habit.douglas was arrested for his part in the distribution ring on july.after his arrest,he was taken to a hospital and treated for heroin intoxication before being taken to prison.
shortly after his arrest,douglas agreed to cooperate with the government by testifying against his suppliers,eduardo and david escalera.after he agreed to cooperate,douglas was released from custody and placed under house arrest.while on home detention,he convinced his girlfriend,kelly sott,to bring him heroin hidden inside an electric toothbrush.when the heroin was found,douglas bail was revoked and he was remanded to the metropolitan correctional center mcc in new york.
douglas pled guilty to a superseding information on january.the information charged him with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and cocaine,in violation of and b a,which carried a mandatory minimum sentence,and with misdemeanor possession of heroin,in violation of and,for the incident that occurred while he was on pretrial release.because the government believed that the escaleras might have left the country when news of douglas arrest was made public by an online publication,the prosecutors agreed to allow douglas to be sentenced before he testified against his suppliers.
the guidelines sentencing range for douglas conduct was to months imprisonment.in his sentencing memorandum,douglas described his struggles with drug addiction and his privileged but troubled upbringing.in view of his addiction,douglas asked the court to impose a sentence of time served or,alternatively,a sentence of months imprisonment,which would have allowed douglas to enter the bureau of prisons bop residential drug abuse program rdap immediately the government characterized douglas cooperation as tremendously valuable and stated its intention to file a motion pursuant to e and to authorize the district court to depart downward from the mandatory minimum sentence of ten years imprisonment.
douglas appeared for sentencing on april.at sentencing,the government did not recommend any particular sentence,but it did file the departure motion.the district court richard berman,judge discussed the many letters submitted by douglas parents,former teachers,friends,and supporters expressing the view that douglas had finally bottomed out,and was resolved to overcome his addiction and disregard for legal constraints.the district judge noted that he thought this case and this sentencing may well be douglas last chance to make it.april,sentencing tr.at.the district court imposed a sentence of incarceration followed by a period of supervised release.
ii.douglas additional conduct 
unbeknownst to the district court and to the prosecutors handling his case at the time of his first sentencing,douglas had recently been discovered to be in possession of contraband yet again.while in bop custody,douglas had convinced one of his attorneys with whom he had begun a romantic relationship to smuggle approximately thirty unprescribed xanax pills to him in the mcc.he took some of the pills himself and provided others to other inmates.this additional misconduct came to the attention of the prosecutors only when they were asked to enter an immunity agreement covering douglas uncharged criminal activity to facilitate his testimony against the escalera brothers,who by that point had been located and arrested.notwithstanding the xanax incident,on october,douglas testified against david escalera,who was convicted by a jury and later sentenced to months imprisonment.
however,less than two weeks after the completion of david escalera trial,and before the scheduled separate trial for eduardo escalera,douglas was found in possession of contraband for a third time while incarcerated or under supervision.on october,a bop staff member suspicious of window coverings in douglas cell and douglas furtive movements searched his person and cell and discovered a piece of paper with traces of white powder on it as well as a small amount grams of an orange substance.later testing showed the substance to be suboxone,a drug used to treat heroin addiction,for which douglas did not have a prescription.although lab analysis of the powder on the paper was inconclusive,douglas later admitted the substance was heroin.after submitting to urinalysis,douglas also tested positive for opiates.douglas told prosecutors that he had found the heroin either in the television room or in the chapel.he told the government that he had not sought out the heroin and that it was not originally intended for him.
four days later,on october,the government filed an information charging douglas with one count of possession of a prohibited object while an inmate of a federal prison,in violation of a and b.the same day,pursuant to a plea agreement,douglas pled guilty.the agreement stipulated that douglas offense level under the sentencing guidelines was and that his criminal history category was iii.after giving douglas credit for acceptance of responsibility,the agreement calculated his guidelines sentence range as twelve to eighteen months imprisonment.the agreement preserved the government right to seek an enhancement for obstruction of justice if douglas had engaged in conduct,unknown to the government at the time of the signing of this agreement,that constitutes obstruction of justice.
in its presentence report psr to the district court,the probation office recommended a sentence of days imprisonment.according to the probation office,that recommendation was shorter than it might otherwise have been in light of administrative sanctions already imposed on douglas,which included eleven months disciplinary segregation in the special housing unit and eighty days canceled good conduct credit toward his early release.however,the psr was submitted before the probation office learned that douglas had misled the government about how he obtained the heroin.after douglas entered his plea but before he was sentenced,another mcc inmate a cooperating witness in another case informed the government that douglas had not found the heroin on the ground but instead had bought it from him.in short,douglas had not only purchased heroin while in prison,he had lied to prosecutors in an effort to mislead them about the seriousness of his conduct.as a result of this deception,the government elected not to call douglas as a witness at the trial of eduardo escalera.
at sentencing,douglas urged the district court not to impose additional punishment beyond the administrative sanctions he had already received.additionally,he urged the court to consider his history of drug addiction as a mitigating factor because his conduct was best explained not by a desire to break the law but by the effects of,among other things,opioid protracted abstinence syndrome opas the best solution to his problems,he argued,was not punishment but treatment.because he was approaching the eligibility period for rdap treatment at the time of his offense,douglas urged the court not to add time to his sentence,which would prolong the time before he could enter that program.finally,douglas noted the relative rarity with which drug possession in prison was prosecuted criminally and the small amount of drugs he had possessed.
the government sentencing memorandum urged the district court to apply a enhancement,pursuant to,an adjustment that would have raise
