application note to defines terms as they are used in section.the definition of felony conviction reads as follows 
felony conviction means a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed.a conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen years or older is an adult conviction.a conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen years is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted,a federal conviction for an offense committed prior to the defendant eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant was expressly proceeded against as an adult.

iii.new york youthful offender adjudications 
article of the new york criminal procedure law establishes the legal status of youthful offender,which courts may assign to convicted defendants between the ages of and who meet certain conditions.proc.law,mckinney.courts have the discretion to designate an eligible convicted defendant a youthful offender if in the opinion of the court the interest of justice would be served by relieving the eligible youth from the onus of a criminal record id.once a convicted defendant is adjudicated a youthful offender,his conviction is deemed vacated and replaced by a youthful offender finding,id,and the court imposes a youthful offender sentence under penal law.a court youthful offender finding and imposition of a youthful offender sentence are together designated a youthful offender adjudication.proc.law.
