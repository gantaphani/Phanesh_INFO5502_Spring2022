after a jury trial in july,michael pelletier was convicted of various counts related to his role in the importation,possession and distribution of marijuana he was sentenced to life imprisonment.on appeal,he asserts that the district court erred when it admitted certain testimony,improperly instructed the jury,and denied his motion for acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence.we affirm.
background 
we recite the relevant factual background in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states gonzalez ramirez,cir,cert.denied,d.the scheme at the heart of pelletier convictions was relatively simple.a confederate of pelletier either swam or was driven across the john river into canada from a point near madawaska,maine after meeting with canadian marijuana suppliers,pelletier associate swam back across the river,most often carrying the contraband in two,watertight duffel bags,although occasionally ferrying larger amounts.the purchase price of the marijuana was approximately per pound.pelletier,or those working under him,later sold the marijuana for per pound.
ii.evidentiary issues 
this appeal primarily invokes challenges to the testimony of pelletier former girlfriend and that of adam hafford,who was one of pelletier swimmers.pelletier attacks this testimony in two slices.the first cantle concerns evidence of pelletier criminal history.the second,directed only at hafford testimony,implicates the hearsay exception for statements against interest set forth in federal rule of evidence b.
pelletier prior crimes 
on the eve of trial,pelletier filed a motion in limine to exclude,inter alia,evidence of his prior drug convictions during a chambers conference prior to the first trial day,defense counsel agreed that pelletier would not object to testimony that he had been in prison,but counsel expressed his objection to testimony about the reason for pelletier incarceration,drug trafficking convictions.the trial judge expressed his view that he did think that gets in.the prosecutor responded that he did anticipate eliciting from any of the witnesses the reason why pelletier was in prison.at the same time,however,the prosecutor cited various authorities for the proposition that prior drug trafficking involvement can be admitted to prove a defendant knowledge or intent.
during the first day of trial,pelletier former girlfriend,kendra cyr,testified that pelletier had told her in january that he was going to jail for something he had done previously.pursuant to the parties agreement,the trial court instructed the jury that the fact of incarceration was offered for context only,and was neither indicative of pelletier character nor probative as to the pending charges.things did not go as smoothly when the subject of pelletier prior incarceration was next broached.
hafford testified on the third day of trial.he testified that he met pelletier in windham sometime between and.when asked why the two were at windham,hafford replied,um,he was there for drug charges,and i was there for at which point defense counsel cut off the testimony with an objection to the admission of pelletier criminal history the prosecutor immediately stated that he did claim it.at sidebar,he added that the testimony was elicited unintentionally,as the result of an question,and that he had no objection to the jury being instructed to ignore the testimony.defense counsel did not immediately agree,noting that the cat out of the bag.
after excusing the jury,the court stated,i guess my thought,as i began to hear the questions this morning,was that i was inclined to admit the evidence of the prior convictions anyway.the court reasoning was based on defense counsel of an earlier witness,jeff dubois,regarding purchasing marijuana from pelletier.dubois testified that he did not literally get the marijuana from pelletier,agreeing with defense counsel characterization that it would just mysteriously appear in his car.according to the court,this phraseology invite d the jury to allow an argument,if it is going to be made,that pelletier essentially had nothing to do with the fact that marijuana went into dubois car.in light of the apparent defense strategy of showing that pelletier was only involved with cash,and not marijuana,the court concluded that the testimony was probative as rebuttal to an assertion of ignorance or mistake.moreover,the court noted that any potential prejudice could be countered with a limiting instruction.
defense counsel reiterated the argument made in the motion in limine that,under federal rule of evidence,the probative value of the convictions was far outweighed by the unfair prejudice to pelletier.the government then suggested another basis for admissibility.noting that of kendra cyr had elicited testimony about pelletier potentially legitimate sources of income,the prosecutor posited that the prior convictions were probative of pelletier intent and knowledge.the court agreed,denied the motion in limine,and,at defense counsel request,immediately gave a limiting instruction to the jury.the court first instructed the jury that the evidence could not be used to show that pelletier is a bad person or that he committed the crimes for which he was standing trial,but only to show possible motive,his intent,his preparation,any plan,or absence of mistake or accident.both sides declined any further instruction.as pelletier counsel requested,the court final jury instructions on the prior crime evidence did not include the purposes for which the evidence could be used.
on the final day of trial,pelletier called his and former girlfriend rina pelletier to testify about his legitimate sources of income,including watchmaking and jewelry making.she also testified about her own employment,their joint purchase of a home,and profits pelletier made from selling certain property.on,the government asked several questions concerning michael pelletier drug trafficking activities and arrest in,prior to the charged conspiracy.the defense did not object to the.
pelletier argues that admission of hafford statement that pelletier was in jail for drug charges and the questioning of rina pelletier about michael pelletier criminal past violated federal rules of evidence and b.given the defense trial objection,we review the trial court admission of hafford statement for abuse of discretion.united states hicks,cir,cert.denied,d.the lack of objection to the government questioning of rina pelletier subjects that testimony to plain error review.united states rodríguez berríos,cir,cert.denied,d.there was no error in the admission of any of the testimony,plain or otherwise.
rule b prohibits the admission of evidence of a person other crimes,wrongs,or acts to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.b.while the rule allows such evidence as proof of motive,opportunity,intent,preparation,plan,knowledge,identity,or absence of mistake or accident,the other acts may not be used for the sole purpose of proving that a defendant had a propensity to commit a crime,see rodríguez berríos,at.
we employ a test to determine whether the district court abused its discretion under rule b.first,we evaluate whether the evidence has special relevance,that is,whether it is relevant to any purpose other than to prove that a defendant has a propensity to commit a crime.id.then,special relevance notwithstanding,we must determine whether the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by its danger of unfair prejudice.
pelletier first argues,without citation to case law,that the court committed reversible error simply because it admitted the testimony without the prosecution asking for it to reconsider its original position.we can find no support for this reasoning,and proceed to evaluate the district court decision under our test 
first,we agree with the district court that the of government witnesses opened the door to introduction of pelletier prior convictions.where defense counsel questioning raised the specter of pelletier having legitimate sources of income,and of not taking part in the delivery of marijuana which mysteriously appeared in a buyer car,there was no abuse of discretion in allowing the evidence in response,united states balthazard,cir finding no error in allowing evidence in response to issue raised by defense counsel.to the contrary,failure to allow such evidence could allow litigants to create misleading impressions,secure in the knowledge that the other side was barred from disabusing the jury.united states marin,cir quoting united states catano,cir.
pelletier next claims that the evidence of his prior drug crimes had no special relevance.we disagree.in the context of drug conspiracy cases,we have found prior convictions probative of knowledge and intent where they indicate a prior relationship between conspirators,united states landrau lopez,cir,and where they may be relevant to the defendant knowledge of the presence of contraband and intent to distribute it,united states nickens,cir.here,given pelletier apparent defense,these issues were squarely even if only implicitly placed before the jury.
pelletier argues that none of the permissible b factors were genuine issues in the case.instead,he claims that the defense strategy was to undermine government witness credibility,rather than to contest any particular aspect of the case.based on our review of the transcript of the proceedings,this claim rings hollow.t he simple fact that the defendant did not argue lack of knowledge or intent would not,by itself,remove those issues from the case.united states ferrer cruz,cir.where,as here,the defendant did not stipulate to the court that he would not dispute those issues such that the trial court would have been justified in preventing the very conducted below,the court was well within its discretion in admitting the evidence under rule b.see id.at.
we also have little difficulty concluding that the probative value of the evidence exceeded any unfair prejudice to pelletier.as we noted in the b analysis,the evidence was probative of pelletier knowledge and intent,and served to rebut inferences raised in.moreover,the court limiting instruction cabined any potential prejudice.see united states ofray campos,cir.finally,to the extent that pelletier now claims that the limiting instruction was defective because it did not pare down the list of permissible uses of the evidence,we note that trial counsel was apprised of the proposed language,declined an opportunity to provide the court with any changes,and again declined comment after the instruction was read to the jury.we thus deem his challenge to the limiting instruction waived see united states medina,cir finding waiver in response to a party considered decision not to avail itself of a procedural right 
based on the foregoing,we conclude that the testimony regarding pelletier prior crimes was properly admitted.
michael easler statements against interest 
hafford testified that pelletier had recruited him to help smuggle marijuana,asking hafford to call when hafford got out of prison.hafford did,in fact,connect with pelletier upon his release in.he testified that at a june meeting,pelletier offered him two jobs swimming marijuana across the river for pelletier,and finding a man named michael easler,who pelletier claimed had robbed him of.coincidentally,hafford had met easler during his earlier prison stint,and although the two did not discuss pelletier,hafford testified that before he left prison he learned that easler had worked for pelletier.
that brings us to the second evidentiary challenge,to hafford testimony about a conversation that he had with easler while both were in a maine county jail in.over defense counsel hearsay objection,which was considered at a sidebar conference,hafford testified that easler told him that he was in jail for drug trafficking that he had been smuggling marijuana for pelletier by swimming across the john river with sixty pounds of marijuana beginning in springtime and ending when there was ice in the water and that he had stolen from pelletier.hafford testimony about easler comments was undoubtedly hearsay,as it was offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.c and.the trial court,however,accepted the government argument that it was admissible as an exception to the hearsay prohibition pertaining to statements against interest 
a statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant pecuniary or proprietary interest,or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability,that a reasonable person in the declarant position would not have made the statement unless believing it was true.a statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement 
pelletier claims on appeal that easler statements did not satisfy rule b.he also claims that the admission of easler statements violated his rights under the sixth amendment confrontation clause.this latter argument was not raised below,and is therefore reviewed only for plain error.there was no error under either theory.
pelletier first argues that easler statements to hafford do not satisfy b because they are not against his penal interest,or at least not sufficiently so to warrant their admission.the construction of the evidentiary rule presents a question of law and is subject to de novo review.united states barone,cir.the application of the rule to particular facts is reviewed for abuse of discretion.id.a statement is admissible as against the declarant penal interest if it tend s to subject the declarant to criminal liability to such an extent that a reasonable person would not make the statement unless it were true.united states jiménez,cir.t his question can only be answered in light of all the surrounding circumstances.barone,at quoting williamson united states,d.
in support of his argument,pelletier notes that easler statements to his fellow inmate were mere boasts,and were indistinguishable from the braggadocio and boasting that we have previously found lacking in reliability.see,united states connolly,cir.this reliance on connolly is misplaced.connolly,and cases it relies on,involved recantations,which we have described as generally viewed with considerable skepticism.id.at quoting united states carbone,cir.easler comments were the opposite of a recantation.indeed,easler implicated himself in the very conspiracy for which pelletier was convicted.
pelletier also suggests that by the time easler made those statements,he had already been indicted on charges related to this case and thus could not have believed his statements to hafford would further subject him to criminal liability.this argument is meritless the statements inculpate d him in criminal acts and conspiracies with others to commit criminal acts.barone,at.they also demonstrated an insider knowledge of a criminal enterprise and its criminal activities,which is another indication that the statements were against his penal interest.id.against this backdrop,we conclude that easler statements were sufficiently adverse to his penal interests to fall within rule b.
our inquiry does not end there,however,as the rule also requires corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.it is not necessary that the corroboration consist of independent evidence supporting the truth of the matter asserted by the hearsay statements,but evidence that clearly indicates that the statements were worthy of belief,based upon the circumstances in which the statements were made.barone,at.
the thrust of pelletier argument is that easler had a strong motive to lie because he had stolen a considerable amount of money from pelletier and would therefore benefit from pelletier lengthy incarceration.however,the fact that easler made the statements to fellow inmate hafford,rather than in an attempt to curry favor with police,cuts in favor of admissibility.see id.at finding fact that declarant made statements to relatives rather than police a corroborating circumstance.pelletier also claims that easler attempt to minimize his own role as little more than that of a swimming drug mule,while at the same time puffing up pelletier role as ringleader,suggests untrustworthiness.although this may be a plausible view of easler statements,it is not the only one.the record reflects that easler description of his involvement tracked hafford description of his own aquatic smuggling.this suggests that easler was not,in fact,minimizing his role in the conspiracy.
t he b corroboration inquiry is concerned only with the admissibility of hearsay evidence based upon its trustworthiness,a determination committed to the sound discretion of the district court.id.even where the call is close,and we do not find to it be especially close here,we respect the district court determination,absent clear abuse.barone,at.we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting easler statements under federal rule of evidence b.
confrontation clause 
the confrontation clause provides that i n all criminal prosecutions,the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.const.amend.vi.in davis washington,d,the court held that the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial hearsay.id.at.thus,t he threshold question in every case is whether the challenged statement is testimonial.if it is not,the confrontation clause has no application.united states figueroa cartagena,cir quoting whorton bockting,d.
the testimony about easler statements during conversation was subject to in court.the evidence was not contained in ex parte testimony or an affidavit.the primary purpose of the statements was not the establishing or proving of some fact at trial.bullcoming new mexico,d id.sotomayor,concurring,at michigan bryant,d.
although we have not previously had occasion to apply davis to the situation presented here statements made by one inmate to another we have little difficulty holding that such statements are not testimonial.our position is consistent with that of both the supreme court,see davis,at.noting,in dicta,that statements from one prisoner to another are clearly nontestimonial citing dutton evans,d plurality opinion,and other circuit courts that have held inmate conversations to be nontestimonial,see united states smith,cir unpublished united states spotted elk,cir united states johnson,cir united states johnson,cir unpublished see also united states smalls,cir finding statement made to confidential informant nontestimonial where declarant knew informant only as an inmate united states johnson,cir same.
moreover,easler jailhouse statements to hafford bear none of the characteristics of testimonial hearsay.they were made not under formal circumstances,but rather to a fellow inmate with a shared history,under circumstances that did not portend their use at trial against pelletier.see davis,at.an accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.quoting crawford washington,d see also united states brito,cir describing testimonial statements as those that a declarant would reasonably understand will be preserved for prosecutorial use horton allen,cir finding statements where they were part of a private conversation with a officer.accordingly,we conclude that the confrontation clause was not implicated by the admission of hafford testimony 
iii.jury instructions 
pelletier was convicted of,inter alia,conspiracy to import marijuana and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana.see b a vii,b g.at the close of evidence,the trial judge first instructed the jury on the elements of conspiracy,including the requirement that the government prove that pelletier intended that the underlying crimes importation of marijuana and possession with intent to distribute marijuana be committed.
the court instruction on the underlying importation crime included the following language it is against federal law to import marijuana into the united states.to import means to bring or transport into the united states from someplace outside the united states.with respect to distribution,the charge stated it is against federal law to have marijuana in your possession with the intention of distributing it to someone else,and it is against it is against federal law to distribute marijuana.
pelletier argues that the instruction on importation was missing two elements related to scienter that the importation was knowing and intentional and that pelletier knew the marijuana came from outside the united states.see united states geronimo,cir t o convict a principal actor of importing a controlled substance,the prosecution must prove that the accused knew the drugs were imported.he cites a similar putative defect in the distribution instruction that the instruction lacked the elements of specific intent to distribute,as well as knowing and intentional possession.united states dyer,cir w e have consistently held that to prove possession with intent to distribute in violation of,the government must establish that the defendant knowingly and intentionally possessed a controlled substance with specific intent to distribute,cert.denied,d.
as no objection was lodged at trial,we review for plain error.united states garcia pastrana,cir noting that plain error standard requires a defendant to show an error that was plain,obvious and clear under current law,prejudicial,affected the outcome of the district court proceedings,and that seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings quoting united states griffin,cir,cert.denied,d.an unpreserved objection to a jury instruction will only rarely justify reversal of a conviction.id.citing united states weston,cir.
the government claims that there was no error,citing to the court preliminary instructions given prior to the parties opening statements which included the following language 
the underlying crime of importing a drug requires intentional and knowing importation of that drug and knowledge that the drug came from outside the united states.
the underlying crime of possessing a drug with the intent to distribute it requires intentional possession of the drug with the specific intent to transfer it to someone else.
even if we assume,however,that the preliminary instructions did not cure subsequent flaws in the final instructions,pelletier is not necessarily entitled to relief.a trial court failure to instruct the jury on all statutory elements is not a structural error,and thus pelletier must show prejudice to warrant reversal of his conviction.neder united states,d united states hebshie,cir.to meet this burden,pelletier must show a reasonable probability that,but for the error claimed,the result of the proceeding would have been different.hebshie,at united states moran,cir noting that,in context of jury instructions,plain error requires showing that allegedly erroneous instruction affected outcome of trial.we can affirm the conviction if the result would quite likely have been the same despite an erroneous instruction.hebshie,at quoting united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
while the final instruction easily and quickly could have been corrected if either the defense or prosecution had brought the issue to the court attention,we nevertheless conclude that the result at trial was quite likely unaffected.with respect to the importation charge,pelletier cyr testified about meeting pelletier canadian drug source at least five times.she also related pelletier tale of hiding money in his wheelchair seat during a trip to canada.hafford,in addition to his testimony about his conversations with easler,testified that pelletier told him how the scheme worked.the evidence was thus overwhelming that pelletier knew the marijuana he was selling came from outside the united states.additionally,cyr testimony that pelletier informed her that easler was bringing marijuana from canada,distributing it for him,and bringing him drug sale proceeds which cyr testified she counted and stacked with pelletier proved beyond doubt pelletier knowledge and intent.accordingly,the instruction on the count charging conspiracy to import was not plainly erroneous.
we ha
