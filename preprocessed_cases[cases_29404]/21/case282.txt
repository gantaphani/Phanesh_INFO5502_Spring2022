seamus maguire pleaded guilty to a charge of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.the district court imposed a month incarcerative sentence the maximum allowed under the statute of conviction.see b d.dismayed by the length of his sentence,the appellant concocts a carefully contrived casserole of claims of error.finding this repast indigestible,we affirm.
background 
where,as here,a sentencing appeal follows a guilty plea,we glean the relevant facts from the colloquy,the unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report psi report,and the record of the disposition hearing.united states vargas,cir.on the evening of june,state and local law enforcement officers detained the appellant and administered miranda rights,see miranda arizona,after he was seen selling drugs in union,maine.the appellant admitted that in the surveilled sale he had sold pounds of marijuana for roughly.he likewise admitted that he recently had acquired around pounds of marijuana and sold to pounds of it to a customer in new hampshire.moreover,the appellant acknowledged that he had to pounds of marijuana in a stash house in portland,maine,and he offered to lead the officers to it.
the officers accepted the appellant invitation.en route,the appellant rethought his original estimate and told the officers that the amount of marijuana at the stash house was only to pounds.the officers retrieved the marijuana,which weighed pounds.
on september,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of maine indicted the appellant for,inter alia,possession of marijuana with intent to distribute see a.the indictment contemplated that b d,which stipulates a maximum sentence of years for distribution of up to kilograms of marijuana,would apply.
the appellant moved to suppress the statements that he had made following his arrest.at the suppression hearing before a magistrate judge,the appellant testified that he had twice requested an attorney during the stop,only to be ignored.he further testified that he had cooperated in part because an officer had threatened to arrest everyone he knew if he did not.four law enforcement officers testified to the contrary.
the magistrate judge found that the appellant had neither asked for an attorney nor been subjected to threats.after reviewing the credible evidence,the magistrate judge recommended against suppression.the district judge accepted the magistrate judge findings and recommendations 
after the denial of his motion to suppress,the appellant entered a guilty plea.the hearing was uncharacteristic the district court found the appellant demeanor disrespectful and admonished him twice before eventually accepting the change of plea.
the district court convened the disposition hearing on november.the court set the base offense level bol at,attributing pounds kilograms of marijuana to the appellant.the court then found that the appellant had perjured himself at the suppression hearing and adjusted the bol upward by two levels for obstruction of justice.see ussg.the court then declined to credit the appellant for acceptance of responsibility,see id,noting both the appellant perjurious testimony and his flippancy during the colloquy.finally,the court placed the appellant in criminal history category 
these calculations yielded a guideline sentencing range gsr of to months.however,the maximum sentence allowable under the statute of conviction was only months.see b d.when the bottom of a properly calculated gsr exceeds the maximum sentence allowable under the statute of conviction,the latter becomes the guideline sentence.see ussg a.cognizant of this principle,the court imposed a month incarcerative term.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
the appellant assigns error to the sentencing court calculation,its enhancement,its refusal to reduce the offense level for acceptance of responsibility,its eschewal of either a downward variance or departure,and its choice of a month sentence.we address these assignments of error sequentially.
drug quantity.
in cases,the amount of drugs attributable to a defendant is an important datum,which bears heavily on his likely sentence.here,the district court found the appellant responsible for pounds kilograms of marijuana.it predicated this finding on the appellant own statements to the police,summing the weights that the appellant admitted to selling on the day of the arrest pounds,the marijuana seized at the stash house pounds,and his estimate of what he had sold to the new hampshire customer pounds.
we review a sentencing court factual findings,including its findings as to drug quantity,for clear error.see united states platte,cir.absent an error of law and none is apparent here a sentencing court does not clearly err in making a determination so long as the approximation represents a reasoned estimate of the actual quantity.united states cintr√≥n echautegui,cir.
the appellant challenge to the district court determination is a bit of a paradox he faults the court for its reliance on the statements that he himself freely made when he was arrested.embracing language from one of our prior decisions,the appellant says his account was too thin or too improbable or too likely to be mere boasting to warrant the court imprimatur.united states marquez,cir.in support,the appellant avers that his original of the amount of marijuana at the stash house,coupled with his fear of harm to his family,indicate that his statements were unreliable.
we start with the unremarkable proposition that a defendant voluntary statements,made after receiving miranda warnings,can be used against him and that,in the ordinary course,such statements can constitute strong evidence of his guilt.see,miranda,at.this case falls within that unremarkable proposition,not within any exception to it.the court below,which saw and heard the appellant and the other witnesses at first hand,concluded that there were enough badges of reliability to render the appellant estimates trustworthy.
this conclusion is entirely supportable.for one thing,the appellant made his statements after he had been arrested,thus minimizing any incentive to exaggerate.for another thing,the appellant apparently cooperated willingly with the officers.there were,the court found,no threats of harm to the appellant family.finally,the pricing structure of the appellant avowed sale to his new hampshire customer to pounds of marijuana for around corresponded to the pricing structure of his surveilled sale pounds of marijuana for roughly.
to say more on this topic would be pointless.the district court determination was not clearly erroneous but,rather,echoed the appellant own statements statements that bore the hallmarks of reliability.consequently,the appellant is hoist with his own petard.
obstruction of justice.
we turn next to the enhancement for obstruction of justice.once again,our review is for clear error.united states akitoye,cir.
the sentencing guidelines empower the district court to enhance a defendant offense level by two levels if the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded,or attempted to obstruct or impede,the administration of justice.ussg.such an enhancement may be based on a finding that the defendant committed perjury during the course of the case.see akitoye,at.but an enhancement for obstruction of justice based on perjury requires something more than a simple asymmetry in the testimony in the case.see id.at.for a sentencing court to impose such an enhancement,the court must independently find by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant deliberately lied about a material matter.see united states shinderman,cir.
the enhancement in this case was based on the appellant testimony at the suppression hearing.but the appellant contends that the district court never found as a fact that he had willfully lied.elevating semantics to an art form,the appellant suggests instead that the court merely found the officers contradictory testimony more credible.
the record belies this suggestion.the court carefully considered the appellant tale of ominous threats and ignored entreaties for counsel.the court rejected this tale as apocryphal.in doing s
