oladimeji alli,a former employee of the united states postal service,pleaded guilty to mail theft after he was caught stealing letters containing credit cards.alli admitted that he had intended to send the cards to a contact in the netherlands in exchange for money.he was sentenced to months in prison.in this appeal,alli raises several challenges to the way his sentence was calculated.after careful consideration,we affirm the sentence.
in december,alli was a temporary employee at a branch of the united states post office in providence,rhode island.his duties included sorting bulk mail.on december,alli dropped off a package,addressed to a destination in the netherlands,at a united parcel service ups facility in warwick,rhode island.finding the package suspicious,ups workers opened it,discovered nine credit cards in nine different names,and then called the state police.the police,in turn,called the post office where alli worked to inquire about alli,whose return address was on the package.postal service inspectors began watching alli at work,and in january they saw him take letters from a mail tray and hide them.two days later,an inspector placed about letters containing credit cards onto alli mail tray.while the inspectors watched and a video camera recorded,alli pocketed two letters containing credit cards.moments later,an inspector confronted alli and escorted him to a conference room where police officers were waiting.
after receiving miranda warnings,alli admitted stealing the two letters with the intention to take credit cards from them.he also admitted that he had stolen the nine credit cards found in the ups package by removing them from letters he had taken from mail trays with the intention of sending the purloined cards to contacts in the netherlands,who had promised to pay him for the cards in a later search of alli apartment,the police found still another credit card,which alli also admitted to having stolen.in april,alli was charged with postal theft in violation of.he pleaded guilty and was sentenced in april to months in prison.
the district judge presiding over alli sentencing hearing understood that he was operating under an advisory guidelines system to calculate the sentence,he began with a base offense level of six to which he added an enhancement pursuant to ussg b e because the loss occasioned by alli offense was more than but less than.the judge then added a separate enhancement after concluding that alli offense involved the production or trafficking of any unauthorized access device or counterfeit access device.b b.on appeal,alli contests the enhancement,arguing that the district court improperly calculated the amount of financial loss caused by his offense.he also challenges the enhancement on the ground that b b does not simply require trafficking in a general sense,but rather the violation of a specific federal statute criminalizing the trafficking of credit cards,e.finally,alli contends that his sentence is unreasonable and therefore must be vacated under the reasonableness standard of review.
we review a district court interpretation and application of the federal sentencing guidelines de novo,united states robinson,cir,but review the court related factual findings,including its calculation of loss amount,for clear error.see united states,cir.
amount of loss 
section b calls for a sentencing court to increase an offender offense level in larceny and theft cases according to the amount of loss resulting from the offense.an application note to that guideline states that loss is the greater of actual loss or intended loss,cmt.a.all agree that no actual loss occurred as a result of alli theft.therefore,the district court calculated intended loss and did so by adding together the credit limits of the stolen credit cards,arriving at a total of this was the same amount recommended by the probation officer who prepared alli investigation report psr.
alli timely objected to the loss calculation in the psr and renewed his objection at his sentencing hearing.the crux of his objection is that because there is no evidence that he himself clearly intended to use the card,the amount of loss should be limited to per card pursuant to application note f to guideline.that note states,in a case involving any counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device,loss includes any unauthorized charges made with the counterfeit access device or unauthorized access device and shall not be less than per access device,cmt.f i.
the district court,however,found it of no importance that alli did not intend to use the cards to their full limit or indeed at all.rather,the court found that alli sold the cards knowing they would be used for unlawful gain and concluded that alli therefore had a reasonable expectation,if not knowledge,that the cards would be used to the fullest extent possible.this was enough,the court determined,to demonstrate intended loss we must therefore decide whether a loss that an offender knows will occur,or should reasonably expect to occur,as a direct result of his offense counts as an intended loss for purposes of an enhancement under.
the guidelines define intended loss as the pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense,including intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur,cmt.a ii.the government bears the burden of proving intended loss by a preponderance of the evidence,although a reasonable estimate of loss will suffice.united states egemonye,cir citing ussg cmt.this circuit has not previously decided whether reasonably foreseeable loss qualifies as intended loss,and the approaches taken by other circuits vary.compare united states staples,cir absent other evidence of the defendant intent,the size of the maximum loss that a fraud could have caused is circumstantial evidence of the intended loss which satisfies the preponderance of the evidence standard.with united states sanders,cir o ur case law requires the government prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had the subjective intent to cause the loss.united states morrow,cir w e look to actual,not constructive,intent.
for our part,we think it sensible in this context to follow the rule that a person is presumed to have generally intended the natural and probable consequences of his or her actions.see,united states jacobs,cir united states fortier,cir endorsing an increased sentence under the guidelines for harms that were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of,although not directly caused by,a defendant conduct.thus,in cases like the present one where the defendant criminal role was to convey stolen credit cards to someone else,intended loss includes losses that might naturally and probably flow from his unlawful conduct.jacobs,at.although alli never intended to be the ultimate user of the stolen cards and thus lacked intent to run up charges on the cards himself,he specifically intended to sell the cards to someone who was quite likely to do so.as the district court stated,
i t pretty clear that alli was a participant in this scheme,he was well aware,obviously,of the fact that these individuals were using the card s for unlawful purposes and he was selling them the card s,that was a further clue that these individuals were going to use the cards to the maximum extent permissible.
alli was aware of the unlawful aims harbored by his customers in the netherlands,was a knowing participant in their larger scheme,and specifically intended to sell them the stolen cards.it was naturally and probably to be expected as a result of alli actions that those contacts would charge as much as possible on the cards.accordingly,we find that the district court attribution to alli of intended loss totaling the stolen cards aggregate credit limit of was not clearly erroneous.
trafficking 
the district court,again following the recommendation of the psr,imposed a upward adjustment to alli offense level after determining that his crime involved trafficking of credit cards.the relevant guideline states if the offense involved the production or trafficking of any unauthorized access device or counterfeit access
