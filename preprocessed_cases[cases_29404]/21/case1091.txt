defendant james riggs,pursuant to a plea agreement,pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine base.the district court sentenced defendant to months imprisonment and five years supervised release.the defendant hereby appeals his sentence.because we find that the government breached the plea agreement,we reverse and remand the case to permit the defendant an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.
in january of,a federal grand jury indicted the defendant on two counts conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base,in violation of a,b a,and count i and distribution of cocaine base,in violation of a and b b count vi the indictment did not specify any drug amounts.
in march of,the defendant entered into a plea agreement with the government under which he agreed to plead guilty to count i in exchange for the government promise to dismiss count vi after sentencing on count pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure e b,the agreement also provided that the parties would jointly recommend to the court at the time sentence is imposed that the defendant be sentenced on the basis of a drug quantity of five to fifty grams of cocaine base or its marijuana equivalent.the agreement explicitly specified that such recommendation was on the court.the plea agreement further stated that the mandatory minimum sentence applicable to the defendant was five years imprisonment.
on march,the district court held a rule hearing at which it accepted the defendant plea of guilty to count i.the court informed the defendant that under his plea he was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence.
subsequent to the rule hearing,the probation office prepared a presentence investigation report psr.the psr recommended a sentence based on a drug quantity of grams of cocaine base,producing a base offense level of,and a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,bringing defendant total offense level to.the psr,based on a criminal history category chc of vi,calculated the appropriate guideline range to be to months.neither party objected to the findings contained in the psr 
on september,the court held a presentence conference.the court questioned the parties as to the psr recommended drug quantity,and neither party objected.the court then agreed with the psr that a drug quantity of grams would result in a guideline range of to months for a defendant with a chc of vi.
the sentencing hearing was held on september.the prosecutor stated to the court that the applicable guideline range was to months and that he was asking for a sentence of months.defense counsel opined that months is plenty.neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel ever recommended at the time of sentencing or at any previous time that the defendant sentence be calculated based on a drug amount of five to fifty grams,as expressly required by the plea agreement.
the district court accepted the plea agreement,concluded that the applicable guideline range was to months,based on a total offense level of and a chc of vi,and sentenced defendant to months imprisonment and five years supervised release.the court,after having to remind the government to move to dismiss,then dismissed count vi.
the defendant never raised any objection to his sentence before the district court.however,the defendant appeals his sentence to this court and seeks to withdraw his plea,alleging that the government breached the plea agreement 
when a defendant has knowledge of conduct ostensibly amounting to a breach of a plea agreement,yet does not bring that breach to the attention of the sentencing court,we review only for plain error.united states saxena,cir.to establish plain error,a defendant must demonstrate that there was error the error was plain the error affected the defendant substantial rights and the error adversely impacted the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.see united states olano,d saxena,at.
w hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor,so that it can be said to be part of the inducement or consideration,such promise must be fulfilled.santobello new york,d.because plea bargaining requires defendants to waive fundamental constitutional rights,we hold prosecutors engaging in plea bargaining to the most meticulous standards of both promise and performance.united states vélez carrero,cir quoting united states clark,cir.
in this case,the government fell woefully short of satisfying these meticulous standards.although the plea agreement bound the government to recommend a sentence based on a drug quantity of five to fifty grams,the government utterly failed to do so instead,the government accepted the psr recommendation that grams of cocaine base be attributed to the defendant.consequently,the prosecutor stated that the guideline range was to months and that he recommended a sentence of months.the prosecutor never mentioned during sentencing the plea agreement,the five to fifty grams drug quantity,or another guideline range that corresponded to this drug quantity thus,the government failed to satisfy its obligation under the plea agreement 
the critical issue before us,however,is whether the government breach of the agreement amounts to plain error under the olano standard.although plain error review usually applies to errors committed by the court,we have also assessed governmental breaches of plea bargains,in the absence of a contemporaneous objection,under this same standard.see saxena,at.
beyond a plain violation of the plea agreement,the defendant must show that the government breach was prejudicial.see olano,at.noting that,to affect substantial rights,the error must be prejudicial.although a defendant usually demonstrates prejudice by proving that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings,see,a defendant alleging a breached plea agreement on appeal need not go so far.see clark,at stating that prosecutor failure to abide by plea agreement,even if did not affect the defendant sentence,is not harmless error correale united states,cir finding that prosecutor breach of plea agreement is not rendered harmless because of judicial refusal to follow the recommendation or judicial awareness of the impropriety.in a plea agreement,the defendant is bargaining for the prestige of the government and its potential to influence the district court.vélez carrero,at.when the prosecutor fails to fulfill the agreement,the defendant is prejudiced because his rights are violated.see correale,at noting that waiver of rights,in exchange for prosecutor statements,is ineffective when agreement is violated.
that said,minor deviations will not void a plea bargain.see clark,at opining that violation of terms not inducing the plea will be considered harmless correale,at.were it clear,for example,that the court had been fully aware of the recommendation at sentencing,the mere failure by the government to present it orally might not prove prejudicial.compare united states,cir finding that failure to orally state terms of agreement,of which court was aware,would not be sufficient to show prejudice to defendant,with united states barnes,cir stating that government failure to expressly request terms of plea agreement can constitute prejudicial error,even where court knew terms of agreement and would have rejected recommendation.here the district judge acknowledged the government intended recommendation at the rule hearing,but several months elapsed between the hearing and sentencing,and it is unclear whether the court deliberately rejected the government recommendation or simply forgot about it during the intervening time as a result,the government failure to abide by the plea bargain was not a mere technical breach.united states pryor,cir failing to inform court of information relevant to plea,of which court already is aware,is technical violation that does not amount to plain error.
in addition to being prejudicial,the government breach of the plea agreement meets the fourth prong of the olano test 
b ecause violations of plea agreements on the part of the government serve not only to violate the constitutional
