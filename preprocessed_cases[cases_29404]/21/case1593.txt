defendant michael green green also known as,inter alia,micheal wilson appeals from a judgment of conviction entered in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,following his plea of guilty before mark kravitz,judge,to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,in violation of g,and sentencing him principally to a term of imprisonment,to be followed by a term of supervised release.the district court calculation of the term of imprisonment was based in part on the court finding that one of green prior felony convictions was for the attempted possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell.green challenges that finding on appeal,arguing that the court relied on impermissible evidence.for the reasons that follow,we remand the matter to the district court for further proceedings.
background 
on march,green was arrested following the execution of a search warrant for his apartment.during the search,the law enforcement agents found,inter alia,a smith and wesson revolver.in july,green was charged in a indictment the federal indictment with violating g,which makes it unlawful for any person who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year to possess a firearm that has traveled in interstate commerce.green thereafter entered into an agreement with the government in which he agreed to plead guilty and acknowledged,inter alia,t hat prior to march,he had been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year plea agreement dated january,signed february,plea agreement,at.
to the extent pertinent to this appeal,the federal indictment alleged that one of green prior felony convictions was for attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree,in violation of new york penal law,on october.federal indictment at.in the plea agreement,the parties stipulated that green had been convicted of two felony offenses in the state of new york,including a conviction for attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.plea agreement at.
a.the calculation of green sentence 
a presentence report psr was prepared,calculating green recommended sentence pursuant to the advisory sentencing guidelines guidelines.the psr calculation started with a base offense level of,pursuant to the guidelines provision that a defendant base offense level should be,if a the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.guidelines a a.section adopts the definition of controlled substance offense that is used in guidelines b and application note to that section.see guidelines application note.section b,to the extent pertinent here,provides the following definition 
the term controlled substance offense means an offense under federal or state law,punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,that prohibits the possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute 
guidelines b emphasis added.and application note to this section provides that for purposes of this section,controlled substance offense s include the offenses of aiding and abetting,conspiring,and attempting to commit such offenses.id.application note emphases added.
green objected to the psr classification of his conviction as a controlled substance offense within the meaning of a a,contending that nothing in the record supported the conclusion that his offense had involved an intent to sell or otherwise distribute.he pointed out that although some subsections of new york penal law prohibit possession of controlled substances with intent to sell,other subsections prohibit simple possession without regard to any such intent.he argued that there was no proof that he had been convicted of anything other than simple possession.absent an intent to distribute,green argued,his conviction did not fall within the definition of controlled substance offense applicable to a a,which sets the base offense level at,and that that conviction instead fell within a,which sets the base offense level at.
b.the state court record as to the nature of green conviction 
section of the new york penal law,entitled criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree,has subsections.to the extent invoked in this case,the version of the section that was in effect at the time of the conduct that led to green conviction provided that 
a person is guilty of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree when he knowingly and unlawfully possesses 
a narcotic drug with intent to sell it or 
one or more preparations,compounds,mixtures or substances of an aggregate weight of ounce or more containing a narcotic drug.
penal law and mckinney.in order to show that green was convicted under subsection for possession with intent to distribute,the government introduced several documents.they included a the indictment that led to green conviction in new york supreme court for kings county new york indictment under b a sentence and order of commitment dated october,signed by that court clerk commitment order and c a document from the clerk office of the new york supreme court for kings county kings county clerk office,entitled certificate of disposition indictment hereafter certificate of disposition.
the new york indictment charged green under his alias micheal wilson in four counts,only the second of which is relevant here.it alleged as follows 
the grand jury of the county of kings by this indictment,accuse the defendant of the crime of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree committed as follows 
the defendant,on or about november,in the county of kings,knowingly and unlawfully possessed a narcotic drug,namely cocaine,with intent to sell it.
new york indictment,second count.although no section was cited,this count described a violation of subsection of new york penal law.
it is undisputed that the new york indictment was resolved by green plea of guilty to attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree,an offense under and new york penal law attempt.the government was unable,however,to obtain from the new york court either a formal judgment or a transcript of the plea proceeding.the commitment order states that green was sentenced to six months imprisonment plus a term of probation and specifies green offense of conviction in abbreviated form as att cpcs presumably denoting attempted criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree.the commitment order does not mention in haec verba,nor,perforce,any of its subsections.thus,green argued that he could have pleaded guilty to,and been convicted of,a violation of subsection,which prohibits mere possession,rather than subsection under which he was charged.
the certificate of disposition introduced by the government is a document that was generated on march,from the kings county clerk office database.signed and officially sealed by wilbur levin,county clerk,it states as follows
