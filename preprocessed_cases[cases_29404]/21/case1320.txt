the defendant appellant,thomas archer,requested specific jury instructions with respect to the government burden of proof regarding his knowledge of the fraud for which he was indicted.the district court johnson,denied these requests and instead gave a general instruction on acting knowingly.archer challenges those denials as well as the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial.we find these challenges meritless.
accordingly,we affirm the defendant conviction.
in calculating archer guidelines sentencing range,the district court relied on four enhancements,three of which archer challenges on appeal.though the basis of the district court application of the enhancement could have been more fully elaborated,we find the record supports its application here.regarding the and enhancements,however,we agree with archer that the evidence is insufficient to sustain their use in this case.we,therefore,vacate archer sentence.
finally,archer challenges the order of restitution imposed by the district court under the mandatory victim restitution act mvra.because we find the record evidence insufficiently specific to demonstrate that each client to whom the court ordered restitution was a victim of the fraud,we vacate the restitution order.
we remand the case for resentencing,including reconsideration of the restitution award.
background 
defendant appellant thomas archer was formerly an immigration lawyer in jackson heights and jamaica,new york.the charges in this case arise out of archer filing of i legalization applications on behalf of his clients.the department of homeland security dhs created the i program,which operated for a limited time in and,as part of a settlement of a lawsuit that had alleged misconduct in the operation of a previous legalization program.newman citizenship immigration,cv,at,order approving class settlement.nationwide,a total of applications were filed and about percent were granted.between and,archer filed between and applications,none of which were granted.
the government suspected that archer was filing false i applications.after investigation,archer and his office manager,rukhsana rafique,were indicted on five counts one count of conspiracy to commit visa fraud,and four counts of visa fraud one for each of three specific clients and one for a married couple,a.one of the substantive charges was dropped when that client declined to testify.archer and rafique were convicted on the indictment remaining four counts.
visa fraud,as charged here,has five elements the defendant knowingly presented an application or document required by the immigration laws that contained a false statement as to a material fact.a all agree that i applications qualify as document s required by the immigration laws,that archer presented them by filing them with dhs,and that some of the applications that archer filed did contain false material information.therefore,archer key contention was,and continues to be,that he was unaware of these falsities and,by implication and extension as to the conspiracy count,that he never agreed to present false information.
trial evidence 
at trial,the government presented the testimony of the three sets of clients gulistan nizar ahmad,and iris and mohammad ally whose applications constituted the bases for the substantive fraud counts a recording of two conversations,one between gulistan,archer,and rafique and one between gulistan and rafique and statistical evidence from an immigration officer.
to understand the import of all of this testimony,the i program details are important.in order to qualify for the program,the must both be a member of the class of the newman settlement and have had limited travel outside the united states.in turn,to be a member of the class,the alien must have been in the country illegally on january,applied for legalization under a prior program between may and may and been turned down for that program because of travel outside the united states between and.applicants could meet the first of these in two ways,either a by having entered the country illegally or b by having entered legally and overstaying their visas.in addition to being a member of the newman class,an eligible alien could not have traveled out of the country either a on any single trip longer than days between and may or b on any single trip longer than days between and the date of his or her application to the prior program and no more than total days in all trips during that time.while an alien i application was pending,he could receive a temporary work permit to work in the united states.
gulistan,a native of pakistan,testified through a translator that he spoke only limited english and did not know,either at the time of his i application or at the time of trial,the requirements of the program.he had gone to archer office on multiple occasions and had spoken with both rafique and archer.rafique instructed him to sign an i application,which was not translated for him and which he could not read.he paid archer,and archer submitted this application to dhs.
gulistan testified that he arrived in the united states in on a work visa,but had previously visited for a short time in with his uncle.his i application,however,stated that he had entered the united states illegally in and stayed until,when he took a trip to pakistan.the application claimed that,thereafter,he had taken six trips to pakistan between and this was needed to account for the birth of gulistan seven children between the late and.gulistan also stated that archer and rafique gave him affidavits for two friends to sign,falsely asserting that they had known him since and,respectively.no one told him what the affidavits said,only that he needed to have his friends sign them.in a january,letter,dhs instructed gulistan to attend an interview in connection with his i application.archer got the interview postponed until october,at which time gulistan attended alone.
in may and june,after federal agents visited his home,gulistan went to archer office on two occasions wearing a hidden recording device.on the first occasion,he spoke only with rafique.on the second,he also spoke with archer and protested that he did not have any proof of the travels his application claimed archer responded so what they also discussed his interview with dhs,which archer had told him to forgo.the government played both recordings at trial.
next,ahmad,also a native of pakistan,testified,also through a translator,that he,too,spoke little english and could not read.rafique prepared his i application,which he signed,but she did not read it to him,and he was unaware of what it said.he did not know the requirements of the program and paid archer.ahmad said he arrived in the united states in as a crewman on a ship.his application,however,stated that he had come to the country in and stayed until,when he took a trip to pakistan.the application included employment and residency information that he agreed was false and that he said he had never provided to anyone.rafique gave him two affidavits for his acquaintances to sign,both of which had next to the blank where the witness should put the date on which he had met ahmad.dhs sent ahmad a letter,instructing him to appear for an interview,which archer asked be postponed.when a new interview was scheduled,archer withdrew ahmad application without ahmad permission.
the third set of witnesses was iris and mohammad ally,a previously married couple from guyana.iris ally said she had limited reading skills.she did not know the requirements of the program and had signed an application rafique gave her without knowing what it said.ally had come to the united states in by sneaking across the canadian border.her application,on the other hand,claimed she had arrived in and stayed until,when she took a trip to guyana.her application also contained residency and employment information that was false and that she had never provided.rafique gave her two affidavits similar to those described in ahmad testimony she had her boss children sign them and returned them to the office.dhs sent her an interview letter,and archer got the interview postponed by having her get a note from her doctor falsely saying she was ill.the interview was rescheduled but neither she nor archer attended it.
mohammed ally testified that he had met with both archer and rafique and paid them.rafique filled out his i application,which he signed.it showed an identical entry and travel pattern to that of ally.in reality,though,he entered the united states in by illegally crossing the mexican border.his application also contained false employment and residency information that he had never supplied.when dhs sent him an interview letter,he brought it to archer office where rafique told him they would withdraw his application.though ally protested and asked for a refund,he eventually relented and allowed archer to withdraw his application.
a dhs officer,mel shatzkamer,presented some descriptive statistics about of archer i applications that were provided to him by the prosecutor.all of the applications claimed that the relevant alien entered the country illegally rather than that he or she overstayed a visa.shatzkamer found this significant because the government has no way of verifying whether someone entered the country illegally on a certain date.a falsified i application,he asserted,would be almost certain to claim eligibility through this method of entry rather than as a result of overstaying a visa,as overstaying a visa could be verified.furthermore,of archer applications stated that the particular alien had arrived in the country in rather than earlier thereby just barely making the cutoff for the program.nearly percent claimed travel outside the country in the interval from june to october of,a coincidence shatzkamer found oddly duplicative given that the travel window for eligibility was the month interval from january to may.finally,of the applications contained at least one affidavit,mostly of the type described in ahmad testimony.absent from shatzkamer testimony,as archer pointed out on cross examination,was any reference to what the national pool of i applications looked like in any of these particulars.
jury instructions 
at the charge conference,archer requested two jury instructions,both of which dealt with how the jury should interpret the evidence going to whether archer acted knowingly.first,he asked for an instruction based on united states phillips,cir the phillips instruction.phillips held that the fact that a defendant is a solo practitioner,without more,is an insufficient basis from which to infer his guilt because,even though he is the only lawyer in the office,he may not be aware of everything his staff is doing see id.at.second,he sought an instruction based on united states maniego,cir per curiam the maniego instruction.in maniego,we said that attorneys are not held to a higher duty to investigate than and have no special obligation to verify independently information given to them by clients.see id.at.the district court denied both requested instructions.
on mens rea,the district court gave the following instruction 
to act knowingly means to act intentionally and voluntarily,and not because of ignorance,mistake,accident,or carelessness.in deciding whether a defendant acted knowingly,you should ask yourself whether the defendant knew that the visa application document you are considering contained a false statement and did that defendant,nonetheless,present the document 
no evidence exists to indicate that archer lodged an objection as opposed to a request for specific supplemental instructions to this instruction in particular or to the district court final instructions as a whole,either at the charge conference or during trial.one further development on this point bears noting,though.during her rebuttal summation,the prosecutor argued that archer knew of the scheme to falsify information because it his law firm.this is some huge midtown manhattan law firm building where the law firm takes up a half a building of employees.it two rooms.it smaller than this courtroom.archer objected,and the court instructed the jury that whatever the lawyers say is not evidence in this case.significantly,archer did not,at that point,renew his request for a phillips instruction or make any other objection.
sentencing 
after archer conviction,his report psr recommended that the court impose four separate enhancements to his base offense level of eleven a enhancement for conduct involving more than fraudulent documents a enhancement for being the leader or organizer of criminal activity a enhancement for obstruction of justice and a enhancement for abusing a position of trust.the specific facts underlying each of the first three enhancements archer has not challenged the fourth are set forth in the discussion of the sentence.the district court accepted all four enhancements and calculated archer guidelines range to be to months.it then imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,three years supervised release,and a special assessment.
the court also entered an order of restitution in the amount of,payable to of archer former clients.this amount represents a refund of per client,roughly the full fee the clients usually paid archer in connection with their i cases.
the district court entered the final judgment of conviction and sentence on november.archer timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
archer raises four issues on appeal whether the district court properly denied his requested phillips and maniego jury instructions,the evidence is sufficient to sustain his convictions,the first three sentencing enhancements listed above properly apply to him,the district court erred in ordering restitution.we address each issue in turn.
jury instructions 
a defendant challenging the district court rejection of his proposed jury instructions must show that his proposed charge accurately represented the law in every respect,and that the charge actually given,viewed as a whole,prejudiced him.united states feliciano,cir internal quotation marks omitted.more specifically,the defendant can prevail by showing that his requested instruction is legally correct,represents a theory of defense with basis in the record that would lead to acquittal,and the theory is not effectively presented elsewhere in the charge.united states quattrone,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we address each challenged instruction in turn.
the phillips instruction 
though phillips is a tenth circuit case dealing with the sufficiency of the evidence rather than jury instructions,the government does not dispute that it correctly states the law,and we agree.furthermore,because the proposed instruction focused directly on archer defense that he was unaware of the false statements and because,had the jury believed that defense,it would have been required to acquit him,the only issue before us is whether the charge the court actually gave adequately represented the requirements of knowledge as an element of the crime.see quattrone,at vacating and remanding for failure to instruct regarding lack of knowledge united states dove,cir holding that unbalanced instructions,which explain how certain evidence may be inculpatory but not exculpatory,are insufficient,especially when the defendant theory of defense is that the government failed to prove an element of the crime.put another way,for archer to show that the substance of his requested charge was not effectively presented elsewhere,he must show that the jury could have convicted him under the instructions given by the court even if it believed his defense of lack of knowledge.quatrrone,at.
to resolve this issue,we compare the requested charge with the one given.phillips involved a solo practitioner charged with immigration fraud.the defendant and his assistant,who was also his wife,were convicted of forging documents.on appeal,the defendant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence establishing his knowledge of the forgeries.the court said that without some evidence showing how the attorney supervised his office,the mere fact that he was a solo practitioner was insufficient to support the inference that he was aware of the fraud.to find otherwise,it said,would be to hold such lawyers to something approaching strict criminal liability for the acts of their employees,contrary to what the law requires at.the phillips court,however,found sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction in the case before it for two reasons a the employee in question was also the attorney wife,which enabled the jury to infer that a office relationship existed between them,and b the government had direct proof that he had forged one of the many documents involved.id.at.
relying on phillips,archer asked that the court instruct the jury that t he fact that one of the defendants is the sole attorney in a small firm in and of itself is not sufficient to determine that the attorney was aware of each and every act that took place in the office or that he approved or encouraged such actions.the court declined,opting instead to give the following instruction with respect to mens rea 
to act knowingly means to act intentionally and voluntarily,and not because of ignorance,mistake,accident,or carelessness.in deciding whether a defendant acted knowingly,you should ask yourself whether the defendant knew that the visa application document you are considering contained a false statement and did that defendant,nonetheless,present the document 
on its face,the district court instruction accurately describes the knowingly element of the charged offense.see,e,united states doyle,cir united states hopkins,cir.and that instruction leaves no room for the jury to convict archer if it believed that he merely ran an office from which fraudulent documents were filed.
resisting this conclusion,however,archer claims that the court refusal to give the phillips instruction prejudiced him because the government,in its rebuttal summation,asserted that archer had to have known about the fraud because the office was small and it his law firm.this,he says,is precisely the type of reasoning against which the phillips instruction would have cautioned the jury.archer argument,however,goes too far the phillips instruction,properly construed,does not prohibit the jury from considering the fact that an attorney is a solo practitioner as one piece of circumstantial evidence from which,along with other evidence,it can infer the attorney knowledge.what it does do is prohibit the jury from relying on that fact in isolation.here,the prosecutor did not ask the jury to rely only on archer status as a solo practitioner.rather,immediately thereafter,she recounted the contents of the audio tapes and the testimony of the trial witnesses that is,she pointed to other evidence that,together with his being a solo practitioner,might lead the jury to find that archer did have actual knowledge in this respect,the government case has much in common with that upheld in phillips,where the attorney status as a solo practitioner was also just one piece of the evidentiary pie.at.
the maniego instruction 
maniego involved two attorneys who operated a scheme to secure lawful permanent resident lpr status for aliens.at trial,their defense was that they were unaware that their clients marriages were fraudulent.a client testified that she told them about her prior marriage,which made her marriage invalid.the trial court instructed the jury that an attorney is not held to a higher standard of conduct,or legal obligation,to verify independently the truth of the information given by a client.at.this court found that instruction proper and affirmed the convictions.id.archer requested,nearly verbatim,the same charge as given in maniego.def.am.req.to charge,united states archer,cr,ecf.
as with the phillips instruction,there is no dispute that maniego accurately states the law or that,if the jury had believed that archer clients provided him with false information and archer was unaware of its falsity,it would have had to acquit him.thus,as above,the only issue before us is whether the mens rea instruction given by the district court adequately represented the requirements of knowledge as an element of the crime.as we said above,it did.the jury could not have convicted archer if it both believed his defense and followed this instruction.therefore,archer has failed to show reversible error.
sufficiency of the evidence 
archer argues that the evidence before the jury was insufficient to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that he had knowledge of the fraud.a defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence underlying a criminal conviction bears a heavy burden because this court must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the government,drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.united states gaskin,cir.we also resolve all inferences from the evidence and issues of credibility in favor of the verdict.united states howard,cir.in short,r eversal is warranted only if no rational factfinder could have found the crimes charged proved beyond a reasonable doubt.gaskin,at.moreover,the jury verdict may be based on circumstantial evidence,united states,cir,and the government is not required to preclude every reasonable hypothesis that is consistent with innocence,united states chang an lo,cir.the government must,however,show more than evidence of a general cognizance of criminal activity,suspicious circumstances,or mere association with others engaged in criminal activity.united states samaria,cir,abrogated in part on other grounds by united states huezo,cir.
all four testified that they spoke little english and did not read well in any language.they all said they did not know the requirements of the program when they came to archer office.they also all testified that their i applications contained false information and that they did not provide this information to anyone at the office.a reasonable inference to draw from this combined testimony is,as the government argued,that they could not have fabricated the dates and other information on their applications in such a way that the fabrications would match up with the program requirements.
accepting this inference,archer protests that the evidence shows only that someone in his office,not he himself,fabricated their information.he contends that rafique,who spoke the clients languages and who met with them in the office while archer was in court,is a more logical candidate.yet,three of the said they spoke with archer about their applications.and one of the two taped conversation with gulistan also could well be interpreted as archer responding so what when confronted with accusations of false information in gulistan application.
in all four clients cases,archer requested adjournments of the dhs hearings that were scheduled for his clients apparently attempting to postpone them indefinitely and in two cases,archer withdrew the applications when dhs insisted on the interviews.from these actions,it could reasonably be inferred that archer was attempting to avoid having clients answer dhs questions about the applications in ways that would uncover their falsity.
the jury was entitled to credit this testimony and was not required to see it as archer urged.see chang an lo,at.together,this evidence was enough for a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that archer was aware that the visa applications contained false statements and that he filed them anyway.this is so,moreover,apart from whatever additional weight phillips permits giving to the fact that archer was a solo practitioner.we,therefore,reject archer challenge to his conviction on this ground.
sentencing 
we review a sentence for both procedural and substantive reasonableness.united states friedberg,cir.among other things,the district court commits procedural error when it makes a mistake in its guidelines calculation.united states cavera,cir en banc.the district court interpretation of the guidelines is a question of law,which we review de novo.united states zagari,cir.as to the facts that support the application of a guideline,the burden of proving such facts is on the government,the standard for proving such facts is a preponderance of the evidence,and we review the district court factual conclusions for clear error.id.clear error exists when we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.cavera,at quoting anderson city of bessemer city.on this point,we note that a conclusion that factual findings are not clearly erroneous is more easily reached when the district court makes those findings explicitly and on the record.
archer contends that the district court committed procedural error in calculating his guidelines range by inappropriately applying three enhancements to that calculation.first,he argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to sustain a enhancement for conduct that involved more than fraudulent documents.second,he claims that the district court erred in imposing a enhancement for being the leader or organizer of criminal activity,because the government presented insufficient evidence to show either that five or more people joined the conspiracy or that the criminal scheme was otherwise extensive.third,he challenges a enhancement for obstruction of justice,imposed for threatening a witness,because his conduct toward the potential witness was,he asserts,not threatening.we address these arguments in this order.
or more documents 
archer received a enhancement for an offense involving or more fraudulent documents.see sentencing guidelines manual b c.at sentencing,the government proffered nothing beyond what it offered at trial.and there,the only evidence as to the number of false documents involved was immigration officer shatzkamer statistical summary of of archer cases.see psr.
to sustain enhancements for relevant conduct,the court must base its findings on specific evidence that the offense involved the requisite quantity of items.this evidence can,however,be circumstantial.united states shonubi shonubi ii,cir.this requirement has two parts a there must be evidence regarding the quantity of illicit or fraudulent goods and b it has to be specific to the defendant.see united states shonubi shonubi i,cir.shonubi i and shonubi ii each dealt with one of these two prongs,respectively.over a number of years,the defendant in the shonubi cases made eight trips to nigeria.on returning to the united states from the last of these trips,he was arrested because officials found grams of heroin in him.shonubi i,at.the district court,multiplying the amount found in the defendant on this one trip by the total number of trips he had made,sentenced him based on eight times that quantity.this court vacated and remanded.we explained that specific evidence,drug records,admissions or live testimony is required to calculate quantities for sentencing purposes,and we concluded that the government instead provided only speculation.id.at.
on remand,the district court held an elaborate hearing,collecting a great deal of statistical evidence about the amount of heroin carried by other nigerian smugglers in similar circumstances.shonubi ii,at.it then the same sentence.id.this court again vacated the sentence.id.at.this time,we faulted the district court for not evaluating evidence specific to the individual defendant.id.at by mentioning drug records and admissions as examples of specific evidence we thought it reasonably clear that we were referring to the defendant his admissions and records of his drug transactions.and by live testimony we were referring to testimony about his drug transactions.in so vacating,our court was careful to point out that specific evidence need not be direct and,when correctly considered,circumstantial evidence could be sufficient.id.for example,the court approved of statistical extrapolation to arrive at an estimate of drug quantity when the sample was randomly selected from a known population.id.at approving of the method of testing four randomly selected heroin balloons to estimate the quantity of heroin contained in balloons found inside the defendant body.
unlike most of the cases that follow the shonubi decisions,the case before us does not involve the second prong of the test there is no doubt that the evidence presented is specific to the defendant,united states jones,cir united states moreno,cir.no one disputes that archer filed all i applications at issue.any analysis of those applications is,therefore,sufficiently specific to archer.
what is at issue here is whether the statistics the government relied on satisfy the first prong the specific evidence requirement.the government contends that shatzkamer report,which demonstrates striking similarities between the four applications presented at trial,all of which the jury,in convicting archer on the substantive counts,must have found to be false,and the remaining,constitutes adequate specific evidence.these statistics,the government asserts,permit a sentencing judge to find by a preponderance of the evidence the relevant standard under zagari that at least of those applications were fraudulent,thus supporting the enhancement under b c for an offense involving or more fraudulent documents.the contention fails for two reasons.
the first and most obvious flaw in the government reasoning is that it has presented no evidence that the four applications proven false at trial were,in shonubi relevant way,a representative slice of the applications on which the government relies.unlike the representative sampling of heroin balloons in shonubi,the four applications presented at trial were not randomly selected from the population.if they had been,shatzkamer report might well be sufficient.if fewer than of the applications were false,the likelihood of randomly selecting four applications that were all false would be,at most,percent it follows then that if four randomly selected applications were all found to be false,this finding could form the basis of a reasonable conclusion that,more likely than not,at least of the applications from which the four were drawn were false.united states duong cam tran,cir affirming random representative sampling as a valid method of estimating drug quantity.
there is,instead,good reason to think that the applications presented at trial were not random,but were instead the most egregious cases.they look like the easiest ones for agents to identify as fraudulent,both because the clients who were most badly misrepresented were most likely to complain and because those applications involved assertions that were easiest to prove false.in this respect,what happened here would be as if the chemist mentioned in shonubi had selected the four balloons with the most pungent vinegar smell,which indicates heroin,tested the chemical composition of those four and then extrapolated the result to the population of balloons whose odor was less pungent.
the second flaw is that the government statistics,without more,tell us very little that is helpful to determining whether any of the other applications were false.the government notes that percent of the applications involved aliens who claimed to have entered the country illegally,that percent of these aliens allegedly did so in,that percent of the applications claimed travel outside the country between june and october,and that percent involved one or more affidavits.that information is interesting,but without a baseline as to what the national pool of i applications filed by,we must assume,honest lawyers looked like to compare it to and shatzkamer admitted he had no such baseline the data tell us nothing about the truth or falsity of the applications.it is like saying that jones patients died,on average,a year after their initial visit with her if most of her patients were healthy people coming for a,this information suggests a finding that jones is a terrible physician if,on the other hand,jones is an oncologist,all of whose patients had terminal cancer of a sort that had a national average life expectancy of two months,the same information makes her look very good indeed.context is essential but the government did not take the time and make the effort to provide any.
this deficiency might,nonetheless,have been cured if the government had explained why the similarities in the applications are,in themselves,incriminating.and we certainly do not foreclose the possibility that,in some circumstances,the incriminating character of similarities is sufficiently obvious that no further explanation is needed.for example,in an immigration fraud case in which the government offered an ins agent summary of regular patterns contained in applications filed by the defendants,the similarities namely repeated stories of allegedly personal persecution,given in great,often detail were deemed too unlikely to be accidental,and the incriminating character of those similarities was held to be obvious.united states walker,cir but the facts here dates of entry and of travel are not so peculiar.without some further explanation or context,the conclusion that many of the applications must be false is no more than supposition.
in the end,this case is unlike those in which we have upheld this enhancement and more like those in which we have not.in all of these,some evidence was required to show that the court was sentencing the defendant not based on his this case,his guilt with respect to four false applications but on his actions in this case,his filing of more than a hundred applications that were in fact false.thus,we have held that a court may not assume that because the defendant was convicted of dealing drugs,all the money that he has is drug money,see jones,at finding the money to be drug money only,in part,because the defendant had no other means of employment that could be a legitimate source of the money,and we have held that simply because a defendant was convicted of cashing forged checks,it was error to conclude that every check he cashed was fraudulent,united states spitsyn,app x cir summary order remanding for resentencing because no evidence existed that of the checks defendant cashed were forged.conversely,where the defendant assistant testified that he had personally processed thousands of false applications for the defendant,we upheld an enhancement.see walker,at.
when the guidelines allow for punishment of relevant conduct as though it were convicted conduct,we have a special obligation to ensure that the evidence of relevant conduct is solid.see shonubi ii,at.the absence of such evidence here renders the district court factual findings clearly erroneous.
leader or organizer 
archer received a enhancement for being an organizer or leader of the criminal operation.see a.this enhancement applies when the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.id.the government argued,and the district court agreed,that archer qualified for this enhancement on both grounds.
before we examine archer contention about the sufficiency of the government evidence on either ground,we pause to note that before applying this enhancement,the district court is required to make specific factual findings regarding either the number of participants or the extent of the criminal activity.united states skys,cir united states espinoza,cir per curiam.we have repeatedly said that it is not enough for the court to make implicit findings or merely to repeat or paraphrase the language of the guideline and say conclusorily that the defendant meets those criteria.skys,at quoting united states ware,cir,and collecting cases.
here,the district court simply said,i find that there was a conspiracy involving five people,and even if there were not five people,that this activity was otherwise extensive.it did,however,adopt the psr,which provided some factual support.see psr noting that the fraud involved not just archer,rafique,and sarvjit singh,but also the knowing and unknowing services of many outsiders including a number of victim applicants who were aware of the fraudulent nature of the applications but signed them anyway,and a number of individuals who fraudulently attested to the truth of those applications in signed affidavits.we will review this enhancement in light of the psr finding.
for a defendant to qualify for the enhancement on the ground,the government must show four people other than the defendant who were criminally responsible for the commission of the offense.cmt.because the psr mentions only archer,rafique,and sarvjit singh,a former employee of archer who solicited clients for him and who was convicted on one count of visa fraud,the evidence is insufficient to sustain the enhancement on this ground.
to qualify on the otherwise extensive ground,however,the government can include the unknowing services of many outsiders in tallying the scope of the fraud.cmt.see also united states carrozzella,cir,abrogated in part on other grounds by united states kennedy,cir.three factors weigh in determining the extensiveness of the fraud i the number of knowing participants ii the number of unknowing participants whose activities were organized or led by the defendant with specific criminal intent iii the extent to which the services of the unknowing participants were peculiar and necessary to the criminal scheme.carrozzella,at accord united states rubenstein,cir.
here,the uncontested number of knowing participants is at least three.this number is on a par with prior cases where we have sustained application of the enhancement,rubenstein,at two knowing participants.next,we count as unknowing participants in the overarching conspiracy a fair number though probably not all of archer clients the precise number being impossible to determine from the record before us for the reasons stated supra who signed the i applications and who sought affidavits from third parties in support of those applications.the same evidence that was sufficient to convict archer,as discussed supra part,is sufficient to show that t he organization of,and direction given to,at least some of the clients was done with the specific intent of filing false visa applications carrozzella,at.finally,though it is logically possible that archer could have filed false applications simply by pulling information from thin air,that was not what the evidence indicated he did.rubenstein,at describing defendants conviction for violating the standards of the clean air act,a violation that can occur only if one has actual workers.under his scheme,archer needed real clients to provide some of their own information and to secure the supporting affidavits that his office prepared.in the actual scheme before us,these clients were peculiar and necessary to the criminal scheme.carrozzella,at id.explaining that the taxi driver who brought a leader of the fraudulent scheme to work on a single occasion would not count.
all this is sufficient to support the psr finding,and we,accordingly,affirm the application of the enhancement under a.
obstruction of justice 
archer received a enhancement for obstruction of justice for sending two text messages to sarvjit singh.in early,archer called singh repeatedly,and singh did not answer.on april,archer texted singh,sarvjit.if ur a government witness signal me by not responding to this message.but if ur a friend call me.psr.singh did not respond.ten days later,archer texted him again,pussy.id singh was,apparently,very threatened by these messages.id.
an enhancement is warranted,inter alia,when the defendant threatens,intimidates,or otherwise unlawfully influences a potential witness with the intent to obstruct justice.cmt.a.an intent to deter cooperation with the government is sufficient.united states shoulberg,cir.
most cases where we have upheld the application of this enhancement involve clear and direct threats against cooperating witnesses or government agents,united states hertular,cir upholding the enhancement where the defendant told agents it was in their best interest to back down from their investigation and warned them that hit men from colombia or mexico would be hired to take them out alteration in original united states agudelo,cir affirming the district court interpretation of the defendant statement to a witness that if the witness were to testify against him in a drug case,he would make a case against the witness for kidnapping as a threat designed to intimidate the witness.but the district court may draw inferences from context and must determine what the defendant meant by his words,and how a listener would reasonably interpret those words.shoulberg,at sustaining the enhancement where a drug dealer with a violent history known to all parties asked for a potential witness address saying,if he is fucking,i got a trick for his ass.
where the defendant statements are ambiguous,we generally defer to a sentencing court findings on the speaker meaning and intent.united states gaskin,cir upholding a enhancement where the defendant threatened the life of one witness in front of a second witness and the district court found that he did so in order to intimidate that second witness.here,however,the district court made no findings with respect to the meaning of archer messages.and we are,in any event,unpersuaded that a reasonable reading of these messages evidences sufficient intent to support an enhancement.
the most obvious reading of archer texts is that he wished to know whether singh would testify for the government and that he was displeased that singh would do so.the district court made no attempt to explain why these interpretations were incorrect under the circumstances or in what way archer words manifested any intent to obstruct justice.with no explicit threat of violence and no history between the two men to suggest that the insult was code for a threat,see shoulberg,at finding that an ambiguous statement could be interpreted against the defendant where his violent history indicated that his statement would be understood as a threat,this case seems very similar to united states hernandez,cir.in hernandez,the defendant had spoken to the cooperating witness before trial,called her the devil,and said she would stare the witness down at trial.id.at.the hernandez court found the district court finding of obstructive intent clearly erroneous,even though the witness was scared the statement was not a threat but was merely an expression of an understandable feeling of betrayal id.at fury may be exceedingly unpleasant,but alone,it bespeaks no intent to obstruct justice.
as in hernandez,the defendant called the witness an unpleasant name upon learning that the witness would cooperate with the government,and the witness was subjectively afraid.but also as in hernandez,and unlike shoulberg,no evidence exists from which one could conclude that the defendant statement was a threat.therefore,like the hernandez court,we find clearly erroneous the district court conclusion that archer texts were threats and hence find the enhancement improper.
for the reasons given in parts and,we vacate the sentence imposed and remand the case for resentencing.this raises the question of whether the government should,or can,be allowed to present additional evidence on remand as to one or more of the matters as to which we found the current record evidence to be inadequate this is an open question in our circuit.but see shonubi ii,at since the government has now had two opportunities to present the required specific evidence to the sentencing court,no further opportunity is warranted.emphasis added.
the consensus among our sister circuits is that generally where the government knew of its obligation to present evidence and failed to do so,it may not enter new evidence on remand.nonetheless,there are cases a where the government burden was unclear,b where the trial court prohibited discussion of the issue,or c where the evidence was,for a good reason,unavailable,in which the district court was permitted,in its discretion,to hear new evidence.to put it more broadly,where special circumstances make the prohibition on new evidence unfair,the district court may admit it.united states noble,cir holding that the the government is not permitted on remand to try again and submit new evidence in a belated effort to carry its burden where the government knew what it was required to introduce united states matthews,cir adopting a policy of remand without limitation on the evidence that the district court may consider unless,inter alia,there was a failure of proof after a full inquiry into the factual question at issue united states hudson,cir because we have clearly stated the governing principles as to when and how disputed sentencing facts must be proved,we direct that resentencing on remand be conducted on the existing sentencing record,with no opportunity for either party to reopen or add to that record.united states leonzo,see ing no reason why the government should get a second bite at the apple where n o special circumstances justified,or even explained,the government failure to sustain its burdens united states dickler,cir perceiv ing no constitutional or statutory impediment to the district court providing the government with an additional opportunity to present evidence on remand if it has tendered a persuasive reason why fairness so requires united states parker,cir holding that double jeopardy prevents the government from offering new evidence when it has already been given one full and fair opportunity to offer whatever proof about the disputed issue it could assemble.
we now join that consensus.we leave to the district court to consider in the first instance whether the justifications outlined above for allowing the government to present new evidence on remand exist in this case.thereafter,if it has admitted no new evidence,the district court should recalculate archer guidelines range without using the enhancements in.b c and.if it chooses to consider new evidence,it should calculate archer guidelines range based on its findings with respect to that evidence.in either case,it should then,of course,impose the sentence it finds warranted by the sentencing factors set forth in a.
restitution 
under the mandatory victim restitution act mvra,the district court ordered archer to pay in restitution to clients,representing a refund of the estimated fees paid by those clients to archer for their i cases.we review restitution orders for abuse of discretion.united states.ojeikere,cir.a court abuses its discretion when it rests its decision on an error of law.united states fernandez,cir.
the mvra requires restitution where a the offense was committed by fraud or deceit and b an identifiable victim or victims has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss.a,c a ii,c b.there is no dispute that archer crime qualifies as to the first element.with respect to the second,the government contends that archer clients are victims of the fraud and that they suffered the pecuniary loss of paying him for a service helping them obtain legal status that he did not provide.appellee br.archer resists the classification of his clients as victims and argues that,in any event,not all of them are victims.
a victim means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of an offense including,in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity,any person directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,conspiracy,or pattern.a determining whether archer clients qualify as victims,therefore,is in large part about whether their losses were caused by archer offense,namely his conspiracy to commit visa fraud critically,the district court statutory authority to award restitution under the mvra is limited to awards to victims of the offense of conviction.in re local metallic lathers union,cir per curiam citing hughey united states.
the government argument that archer took his clients money for a service he did not provide might be taken as referring to an entirely separate consumer fraud rather than to the immigration fraud it charged.this raises the possibility that the government is seeking restitution for losses caused by an unprosecuted offense rather than by the offense of conviction,something it may not do.id.holding that a victim of a fraud count in the indictment to which the defendant did not plead guilty was properly denied restitution.for a number of years,our court determined whether a loss was part of the offense of conviction by reference to the elements of the crime restitution was proper only if the conduct that caused the loss was an element of the crime.id.at id.at rejecting the plaintiff argument that the district court erred by defining a victim according to the elements of the crime or offense of conviction internal quotation marks omitted 
for example,in the local case,the defendant,a business owner,developed a scheme in which he issued business checks to fictitious vendors,forged endorsements on those checks,cashed them,and then used the proceeds to pay his employees in cash,thereby avoiding obligations to the irs and the employees union.id.at.he was charged with conspiracy to launder money and defrauding the union,but pleaded guilty to the former charge as part of a plea agreement in which the government agreed to drop the latter charge.id.at.the union sought restitution,claiming that it was a victim of the money laundering scheme because paying the employees with cash,and thus avoiding paying the union as required under the collective bargaining agreement,was the purpose of the money laundering scheme.id.at.the court affirmed the magistrate judge determination that the money laundering scheme was complete when the defendant received the cash and so what he intended to do or did with it after that moment was irrelevant to the crime of conviction.id.at.as a result,the court held that the union was not a victim under the mvra.id.at.
our recent decision in united states paul,cir,however,expands this test somewhat.in that case,the defendant committed securities fraud by trading a stock between multiple accounts he controlled,called nominee accounts,thereby artificially increasing the liquidity of the stock and,hence,its price.in the process,he secured margin loans from several banks based on his holdings of this stock.these loans were how he profited from the scheme simultaneously inflating the stock price while continuing to hold the shares,something he could do only because of the loans he had secured.id.eventually,the scheme was uncovered,the stock price fell dramatically,and given the worthlessness of the shares,he was unable to repay the loans.id.he pleaded guilty to securities fraud but contended that the court could not order restitution to the banks because their losses were caused by his fraudulent creation of the nominee accounts,which he argued was bank fraud,and not the securities fraud of which he was convicted.id.at.we rejected this argument and found that the loans were part of the larger securities fraud for two reasons.first,because paul explicitly admitted that he concealed from the investing public that he was leveraging and,in effect,liquidating a substantial part of his stock holdings through the use of the margin loans,that conduct itself was an element of securities fraud.id.at.second,and more broadly,because the loans were part of the scheme paul actually devised for profiting from his crime and because t he brokerage houses would not have made the loans to the defendant had they known that the collateral for the loans was the stock he manipulated through the nominee accounts,their losses were caused by his overall scheme.id.at.
paul reasoning echoes the statute,which provides that in the case of an offense that involves as an element a scheme,conspiracy,or pattern of criminal activity,any person who is directly harmed by the defendant criminal conduct in the course of the scheme,conspiracy,or pattern is a victim.a.this same reasoning that victims are those who would not have made the payments to the defendant had they known about the fraudulent scheme,paul,at also explains the rule that,who,by definition,know of the scheme,are not victims and may not receive restitution,see united states reifler,cir disallowing restitution for those individuals whose stock lost value but who bought it knowing the defendant intended to inflate the price artificially.
the government is correct that this rule is not about denying benefits to those with unclean hands.see ojeikere,at allowing restitution to those whose money the defendant had stolen despite the fact that they had conspired with him to commit a different fraud on third parties.it is a rule about causation in the fundamental and not simply but for meaning of the word if a person gives the defendant his money to bet,knowing that the bet might lose,his later loss,for purposes of restitution,is,in this fundamental sense,caused not by the defendant accepting his money but by the outcome of the bet 
in the instant case,the first question is whether the clients payments to archer were part of the visa fraud conspiracy or,instead,were only part of an entirely separate consumer fraud scheme for which he was not prosecuted.it is certainly possible for one to commit visa fraud without accepting any money from the visa applicants the crime is complete with the knowing presentation of a false document to the government see in re local,at.archer receipt of money from his clients was,therefore,not an element of the crime.but,in this case,the fraud was not by any means entirely separate hence,restitution might nonetheless be available.here,the clients payments,like the margin loans in paul,were the mechanism through which archer profited from his conspiracy and,thus,were an integral part of the single scheme he devised.under paul,such payments could qualify as part of the offense for which he was convicted and hence his clients could be victims under the mvra if,but only if,the clients would not have made the payments had they known that archer would file false applications.see paul,at.that is,if archer clients thought they were buying his honest legal services,they may well have been victims of his visa fraud conspiracy.on the other hand,if they thought and a fortiori if they in fact knew that they were buying the cover that his law practice gave to their false visa applications either because they wanted the temporary work permits issued to i applicants or because they thought the government might be duped and grant their applications then they suffered no loss that was proximately caused by archer visa fraud.
the showing required to satisfy the government burden on this point varies depending on the circumstances of the fraud.in some cases,it will be clear that no reasonable person would have given the defendant her money if she had known of his in the fraud in ojeikere where the defendant plan was to abscond with his funds as soon as he got hold of their money.at.see also united states marino,cr.lexis cir.in those cases,a generalized description of the fraudulent scheme is enough to support restitution.but where it is plausible that some individuals would have paid the defendant even if they had been informed of his fraudulent plan,then the government must proffer some individualized evidence to meet its burden of showing that each alleged victim was actually a victim.united states gonzalez,cir vacating a restitution award where the district court failed to calculate individualized and actual losses.
two facts lead us to conclude that the case before us is of the latter kind.first,the record reflects that in several instances,applicants did in fact know that their papers contained falsehoods.for example,ally admitted that he knew one of the affidavits for his application was false but that he begged his to sign it anyway.rahul gupte,a client who was deposed but did not testify,said that he signed his i application knowing it contained false statements,including a false address he provided.another client,manzoor ahmad,had previously submitted a similar application for legalization with the same false information that was later included on his i form.
second,filing a false but plausible i application was anything but a sure loser.while the alien application was pending,the alien could obtain a temporary work permit,and all four clients who testified at trial said they in fact did receive such a permit.there also remained the possibility,however small,that dhs would be fooled by their false applications and grant them visas.of course,a knowing applicant might well realize that the application would likely have to be withdrawn eventually or would be denied and that he or she could face the possibility of future sanctions.but it is an unfortunate fact that criminals take that kind of risk every day.
the upshot is that,in the instant case,the government bore the burden of demonstrating by
