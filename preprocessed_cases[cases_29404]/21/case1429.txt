savoca appeals his sentence arguing that it is procedurally unreasonable because in applying an enhancement for obstruction of justice,the district court impermissibly took into account his testimony at his trial after pleading guilty,but prior to his sentencing and because he should have received credit for acceptance of responsibility his sentence is substantively unreasonable and the district court should have conducted a complete resentencing hearing after vacating the original sentence.we conclude,inter alia,that the district court permissibly considered savoca testimony at his trial in determining his sentence.thus,for the reasons stated in this opinion,we find that savoca sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable,and that a new sentencing hearing was not required.we,therefore,affirm his sentence as imposed by the district court.
