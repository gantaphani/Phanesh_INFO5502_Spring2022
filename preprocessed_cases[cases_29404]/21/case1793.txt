defendant edward bello appeals from a sentence entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york hellerstein,insofar as it imposes as a condition of probation a bar on during a period of home detention.we conclude that the imposition of the bar for the stated purpose of promoting and remorse exceeds the district court broad discretion.because the television restriction appears to have been an integral part of the defendant overall sentence,we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.
background 
on june,edward bello pleaded guilty,without a plea agreement,to a indictment charging him with conspiracy to use stolen credit cards in violation of a.bello and a had schemed to steal credit cards from lockers at a new jersey health club and use the stolen cards to make unauthorized purchases.
the presentence investigation report psr,prepared by the probation office pursuant to the sentencing guidelines or the guidelines,computed the total offense level as and the criminal history category as ii the two criminal history points were based upon a conviction for possession of a gambling device and a conviction for credit card theft each offense punished by one year of probation.bello also had two other convictions too old to be counted a conviction for simple assault and a conviction for disorderly conduct,as well as seven prior arrests in not resulting in convictions,for which he received no points under the guidelines.no criminal history points were added for the fact that his present conviction and his most recent prior conviction were for virtually identical crimes.
on the basis of the guidelines calculation in the psr,which neither party contested and which the district court ultimately adopted at the sentencing hearing,bello sentencing range was four to ten months of imprisonment.see tr.because this was within zone b of the guidelines sentencing table,the court was authorized to impose a sentence of probation if it included at least four months of home detention or community confinement.see c,e id.home detention may be imposed as a condition of probation or supervised release,but only as a substitute for imprisonment.the probation office considered,however,that the defendant was not deserving of the privilege of probation,and recommended that he be sentenced to four months of imprisonment.
by letter and at sentencing,bello counsel argued that probation with home detention would be an appropriate sentence for bello then years old with a heart condition because his income as a videogame repairman was the sole source of support for his wife who had crohn disease and could not work and the couple two teenage daughters.at the sentencing hearing on december,bello apologized to the court for his criminal conduct,said he had committed the offense to get m oney for medicine,and reported that he had been promised a job starting the following month.tr.
the government opposed probation on the grounds that it was unjustified by the crime of conviction and bello criminal history bello had never spent a day in prison in his life for his prior convictions and bello crimes were getting more serious,not less serious.id.at.the government suggested that the defendant two adult children could help support bello and the couple teenage daughters while he was in prison.
judge hellerstein ruled with some misgiving,i will not impose custody.but i will impose as close to it as i can.id.at.the sentence imposed consisted of five years of probation,the first ten months of which were to be spent in home detention.as a condition of probation,the court imposed sua sponte a television bar on bello during his home detention there will be no television in the house.you going to have to take your tv sets out of there.id.after defense counsel objected that removal of all televisions from the household would be unduly harsh for bello family,the court modified the condition bello teenage daughters could keep televisions in their rooms,and bello could watch there.id.at.the court elicited bello promise that he would nevertheless abstain 
the court i want you,on your honor,to state very clearly that you will not watch tv 
bello i wo.
the court during this entire period of home detention.do i have your word 
bello yes.you have my word,your honor.thank you.i appreciate it.
five days later,bello moved to strike the television bar.in his motion,brought before the district court pursuant to.c,bello argued that the restriction,even as modified,violated his first amendment rights and was not reasonably necessary for his rehabilitation or reasonably related to the goals of the sentencing reform act,as set forth in a,b.the government took no position.
by memorandum and order dated december,the court denied bello motion,ruling that the television bar was reasonably related to factors appropriately considered for sentencing purposes,including defendant history and circumstances.memorandum and order denying removal of condition of probation order denying removal at.the court made clear that the restriction had been imposed to promote d eprivation s of liberties are likely to create opportunities for and without deprivation and,there would be considerably less chance that defendant will conquer the habit of recidivism that has marred his life.id.at.
bello appealed.by order dated february,a panel of this court granted a stay of his home detention pending the outcome of this appeal.
discussion 
a sentencing court has broad discretion to fix the conditions of probation,a decision we review only for abuse of discretion.united states peterson,cir.the district court discretion,however,is not untrammeled,united states abrar,cir,or unfettered,united states doe,cir,and we carefully scrutinize unusual and severe conditions,united states cutler,cir internal quotation marks omitted.a n erroneous view of the law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence amounts to an abuse of discretion.doe,at quoting cooter gell hartmarx,d internal quotation marks omitted.
under the sentencing reform act of,the act,a court determining an appropriate sentence shall consider,inter alia,the following statutory purposes

a.the goal is to impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary to achieve these purposes.id.a.
in sentencing a defendant to probation,a court must impose certain mandatory conditions,id.a a,none of which is at issue here.a nonexclusive list of additional,discretionary conditions are set out in b,with room left for such other conditions as the court may impose,see id.b.one of the enumerated discretionary conditions is home detention.id.b providing that court may require that defendant remain at his place of residence during nonworking hours.
in imposing conditions of probation,courts are to consider a variety of factors,including the list of statutory purposes found in a.see id.b.the guidelines provision governing conditions of probation incorporates these purposes,providing in relevant part
