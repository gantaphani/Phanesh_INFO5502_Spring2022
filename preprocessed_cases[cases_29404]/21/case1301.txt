background 
following a jury trial,saeed was convicted of conspiring to distribute heroin in violation of,aggravated identity theft in violation of a c,and making false statements on a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency in violation of.
saeed criminal activity came to light after customs and border patrol at newark international airport seized a fedex package from india containing grams of heroin.immigration and customs enforcement ice agents executed a controlled delivery of the package to its intended brooklyn address,which resulted in the arrest of two of saeed,temitope mohammed and bolaji olaiye.subsequently,ice received authorization to intercept calls over a cell phone belonging to kay oyewumi a leader of the heroin trafficking organization.the intercepted calls implicated saeed in the conspiracy and led to his arrest on april.
saeed was initially charged with participating in a conspiracy to distribute,and to possess with intent to distribute,one kilogram or more of heroin in violation of,a,b a,and.during a interview saeed identified himself as reginald davis and admitted to some of his criminal activity.
on december,saeed counsel advised the government that his review of his client record indicated that saeed might be eligible for relief pursuant to f.the government responded that it would not agree to recommend relief unless defendant revealed his true identity.despite the government position regarding the safety valve,saeed and his attorney met with the government on december,to provide the government with information proving he was eligible.
the meeting was held pursuant to a proffer agreement signed by saeed,saeed counsel,the assistant united states attorney,and a witness.during the proffer,the government questioned saeed about his identity.he identified himself again as reginald davis claimed he was born in houston,texas in and provided what he asserted were the final four digits of his social security number.during the meeting,the government also asked saeed questions about the narcotics conspiracy,his involvement with oyewumi and olaiye,the length of his participation in the conspiracy,and the amounts of heroin he distributed.
after the proffer,the government further investigated saeed identity and informed the court that it might seek additional charges against saeed for false statements and identity theft.
on march,the grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging saeed with four new counts related to his false statements to the government about his identity during his interview and proffer.ultimately,the government dropped two of these counts and proceeded to trial only on count one,involving the narcotics conspiracy count four,charging saeed with making false statements about his identity during the proffer in violation of and count six,charging saeed with aggravated identity theft in violation of based on his use of the identity of reginald davis during the safety valve proffer.
saeed made a number of motions that are now at issue on appeal.he moved to suppress statements he made during the proffer,arguing that the government acted in bad faith when it continued the proffer after saeed continued to lie about his identity.saeed also moved to sever count one from counts four and six on the basis that joinder was improper pursuant to federal rules of criminal procedure and.both motions were denied.a jury trial followed and saeed was found guilty on all counts.
during sentencing,the government opposed relief on the basis that saeed lied about his identity.the district court denied relief,imposed an obstruction of justice enhancement,and ultimately sentenced saeed to months imprisonment.the month sentence included months imprisonment for counts one and four,and months imprisonment the mandatory minimum to be served consecutively as required by statute on count six.
saeed appeals the jury verdict on counts four and six,the district court pretrial rulings,and his sentence.
discussion 
on appeal,saeed argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury guilty verdict on counts four and six the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress his statements the district court erred in denying his motion to sever count one from counts four and six and his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable.these arguments lack merit and there was no error below.we therefore affirm saeed conviction and sentence.
i.the jury guilty verdict on counts four and six was supported by sufficient evidence.
saeed argues that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury verdict on counts four and six because the government failed to present evidence that proved,as required by,that his false statements were material under,a statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence,or be capable of influencing,the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed,united states gaudin,d,or if it is capable of distracting government investigators attention away from a critical matter,united states stewart,cir.
here,saeed lies about his identity during the proffer clearly meet the definition of material.as a matter of common sense,providing a false identity to officials conducting a proffer has both a natural tendency to influence and is capable of distracting those officials.indeed,there is little doubt that providing a false identity can result in a significant hindrance to law enforcement investigation or prosecution of crimes giving a false identity can impede the government ability to develop information about the subject crime,and to inform itself about the defendant and any relevant criminal history.see,united states oladipupo,cir.accordingly,any reasonable juror could have appropriately concluded that saeed lies about his identity were material to the government investigation.
but the government offered more to support its burden of proof.it introduced testimony that the purpose of a proffer is to determine eligibility for safetyvalve relief and that both truthfulness and criminal history are elements to be considered in determining whether a defendant is eligible this testimony was enough to support the jury finding that a defendant lies about his identity during a proffer have a natural tendency to influence or are capable of distracting the government agents.that is all that is required for materiality.thus,viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the we are required to jury finding of materiality was eminently reasonable.see united states libera,cir united states stanley,cir.
nevertheless,appellant argues that a few cases that found evidence insufficient to support a conviction counsel in favor of reversing his conviction here.see united states ismail,cir united states kwiat,cir.we disagree the cases are inapposite.both ismail and kwiat involved false statements made to one agency when the government had to show the statements were material to a different agency.
in ismail,for example,defendant made a false statement to a bank,and the government argued the statement was material to the fdic because the bank was fdic insured.the fourth circuit noted that the false statement charge would have been appropriate if it was for making a false material statement in a matter within the jurisdiction of the secretary of treasury,or the internal revenue service,but was not appropriate where the charge was making a false statement within the jurisdiction of the fdic because the statement was not made to that agency.at.ismail thus holds only that where the connection between the agency to which the s
