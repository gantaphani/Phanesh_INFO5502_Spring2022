this public corruption case from puerto rico resulted in the conviction,for misuse of federal housing monies from to,of the sole defendant,edwin rafael.cornier was the general manager,sequentially,of two private management corporations,cora and erco.cornier worked with a hud division director,a contract employee of the puerto rico public housing authority,and their divert united states department of housing and urban development hud funds that were meant for the administration of housing projects in puerto rico.the schemes alleged involved fraud,kickbacks,sham contracts,ghost employees,and conflicts of interest.others involved were convicted under separate indictments.
cornier claimed to be an innocent victim caught in the corrupt schemes of others.he was sentenced to months in prison and three years of supervised release,and sentenced to pay restitution of to hud.cornier appeals both his conviction,on insufficiency of evidence grounds,and his sentence requiring restitution.we affirm the conviction,but vacate part of the restitution order.
cornier was indicted on eight counts,all related to misuse of federal housing funding.cornier pled not guilty.after an jury trial on the first seven counts,he was convicted on six of those seven counts aiding and abetting the theft or misapplication of federal funds in violation of a a and count one conspiring to defraud the united states by violating,in violation of count three aiding and abetting the theft or misapplication of federal funds in violation of a a and via a different scheme than the scheme implicated by count one count four aiding and abetting extortion in violation of a and b count five money laundering in violation of a b i and count six and conspiracy to commit money laundering in violation of h count seven.he was acquitted on count two,which charged him with aiding and abetting the solicitation and acceptance of a kickback in violation of,and.
essentially,count one involved a scheme in which cornier,as general manager of cora,hired the brother of a housing authority employee to prepare and submit vouchers for federal cgp funds and then lied about the nature of the brother employment to the cora board.the preparing vouchers for submission to the housing authority and the underlying modernization work evidenced by the to have been done.the preparation of the vouchers,however,was done by the housing authority employee,who also approved the payment of the vouchers when they were submitted to the housing authority,and not by the brother.as to this scheme,cornier says that no real harm was done.
counts three through seven involved a later scheme with cornier next company,erco.erco employed at an excessive salary the of a hud official.the brother did little work,but he received a handsome salary of a month,kept of it,and passed along the remaining to the hud official.as to this scheme,cornier claims that he was forced into feeding the greed of the hud official,was himself a victim of the official extortion,and was entitled to judgment in his favor.there is no claim of trial error,only that the evidence was insufficient.
at sentencing,the district court addressed count eight,which charged cornier with forfeiture of assets related to the offenses in the other counts,and ordered cornier to pay restitution in the amount of to hud.of that amount,was connected with the count one conviction.cornier now appeals his convictions and the order to pay restitution as to count one.

some background facts about the funding of public housing projects in puerto rico are necessary to understand the schemes involved in this case.hud allocates federal monies to puerto rico for the administration of public housing projects.most of that federal funding is allocated to cover the costs of managing and operating the housing projects.a different portion of the federal funding is allocated to pay for periodic modernization of the housing projects.hud disburses this modernization funding based in part on a comprehensive grant program cgp,so the funds are called cgp funds.the puerto rico public housing administration prpha receives the federal funds from hud and is charged with administering the commonwealth public housing projects.pursuant to a agreement between the government of puerto rico and hud,management of the housing projects in puerto rico is done by private management agencies.such agencies submit bid proposals to prpha,and the proposals are then evaluated by a prpha bid board.a private management agency that has been awarded a management contract by prpha is paid a management fee under the contract using federal funds from hud.in addition,the private management agency may submit requests to prpha for cgp funding in connection with the documented expenses of modernizing and improving its assigned housing projects.
under count one violation of,the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that cornier was an agent of an organization,or of a state,local,or indian tribal government,or any agency thereof that cornier embezzled,stole,obtained by fraud,knowingly converted,or intentionally misapplied property that is valued at or more from such organization,government,or agency and that such organization,government,or agency receives,in any one year period,federal assistance in excess of.
cornier raises no issue about the first or third prongs.he argues only that the second prong was not satisfied because his actions fit within a statutory exception.under c,bona fide salary,wages,fees,or other compensation paid,or expenses paid or reimbursed,in the usual course of business are exempted from the statute coverage.c see united states mills,cir b ona fide salaries,wages,fees,and other compensation either received by or promised by defendants fall within the scope of the subsection c exception.subsection c was added to the statute in,and the only reference to it in the legislative history states that it amends to avoid its possible application to acceptable business practices,at,reprinted in.
the facts pertaining to count one,recounted in the light most favorable to the prosecution,are as follows.cora management group,was a private management agency.cornier,a former prpha employee,was the general manager and a shareholder of cora.among other things,he was in charge of administering bids for contracting services and obtaining cgp funding for cora.in july,cora was awarded a contract with the prpha to manage and maintain certain housing projects.under the contract,cora received federal funds from prpha prpha received those funds from hud.cora received federal assistance in excess of during each of the years in connection with its management of the housing projects.
rubin monroig,a contract employee at prpha,approached cornier in and informed him that cora was not requesting from prpha any cgp funds.cora was,of course,receiving a management fee from prpha to operate the housing projects.that management fee was paid by prpha using federal funds from hud.but cora was also entitled to request cgp funds in order to make physical improvements to the public housing projects it operated and in order to improve its management of those projects unlike the management fee,which was established under the contract,the disbursement of cgp funds was left to the discretion of prpha.like the management fee,the original source of the cgp money disbursed by prpha was hud.rubin monroig told cornier that his brother,francisco monroig,could assist cora in obtaining cgp funds.cornier then hired francisco for that very purpose.
hiring an expert to assist in handling the paperwork associated with obtaining cgp funds was itself a legitimate use of cgp funds because employing such an expert could improve the management of the public housing projects.francisco monroig,however,had absolutely no expertise in or knowledge of cgp funds.whenever cornier needed assistance as to cgp funds,he contacted francisco brother,rubin,who did have such knowledge,and rubin provided the requested assistance.rubin prepared cora requests for cgp funding,which involved creating invoices and associated documentation,and gave them to francisco.francisco then delivered the documents to cornier,who,in turn,submitted them to prpha.this was an by rubin,who could not directly do any of these things because he worked for prpha.francisco did not perform any work at all related to cgp funds.
this case is unusual in that the government made no effort to prove that the underlying work paid for by the hud monies was not done.united states moeller,cir sufficient evidence to convict under a a where,among other things,no written product was ever produced in exchange for state funds.rubin testified that he did in fact provide the expertise necessary to fill out the paperwork associated with requesting cgp funding for maintenance work,and that the underlying maintenance work for which he claimed cgp funding was needed in the invoices he prepared for in fact performed by cora.however,there was also testimony from carmen ortiz,a cora board member,indicating that cornier could have done the paperwork himself.cornier job,after all,was to administer the cora budget and to prepare bids for contracting services.when francisco contract expired,cornier did in fact prepare the cgp invoices himself.see mills,at suggesting that the c exception would not apply if the government proved that salaries were paid for jobs that were unnecessary or unjustified.
the government strategy,it seems,was not to prove that the work was not done,but rather,to prove that the work was done by someone who could not lawfully do it.rubin worked for prpha,and his job was to review the requests for cgp funding from private management agencies such as cora and to authorize payments of cgp funding to those agencies on prpha behalf.rubin gave preferential treatment to cora requests for federal funding,but it was not proven that those requests would not have been funded anyway.cora paid francisco between september and february for the assistance with the paperwork involved in obtaining cgp funds,and francisco passed the money along to rubin.
the government evidence about what cornier got out of this arrangement was not entirely clear.as best we can tell,this scheme may have somewhat increased cora profits in at least two ways.first,cora cgp invoices were never rejected.this was important because there was some evidence that the underlying maintenance work needed to be done and that cora risked losing its management contract if the work was not done.if the cgp invoices had been rejected,then cora might have had to pay for the costs of the maintenance work out of its own funds,if the work was done at all.rubin suggested that the work would not have been done by cora if cgp funds were not available.according to rubin,the benefit of the arrangement to cornier was that cora had the benefit of having some work that they needed to be done,having it actually done at a cost which was not going to be charged against their profit,and the company would appear well for having done that work.second,there was some marginal benefit in that cora cgp invoices were processed more quickly.
whatever the gains to cornier from the arrangement may have been,they were not trivial because cornier both lied about and tried to cover up the arrangement.the cora board was not aware of francisco employment.when the board eventually discovered his employment,it confronted cornier.cornier falsely told the board that he had hired francisco because prpha had demanded that cora hire a cgp lobbyist.francisco only worked about a month after the board discovery,and cornier told the board that francisco employment had ended because his contract had expired,even though the contract actually had no expiration date.
cornier argues that his conviction on count one should be reversed because the payments that he authorized to francisco monroig constituted legitimate compensation paid in the usual course of business and thus fell within the c exception.cornier points out that cgp funds could lawfully be used to hire experts to assist cora in requesting funds from prpha.further,he maintains that there was no evidence either that he had any knowledge that rubin monroig was receiving any part of the payments made to francisco monroig,or that he had any knowledge that rubin,not francisco,was the one actually doing the work.without such knowledge,cornier argues,the payments to francisco were made in good faith.in other words,francisco and rubin may have had a scheme,but he was not part of it.
there was sufficient evidence for the jury to convict.first,the intentionality element of the intentional misapplication of federal funds was met by evidence that cornier in fact knew that rubin did the work,not francisco.there was testimony that francisco was entirely ignorant about cgp funds and that cornier never even bothered to ask francisco about them.francisco testified that he really did know what cgp was and that the work required by his employment contract with cora was not performed by him,but rather by rubin.francisco explained that he never talked to cornier about cgp funds and that cornier never asked him about them.his limited conversation with cornier pertaining to the documents he delivered was,if cornier had any questions regarding the information,cornier should contact my brother rubin because he was the one who could answer.
rubin testimony was consistent with francisco.rubin acknowledged that francisco had no knowledge of federal funds and could not have assisted cornier with them.rubin testified that i suppose that cornier knew that francisco did know anything about cgp funds,because cornier never asked him about them.rubin explained that he himself prepared the invoices for cornier and that cornier would contact him,not francisco,to discuss work related to cgp funds 
furthermore,cornier own behavior belies his contention that he had no knowledge that he was involving cora in sham contracts with francisco it supports the conclusion that he took active steps to conceal the fraud.cornier met with francisco behind closed doors,and he never informed the cora board that francisco was being employed.when eventually confronted by the board,cornier first lied about the reason that francisco was hired and then lied about the termination date of francisco contract.
this brings us to the bona fide salary exception in c,and to cornier argument that the payments were not a misapplication at all.the jury could easily have concluded that the payments to rubin through francisco were not bona fide because the prpha conflict of interest rules prohibited rubin from participating in such a scheme.a scheme designed to evade conflict of interest rules is hardly legitimate or acceptable.that the payments were made for a legitimate hire a cgp expert to obtain funding for maintenance work that was indeed not render them bona fide under the statute if they were intentionally misapplied,as they were here via sham contracts that skirted conflict of interest rules and allowed cora to receive preferential treatment and other benefits.
this interplay between the bona fide exception and the prohibition against intentional misapplication is sensible.as the second circuit has explained,the first four prohibitions of a a,embezzlement,stealing,obtaining by fraud,and knowing conversion,cover any possible taking of money for one own use or benefit.intentional misapplication,in order to avoid redundancy,must mean intentional misapplication for otherwise legitimate purposes if it were for illegitimate purposes,it would be covered by the first four prohibitions united states urlacher,cir.the prohibition against intentional misapplication covers the situation presented here payments made for what was an underlying legitimate purpose but intentionally misapplied to undermine a conflict of interest prohibition.to hold that such payments were bona fide under c would be inconsistent with a a.
we affirm the conviction on count one.
counts three,four,five,six,and seven 
to convict cornier under count three conspiracy to violate,the government had to prove that there was an agreement,an unlawful objective of the agreement here,violation of,and an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.united states barker steel,cir.
to convict cornier under count four the government had to prove that cornier aided and abetted in a violation of,the elements of which were set forth earlier.
to convict cornier under count five aiding and abetting extortion,the government had to prove that cornier aided the inducement of a victim to part with property that he did so knowingly and willingly with extortionate means and that interstate commerce was affected.see united states stephens,cir.
to convict cornier under count six money laundering under a b i,the government had to show that cornier knowingly conducted a financial transaction,that he knew the transaction involved funds that were the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,that the funds involved were in fact the proceeds of a specified unlawful activity,and that cornier engaged in the financial transaction knowing that it was designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature,location,source,ownership,or control of the proceeds of such unlawful activity.see a b i united states,cir.
count seven charged conspiracy to launder money.
cornier appeal of counts three through seven boils down to a single he was an innocent victim of extortion by juan irizarry valentin irizarry.
the facts relevant to the remaining counts,described in the light most favorable to the prosecution,are as follows.in,cornier befriended irizarry,who was the director,operations division,office of public housing at hud in puerto rico.irizarry job at hud involved visiting and evaluating the public housing projects that were managed by private management agencies.
in,cora received a fee for its management and maintenance of certain shelters that were set up by fema in the aftermath of the devastation wrought by hurricane george.normally,all the cora partners shared in management fees.when the management fee from fema arrived in this instance,however,cornier took carmen ortiz,one of the cora board members,to see irizarry at irizarry hud office.irizarry falsely told ortiz that the fee could only be divided among the three cora partners who had actively worked on the shelters.as a result,the management fee was split among cornier and only two other cora board members,so cornier received a larger share than he should have.irizarry thus lined cornier pocket by making a false statement.
cornier formed his own management agency company,erco enterprises,erco in irizarry helped cornier behind the scenes to incorporate erco and then to prepare a bid proposal to prpha.irizarry,a hud official,did not sit on the prpha board that would act on the proposal.the proposal budget set forth the allocation of the money that erco planned to spend in managing the requested housing projects.under the public housing project system,federal funds paid the salaries of management agency employees assigned to the particular housing projects.in its proposal,erco budgeted a generous salary of about annually for an assistant general manager the person named was roberto colon.
based on that proposal,prpha awarded erco a dollar,contract april to march to manage and maintain certain housing projects.the overall contract was worth.there is no evidence that irizarry influenced the prpha to approve the proposal,including its generous salary figure.after the contract was awarded to erco,irizarry arranged for a meeting among cornier,samuel valentin toro irizarry,valentin and himself.at that meeting,irizarry introduced cornier to valentin as your next boss.cornier offered valentin an assistant general manager position for per month annually,plus additional incentives.valentin accepted the offer and was hired to work as an assistant general manager.cornier wife,raquel rios,was also hired to work as an assistant general manager she was paid the same salary as valentin.so,a year was being spent on the position of assistant general manager.roberto colon,who had been designated as the assistant general manager in the bid proposal,never held the position.
irizarry then instructed valentin to open a bank account and to deposit the money from cornier there each month.irizarry told valentin to keep each month for himself it was understood that irizarry would keep the remaining.irizarry received approximately in payments from cornier in this way.
even before valentin started working for erco,cornier made payments to irizzary by issuing two checks to valentin and then endorsing the checks to himself by forging valentin signature.cornier deposited these checks in his own bank account and then wrote out checks to irizarry from that account for comparable amounts.cornier also created and signed false employment records for valentin in connection with the two checks.irizarry later asked valentin to imitate the forged signature on future checks.
cornier argues that he was an innocent victim of extortion by irizarry and thus entitled to judgment in his favor on each of the remaining counts.as to counts three and four,the government asserts that there is no innocent victim defense to a violation of.while some case law suggests that mere acquiescence to an extortioner demands for payments may not be criminal under extortion,see united states spitler,cir,cornier has pointed to no authority,and we have not discovered any,to support a similar defense to.evans united states,d extortion and bribery are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
we have already discussed the bona fide exception defense to liability,and it has no conceivable application to the irizarry affair.as to counts three and four,then,we take the defendant innocent victim argument as a claim that there was insufficient evidence that he entered into an agreement with irizarry and valentin to intentionally misapply funds in violation of.
the government evidence supporting the existence of an agreement included the following that irizarry had helped cornier to get money while at cora and then helped him to incorporate erco and to prepare a bid proposal for a prpha management contract that the bid proposal included an annual salary of designated for an assistant general manager named roberto colon that once erco was awarded the contract,valentin,irizarry,was substituted for colon and paid a salary that even valentin conceded was grossly inflated that valentin gave of his monthly salary to irizarry,who had arranged the meeting among the three men at which cornier offered valentin the position and that cornier was clearly aware that valentin was being used to funnel money to irizarry because even before valentin began working for erco,cornier paid valentin,falsely endorsed the payments to himself,and then used the money to pay irizarry.based on that evidence,the jury was amply justified in concluding that irizarry and cornier had an agreement to submit a bid proposal that included an inflated salary figure for the assistant general manager position,to substitute valentin for colon,and to use the inflated salary to channel federal funds to irizarry.the inflated salary in the bid proposal provided cornier with the extra federal funds necessary to pay irizarry,so the jury could logically infer that the men had agreed to include the inflated salary in the bid for that very purpose.that cornier engaged in the misapplication of funds intentionally is supported by the evidence of his efforts to conceal the channeling the payments to irizarry through valentin,by using roberto colon name on the bid proposal,and by signing false employment rec
