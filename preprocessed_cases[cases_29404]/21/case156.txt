wayne vargas de jesús appeals the district court denial of his petition for relief.vargas contends that his petition should have been granted because his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance at sentencing in violation of the sixth amendment.we affirm.
because we are considering a petition,we recount the proceedings not only through conviction and sentencing,but also through vargas direct appeal.that way,we will have provided all of the background that is relevant to the issues that are now before us on review.
we start with what happened at trial.in,a jury found vargas guilty of two counts of possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance within one thousand feet of a school,in violation of a and,and one count of conspiracy to do the same,see 
in rendering the verdict,the jury set forth findings about the drug quantity involved in each offense in a special verdict form.the jury found that one of the two substantive possession counts involved grams or more of cocaine base and that the other involved kilograms or more of cocaine.the jury also found that the conspiracy count involved at least grams of cocaine base.
the probation officer then prepared the presentence report psr.apparently relying on the jury findings in the special verdict form,the psr recommended a base offense level of under the united states sentencing guidelines based on drug quantities of kilograms of cocaine and grams of cocaine base.after applying various enhancements,and using a criminal history category of i,the psr calculated a guideline sentencing range of to months imprisonment.
defense counsel did not object at the sentencing hearing to the psr drug quantity determination.the district court adopted that determination,as well as the psr other recommendations.the district court then imposed a sentence of months imprisonment on each of vargas three counts,with those sentences to be served concurrently.
vargas appealed.he argued that the district court did not have jurisdiction over the two substantive possession counts due to the federal juvenile delinquency act fjda.we agreed because the only evidence supporting those counts concerned conduct vargas engaged in before he had reached the age of eighteen the age of majority and because the government had not certified that the case satisfied one of the enumerated conditions in the fjda that would permit federal court jurisdiction over juvenile conduct.see united states vargas de jesús,cir.
at the same time,we rejected vargas argument that,under the fjda,the district court also lacked jurisdiction over the conspiracy count.id.at.we reasoned that the government had supported the conspiracy count with evidence of conduct that vargas engaged in not only before but also after he had turned eighteen.id.at.and,citing our decision in united states welch,cir,we held that a jury may consider evidence of a defendant conduct to establish the existence of a conspiracy so long as the defendant had in some manner ratified his participation in the conspiracy after attaining majority.vargas de jesús,at alterations and internal quotation marks omitted.
on remand,the district court did not resentence vargas.instead,the district court entered an amended judgment reflecting that vargas had been convicted of only the conspiracy count.the district court then imposed the same sentence that it had selected at vargas sentencing months imprisonment 
following the district court entry of the amended judgment,vargas,proceeding pro se,filed a petition to vacate or modify his sentence under.the district court referred vargas petition to a magistrate judge,who recommended denying the petition.the district court adopted that recommendation and thus denied the petition.
both the magistrate judge and the district court construed the petition to argue only that the defense counsel had provided ineffective assistance during vargas trial.neither read the petition to contend that the defense counsel had also provided ineffective assistance at sentencing.
following the district court denial of the petition,vargas sought a certificate of appealability coa.the district court denied the request.proceeding pro se requested a coa from this court.
in considering vargas request,we interpreted vargas petition to argue that his counsel was ineffective both at trial and at sentencing.we issued a coa only as to the latter question,upon which the district court had not ruled.specifically,we granted vargas a coa on the issue 
whether counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to challenge the drug quantity attributed to petitioner at sentencing,given that petitioner participation in the charged conspiracy occurred largely while he was underage,and that the evidence of narcotics transactions presented at trial was limited to transactions occurring before petitioner reached the age of majority.
we also granted vargas request for appointment of counsel.
where,as here,the district court did not address the ineffective assistance of counsel claim that we certified for appeal,an appellate court usually is to handle the inquiry that such claims often require.united states ofray campos,cir.nevertheless,here we may address such a claim because the critical facts are not in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of the claim.united states mala,cir 
in pressing his ineffective assistance claim,vargas contends that the only evidence of actual drug quantities introduced during his trial involved drug transactions that took place prior to him reaching the age of majority,and that defense counsel should have objected to the use of that evidence to calculate vargas sentence.vargas argues that,had counsel so objected,the objection would have been successful and would have resulted in a lower sentence.he thus claims ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing.see strickland washington,d holding that,to succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim,a petitioner must show both deficient performance and prejudice see also lafler cooper,d stating that strickland applies in the sentencing context,as there exists a right to counsel during sentencing.
an attorney performance is deficient under strickland,however,only where,given the facts known at the time,counsel choice was so patently unreasonable that no competent attorney would have made it.knight spencer,cir internal quotation marks omitted.to prevail on a claim of deficient performance,moreover,a defendant must overcome the strong presumption that the action he challenges might be sound strategy on the part of his attorney.see horton allen,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we conclude that vargas has not overcome that strong presumption because an objectively reasonable counsel could have made a strategic choice not to object to the use of vargas conduct in fashioning vargas sentence.see wilder united states,cir judging whether counsel was ineffective by asking whether o bjectively reasonable counsel could have made a strategic choice to do as actual counsel did.
there was,at the time of sentencing,substantial precedent uniformly rejecting the argument that conduct could not be considered for purposes of sentencing in a case like vargas.see united states gibbs,cir holding that the district court could take into account quantities of crack cocaine the defendant sold before he reached age eighteen as relevant conduct to the defendant drug trafficking convictions united states thomas,since the defendant was properly convicted in adult court of a conspiracy he joined as a juvenile but continued in after eighteen,the guidelines unambiguously permit the court to consider his and his foreseeable conduct that occurred during the commission of the entire conspiracy offense.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted united states sparks,app x,cir unpublished i n sentencing an adult defendant for conspiracy,a district court may consider all relevant conduct,including conduct which occurred when the defendant was a juvenile participant in the conspiracy.accordingly,we find the defendant argument that the district court erred in considering the d
