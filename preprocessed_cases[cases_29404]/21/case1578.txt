patrick cole appeals from an order sentencing him to months imprisonment.principally because the district court failed to provide sufficient notice of its intent to consider sua sponte an sentence,we vacate and remand.
background 
a.the offense and plea agreement 
in may,a grand jury in the western district of new york indicted patrick cole on counts of mail fraud.after the filing of the indictment,authorities arrested cole in nevada,releasing him on conditions that included he voluntarily appear to answer charges in the western district of new york.cole appeared before the district court where he initially pled not guilty.after litigating pretrial motions,however,cole accepted a plea agreement in which he pled guilty to a single count of mail fraud.
according to the plea agreement,cole held himself out to be a successful investor,who was willing to invest money of others,falsely claiming that he was investing their money by trading stocks.plea agreement of patrick cole.cole accentuated this fraud by establishing sanssuecie,a nevada corporation.because it was based in nevada,cole told his victims,the corporation benefitted from certain tax advantages that he could pass on to his investors.in fact,cole did maintain two nevada at a postal annex and the other at a gas employed a mail forwarding service to coordinate the two.cole used these addresses and the mail forwarding service to dispatch victim investors statements from las vegas with a las vegas and a las vegas postmark,thus supporting the illusion the investments occurred through his company in las vegas.these fraudulent statements falsely show ed large returns so as to lull the investors into believing they had ample funds invested.in addition,cole plied a technique for part of his scheme,paying returns to earlier investors with money provided by later victims,thus lending his con a further air of legitimacy.in truth,cole had not invested the money entrusted to him by his victims but instead used that money to finance his ongoing scheme as well as personal expenses.all told,cole defrauded his victims of nearly million over the course of at least four years.more than million of that sum has not been recovered.
cole acquiesced,by way of his plea agreement,to all but one of the guidelines adjustments the government sought.cole agreed to the base offense level level,as well as an enhancement for the amount of loss level increase,an enhancement for number of victims level increase,and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility level reduction.cole reserved the right to dispute,however,the government proposed enhancement for use of sophisticated means under b.plea agreement of patrick cole the defendant specifically reserves the right at the time of sentencing to argue to the court that this sophisticated means enhancement does not apply.cole and the government agreed cole was a offender and so merited a criminal history category of thus,in advance of his sentencing hearing,cole sought application of a guidelines range of months,while the government advocated for a guidelines range of months.the difference in the ranges reflected simply the parties disagreement as to whether cole used sophisticated means in executing his scheme.
b.the presentence investigation report and the sentencing hearing 
before he filed the presentence investigation report the psr,the probation officer reviewed the plea agreement and interviewed cole in the presence of his counsel.the probation officer then endorsed the government guidelines range offense level of,and a criminal history category of i,yielding a guidelines range of months.the psr also stated there appeared to be no reason to depart from the guidelines range.
cole filed a timely written request for a downward departure,in which,as reserved in the plea agreement,he also objected to the proposed sophisticated means enhancement.the government responded to this objection on its merits.ultimately,the government urged the district court to sentence cole within the advisory sentencing guidelines range of months,but at the highest end of that range.although cole did meet with the probation officer before the filing of the psr,neither he nor his attorney did so after the psr was filed and before the sentencing hearing.
at the sentencing hearing,which lasted about an hour and a half,the district court explained it would not entertain cole argument disputing the sophisticated means enhancement.the court justified this ruling by reference to the local procedural guidelines of the federal sentencing procedures under the sentencing reform act of.p aragraph of that document,the court explained,requires a party who reasonably disputes sentencing factors to seek administrative resolution of the disputed factors through opposing counsel and the probation office before filing its statement with respect to the sentencing factors.the court further explained that paragraph five of that document required counsel to confer with the opposing counsel and the probation office in a good faith effort to resolve the disputed matter.the court concluded that by failing to meet with the probation officer between the filing of the psr and the sentencing hearing,defense counsel violated these rules.
after denying defense counsel the opportunity to argue the objection to the sophisticated means enhancement,the district court continued with the sentencing proceedings.in summarizing the applicable guidelines range,the district court initially gave no indication of its intent to consider an upward departure.after hearing several of cole victims,the district court noted that cole could not account for all his gains and one of the most amazing things about all the things i been reading is he did know what he did with the money.he ca account for the money.the district court then stated that absent evidence to the contrary,it could infer cole has got a stash somewhere or an offshore account in which cole had secreted the stolen money.the conclusion that cole had hidden the money,the district court made clear,constituted a basis for an upward departure i intend to give him a sentence higher than any guideline range.the district court and defense counsel then engaged in a colloquy concerning the validity of the inference that defendant had a stash of stolen money.during this colloquy the district court again stated the inference means going over the guidelines.and i telling you right now i intend to do it.later,the district court appeared to retreat from its insistence that an upward departure must be imposed i just putting you on notice that i seriously considering going over.ultimately,at the end of the sentencing proceeding,less than an hour and a half after it had begun,the district court adopted the government proposed guidelines range of months,then departed upward months to arrive at a sentence of months incarceration.
ii.discussion 
notice of intent to consider sentence 
in this case,the district court sua sponte imposed an sentence,departing months above the highest end of the guidelines range that it found applicable.as cole correctly notes,a district court must provide reasonable prehearing notice of its intent to consider a sentence above the guidelines range.i c united states anati,cir.of course,the right to be heard has little worth unless one is informed that a decision is contemplated.burns united states,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the notice given during the course of the sentencing hearing and put into effect less than two hours later was insufficient.failure to give such reasonable notice constitutes plain error.consequently,we remand.united states gilmore,cir per curiam.on remand,the district court must provide the defendant notice so as to avert unfair surprise as well as facilitate adversarial testing of factual and legal considerations relevant to the contemplated departure.anati,at internal quotation marks omitted.
refusal to consider defense counsel objection to the guidelines calculation 
in the estimation of the district court,cole counsel violated a local procedural guidelines rule by failing to meet in conference with a probation officer in the time between the filing of the psr and the sentencing hearing,to discuss his objections to the psr.in response to this ostensible procedural violation,the district court denied cole the opportunity to argue his objection to the sophisticated means enhancement.we hold that judge arcara should have afforded cole this opportunity.
the local procedural guidelines rule 
as a preliminary matter,the parties dispute the status of the district court local procedural guidelines rule.thus,our first task is to identify this rule and determine its relationship to the federal rules of criminal procedure.see.b mandating that standing orders be consistent with the federal rules.the parties draw our attention to a document called procedure to assist practitioners before the united states district court judges richard arcara and william skretny in proceedings under the sentencing reform act of in western district of new york,available at last visited august,which we include in an appendix to this opinion.paragraph three of that document hereinafter,paragraph three states 
if a party disputes any legal conclusions,sentencing factors or findings of facts material to sentencing included in the psr,or seeks the inclusion in the psr of any additional legal conclusions,sentencing factors or facts material to sentencing,it is that party obligation to seek administrative resolution of such disputes by conferring with opposing counsel and the probation office prior to filing the statement of parties with respect to sentencing factors.this presentence conference is mandatory except when the psr is undisputed.no party may file a written objection to the psr unless he or she has conferred with opposing counsel and the probation office in a good faith effort to resolve the disputed matter.
cole and the government agree paragraph three does not have the force of a local rule it was not adopted by a majority of judges following a period of appropriate public notice and comment the government instead contends paragraph three reflects a standing order.we conclude that because paragraph three does not constitute a local rule,it must be a standing order.rule b,which governs standing orders and is captioned procedure when there is no controlling law,provides that a judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law,these rules,and the local rules of the district.cole argues that federal rule of criminal procedure f,which governs objections to the psr,represents c ontrolling l aw in this area and thus must preclude the district court from addressing in a standing order the procedure covered in paragraph three.
the advisory committee comments on rule explain that rule b was intended to allow individual courts to regulate matters of detail by local rules or usage.matters of detail include the mode of impaneling a jury,the manner and order of interposing challenges to jurors,the manner of selecting the foreman of a trial jury,the matter of sealed verdicts,the order of counsel arguments to the jury,and other similar details.rule b advisory committee note.although we have not specifically addressed the standard by which to evaluate the validity of a standing order promulgated pursuant to rule b,the third circuit has read a and rule together to impose two requirements for a valid standing order affecting criminal matters.first,the local rules must not be inconsistent with the federal rules of criminal procedure.second,as the advisory notes to rule made clear,the local rules must be narrow in scope and must deal with matters of detail not covered by the federal rules.baylson disciplinary bd.of supreme court,cir footnote omitted.local rules that fail to comply with those requirements are nullities.id.citing frazier heebe,d.by comparison,the tenth circuit reads rule to impose a consistency requirement,but not a per se matters of detail requirement.see united states robertson,cir rule permits the adoption of internal rules only when two circumstances exist.first,the district as a whole has not adopted a rule bearing on the same matter,and second,so long as the internal rule is not inconsistent with the federal rules or other rules.
we need not determine whether the district court standing order must also regulate only a matter of detail if paragraph of the standing order is inconsistent with federal law.in discussing a district court rule authority to promulgate local rules,we have concentrated on the consistency requirement in rule a for rules promulgated by a majority of the district court,rather than rules adopted by individual judges under rule b,but we can apply the analysis of the meaning of consistent to both parts of the rule.see,schneider feinberg,cir the canons of statutory construction favor the consistent use of terms throughout a statute.united states gabriel,cir a term appearing in several places in a statutory text is generally read the same way each time it appears.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.compare.a describing local rules adopted by a majority of a district court a local rule must be consistent not duplicative statutes and rules adopted under and must conform to any uniform numbering system prescribed by the judicial conference of the united states,with.b describing standing orders adopted by individual district court judges a judge may regulate practice in any manner consistent with federal law,these rules,and the local rules of the district.standing orders,of course,must also be consistent with the district court local rules.
the standing order consistency with federal rule of criminal procedure 
we focus on the question whether the standing order is consistent with federal rules of criminal procedure f and i.federal rule of criminal procedure f provides an objecting party must provide a copy of its objections to the opposing party and to the probation officer.f.after receiving objections,the probation officer may meet with the parties to discuss the objections before submitting a revised psr to the court seven days prior to the hearing.f emphasis added see also.rule i c,meanwhile,states the sentencing court must allow the parties attorneys to comment on the probation officer determinations and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence.
rule in subdivisions f and i in intended to provide efficient and focused,adversarial resolution of the legal and factual issues to ensure that a defendant is not sentenced on the basis of materially untrue statements or misinformation.united states sisti,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.this purpose is clear from the history of the rule enactment.the judicial conference first proposed the provisions pertaining to objections to the psr in amid concerns that sentencing hearings would become more complex due to the new fact finding requirements imposed by guideline sentencing methodology.report of the advisory committee on criminal rules to the committee on rules of practice and procedure,available at www.uscourts.gov rules reports cr.pdf last visited august.thus,in the supreme court approved,and congress adopted,a version of rule that newly focused on preparation of the psr as a means of identifying and narrowing the issues to be decided at the sentencing hearing.id.in the same revision,rule was drafted to reflect greater emphasis on a defendant right to argue objections to the district court at the sentencing hearing id.at.the conference shaped both these provisions to maximize judicial economy by providing for more orderly sentencing hearings while also providing fair opportunity for both parties to review,object to,and comment upon,the probation officer report in advance of the sentencing hearing.id.at see also federal criminal code and rules thomson west.the case law confirms this understanding of rule purpose.see sisti,at a defendant must have an opportunity to assure the accurate presentation of reliable sentencing information to the district court.citations and internal quotation marks omitted united states reiss,cir similar united states,cir stating that the sentencing procedures laid out by rule are designed to narrow the issues and provide due notice united
