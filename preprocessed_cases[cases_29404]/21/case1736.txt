teddy molina defendant or appellant appeals from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered november,in the united states district court for the northern district of new york munson,following his guilty plea to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,in violation of g.molina pled guilty before district judge thomas mcavoy.sentencing was referred to district judge howard munson,who conducted the sentencing hearing.
this appeal presents us with a sentencing record that we believe contains error.the error is not a reasoned error by the district court,but an error of omission.it is not uncommon when reviewing a record on appeal to be confronted with an error not so substantial as to require reversal,and yet not so insignificant that it may in justice be ignored.such is the circumstance of this case,and the reason why we write.
in the early morning hours of august,in syracuse,new york,teddy molina with three other cireno,carlos belez,and irvin aviles apprehended by syracuse police after a citizen reported that they had been observed crouching in some shrubbery at a house on seymour street.when the police arrived,molina and his cohorts fled,pursued by the police on foot.all four were quickly captured.but during the chase,the men dropped firearms that were later recovered by the police.in all,four firearms were found,including a shotgun and three pistols,one of which had an obliterated serial number.
subsequently,it turned out that molina and the other three men were planning an armed robbery of an individual they believed was a drug dealer who had drugs and money in his seymour street home.on august,a federal grand jury handed down a indictment charging all four participants with weapons charges,as follows receiving stolen firearms count selling defaced firearms count unlawfully transporting firearms count and possession of a firearm as a prohibited person convicted felon count.teddy molina pled guilty to count,charging him with possession of firearms as a prohibited person in violation of g.
his plea,pursuant to a plea agreement,satisfied his criminal liability under the indictment and left open the question of whether an aggravating role adjustment should be applied for his role in the offense.molina presentence investigation report psr recommended a enhancement for his role as manager or organizer under the sentencing guidelines manual c.before the sentencing hearing and to prepare for that hearing,defendant counsel asked the district court that he be provided with the presentence reports and criminal histories of molina three.the district court did not rule on this motion prior to holding molina sentencing hearing.
on september,the sentencing hearing was held on the proposed enhancement for molina being an organizer.the government called one of his,jos√© luis cireno,as a witness.cireno testified with respect to molina role in organizing the crime,including the facts that molina suggested the crime,provided each with a firearm,brought tape to the purported crime scene to the intended victim,and brought for communication.defense counsel cireno,but called no witnesses.
several weeks later the district court denied by memorandum and order dated october,molina motion for disclosure of his psrs.it ruled that neither the jencks act,nor our ruling in united states charmer industries,cir,supported molina request for presentence reports.judge munson noted that he had reviewed in camera cireno presentence report and found that it contained no exculpatory or impeachment material.the district court ruled that since the other two were not called to testify,defendant request for their psrs was moot.
on october,the district court granted the sentence enhancement the government had requested,raising molina total offense level to,for which he was sentenced to months in prison,three years of supervised release,and a special assessment.this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,molina contends the district judge erred by failing to conduct an in camera review of two of his presentence reports to determine whether they contained exculpatory impeachment material that appellant could present at his sentencing hearing and,additionally erred in imposing a enhancement for appellant role in the offense pursuant to c without making sufficient factual findings.we discuss each contention in turn.
i in camera review of psrs 
to keep our analysis in context,we take a brief look at how presentence reports evolved.the present day presentence report traces its ancestry back to the federal probation act of,ch,stat,repealed in,establishing probation offices to supervise offenders placed on probation.trial judges began to use probation officers as a source of informal information regarding offenders.this informal approach was standardized in by federal rule of criminal procedure c.the presentence report thereafter became the single most important document at sentencing and during defendant imprisonment.stephen fennell william hall,due process at sentencing an empirical and legal analysis of the disclosure of presentence reports in federal courts,harv.
focus turns to federal rule of criminal procedure,particularly rule c,which for the first time required the probation department to prepare a report on each defendant.subdivision d of rule sets out the information that a presentence report should contain.insofar as pertinent here,it includes 
a the defendant history and characteristics,including 
i any prior criminal record 
ii the defendant financial condition and 
iii any circumstances affecting the defendant behavior that may be helpful in imposing sentence or in correctional treatment 
b verified information,stated in a nonargumentative style,that assesses the financial,social,psychological,and medical impact on any individual against whom the offense has been committed 
f any other information that the court requires.
subdivision e discusses the disclosure of the report and the probation officer recommendation.it states unless the defendant has consented in writing,the probation officer must not submit a presentence report to the court or disclose its contents to anyone until the defendant has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere,or has been found guilty.e.
thus,presentence investigation reports,created by the probation office,function primarily to assist the court in determining an appropriate sentence.for that reason they are generally viewed as confidential so as not to impede the free flow of information needed to assist the sentencing judge.see charmer,at.but the confidentiality of presentence reports has not been considered absolute because of due process concerns that a court not impose an unjust sentence based on materially false information obtained from others besides the defendant.townsend burke.
with this background in mind,we turn to the question before us defendant request to have an examination of his psrs.with respect to third party disclosures,we have approved a procedure by which the sentencing court examines requested presentence reports in camera for exculpatory or impeachment material that might aid the defendant requesting it.the court then determines if the policy of confidentiality is outweighed by a compelling need for disclosure to meet the ends of justice.see charmer,at united states moore,cir.here,it is undisputed that the district court examined the presentence report of the witness,cireno.the question before us therefore is whether the district court erred in not following the same procedure with the two additional.this issue is a question of first impression.
to begin,we set out our standard of review.ordinarily,a district court decision as to disclosure of a presentence investigation report is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.united states pena,cir.in the instant case,however,the sentencing court ruled that the motion for disclosure was moot as to the two defendants.because that ruling was one of law,and not an exercise of discretion,we review it de novo.see catanzano wing,cir.
the government had the burden at appellant hearing to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was an organizer or leader in the criminal offense for which he was convicted.to discharge that burden the government is required to present facts sufficient to warrant the sentence enhancement.because of our emphasis on the confidentiality of presentence reports,and because the presentence reports of those than defendant not obviously relevant to the accuracy of defendant sentence,we have ruled that a showing of compelling need must be made to obtain disclosure of the reports of.see moore,at procedure is for district court to review psr in camera see also united states trevino,cir no disclosure of presentence investigative report absent plausible showing of materiality and favorability.
the fourth circuit has taken a broad view of the ends of justice stating that when a witness whose psr is sought to be disclosed is a,a proper concern for the rights of the defendant requires in some cases that confidentiality of that psr be breached because the testimony of such witness may be shaded to curry favorable treatment rather than being premised upon an overriding concern for the truth.united states figurski,cir.be that as it may,we nonetheless think that,under our precedents,no in camera review of a psr is required without a threshold showing of a good faith belief that a psr contains exculpatory evidence not available elsewhere.united states zolin,d party asserting exception to privilege must make threshold showing to trigger in camera review.
in the case at hand,appellant has made no showing of how the presentence reports of are essential to ensure the fairness of his hearing or the reliability of the facts presented to the court.instead,molina abstract arguments that the reports might affect how he cireno,or may have caused him to present testimony through one or both remaining fall well short of the particularity required to demonstrate a compelling need.see charmer,at united states corbitt,cir.further,key to the showing of a third person seeking disclosure is whether the information in the presentence report is obtainable from other sources.see charmer,at.appellant had the opportunity to call his as witnesses at the hearing and chose not to do so.accessing their presentence reports should not serve as a substitute for other available means of obtaining the information they contain.
having so concluded,we add that in the interests of justice,and since we are conducting de novo review of this issue,we obtained and examined the presentence reports,held under seal,of all three,jos√© cireno,irvin aviles manso,and carlos belez.none of the presentence reports contain exculpatory or impeachment material indicating that any of the served in place of or in the role of organizer of the planned robbery in short,there is no material for which appellant could reasonably be said to have a compelling need.as a consequence,even assuming that the sentencing court as a matter of preferred practice should examine all the psrs in camera,its failure to do so in this case was harmless error.
ii sentence enhancement 
we turn next to examine the district court factual findings to see if they are sufficient to support the sentence enhancement imposed on appellant for being an organizer or leader.our precedents are uniform in requiring a district court to make specific factual findings to support a sentence enhancement under.united states szur,cir united states zagari,cir united states stevens,cir.we overturn a sentencing court findings as to the defendant role in the offense only if those findings are clearly erroneous.see szur,at.
adoption of the presentence report 
a district court satisfies its obligation to make the requisite specific factual findings when it explicitly adopts the factual findings set forth in the presentence report.united states eyman,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d see united states zichettello,cir,cert.denied,d.it may do so either at the sentencing hearing or in the written judgment it files later.united states thompson,cir.
in the present case the sentencing court entire explanation of the sentence enhancement was as follows 
the court all right.thank you,southwick.anything further 
wells no,judge,except that i thought you did not rule on the enhancement on the day of the hearing,i thought you reserved it until time of sentencing.
the court well,how much difference does that make 
wells just that i wanted to make sure i also put on the record that i did not concede the issue that had been ruled on.
the court well,i rule on it now.
wells yes,sir.
the court i grant the enhancement at this time.molina,the court finds that the total offense level in this case is,and the criminal history category is iii,and the guideline imprisonment range is to months 
this is light treatment indeed,and it does not meet the requirement imposed on the district court of making specific factual findings.the quoted discussion does not indicate whether the trial court actually considered the requisite factors under.some of those factors are,for example,the defendant exercise of decision making authority,his recruitment of accomplices,and the degree of his participation in organizing the offense.see,cmt.such a lack of specificity devoid of any statement of reasons does not permit meaningful appellate review of the enhancement the district court imposed.
moreover,a sentencing court that relies on a psr must not only agree with that report,but must also adopt it expressly.despite the insufficiency of the explanation offered for the sentence enhancement,the district court arguably satisfied its obligations under thompson by expressly adopting the presentence report in the statement of reasons set out in its written judgment.
however,even if the district court was sufficiently explicit in satisfying its obligations under thompson,we still must consider whether the trial court satisfied its obligations under c to state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.the trial court did not satisfy this unambiguous mandate.
several of our cases contain language that might appear to be at odds with the terms of c,which requires that t he court,at the time of sentencing,shall state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence emphasis added.see,eyman,at a district court satisfies its obligation to make the requisite factual findings when it indicates in its written judgment that it is adopting the findings set forth in the psr.emphasis added accord united states martin,cir united states prince,cir thompson,at.the issue before the court in those cases,however,was the district court obligation to make sufficient factual its obligation to state those findings in open it is not surprising that the cited cases did not address the open court requirement.consequently,we do not read them as dispensing with the requirements of c.congress had goals in mind when it enacted c,including to inform the defendant of the reasons for his sentence,to permit meaningful appellate review,to enable the public to learn why defendant received a particular sentence,and to guide probation officers and prison officials in developing a program to meet defendant needs.see,at,reprinted in,united states carey,cir.we are concerned that these goals may not be fully met when the to support a sentence enhancement is set out only in the written judgment.
we recognize nonetheless that the open court requirement may be satisfied by the district court adopting the psr in open court.adopting the psr in open court puts the defendant on notice of the grounds for the sentence imposed since the defendant usually has either seen his own psr or is entitled to ask for it.however,in the present case the district court did not state either its reasons or adopt the psr in open court.
harmless error analysis 
although this omission was error,we must examine the error to ascertain if it was harmless.this will depend on whether the reasons supporting the finding that appellant was an organizer or leader were sufficiently explained in the presentence report,and whether the district court satisfactorily adopted those findings in its statement of reasons.inasmuch as appellant did not object at the time to the lack of spec
