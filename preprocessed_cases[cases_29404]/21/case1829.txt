luis santiago gonzalez appeals from a judgment of conviction and sentence entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york kaplan,sentencing him principally to a term of imprisonment of twelve months and one day.the sentence was imposed following his conviction on a plea of guilty to embezzling funds from a federally insured bank.through his counsel,gonzalez at sentencing requested a discretionary downward departure in the applicable guideline range based on a claim of aberrant behavior.the district court rejected that request as a matter of law.whether the rejection was justified in this case as a matter of law is the sole issue facing this court on appeal.we hold that it was not,and for the reasons that follow we vacate the sentence and remand the case to the district court for a resentencing consistent with this opinion.
background 
employed by deutsche bank as a payroll administrator,gonzalez was able to manipulate electronic payroll records to cause a severance payment of to be made in the name of rahul bajaj on january.bajaj had been fired by the bank on december.gonzalez also altered direct deposit information to transfer the severance payment for deposit into an account at fleet bank opened by his brother at his direction on january.taxes and payroll deductions subtracted from the payout left a net amount of approximately for deposit in the fleet bank account.on the same date that the funds were deposited,gonzalez brother attempted to make a withdrawal of.suspicious of the transaction,officials at fleet bank contacted their counterparts at deutsche bank to inquire about the deposited funds.deutsche bank promptly discovered the embezzlement and confronted gonzalez,who admitted what he had done and signed a written statement.since fleet bank had permitted no withdrawals,all the embezzled funds were returned to deutsche bank.
in a indictment filed on september,gonzalez was charged with embezzling funds from a federally insured bank,in violation of.he appeared before the district court on october,to enter a plea of guilty.after an extended and thorough allocution,the district court accepted the guilty plea,finding that it was knowing and voluntary and supported by facts that established all the elements of the offense charged.in december,the probation office provided the parties and the district court with a investigation report.in the report,an offense level of thirteen was calculated for gonzalez as follows a base level of six,pursuant to section of the united states sentencing guidelines the guidelines an upward adjustment of seven points,pursuant to section b h,on the basis of the amount of funds involved an upward adjustment of two points,pursuant to section b a,because the offense involved more than minimal planning and a downward adjustment of two points,pursuant to section a,for acceptance of responsibility.with a category i criminal history by virtue of no prior convictions,and with an offense level of thirteen,the guidelines for gonzalez called for imprisonment in the range of twelve to eighteen months.
by letter dated january,and addressed to the district court,counsel for gonzalez requested a downward departure in the guidelines offense level established by the probation office.this request was based upon a claim that gonzalez criminal act was an aberration in an otherwise life.the departure would result in a sentencing range of zero to six months imprisonment.the claim of aberrant behavior was said to be supported by gonzalez lack of a prior criminal record,his steady employment history,his speedy admission of guilt and cooperation with authorities,his remorse,and his reputation as a good and honest person.
cited as authority for the downward departure for aberrant behavior were zecevic united states parole commission,cir applying a totality of circumstances test and guidelines section and application notes identifying specific factors to be considered in departure.section became effective on november,a date subsequent to gonzalez offense.sentencing guidelines manual.counsel contended that the departure was justified under the test established in the guideline as well as the test established in the case but stated that to the extent the zecevic test may be regarded as more liberal it should control to avoid an ex post facto problem.before the government response to the letter was received,the probation officer issued a sentencing recommendation for downward departure and a sentence of imprisonment for one month.
by letter dated february,the government responded to counsel letter.although the government argued that section should be applied in gonzalez case,it contended that,under either the test enunciated in that guideline or the test enunciated in zecevic,gonzalez did not qualify for a downward departure.in support of its position,the government asserted,among other things,that gonzalez planned and committed his offense over a period and therefore that the offense could not be considered spontaneous that gonzalez enlisted the help of another person,his brother that he was motivated by pecuniary gain that his early confession was not significant due to the transparent nature of his conduct and that he offered no justification,such as extreme pressure or psychological disorder,for his conduct.the government argued that there was no basis for a claim that the crime committed by gonzalez was a single occurrence that was committed without significant planning or was of a limited duration.
gonzalez appeared for sentencing on february.also present were his counsel and counsel for the government.after commenting that it found the applicable guidelines range too severe in this case,the district court proceeded to review the request for a downward departure for aberrant behavior.the court first addressed the question of whether section was applicable,noting that the answer depended upon whether the guideline was a clarification of existing law or a substantive change.the court stated that i f it is a clarification,it applies.if it is a substantive change,it ca be applied because the ex post facto clause precludes application of different law to the defendant conduct,which was completed before november.finding it unnecessary to resolve the question in light of its ultimate conclusion that an aberrant behavior departure was not warranted under either section or zecevic,the court proceeded first to examine the requirements of application note of the guideline.
the court stated that the application note requires that the crime had been a single criminal occurrence or criminal transaction that was committed without significant planning,was of limited duration,and represented a marked deviation by the defendant from an otherwise life.noting that it was undisputed in gonzalez case that there was but a single criminal occurrence reflecting a marked deviation from a life that was otherwise law abiding,the district court found that the offense was not of limited duration in the sense that phrase is used in the application note.this finding was said to eliminate the need for a finding as to the without significant planning element of the application note.
in its analysis of the limited duration element,the district court said i think the point of the guideline in respect of duration is to try to identify some set of criminal activity,some subset of criminal activity which is,in some significant degree,spontaneous.observing that spontaneity is the easiest term to define here either,the court found that gonzalez had more than enough time to think about what he was doing and to stop it,whatever inexplicable situation caused him to embark on the scheme in the first place.with reference to this finding,the court stated,t he consequence i hold as a matter of law is that the offense was not one of limited duration within the meaning of the application note,and assuming that applies,i would be obliged as a matter of law to deny the application for a departure.
turning to the zecevic totality of circumstances test for aberrant behavior,the district court stated that the zecevic factors cut in different directions in this case.on one side of the equation,the court noted the lack of a prior record said to be insufficient alone to justify departure,the singular nature of the criminal act,and the fact that the defendant admitted his guilt as soon as the offense was detected said to be inevitable under the circumstances.the court concluded the zecevic analysis as follows 
on the other side of the equation,however,the offense involved more than minimal planning.and although it may have begun spontaneously or impulsively,it went on too long for that fact to weigh heavily in the analysis.
the motive,obviously,was greed.the fact that the defendant did profit from the offense is attributable only to the fact that he was caught essentially in the act.therefore,considering the totality of the circumstances,i hold as a matter of law that no downward departure is applicable under zecevic either.
the court then proceeded to sentence gonzalez to a term of imprisonment of twelve months plus one day,a term of supervised release of three years,and a mandatory special assessment of.bail was continued pending an appeal and the execution of the sentence was stayed pending appeal.
discussion 
appealability 
a district court denial of an application for a discretionary downward departure is generally not appealable.see united states middlemiss,cir.a denial of a downward departure is subject to review only when the district court misapplies the guidelines,imposes an illegal sentence,or mistakenly believes that it lacks the authority to depart.see united states,cir.we presume that district courts are aware of their authority to depart downward.see united states brown,cir.this presumption is overcome,however,where there is clear evidence of a substantial risk that the judge misapprehended the scope of his departure authority.see also united states,cir remanding district court decision to deny a downward departure where at the very least,the district court remarks at sentencing create d ambiguity as to whether the court understood its authority to depart.
in this case,after denying the departure requested under both section and zecevic,the court stated 
now,i have carefully framed this ruling purely as a matter of law because it is my intention to make clear that if the court of appeals feels that i have the discretion to depart downward,i would certainly entertain that prospect.i think the sentence is too harsh,but my conscientious reading of zecevic and the new guideline leads me to believe that i lack the discretion to do so,and that the basis of my ruling on the departure.
this statement demonstrates that the district court believed it was without authority to award a discretionary downward departure in this case.the ruling denying gonzalez request was framed purely as a matter of law based on the two standards discussed by the court.it is thus apparent that the district court refusal to depart was premised on purely legal,rather than discretionary,grounds.the misapprehension by the district court of its authority to depart alone confers jurisdiction on this court.see united states grandmaison,cir.moreover,as will be seen,the district court applied the wrong legal standard regarding departure for aberrant behavior in arriving at its conclusion.where the proper guideline legal standard to be applied is at issue,as in the case at bar,appellate review is warranted.zecevic,at.here,the district court misapplied the guidelines,erred as to the appropriate legal standard,and mistakenly believed that it lacked authority to depart.accordingly,the denial of gonzalez application for a downward departure for aberrant behavior is appealable.middlemiss,at.
ii.the aberrant behavior standard under zecevic 
the sentencing guidelines recognized the authority of courts to depart downward for aberrant behavior prior to the sentencing commission adoption of the specific policy statement set out in section.section,entitled grounds for departure policy statement,sets forth a number of considerations that should enter into the discretionary authority to be exercised by district courts in awarding downward departures.the power to depart from the sentencing range established by the commission is conferred by statute,as recognized in the first sentence of section 
under b,the sentencing court may impose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable guidelines,if the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.
in accordance with the foregoing,the guidelines specifically noted the possibility of departures for aberrant behavior in referring to single acts of aberrant behavior that still may justify probation at higher offense levels through departures,ch,pt.a,d.
recognizing that a single act of aberrant behavior might justify a downward departure,and aware of the absence of an appropriate rule in this circuit defining the meaning of single aberrant act,the panel in zecevic undertook the formulation of such a rule.the panel recognized that there had been two approaches to the question,with some circuits concluding that what was contemplated was a spontaneous and thoughtless act not the result of substantial planning while other circuits employed a totality of circumstances test,with spontaneity and lack of planning not dispositive but being among a number of factors to be considered.zecevic,at.the panel aligned itself with those circuits adopting the totality of circumstances approach,defining aberrant behavior as a departure from a life that is otherwise law abiding and listing the following factors to be considered 
the singular nature of the criminal act the defendant criminal record the degree of spontaneity and planning inherent in the conduct extreme pressures acting on the defendant,including any psychological disorders from which he may have been suffering,at the time of the offense the defendant motivations for committing the crime,including any pecuniary gain he derived therefrom and his efforts to mitigate the effects of the crime.
following the listing of factors,the panel wrote this list is not exclusive,and no one factor shall be dispositive.id.the appellant in zecevic failed the test of spontaneity applied in the first instance by the parole commission,and the court determined that he failed the totality test as well.the panel wrote 
although he had the opportunity to and did present other evidence bearing on the totality standard,zecevic presented no evidence to suggest he was suffering from any disorders or operating under any extreme pressures at the time he committed the offense,nor did he demonstrate any particular motive other than pecuniary gain.he did not claim that he had made efforts to mitigate the effects of the crime.apart from his status as a first offender and the support of his mother,zecevic has little else to recommend him for an aberrant behavior departure.
in united states martinez,cir,we reversed a downward departure for aberrant behavior by a district court after a remand for consideration in light of zecevic.the defendant there participated in cocaine importation schemes spanning at least thirteen months.the panel noted the defendant lack of a criminal record but observed that the schemes did not constitute a departure from a life.id.at.it rejected the trial court reliance on a claim that the defendant was under pressure to pay the workers at his factory,finding the economic considerations for the crime did not meet the extreme pressures factor described in zecevic.id.at.the panel also rejected the following factors,considered by the district court,as of highly questionable connection to the aberrance of the defendant behavior charitable and volunteer activity,type ii diabetic condition,rehabilitative efforts,and family circumstances.id.at.the panel described limitations on the expansion of the zecevic factors in the following language 
although zecevic does set forth a fluid totality of circumstances test,this does not justify the consid
