arthur juwa,who pled guilty to one count of possession of child pornography,asks us to vacate and remand his sentence of months imprisonment because it was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.in this case,the recommended sentencing guidelines range was to months imprisonment,which both parties agreed would be reasonable.the district court stephen robinson,judge,however,imposed a sentence of months based,at least in part,on pending state charges against juwa for sexual abuse of a minor.in declaring its reasons for the upward departure,the district court cited the fact that juwa had engaged in sexual conduct with a minor child on repeated occasions.yet juwa had indicated his intent to plead guilty only to one count of felony sexual abuse in the state case.because it is unclear to what extent the district court impermissibly based its sentencing enhancement on unsubstantiated charged conduct,we hold that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable,and we vacate and remand for resentencing.
background 
on february,while investigating allegations of sexual abuse of a minor in rockland county,new york,state law enforcement officers conducted a search of juwa home and car.in his car,they found a laptop computer containing images of child pornography,at least one of which had been downloaded from the internet.juwa was charged federally with one count of receiving and distributing images containing child pornography,in violation of a b,and one count of possessing child pornography,in violation of a b.
on october,juwa agreed to plead guilty in federal court to possession of child pornography.in calculating the applicable sentencing guidelines range,the parties and the probation office determined that under,juwa base offense level was.a increase for the use of a computer and a decrease for acceptance of responsibility produced an adjusted offense level of.with a criminal history category of i,the resulting guidelines range was to months imprisonment.in the plea agreement,juwa and the government agreed that they would not seek any downward or upward departures,respectively,and that a sentence within this range would be reasonable.
the presentence report psr prepared by the probation office on december,noted that juwa laptop had been seized during the rockland county investigation into charges of,inter alia,sexual abuse and sexual misconduct against a child the rockland county case.the psr further noted that juwa had been arrested on march,on the following state charges course of sexual conduct against a child in the first degree one count criminal sexual act in the first degree four counts sexual abuse in the first degree three counts and endangering the welfare of a child one count.the state indictment alleged that,on various dates between december,and december,juwa had engaged in oral sexual conduct with his nephew,who was eight years old at the time of juwa arrest.according to the psr,however,juwa had not admitted to those allegations.the probation office ultimately recommended a term of months imprisonment,at the bottom of the guidelines range,followed by three years supervised release.
on january,juwa appeared before the district court for sentencing.the district judge indicated that he had received and read defense counsel submissions,which included letters in support of juwa,as well as two victim impact statements submitted by juwa nephew and the nephew mother through the attorney office.defense counsel objected to consideration of these letters because juwa nephew was not a victim of the federal offense.the district judge stated that he would hear from both the defense and the prosecution,as well as from the nephew and the nephew mother.if he decided to consider the latter statements or to consider an upward departure,or both,he would adjourn the sentencing proceeding to give defense counsel an opportunity to respond.
after giving all relevant parties a chance to speak,the district judge stated that he would not consider the victim impact statements but that he would consider an upward departure.in particular,he was interested in the status and timeline of the rockland county case,whether juwa was going to plead guilty to those charges,and if and when he would be sentenced in that case.after asking the defense and the government to contact their corresponding parties in the rockland county case and clarify these issues,the district judge adjourned the proceeding.
sentencing resumed on may.the district judge began by noting that,in the interim,he had received a letter from the government indicating its understanding that the rockland county case would not be resolved until after juwa federal sentencing that juwa intended to plead guilty to one count of felony sexual abuse and that the anticipated sentence was five years imprisonment,to run concurrently with his federal sentence.defense counsel indicated that he had no objections to the contents of the government letter.
the defense then asked the district court to impose a sentence within the guidelines range,citing the nature of the crime and juwa lack of criminal history,and stating that,apart from the rockland county matter,there is nothing that would warrant either a departure or stepping outside the guidelines in applying the sentence.the district court,however,stated that it could not look past the rockland county case.in response,the defense argued that if the rockland county case was taken into account,the district court should apply b,which states if the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor,increase by levels.b.a increase would result in a guidelines range of to months.the defense also acknowledged application note,which provides for an unspecified upward departure i f the defendant engaged in the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor at any time whether or not such abuse or exploitation occurred during the course of the offense or resulted in a conviction for such conduct,but argued that even under this provision,a increase would be sufficient.application note.

in the alternative,the district judge stated that he would impose a sentence of months,given that there were no restrictions on the type of information a sentencing court could consider in arriving at an appropriate sentence.but in describing his reasons for imposing this sentence,the district judge stated that juwa has engaged in sexual conduct with a minor child.he has done so on repeated occasions.in addition to the term of imprisonment,the district judge ordered a term of supervised release and a mandatory special assessment of.
defense counsel objected to the sentence as excessive and pointed out that juwa had not agreed to plead guilty to every count of the rockland county indictment.to this,the district court replied,i said he intended to plead to one count sexual abuse.in the written judgment of conviction,the district court provided the following explanation for imposing a sentence outside the advisory guidelines range the defendant,through his attorney,and the gov t informed the court that the defendant was going to enter a plea of guilt to an aggravated sexual assault charge in state.that charge was for molesting his nephew for years from the ages of.
