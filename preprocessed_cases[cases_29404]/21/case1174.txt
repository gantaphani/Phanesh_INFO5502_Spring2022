jamell sellers was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment for being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition under.g and under e of the armed career criminal act acca judgment was entered on november,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york johnson.
sellers contends that the application of the acca was error,arguing that his state conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance does not qualify as one of the three previous convictions necessary to apply the acca because he was adjudicated as a youthful offender yo for that offense under new york law.see e.therefore,he appeals his sentence of the acca statutory mandatory minimum of fifteen years imprisonment.
we hold that a drug conviction under new york law that was replaced by a yo adjudication is not a qualifying predicate conviction under the acca because it has been set aside within the meaning of a and new york law.accordingly,we remand to the district court for resentencing.
background 
an indictment was returned on october,in the district court for the eastern district of new york,alleging that on september,sellers possessed a firearm and ammunition and had previously been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year,in violation of g.sellers had been arrested by two new york city police officers responding to a call that a man with a handgun was standing in front of a building in brooklyn.the officers saw a man who fit the description in the call and,as he began walking away from them,saw the handgun in his pants.sellers was arrested,and a loaded taurus mm semiautomatic pistol was seized.
on may,sellers moved for a ruling by the district court that he would not be sentenced under the acca if he were to plead guilty.violations of g are punishable by a maximum sentence of ten years,and there is no mandatory minimum.a.however,the acca imposes a mandatory minimum sentence if a person violates g and has three previous convictions by any court referred to in section g of this title for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,or both,committed on occasions different from one another.id.e.sellers argued that he did not qualify as an armed career criminal because one of his three prior criminal convictions from when he was years old had been replaced by a yo adjudication under new york law 
the government opposed sellers motion,contending that resolution of the acca issue was premature.the government also argued that sellers was an armed career criminal because sellers yo adjudication for the drug offense was not excluded from consideration as a previous conviction under the acca.
on june,at a status conference three days before trial was to begin,the district court declined to rule on the acca issue,reasoning that doing so would place the court in a position of negotiat ing with the parties.appellant app.sellers then pled guilty that day to the indictment without a plea agreement.during the plea colloquy,sellers acknowledged that he had two prior felony convictions and he had a third conviction that resulted in a new york yo adjudication and did not qualify as a conviction under the acca.sellers was informed by the district court that if he was found to have three qualifying convictions,the acca would trigger the statutory mandatory minimum of fifteen years and a maximum of life in prison.after sellers stated that he understood,the district court accepted sellers plea.
the pre sentence report psr calculated sellers sentencing guidelines guidelines or range to be to months based on a criminal history category v and a total offense level of,which included upward adjustments due to his acca status.because of the acca statutory mandatory minimum,the psr concluded that the guidelines range increased to to months.see e.
sellers filed objections to the psr,including the portions of the psr which adopted the government position that the statutory mandatory minimum of fifteen years under the acca applied.sellers also disputed his points calculation for criminal history v,arguing that no points should be assigned for the yo adjudication,and thus his criminal history category should be iv instead of v.he also disputed the application of a sentencing guidelines offense level enhancement for under sellers advocated for a guidelines range of to months imprisonment.in response,the government argued that his conviction satisfied the acca and also should be counted under the guidelines for determining his criminal history category and for applying the offense level enhancement.
on october,the district court sentenced sellers to the acca statutory mandatory minimum of fifteen years imprisonment,concluding that the acca applied to sellers notwithstanding his yo adjudication.sellers once again objected to the acca mandatory minimum and the effects of the acca determination on his guidelines calculation.
judgment was entered on november,and sellers filed a timely notice of appeal on the same day.
discussion 
we consider two issues on this appeal.first,we determine the requirements for a prior conviction for a serious drug offense to qualify as a previous conviction under the acca.second,we evaluate sellers yo adjudication for his drug offense in new york to decide whether it was a previous conviction that would qualify as an acca predicate conviction.
standard of review 
the burden is on the government to prove the existence of a qualifying conviction when seeking a sentencing enhancement under the acca.united states rosa,cir.the questions of what documents a district court may rely on to determine the nature of a prior conviction and of the scope of a district court authority to make factual findings are questions of law,which we review de novo.id.internal citations omitted.likewise,w e review de novo questions of law relating to a district court application of the acca.see united states brown,cir reviewing de novo whether the defendant prior conviction constitutes a violent felony for acca purposes.we review for clear error the district court factual findings regarding the nature of the prior offense.id.at.
ii.qualifying convictions under the acca 
the first question is what prior convictions qualify as previous convictions under the acca.as in all statutory construction cases,we begin with the language itself and the specific context in which that language is used.mcneill united states,alteration in original quoting robinson shell oil.
here,the relevant gateway to the application of the acca is the violation of the felon in possession of a firearm statute,g.see e.the single predicate conviction necessary for a violation of g is a conviction in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.id.g.however,a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year is further defined in a as excluding a ny conviction which has been expunged,or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored.id.a.thus,g excludes certain prior felony convictions.
once the elements of g have been satisfied,the acca increased mandatory minimum period of fifteen years imprisonment applies if the defendant has three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses.id.e.the acca,in describing the three prior convictions necessary for its application,states that they must be previous convictions by any court referred to in section g,thus adopting the g definitional reference to a,including its exclusions.
the government argues,however,that the phrase referred to in section g in e modifies any court rather than three previous convictions.according to the government,e cross reference to g,therefore,means only that the serious drug offense or violent felony must be a conviction in a domestic court rather than a foreign court,and that a definition of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year with its exclusions does not apply.we find this argument unpersuasive.
because g does not define any court,the government proposed construction would leave the cross reference in e with no useful purpose.in order to give meaning to e cross reference,we conclude that the phrase referred to in section g modifies three previous convictions in e.see united states menasche,it is our duty to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,the convictions necessary for applying the acca invoke the further definition of crime s punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year in a,which excludes certain convictions,including those that have been set aside.a see united states parnell,cir per curiam convictions that are set aside are expressly exempted from the calculation of defendant previous convictions under the acca.
this application of the definition in a to previous convictions in e follows the approach taken by the fourth and ninth circuits.see united states collins,cir section e thus incorporates the definition of crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,found in section a,and its exclusion of any conviction for which the defendant civil rights have been restored.united states clark,cir t o bring a defendant under the provisions of e the government must show the convictions are of the type referred to in g that section refers to conviction in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,a term in turn defined in a.emphasis added.
as mentioned above,predicate convictions in e must be either a violent felony or a serious drug offense as defined in e.the government also contends that even if the definitional language in a and its exclusions applies to the acca,it applies only to a violent felony and not a serious drug offense.the government points out that e b includes as part of its definition of a violent felony any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year the language also found in g and a while a serious drug offense as defined in e a does not include this language.however,the repetition of the phrase crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year in the definition of violent felony in e b and its absence in the definition of serious drug offense in e a does not demonstrate that congress intended to make the cross reference in e to g and to a and its exemptions inapplicable to serious drug offense s.
the specific definition of serious drug offense states that a prior drug conviction qualifies only if it was a federal or state conviction for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.e a i,ii.congress chose to count only more serious drug offenses with maximum statutory imprisonment terms of ten years or more as qualifying acca predicates.repeating g language in e a serious drug offense definition would have contradicted congress choice to count only those drug offenses with at least maximum statutory penalties.applying a exclusions of certain prior felony convictions to serious drug offense is consistent not only with the plain language of the statute,but also with this statutory framework.therefore,we conclude that a conviction for a serious drug offense that is excluded under a is not a qualifying conviction under e.
iii.a conviction that is set aside 
the next issue is whether sellers new york yo adjudication rendered his prior guilty plea to the underlying drug offense a conviction that has been set aside under a the language of that section provides that a prior offense does not qualify as a conviction if it has been expunged or set aside or the offender has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored.a.this provision exempts from the acca otherwise qualifying convictions.see logan united states,discussing the a exemptions in the context of sentencing.we conclude that under new york law,sellers yo adjudication for a drug offense operates to set aside his prior drug conviction because a specifically requires the district court to apply state law in making that determination and new york law deems such yo adjudications to set aside convictions and does not consider yo adjudications predicate convictions for sentencing enhancements in new york state courts.
the meaning of set aside 
section a sets out four ways an otherwise qualifying conviction is excluded from consideration as a predicate conviction under the acca expungement,pardon,setting the conviction aside,or restoration of civil rights.a.each term describes a measure by which the government relieves an offender of some or all of the consequences of his conviction.logan,at.
two of the four exclusions are relevant in the analysis here setting aside and expunging a prior conviction.set aside means to annul or vacate a judgment or an order.black law dictionary ed.by contrast,expunge means to remove from a record,and expungement of record is the actual removal of a conviction from a person criminal record.id.at.
we have previously recognized differences in the treatment of convictions that are set aside and convictions that are expunged.a set aside conviction,unlike an expunged conviction,does not eliminate all trace of the prior adjudication and allows consideration of youthful offender adjudications in later proceedings.see united states matthews,cir see also id.at,holding that defendant new york yo adjudication simply set aside his prior conviction but did not expunge the conviction for purposes of see also united states cuello,cir describing matthews conclusion that a yo adjudication was not an expunged conviction for the purposes of because new york youthful offender law evinced an intent only to set aside a conviction for the purposes of avoiding stigma,rather than to erase all record of the conviction or to preclude its future use by courts.while a set aside conviction may still be considered for certain purposes because it has not been fully expunged,see,matthews,at,it is nonetheless excluded from consideration as a predicate conviction under the acca,see a,because of the particular language of that definitional statute.
the requirement to apply state law 
section a is explicit in requiring district courts to apply state law in evaluating prior state convictions.section a states that w hat constitutes a conviction of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held and that a ny conviction which has been set aside shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter.a.
this language in a distinguishes our treatment of new york yo adjudications as potential acca predicate convictions from that of our earlier decisions that analyzed the impact of such adjudications under another federal criminal statute and the sentencing guidelines.
we previously held,for instance,that a new york yo adjudication qualifies as a prior conviction for a felony drug offense that has become final under b and thereby increases the statutory mandatory minimum for certain drug offenses.united states sampson,cir.although in sampson we reviewed the new york yo statutes to determine the practical impact of a yo adjudication,we applied federal law to determine whether a prior new york felony drug conviction replaced by a yo adjudication constituted a final felony drug offense under b.see id.at discussing,b.unlike a,however,neither b nor the definition of felony drug offense in excludes otherwise qualifying convictions that have been set aside under state law.
the acca incorporation of a exclusion for convictions set aside under state law also warrants treating new york yo adjudications differently in the accapredicate conviction context than in our previous decisions interpreting certain provisions in the sentencing guidelines.in united states matthews,we held that a prior new york yo adjudication should be counted in determining the defendant criminal history under and.matthews,at.sentencing guideline j specifically states that only prior convictions that have been expunged will not be counted in making a criminal history determination,and an application note to expressly states that prior convictions that have merely been set aside should be counted,cmt.we held that new york convictions replaced by yo adjudications were not expunged
