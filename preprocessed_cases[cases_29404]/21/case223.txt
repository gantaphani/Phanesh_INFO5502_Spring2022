a jury convicted ismael vázquez larrauri vázquez of drug and firearm offenses after a trial for leading a conspiracy to distribute drugs in puerto rico public housing projects.the district court sentenced vázquez to concurrent life sentences on all six counts of conviction.vázquez now appeals,arguing that prosecutorial improper vouching for a government evidentiary errors warrant a new trial.he also challenges his sentence,claiming that the district court failed to make an individualized drug quantity finding and that the life sentence on the firearm count exceeded the applicable statutory maximum.failing all else,he also claims ineffective assistance of trial counsel.we affirm vázquez convictions on all counts and his life sentences on the five drug counts,but remand for a modified sentence on the one firearm count.we decline to address his ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal.
background 
vázquez does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction.we recently noted the lack of clear consensus in this circuit whether to recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict,or to present the facts in a more balanced or neutral manner,when the defendant does not raise a sufficiency of the evidence claim.united states rodríguez soler,cir.because the standard used to review the facts would make no difference for this appeal,we decline to decide the issue and instead simply present a neutral version of the facts based on the trial testimony.see id.
the charged crimes in this case arise from a drug trafficking organization distribution of large quantities of heroin,cocaine,cocaine base crack cocaine,and marijuana through multiple drug points from until.trial witnesses testified that vázquez initial role in this organization was managing sales at drug points located in the jardines de montellano and luis muñoz morales public housing projects in cayey,puerto rico.at first,he shared responsibility for running the drug points with others,including an individual known as cheo cabezon.vázquez and cheo cabezon then took over complete control and supply of these two drug points sometime in the.in,vázquez expelled cheo cabezon from the organization and assumed sole leadership.vázquez grew his enterprise and eventually either controlled or became the exclusive supplier for additional drug points in the el polvorín and las vegas wards in cayey,santa isabel,salinas,coamo,and the borinquen ward in guayama.
the government began investigating vázquez in and obtained a grand jury indictment against him and seventy other individuals in.the indictment charged vázquez with six counts count i charged conspiring to distribute to possess with intent to distribute specified quantities of heroin,crack cocaine,cocaine,marijuana,within feet of a public housing project,in violation of a,and counts ii v charged aiding and abetting in possession with intent to distribute heroin,crack cocaine,cocaine,and marijuana within feet of a public housing project,in violation of a,and and count vi charged conspiring to possess firearms during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense,in violation of o 
at trial,the government case depended heavily on the testimony of three cooperating witnesses to establish vázquez leadership role in the conspiracy,and all three cooperating witnesses testified that vázquez assumed control and was the boss of the drug points.testified that she joined the charged conspiracy in the by collecting the tallies,or money from drug sales,for the drug point at jardines,where she also lived.most importantly for this appeal,she testified that vázquez ordered the murders of three individuals who threatened his control over the drug points the expelled cheo cabezon an ambitious drug seller named mamart and son,known as el arabe.after her son death in,became a confidential informant for the government.she was later indicted for her role in the drug conspiracy and testified against vázquez pursuant to a plea agreement.
testified extensively about drug quantities distributed through the drug points and the manner in which vázquez operated the conspiracy.beginning in or,worked for vázquez cockfighting operation.testified that he regularly attended cockfighting matches with vázquez and fifteen to twenty other individuals.and the others placed bets of up to with money that vázquez instructed to collect from the various drug points while working with hiram torres aviles torres,who was in charge of tallying drug proceeds and preparing drugs for distribution.after a few months,vázquez and torres taught how to prepare and package the heroin,crack cocaine,cocaine,and marijuana for distribution,who had trained in accounting,testified in detail about the technique and quantities used to prepare drugs for the various drug points.testified that he stored kilograms of cocaine and heroin for vázquez in his jardines apartment.
also testified about the enforcement side of the drug conspiracy.he stated that at vázquez direction he stored up to firearms,some of them machine guns,and that vázquez would order others to use the firearms.recalled that vázquez told that,if he turned on vázquez,would end up dead like cheo cabezon.also testified that he was present at the meeting at which vázquez and other members of the conspiracy decided that el arabe had to be killed because he was trying to take over the jardines drug point.later became a confidential information for the government for which the government paid him and then stopped working for vázquez in.
testified pursuant to a plea agreement he had entered for his involvement in a different drug conspiracy.he told the jury that he supplied drugs to and rented the jardines drug point in the early,while vázquez managed the sales at the drug point.explained that vázquez and cheo cabezon took over the jardines drug point after retired in to run local stores.maintained contact with cocaine suppliers,however,and,on at least twenty occasions between and,he used these contacts to supply vázquez with a or more of cocaine when vázquez normal supply ran dry.
the government also presented testimony from fourteen law enforcement agents about controlled drug purchases,arrests,and seizures of money,guns,and drugs at the jardines and morales drug points and at residences none of this testimony directly implicated vázquez,although at least two of the arrests and seizures were the result of information provided by and corroborated parts of his testimony.the lead case agent,ricardo cruz vázquez,testified about wiretaps obtained on the phones of,including a wiretap on vázquez phone.vázquez was a participant in some of the recorded conversations played for the jury,but only two arguably involved discussions about the drug operation vázquez called no witnesses in his defense.
the jury found vázquez guilty on all six counts.for the drug offenses,the jury checked off boxes on the verdict form indicating that it found that vázquez conspired to possess and possessed with intent to distribute the quantities of heroin,cocaine,crack cocaine,and marijuana specified in the indictment and on the verdict form.the district court sentenced vázquez to concurrent terms of life in prison on all six counts.
on appeal,vázquez asks us to vacate his conviction based on prosecutorial misconduct,evidentiary errors,and ineffective assistance of counsel,and to set aside his sentence based on a lack of individualized drug quantity finding and because the life sentence on the firearm count exceeded the statutory maximum.we address each argument in turn.
ii.standard of review 
with one exception that we note below,vázquez failed to raise below the errors he now asserts on appeal.we review these unpreserved claims for plain error,and thus require vázquez to meet the heavy burden of showing that an error occurred that the error was clear or obvious that the error affected his substantial rights and that the error also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states colon,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
iii.analysis 
prosecutorial misconduct 
vázquez first directs us to several remarks by the prosecutor during the opening statement and closing argument that vázquez claims were prosecutorial misconduct.having not objected at trial to any of these remarks,he concedes that the plain error standard applies.see united states kasenge,cir.in the context of prosecutorial misconduct,we reverse only if the prosecutor remarks so poisoned the well that the trial outcome was likely affected.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we make this determination considering the following factors the severity of the prosecutor misconduct,including whether it was deliberate or accidental the context in which the misconduct occurred whether the judge gave curative instructions and the likely effect of such instructions and the strength of the evidence against the defendant.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
witness vouching 
vázquez first charge of prosecutorial misconduct is that the prosecutor improperly vouched for credibility during the government initial closing argument.improper vouching encompasses statements by the prosecutor that place the prestige of the prosecutor office behind the government case.united states pérez ruiz,cir.the precise line between improper vouching and permissible argument is a hazy one.united states vizcarrondo casanova,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore begin by describing a few types of argument that fall fairly clearly on either side of that line.
it is generally permissible for the government to offer specific reasons why a witness ought to be accepted as truthful by the jury.united states rodríguez,cir not improper for prosecutor to argue that cooperating witness was credible because his testimony put him and his family in danger.one such reason is that the witness testified pursuant to a plea agreement that required the witness to testify truthfully to receive the benefit of the bargain.see,united states hansen,cir not improper for prosecutor to remind jury that witness testified that he agreed to tell the truth in a plea agreement united states henderson,cir same.another proper credibility argument is that a witness would have told a better,more consistent story if the witness had been lying,see,pérez ruiz,at if they were all going to get up and make up a story,would it have been a better story,at least as long as the argument does not assert that the lack of consistency was viewed as a sign of credibility by the government itself,see vizcarrondo casanova,at possibly error,but not clear or obvious error,when prosecutor statement that the government knew that the witnesses versions were going to conflict could have been understood as a suggestion that the government itself concluded that the stories were credible.
in contrast,several forms of credibility argument plainly cross over into improper vouching.the first form occurs when the prosecutor tells the jury that the prosecutor takes personal responsibility or ownership of the case and thus directly places the government credibility at issue.see,united states rojas,cir i f you have any issues with the way this investigation was run,blame me.i in charge.i responsible.united states josleyn,cir i a married person with a family,and i go home at night with a sound conscience.i have worked very hard on this case and we are very proud of what we have done.we have done nothing to be ashamed of.the second form of prohibited vouching occurs when the prosecutor impart s her personal belief in a witness veracity,pérez ruiz,at,or in the defendant guilt,see united states andújar basco,cir i feel comfortable and the united states feels comfortable that they have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that this man delivered five kilograms of cocaine.bare assertions that a witness was honest or correct are therefore improper.see,united states rodríguez adorno,cir was the passenger credible was he honest of course,he was.alteration in original united states gomes,cir telling a jury that a police detective gave you honest,candid,truthful testimony emphasis removed united states castro davis,cir i think the identity witness testimony was very clear it seems to me,and i submit to you,that the witness is right on the money.emphasis removed.
it is this latter form of improper vouching the personal assurance of a witness credibility that vázquez accuses the prosecutor of employing during his initial closing argument.the alleged vouching,emphasized and accompanied by the surrounding argument,went as follows 
now,let talk about.she had a third grade education.i submit to you she was a difficult witness,difficult to get her story out.difficult to get from her the things that she had to tell.you saw her on the stand,you were able to evaluate her credibility.
and i ask you,was she telling you the truth i submit to you that she was.
now,do you think she minimized things do you think she did want to tell you about the verdugo brand of drugs possibly.possibly.but is there any doubt that she was a member of vázquez conspiracy,beginning in the early,all the way up until 
there should be no reasonable doubt based on the evidence you heard of her participation,and more particularly,of this defendant involvement in a conspiracy,and when it began you heard that testimony.you remember that.
vázquez argues that the emphasized language improperly conveyed to the jury the prosecutor personal opinion that was truthful.
we doubt the foregoing statement amounted to improper vouching.the prosecutor did not claim to think or believe the point asserted.castro davis,at.also,the prosecutor words as printed on the page are ambiguous.submit can mean to present or propose to another for review,consideration or decision.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.in this sense,it is unobjectionable.see hansen,at witness plea deal here is to tell the truth,and i submit to you,that is precisely what he did during this trial,was not improper vouching united states marshall,cir they say,i submit to you,they have told the story the way it truly unfolded,was not improper.submit can also mean to put forward as an opinion or contention.merriam webster collegiate dictionary ed.whether a juror would hear the spoken words as conveying a proposition for review,or conveying what the prosecutor himself thinks,likely depends on tone,context,and the juror disposition.
defense counsel heard the prosecutor tone,in context.his lack of any objection suggests that neither tone nor context pointed toward vouching.see marshall,at a n excellent test for determining whether the prosecutor statement was a personal endorsement is whether counsel contemporaneously thinks the line has been crossed,and objects,which,in turn,enables the court to instruct the jury.the prohibition against vouching is widely understood by defense counsel,the objection is easy to make,and the collateral effects of scoring a correction in the prosecutor closing are often advantageous for the defendant.
even on the cold page,context suggests that the message as conveyed and received was not one of personal vouching.the prosecutor immediately preceding statement y ou saw her on the stand,you were able to evaluate her credibility drew the jurors attention to its proper evaluation of credibility based on their observations during her testimony.and immediately afterward the prosecutor anticipated and addressed the defense point that minimized her involvement in the conspiracy 
in sum,the prosecutor statement upon which vázquez principally bases his argument was likely not vouching and in any case was not clearly or obviously vouching.see vizcarrondo casanova,at while the prosecutor unwisely put his toes up to the line,if there was error it was not clear and obvious.for that reason alone we must reject this grounds for appeal.
comment on failure to testify 
vázquez next argues that during rebuttal the prosecutor improperly commented on vázquez decision not to testify.see united states wihbey,cir.the challenged comment came in response to defense counsel closing argument,which focused on the government three main.o,and and what those three witnesses had to gain by testifying.the prosecutor then began his rebuttal as follows 
members of the jury,i submit that in response to defense counsel said sic,if this were such a simple case,why are sic we here two weeks 
i submit to you that the witnesses that you heard and the testimony you heard and the evidence that you heard took two weeks to get in before you.
the three witnesses,the three key witnesses,there were three witnesses against the defendant,members of the jury.there were,do have the exact count.but every witness that came and testified before you was a witness against the defendant every police officer,every agent,every cooperating defendant,every cooperating witness.every one of them was a witness against the defendant.not just three.
emphasis added.
it is that c omment by a prosecutor on a defendant failure to testify violates the fifth amendment guarantee against.wihbey,at citing griffin california.when a statement is not obviously a comment on the defendant failure to testify,we ask w hether,in the circumstances of the particular case,the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.united states newton,cir quoting united states glantz,cir.
in context,the prosecutor comment was not improper.see united states sepulveda,cir in assaying the appropriateness of a prosecutor remarks,context frequently determines meaning.although in isolation the statement every witness that came and testified before you was a witness against the defendant might support the negative inference that vázquez did not himself testify,this was not the comment manifestly intended or natural and necessar y meaning when read in the context of the defense closing argument.newton,at.we will not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury,sitting through a lengthy exhortation,will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.united states taylor,cir internal quotation marks omitted.this is especially true when the ambiguous remark draws no objection,as was the case here.id.we are especially reluctant to fish in the pool of ambiguity when the complaining party failed to bring a dubious comment,easily corrected on proper notice,to the immediate attention of the trial court.quoting sepulveda,at.the more natural,plausible interpretation of the prosecutor statement is simply that he was rebutting the claim that the government case rested on the testimony of only three witnesses.
in any event,even if the prosecutor comment had crossed the line,it would not rise to the level of plain error.the district court gave the jury clear instructions on vázquez right not to testify and the burden of proof these instructions,and the significant evidence of vázquez guilt,made it unlikely that the prosecutor statement affected the outcome of the trial.see wihbey,at 
duty to acquit 
during the initial closing,the prosecutor told the jurors,i ask you and i advise you it your duty as jurors,if you have reasonable doubt,you must acquit vázquez,you must acquit him.that your job.vázquez argues that advising the jury of its duty somehow inflamed its passions and interfered with its impartiality.we disagree.there is nothing wrong with the government asking the jury to acquit if it finds the government failed to meet its burden,and the court in fact instructed the jury to do the same united states ayala garcía,f d,cir it was inappropriate for the prosecutor,after several inflammatory remarks,to tell the jury,i charge you to do your job,find the defendants guilty.
misstating the evidence 
for the remaining challenged comments,vázquez essentially complains the prosecutor misstated or exaggerated the evidence in the record.several of these challenges are perfunctory,undeveloped,and therefore waived.united states zannino,cir.in any event,we find none of these comments improper and briefly address each in turn.
vázquez first challenges a statement during the government initial closing argument that vázquez got rid of anybody that represented a threat to him,beginning with cheo,continuing with mamart,and el arabe.that how the drug trafficking organization worked.vázquez argues that the use of anybody was an unsupported extrapolation from the three murders in evidence and referred to the excluded evidence of other murders,but this statement merely summarized the testimony of and that vázquez got rid of all three of the threats that they testified about cheo cabezon,mamart,and el arabe.testified that vázquez told him much the same thing,that whoever would be against him,the same thing would happen to that person than sic to the ones who are dead.
vázquez next challenges the prosecutor promise during his opening statement that the jury would hear what happened to son el arabe at the hands of vázquez.although vázquez correctly notes that there was no evidence that he killed el arabe literally with his hands,both and testified that vázquez ordered el arabe killed.it was therefore hardly impermissible to make the figurative argument that el arabe died at the hands of vázquez when killed by vázquez crony at his behest.vázquez similarly challenges the prosecutor statement during the initial closing argument that got up here and testified that this man here,ismael vázquez,destroyed her life,that what she testified,he destroyed her life t hat why says the defendant destroyed her life,because her son never made it to christmas.this merely restated.admissible testimony,see infra,that vázquez ordered her son death and in doing so destroyed her life.
finally,vázquez challenges two of the prosecutor comments to the jury about drug quantity.first,during the opening statement,the prosecutor referred to vázquez as the largest drug dealer in cayey.vázquez argues that there was no basis for this comment because there was no evidence of other drug dealers sales in cayey during this time.it would be reasonable to infer that vázquez was the largest drug dealer in cayey,however,given the testimony that he controlled the mega drug point at jardines,which was the largest housing project of cayey,as well as drug points at morales and el polvorín in cayey,and that he ordered potential competitors killed.in any event,we doubt the jury would have changed its verdict if it turned out he was the second or dealer in the area.similarly,we find nothing objectionable in the prosecutor plausible suggestion that the total quantity of drugs distributed over the fourteen years of vázquez leadership was greater probably significantly greater than that distributed over a snapshot.
evidentiary challenges 
the murder testimony 
two of the government cooperating witnesses,and,testified that vázquez ordered the killings of three son el arabe,cheo cabezon,and posed a threat to his drug points.the district court refused to admit additional testimony or evidence about these three murders or any evidence about two other murders.vázquez argues that this testimony was inadmissible because its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice.
we review preserved evidentiary challenges for an abuse of discretion.vizcarrondo casanova,at.vázquez did object at sidebar before testimony about the murders of el arabe and cheo that such testimony would be unfairly prejudicial.he failed to timely object,however,to earlier testimony about the three murders.we therefore review the admission of her testimony for plain error.regardless of the standard of review,however,o nly rarely and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances will we,from the vista of a cold appellate record,reverse a district court judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.id.alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.
there are no such compelling circumstances here,under either abuse of discretion or plain error review.the indictment charged that it was part of the manner and means of the conspiracy that some of the would use violence,force and intimidation against members of their own drug trafficking organization and rivals in order to maintain control of the drug trafficking operations.both witnesses testified that vázquez ordered the murders because vázquez viewed the victims as threats to his control over the drug points.the district court correctly determined that this testimony was highly probative to show the manner in which the drug conspiracy operated and the way its members furthered its goals,as charged in the indictment.see united states rivera calderón,cir.more importantly,the testimony showed that vázquez led the conspiracy by enforcing its rules and protecting it from internal and external threats.see id.
nor did any unfair prejudice from this testimony substantially outweigh its probative value.the murder evidence was limited to testimony from the first two witnesses in a trial and was not overly graphic there was no testimony from ballistics experts,pathologists,or crime scene investigators.id.at such testimony was not unfairly prejudicial in drug conspiracy case.the only photographs the jury saw were of el arabe body cleaned,apparently in a morgue,and used for identification purposes and the bloody stairwell where he was shot.moreover,after the government elicited testimony from about her son death,the district court took steps to screen for unfair prejudice by requiring the prosecutor to first make a proffer of any further murder testimony.there was no abuse of discretion or plain error in admitting this testimony.
leading questions 
vázquez also claims that the government improperly used leading questions during the direct examinations of two of its witnesses,and agent cruz vázquez.because vázquez did not object to any of the questions he now challenges on appeal,we review for plain error.federal rule of evidence c provides that l eading questions should not be used on direct examination except as necessary to develop the witness testimony.we afford the district court extensive discretion over the phrasing of questions,because the trial judge is best situated to strike a practical and fair balance.hansen,at internal quotation marks omitted.
vázquez cites two examples of allegedly improper leading questions during testimony.the first question was not even leading the prosecutor merely referenced in his question prior testimony that vázquez fired cheo cabezon from the drug conspiracy in the second example,the prosecutor led through some basic arithmetic to clarify the year her son died this was hardly improper.united states mulinelli navas,cir not always improper for prosecutor to use leading questions to assist in developing coherent testimony.although the government did use leading questions with agent cruz vázquez,these questions laid a foundation for playing wiretap recordings.the district court did not err,let alone clearly or obviously err,in allowing these questions,and in any event vázquez faces an insurmountable hurdle on plain error review because he has made no effort to show that such error likely affected the outcome below.hansen,at.
sentencing challenges 
vázquez challenges his life sentences primarily on the basis that the district court committed plain error in failing to make an individualized finding on drug quantity when determining the guidelines sentencing range.he also makes a fleeting,passing assertion that a life sentence exceeds the maximum penalty for the firearm offense count vi.we address each contention in turn.
guidelines calculation 
vázquez presentence investigation report psr recommended that he be held accountable for at least kilograms of heroin and kilograms of crack cocaine based only on a sample of the conspiracy.this recommendation was based on information made available by the attorney office.the psr also noted that according to testimony at trial,vázquez used his farm to store and sell drugs by the kilogram.vázquez did not file any written objections to the psr.
at sentencing,the district court grouped together the five drug offenses,see d,and the firearm offense,see id.c,to determine vázquez base offense level of the district court made no specific finding on drug quantity and did not state that it was relying on the psr finding that vázquez was responsible for at least kilograms each of heroin and crack cocaine.instead,the district court simply announced that 
the guideline for a,section,offense is found in guideline section,which provides that offenses involving in excess of kilograms of heroin and in excess of kilograms of crack cocaine,have a base offense level of under guideline section c.
the district court then applied twelve levels of to arrive at a total offense level of.because the maximum total offense level under the guidelines is,the district court assigned vázquez a total offense level of.see id.ch,pt.a,cmt.based on a criminal history category of ii,the district court calculated vázquez guidelines sentencing range as life in prison.after reviewing the a sentencing factors,the district court sentenced vázquez to concurrent sentences of life in prison for all six counts.
neither party made any objections during the sentencing hearing.vázquez defense counsel noted that vázquez preached at the correctional facility and suggested only that the court recommend theology courses.vázquez personally did not make any arguments about his sentence.
the base offense level for drug offenses depends mostly on the quantity of drugs involved in the offense.c.when fashioning a guidelines recommended sentence for a drug conspiracy or possession offense,the district court must make a finding of drug quantity by a preponderance of the evidence.united states pizarro,nn.cir.this finding must be an individualized finding as to drug amounts attributable to,or foreseeable by,that defendant.united states colón solís,cir see also united states escobar figueroa,cir applying colón solís to guidelines calculations.
here,the district court did not make the required individualized drug quantity finding.the bare recitation of the heroin and crack cocaine threshold quantities for a base offense level of under c does not qualify as such a finding.see colón solís,at.however,because vázquez never lodged an objection at sentencing,we review his claim for plain error.united states medina villegas,cir.although the district court failure to make an individualized drug quantity finding was an error that was clear and obvious,vázquez can not make the requisite showing that this error affected his substantial rights or seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.quoting united states duarte,cir.in particular,for at least two reasons he can not show that but for the error,the district court would have imposed a different,more favorable sentence.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
first,because vázquez did not object to the psr,the district court could have relied on the psr recommended finding that vázquez was responsible for at least kilograms each of heroin and crack cocaine.see.i a at sentencing,the court may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact.united states ocasio cancel,cir when a fact is set out in a presentence investigation report and is not the subject of a timely objection,the district court may treat the fact as true for sentencing purposes.see also united states medina,cir the unchallenged portions of the psr provide us with an independent ground on which to justify our decision.the psr unchallenged recommended quantity finding was more than adequate to meet the threshold of kilograms of heroin or kilograms of crack cocaine required for a base offense level of.c.
second,even relying only on the lesser quantities of drugs for which the jury found vázquez responsible beyond a reasonable doubt,vázquez still would have been subject to a guidelines sentencing range that included life in prison.vázquez does not challenge the twelve levels worth of enhancements the district court applied to determine his total offense level.therefore,a base offense level of or more would have resulted in the same maximum total offense level of and the same guidelines sentencing range of life in prison.and indeed,considering only the four possession counts counts ii v and leaving aside the conspiracy count count i,the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that vázquez possessed with intent to distribute enough of each drug that his base offense level would have been based only on the jury findings.see c.the verdict form completed by the jury asked,for counts ii through v,d o you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the quantity of controlled substances that vázquez possessed with the intent to distribute was equal to or more than one kilogram of heroin,grams of crack cocaine,five kilograms of cocaine,and kilograms of marijuana.the jury checked yes in response to each question.one kilogram of heroin or five kilograms of cocaine alone would be sufficient for a base offense level of.id.alternatively,grouping together the quantities found by the jury yields a total offense quantity equal to kilograms of marijuana equivalents see id.d,b grouping drug offenses cmts.b,d combining different controlled substances using marijuana equivalents.because this amount is between and kilograms of marijuana,it too yields a base offense level of.id.c.
a base offense level of,with the unchallenged twelve levels of enhancement,would have resulted in a total offense level of.the total offense level must be reduced to the maximum of,id.ch,pt.a,cmt,the same total offense level that the district court used in sentencing vázquez to life in prison.therefore,the district court clear and obvious error did not affect vázquez sentence,and does not require reversal on plain error review.
life sentence in excess of statutory maximum on count vi 
in his opening brief,vázquez mentions in passing that his life sentence for the firearm offense count vi exceeded the maximum penalty.he did not develop this point in any of his briefs or at oral argument.usually,we deem such a perfunctory challenge to waive a challenge to many types of claimed error.zannino,at i ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.here,though,where the error that comes to our attention on direct review is a plainly unlawful and excessive sentence albeit on one count only,we may set aside the error to prevent a miscarriage of justice.see united states garcía ortiz,cir deciding to address otherwise waived argument that life sentence on one count exceeded statutory maximum to prevent a miscarriage of justice,even though defendant was still subject to life sentence on another count.
the error here is vázquez life sentence for the firearm offense,count vi,which exceeds the applicable statutory maximum.o a defendant convicted of conspiracy to possess a firearm in furtherance of a drug offense shall be imprisoned for not more than years see united states almonte nuñez,cir guideline calculations simply can not usurp a maximum level of imprisonment established by congress.section o does provide for a maximum life sentence if the firearm is a machinegun or destructive device,or is equipped with a firearm silencer or muffler,but there was no such finding by the jury here.
as a practical matter,vázquez overall sentence of life in prison will not change even if we vacate his sentence for the firearm possession offense,because the life sentences on his other five counts counts i v will remain.we recently observed that w e have not adopted a uniform rule about whether,without a preserved claim of error,a defendant who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of a statutory maximum is entitled to relief even though his overall period of immurement will not be affected.almonte nuñez,at.despite the lack of a uniform rule,we further noted that a lthough particular cases may differ,flexibility exists and,under normal circumstances,our discretion should be exercised in favor of trimming back an excessive sentence.id.in almonte nuñez,we decided to exercise this discretion in favor of modifying a month sentence on one count that was in excess of the month statutory maximum,even though the defendant still faced a concurrent month sentence on another count.id.two factors influenced our decision.first,leaving intact a sentence that exceeds a congressionally mandated limit may sully the public perception of the fairness of the proceeding.id.second,we found it unwise and unfair to ask a defendant to bear the risk of difficult to predict collateral consequences that may arise as a result of an sentence imposed on a particular count.id.
here,vázquez faces a smaller risk of harm from collateral consequences than the defendant in almonte nuñez because,regardless of our decision,he must serve five concurrent life sentences on five other counts.but leaving in place the plainly unlawful sentence for count vi could sully public perception of the proceeding.and,at least in theory,collateral review or other unpredictable events might alter someday the impact of the conviction on the other counts.we therefore remand to the district court with instructions to enter a modified sentence of twenty years in prison for the firearm offense count vi.see id.at.
ineffective assistance of counsel 
vázquez final challenge is that his trial counsel was constitutionally deficient for failing to object to leading questions on direct examination,inadmissible hearsay testimony,testimony about the murders,and the prosecutor allegedly improper remarks during closing.see strickland washington.as a general rule,this court does not review ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal.united states natanel,cir.there is an exception where the critical facts are not genuinely in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of an ineffective assistance claim,united states reyes,cir internal quotation marks omitted,but why counsel acted as he did is information rarely developed in the existing record,and this information is crucial to resolve an ineffective assistance claim.united states torres rosario,cir.because we can only speculate based on this record as to why counsel acted as he did,we decline to review vázquez ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we affirm vázquez convictions on all six counts.we also affirm his life sentences on counts i,ii,iii,iv,and v,but order the district court to enter a modified sentence of twenty years on count vi.
so ordered.
the indictment also contained a forfeiture allegation count vii not at issue in this appeal.
we have assigned initials instead of using real names in light of concerns about the safety of cooperating witnesses raised by the committee on court administration and case management of the judicial conference of the united states.united states etienne,cir.
the parties stipulated as to the types and quantities of drugs seized.the total quantity seized was grams of heroin,grams of crack cocaine,grams of cocaine,and grams of marijuana.
both phone calls were between vázquez and an individual known as pakay.the first occurred on february,and was translated and transcribed as follows vázquez uh,do you already have that money for barre it seven and a yes.i know it seven and a half but not until zandy gives me this.remember,i have vázquez do be a expletive.it that i need that money.bring down what you have and at the end,when you finished you square it second conversation occurred on february,and was translated and transcribed as follows vázquez how about that thing everything worked out i worked everything heavy weight.vázquez we up to the kilo,forget it.everything very well.
the prosecutor developed this point in rebuttal,and in doing so emphasized to the jury that it alone was to determine the truthfulness of testimony you can determine whether was completely lying,whether she was shading the truth,or whether everything that she said was the truth.that your job as jurors and i submit to you the evidence of that she presented to you is telling.you can make the determinations of where she shaded and where she was a little hesitant.make those determinations.
we also reject vázquez additional contention that
