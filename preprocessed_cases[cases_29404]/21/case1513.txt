the armed career criminal act acca mandates a fifteen year minimum sentence for anyone convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g,who has three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,or both.e.section e a ii defines a serious drug offense,in relevant part,as an offense under state law for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.e a ii.these four appeals,heard in tandem and consolidated for disposition,raise the same legal question whether a prior conviction for a new york drug offense can serve as a predicate serious drug offense under the acca,where new york rockefeller drug laws prescribed a maximum sentence of at least ten years for the offense at the time it was committed,but where new york amended the rockefeller drug laws,prior to the federal sentencing in these cases,to reduce the maximum sentence for the same offense conduct to less than ten years.

rockefeller drug law reform act 
in,after a protracted and very public debate,see people denton,misc d.kings county,rev on other grounds by,app.div d dep t,new york passed the rockefeller drug law reform act reform act,which significantly lowered the maximum terms of imprisonment prescribed for certain drug offenses,including class b and class c felony drug offenses.see penal law mckinney laws ch.effective.the reform act did not amend the statutory definitions or classifications of the underlying offenses.except for a technical amendment in,see laws ch,the definition and classification of the statutory offenses has not been altered since these defendants were convicted in state court.
under the rockefeller laws in place at the time of the defendants state convictions,a maximum term of at least ten years imprisonment was prescribed by new york law for class b and class c drug offenses.see penal law.under the current sentencing laws introduced by the reform act,the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by law for the class c drug offenses committed by archer,villegas and williams,and for the class b drug offense committed by someone,such as darden,with no prior drug felonies,is less than ten years.see penal law b ii providing that maximum sentence for class c drug felony committed by someone in worst criminal history class is nine years and a i providing that maximum sentence for class b drug felony committed by felony drug offender is nine years.the reform act,however,did not become effective until january,and the current sentencing laws do not apply to crimes committed before the effective date.see people utsey.
thus,if the defendants were to engage in the same conduct today,their offenses would carry a maximum term of less than ten years.however,because the reform act is not retroactive,if the defendants were somehow sentenced today for the specific,conduct that led to their prior convictions,the defendants would be subject to a maximum term of at least ten years.
discussion 
the acca defines a serious drug offense,in relevant part,as an offense under state law for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.e a ii.the sole issue consolidated for disposition on appeal is whether a prior state conviction was a conviction for a serious drug offense within the meaning of the acca,where state law prescribed a maximum sentence of at least ten years for the offense at the time of the state conviction but state law,prior to federal sentencing,prospectively reduced the maximum sentence to less than ten years for the same offense conduct this is an issue of first impression in our circuit.because the issue turns solely on an interpretation of a federal statute,our review is de novo.see,united states king,cir.
in order to resolve this issue,we must first decide whether to apply the state current sentencing laws or the state sentencing laws in place at the time of the state conviction.because we conclude that the acca directs courts to apply the state current sentencing laws,we must next decide whether the maximum term currently prescribed by new york state law for these offenses is at least ten years.under the reform act,these offenses are punishable by a maximum term of less than ten years.a complication arises,however,because due to a prospective clause in the reform act,new york continues to permit the imposition of a maximum term greater than ten years for offenses committed before the reform act effective date.
current state law 
we first address whether,in determining the maximum term that is prescribed by state law for an offense,we should examine current state law or the state law in place at the time of the state conviction.following every court to reach the issue,we conclude that sentencing courts should examine current state law see united states morton,cir united states hammons,d,archer,d at williams,d at united states hinojosa,cir applying current state law,but not deciding whether current or past state law governs.our reason is simple the acca definition of a serious drug offense uses the present tense in referring to the applicable state law.if congress had wanted sentencing courts to examine the state law in place at the time of the state conviction,it could have easily so provided by defining a serious drug offense as an offense under state law for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years was prescribed by law at the time of conviction.rather than choosing this course,congress enacted the acca,which refers to the maximum sentence that is prescribed by state law.the present tense signals that sentencing courts should examine the state current sentencing scheme.see hammons,d at the present tense of the verb is denotes that the current sentencing structure is relevant,rather than the sentence that was prescribed by law at the time of the earlier crime.williams,d at there is no linguistic or logical basis for reading the statute to embrace those state drug convictions for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more was prescribed by law in short,is means is,not is or was.
moreover,this plain reading of the statute is confirmed by the statute purpose.congress could have defined a serious drug offense in a any number of ways congress could have defined the seriousness of a drug offense in terms of the weight and type of the drugs involved congress could have defined the seriousness of a drug offense in terms of the actual state sentence imposed on the particular defendant.rather,congress defined the seriousness of a drug offense in terms of the maximum sentence that is prescribed by state law.as the supreme court recently explained,the purpose of this definition is to defer to the sentencing policy of each state as the measure of the seriousness of the drug offense.
in e a ii,congress chose to rely on the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed by state law as the measure of the seriousness of state offenses involving the manufacture,distribution,or possession of illegal drugs.congress presumably without if state lawmakers provide that a crime is punishable by years imprisonment,the lawmakers must regard the crime as serious,and congress chose to defer to the state lawmakers judgment.
united states rodriquez,d see morton,at what is evident is that section e a ii,by looking to state sentencing law,leaves the standard by which to judge the seriousness of a state drug conviction to the policy of the state.
in light of this statutory purpose,it was eminently reasonable for congress to defer to the state lawmaker current judgment rather than to the state lawmaker discarded judgment.thus,a consideration of the statutory purpose confirms our plain reading of the statute text judges should examine the state law in place at the time of the federal sentencing 
we next address whether,under current new york law,the maximum sentence prescribed for the defendants offenses is at least ten years.the difficulty is that new york current law is not retroactive.there are two apparently conflicting decisions on this issue in our sister circuits.
in morton,the sixth circuit reasoned that it was evident that section e a ii,by looking to state sentencing law,leaves the standard by which to judge the seriousness of a state drug conviction to the policy of the state.at.accordingly,because,at the time of federal sentencing,the state of tennessee did not consider the defendant drug offense serious enough to impose a sentence,the court concluded that the defendants prior conviction was not a serious drug offense.id.the morton court did not explicitly discuss whether the amended state statute was made retroactive,but the court noted that,as in this case,the state statute had an explicit,prospective effective date.id.at 
in hinojosa,the fifth circuit attempted to distinguish morton on the ground that the amended state statute relevant to hinojosa conviction,which reduced the maximum term of imprisonment to less than ten years,was not made retroactive.at.relying on the of the amended state statute,the hinojosa court held that the prior state conviction was for a serious drug offense because if the defendant were sentenced by the state court for those crimes today,he would still be subject to a maximum term of at least ten years.id 
there are two ways of framing the relevant question first,it might be asked,following the hinojosa court,what maximum term is prescribed by current state law for someone who committed the offense conduct on the date the defendant committed the offense.second,it might be asked what maximum term is prescribed by current state law for the offense conduct,without regard to the date on which the defendant happened to commit the offense.the choice between these two methods of framing the question turns on whether the date of the commission of the offense is properly regarded as part of the offense for which the maximum term is prescribed by law.e a ii 
the supreme court recent rodriquez decision,which addressed the same definition in the acca of a serious drug offense,causes us to examine the issue a bit more closely.the key statutory terms are offense,law and maximum term.rodriquez.at.in rodriquez,the supreme court explained that an offense simply means the violation of the governing criminal statute.at here,the new york statutes defining the offense conduct,and setting out the felony classifications,have not been meaningfully amended since the state convictions.thus,darden relevant offense is having sold a controlled substance,of a statutorily specified weight and type class,in violation of new york penal law archer,williams and villegas relevant offenses are having attempted to sell controlled substances,of a statutorily specified weight and type class,in violation of new york penal law.the law is the state law that prescribes the applicable sentencing range for the offense and the maximum term is the maximum sentence that can be imposed for the offense.rodriquez.at.
in rodriquez,the question was whether the maximum term of imprisonment for the purposes of e a ii is determined with or without reference to recidivist enhancements.id.at.the state sentencing law prescribed a maximum term of five years imprisonment for a violator of the statute but a maximum term of ten years imprisonment for a subsequent violator of the same statute.id.at.the court held that the increased maximum term applicable to recidivists was the maximum term prescribed for the offense by state law.id.at.the defendant had argued,in effect,that the state law punished two different offenses the state punished the offense by a maximum term of five years and the state punished the offender status as a recidivist by an additional maximum term of five years.id.thus,the defendant argued,the maximum term prescribed by law for the offense was only five years.id.similarly,the defendant,drawing on the acca definition purpose of deferring to state lawmakers judgment about the seriousness of a offense,argued that the increased maximum term applicable to recidivists should not be used to measure the seriousness of the offense because the defendants status as a recidivist has no bearing on the seriousness of the offense.id.at.the court rejected this argument on the ground that it rest ed on the erroneous proposition that a defendant prior record of convictions has no bearing on the seriousness of an offense.id.as the court explained,an offense committed by a repeat offender is often thought to reflect greater culpability and thus to merit greater punishment.id.
more broadly,the court rejected the premise,common to both arguments,that recidivist statutes punish something other than the offense of conviction.
if the defendant were correct that a defendant record of prior convictions has no bearing on the seriousness of an offense,then it would follow that any increased punishment imposed under a recidivist provision would not be based on the offense of conviction but on something the defendant prior crimes or the defendant status as a recidivist.but we have squarely rejected this understanding of recidivism statutes t his court consistently has sustained laws as penalizing only the last offense committed by the defendant.when a defendant is given a higher sentence under a recidivism statute of the punishment is for the offense of conviction.none is for the prior convictions or the defendant status as a recidivist.the sentence is a stiffened penalty for the latest crime,which is considered to be an aggravated offense because it is a repetitive one.
id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted third alteration in original.it is not clear whether the court considered the defendant recidivism to be part of the offense of conviction what is clear is that the court determined that when a state prescribes a higher maximum term based on the recidivist nature of the offense,of the punishment is for the offense of conviction.id.emphasis added.
we do not read this discussion as dicta.both the text and the purpose of the acca definition of a serious drug offense require an analysis of whether an enhanced maximum term is for the offense of conviction.the acca defines a serious drug offense as a offense for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.e a ii.thus,the acca text requires a determination of whether an enhanced maximum term is punishment for the offense.similarly,and perhaps more important,the purpose of the acca definition is to defer to state lawmakers judgment of the seriousness of a drug offense,rodriquez.at,as expressed in the state current sentencing laws.if a state determines that a offense merits less than ten years maximum imprisonment,but permits the imposition of a higher maximum sentence in an individual case for technical reasons that have no bearing on the state current view of the seriousness of the offense,it would frustrate the purpose of the acca to conclude that the offense is a serious one.begay united states,d interpreting the acca parallel definition of a violent felony as viewed in terms of the act basic purposes.
accordingly,following the rodriquez court,we conclude that conduct that increases the maximum term of imprisonment is part of the offense of conviction,to which the maximum term is tied for purposes of the acca,only if the conduct,in the state view,bears on the seriousness of the offense.rodriquez.at.the question,at bottom,is whether,in punishing the earlier timed nature of the offense more severely,the state is meting out extra punishment for the offense of conviction.
as the rodriquez court explained,there is no question that a subsequent offense is a more serious offense than a first offense,which the state views as deserving greater punishment.see id.at.our question is whether,under new york law,the fact that a drug offense was committed before january,makes the offense more serious than an offense committed after that date.
to be sure,there are some crimes that are more or less serious depending on the timing of the offense conduct.see,united states mortimer,cir noting that failure to register for a military draft may be a more serious offense punished more harshly during a time of war than in peacetime.but a drug crime is not plausibly in this category.the reform act,and its legislative history,amply confirm that new york does not view drug crimes committed before january,as more serious than drug crimes committed after that date.rather,the provision was almost surely enacted to combat problems of retroactive administration.see hammons,d at were the statute made fully retroactive to all classes of felonies,implementing this provision to possibly thousands of cases would be an enormous burden on the state court system.
to begin,unlike the explicit statutory recidivism enhancement at issue in rodriquez,the reform act does not contain an explicit enhancement for drug crimes committed before january.rather,the only indication in the reform act that drug crimes committed before the effective date would remain subject to the higher maximum terms is found in the reform act clause.except for the lingering effects created by this clause,the rockefeller drug sentencing laws were repealed entirely.
second,the legislative history of the reform act amply confirms that the purpose of the reform act was to replace the harsh rockefeller sentencing laws with more appropriate sentencing laws,not to recognize a new class of drug offenses that were less serious because they were committed after the statute effective date.the legislative sponsors of the new york bill,in a section described as justification for the sentencing reductions,described the rockefeller drug laws as providing inordinately harsh punishment for low level drug offenders as well as misdirecting public funds for the incarceration of these offenders.see new york sponsors memorandum,ch.new york rockefeller drug laws have been the subject of intense criticism for many years.the current laws provide inordinately harsh punishment for low level drug offenders,warehouse offenders in state prison who could more productively be placed into effective drug treatment programs and waste valuable state tax dollars which could be used more effectively to provide drug treatment to addicts and harsh punishment to violent criminals.the governor,in calling for the legislation,expressed a similar categorical rejection of the harshness of the rockefeller sentencing laws.see governor state of the state address delivered january,mckinney session law news of,at the rockefeller drug laws allow drug offenders to be more severely punished than rapists.we need to change that.let reform these antiquated laws this year.the consistent view of these state lawmakers was that the rockefeller laws were too severe,then as now.
if there is any doubt that the reform act reflected a categorical rejection of the harshness of the rockefeller sentencing laws,no matter when the underlying offenses occurred,this doubt is dispelled by the reform act inclusion of unique sentencing reductions for those sentenced under the discarded,inordinately harsh rockefeller laws.prisoners convicted under the old laws for class b and class c drug felonies were granted unique,expanded opportunities to qualify for sentencing reductions that substantially lowered their sentences from up to to,in some instances,of the sentence imposed and to obtain early termination of parole.see laws ch,utsey,at,noting that the statute includes ameliorative p
