george correia appeals the district court order which denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus,see,in which he contended that a state trial court judge violated due process by vindictively punishing him for exercising his right to a jury trial on various criminal charges.we affirm.
background 
on september,petitioner asked a car dealership salesman for permission to a corvette.during the ensuing drive,correia absconded with the vehicle.four days later,a boston police officer saw correia as he was driving the corvette in the beacon hill area.unaware that the corvette was stolen,the officer pulled it over after noting that it had neither a valid license plate nor a current inspection sticker.as the officer approached the corvette on foot,correia abruptly sped away from the scene,leading state and boston police hereinafter police on a prolonged car chase on downtown boston streets and adjacent freeways.during the chase,correia recklessly drove the wrong way down streets,crashed into several other police and civilian vehicles,repeatedly refused police demands to surrender at gunpoint,attempted to run over several police officers,and finally managed to strike a police officer with the vehicle.this vehicular rampage caused severe bruises and lacerations to a police officer,as well as spinal injuries to a civilian automobile driver.
in due course,correia was indicted in suffolk county superior court on counts speeding counts,driving to endanger,driving with a suspended license,assault and battery with a vehicle,assault with a vehicle,receiving stolen goods,leaving the scene after causing personal injury or vehicular damages,driving the wrong way on a street,and failing to stop for a police officer.
prior to the jury trial,correia informed the presiding superior court judge that he might agree to plead guilty.whereupon the judge informed correia that he probably would impose a year prison sentence should correia enter a guilty plea.however,shortly thereafter correia elected to proceed to trial.finally,disregarding the court advice,correia elected to represent himself at trial.
following trial,the jury convicted correia on of the counts assault and battery with the corvette count assault with the corvette receiving stolen goods leaving the scene after causing personal injury or vehicle damage and failing to stop for a police officer the trial judge denied correia ensuing motions for a new trial,and sentenced him to imprisonment for to years,well within the sentencing range prescribed by statute.
the massachusetts appeals court affirmed the convictions and sentences in an unpublished opinion,and the supreme judicial court denied the ensuing application for further appellate review.in february,correia submitted the instant habeas corpus petition to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts,which denied the requested relief and issued its certificate of appealability.correia now appeals from the district court order denying the petition for habeas corpus.
discussion 
correia contends that the massachusetts appeals court unreasonably applied clearly established united states supreme court precedent in rejecting his claim that the trial court vindictively punished him for refusing to enter a guilty plea prior to trial by imposing a year prison term,rather than the year term which would have been imposed had correia entered a guilty plea.as evidence of the alleged vindictiveness,correia relies upon i the large numerical differential between the pretrial and sentencing ranges ii the jury acquittals on many of the more serious charges in the indictment and iii the comments made by the trial judge during trial,suggesting that the trial judge himself believed that correia was guilty and that the trial was a waste of judicial resources.
we review denials of habeas corpus relief de novo,inquiring whether the decision is contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established supreme court precedent.see williams taylor,d.a decision contravenes the unreasonable application criterion when,though it correctly identifies the pertinent united states supreme court rule,its application to the particular facts of the case at bar is objectively unreasonable.id.at.
in affirming the conviction notwithstanding correia vindictive sentencing claim,the massachusetts appeals court relied upon three grounds the trial court cited objective,reasons for imposing a higher sentence following trial the trial court neither stated nor implied that correia would receive a higher sentence if he did not plead guilty and at no time did the trial court evince a belief that the trial was a waste of judicial resources.
in the event a criminal defendant successfully appeals his conviction and the same trial judge imposes a stiffer sentence following a retrial,the presumption arises that the harsher sentence was a product of judicial vindictiveness in response to the defendant rightful recourse to the appellate process yet this presumption is rebuttable provided the record contains objective evidence which adequately explains the more severe sentence.see united states goodwin,d north carolina pearce,d united states,cir.
the same presumption may arise when a criminal defendant rejects a plea with it the prospect of a more lenient elects instead to exercise his constitutional right to a jury trial.see,johnson vose,cir.the two situations differ,of course,in that a higher sentence after a remand and retrial alters a judge previously imposed punishment,whereas a higher sentence after a failed plea bargain is not a retreat from a previously imposed sentence,and as here,is likely to reflect additional evidence adduced at trial and the loss of a discount for pleading guilty.
in any event,as this presumption is designed to safeguard against the risk of actual distinguished from the mere fact that the sentencing court decided to impose a harsher sentence following a trial or presumption arises only in circumstances in which there is a reasonable likelihood that the increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness.id.citing alabama smith,d citations omitted emphasis added.absent such a reasonable likelihood,the aforementioned presumption is never triggered,and the defendant must instead establish actual vindictiveness.see id.
the record in the instant case simply can not support a determination that the massachusetts appeals court unreasonably applied the pertinent legal principles.see williams,at.first,the mere fact that the sentence exceeded the plea bargain sentence by some seven to ten years is insufficient,in and of itself,to indicate a reasonable likelihood of actual vindictiveness.for one thing,unlike a verdict of guilty,an admission of guilt properly warrants the sentencing court consideration of a more lenient sentence than might otherwise be imposed in appropriate response to the defendant criminal conduct.see smith,at.thus,the year prison sentence proffered to correia during the plea bargaining process does not reflect a true assessment of correia criminal culpability,in that it plainly included a substantial discount for leniency.
as for the remaining aspect of the differential,normally the sentencing court imposes a sentence after considering the evidence presented at trial.in contrast,a sentence normally is predicated upon a more rudimentary record of the alleged criminal conduct,such as the description in the indictment,a presentence report.see id.at.indeed,the sentencing judge in this case adverted to this very consideration in sentencing correia,explicitly observing that both the government graphic trial presentation regarding the sheer recklessness of the correia rampage,and correia apparent lack of remorse,see id.t he defendant conduct during trial may give the judge insights into the defendant moral character and suitability for rehabilitation,accounted in substantial part for the decision to impose the harsher sentence 
compared with the sparse information available to the trial judge at the pretrial conference consisting of little more than a recitation of the charges set forth in the indictment,see supra section i,the
