following a jury conviction on one count of conspiring to defraud the united states,one count of insurance fraud,and six counts of mail fraud,the district court sentenced héctor flores to months in prison under the united states sentencing guidelines.flores does not challenge his conviction on appeal.rather,he assigns error to the district court calculation of his sentence and asserts that,in any event,he is entitled to resentencing in light of united states booker,d.we reject both claims and affirm his sentence.
the sentencing issues on appeal do not require us to recount in detail the events that led to flores conviction.we therefore provide only a brief outline of the relevant history.at all times relevant to this case,flores owned and operated an automobile repair shop called taller el poder in vega baja,puerto rico.between october and june,flores participated in a fraudulent car insurance scheme wherein he and his staged car crashes and had police officers,also participants in the scheme,prepare false police reports documenting the accidents.through his repair shop,flores would then prepare inflated estimates for insurance claims based on the staged accidents,claiming both the damages sustained in the accidents and additional damage that did not,in fact,exist.this scheme was lucrative.at sentencing,an attorney for a consortium of defrauded insurance companies testified that the total loss to the insurance companies was more than million,and that just the claims attributable to flores,his shop,and his wife totaled more than.
on july,a grand jury returned a indictment against flores and seventeen other individuals,including one of flores employees,an insurance salesman,an insurance claims adjustor,and numerous police officers,in connection with the car insurance scheme.nine of the counts in the indictment implicated flores conspiracy to defraud the united states,count one,insurance fraud,count two,and mail fraud,counts three through eight and sixteen.on february,following a ten day trial,the jury convicted flores on counts one,two,three through seven,and sixteen,and acquitted him on count eight.
flores was sentenced on july,under the edition of the united states sentencing guidelines.see b if the court determines that use of the guidelines manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced would violate the ex post facto clause of the united states constitution,the court shall use the guidelines manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was committed.the district court grouped the counts of conviction together pursuant to d,and assigned a base offense level of.id.a over flores objections,the court then imposed a increase based on its finding that the offense involved a loss of more than,see b k,a increase based on its finding that the offense involved more than minimal planning,see id.a,and a increase based on its finding that flores was an organizer or leader of an extensive criminal activity,see a,for a total offense level of.based on flores criminal history category of i,his guideline sentencing range was to months.flores asked the court to sentence him at the low end of the range on the grounds that he has two minor children and that his pled guilty rather than proceeding to a sentence very distant,even to the lower end of this offense level.the government recommended a sentence at the upper end of the range,emphasizing that as far as we can tell,the defendant is still not repentant.after hearing a victim impact statement by rafael barreto,an attorney for the defrauded insurance companies in a related civil case,the court sentenced flores to months in prison,the top of the applicable range,on each count,to run concurrently.the court also imposed a fine of and ordered flores to cooperate with barreto in the related civil case.this appeal followed.
on appeal,flores objects to his sentence on two grounds.first,he assigns error to the district court finding that the loss from his fraudulent activities was in excess of.second,he contends that he is entitled to resentencing in light of booker.we consider each claim in turn 
loss calculation 
the guidelines section applicable to flores offense of conviction provides for incremental sentencing increases based on the amount of the loss due to fraud.see.based on testimony by barreto,the report estimated the amount of the loss attributable to flores as being in excess of,and thus recommended a increase to flores base offense level.see id.b k.
at sentencing,the court asked barreto to explain his calculations regarding the counts and losses attributable to the scheme in which this defendant participated.barreto testified under oath that 
in the civil complaint that is parallel to the criminal case,the losses sustained by the insurance companies actually surpassing right now over million.nonetheless,we understand that there might have been a few schemes,a few conspiracies against the insurance companies,and therefore,in order to be just,and in order to be able to sustain or to specify the losses caused by this defendant,what we did was to address only those cases and those claims made that were caused directly by this defendant.we did not include the million because we could not say that all of the claims were all attributable directly to the defendant the amount that we provided to the probation officer was the amount that added up all the claims that had to do with héctor flores,with taller el poder,and with his wife.not necessarily that means that they were in the claims that were included in the indictment.there were other claims not included in the indictment that nonetheless were included in the civil complaint that were attributable to héctor flores.
the court asked barreto to confirm that his testimony was that the insurance fraud scheme and claims attributable directly to the participation by flores,his wife,and taller el poder,is over.barreto responded that the court was correct.
flores was then given an opportunity to question barreto.he declined,stating that we are in a total state of,so we can not argue as to that matter.flores only comment on this point was to emphasize that the indictment cited a loss of just and that he had been acquitted on one count,which would suggest a lower total.in response,the government informed the court that the amount alleged in the indictment was attributable only to the counts on which flores was convicted.even if not covered in the indictment,the government asserted that the amounts stated by barreto are relevant conduct as to this case.see a defining relevant conduct to include all acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.
after hearing barreto testimony and arguments from both sides,the court found that the losses stated by barreto were relevant conduct and sustain ed the finding of the probation officer in the report that this defendant should be sentenced with losses in excess of which is less than the that the victim has supplied to this court and to the probation officer.on appeal,flores asserts that this finding was erroneous.we review the district court loss calculation for clear error.see united states antonakopoulos,cir.
flores attacks the court loss calculation on several grounds.he asserts that the government failed to establish a nexus between all of the losses included in barreto estimate and the conduct for which he was convicted,that it was in barreto interest,because of the pending civil case,to err on the side of exaggeration,and that barreto calculation included some claims filed by flores.more broadly,flores also contends that it was not established by a preponderance of the evidence that the loss exceeded.we reject these claims.
as we have explained,d etermination of actual loss need not be precise t he court need only make a reasonable estimate of the range of loss,given the available information.united states brandon,cir quoting cmt.here,the court relied on an estimate by a representative of flores victims of the losses based on the insurance fraud scheme and claims attributable directly to the participation by flores,
