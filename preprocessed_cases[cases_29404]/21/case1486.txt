defendants kelvin minott,george fuller,and jonathan baker appeal from their convictions after jury trial in the united states district court for the northern district of new york hurd.they were convicted of conspiracy to possess crack cocaine with the intent to distribute in violation of and.the appellants contend that the evidence was legally insufficient to support their convictions relying on the exception.the appellants contend that as buyers of drugs from a selling conspiracy,they could not be convicted of conspiring with the sellers for the illegal transfer of the drugs.we reject the contention and affirm the convictions.the appellants argument is based on an oversimplified misunderstanding of the exception.even if the exception protects buyers from criminal liability for conspiracy with their sellers to make the transfer between them,it does not protect them from criminal liability for conspiracy with their sellers with regard to other transfers either by the seller or by the buyers,if the facts support such a charge.we remand fuller case for the district court to reconsider his sentence in light of kimbrough united states,d.
background 
the evidence,seen in the light most favorable to the government,see jackson virginia,d,showed the following a drug distribution organization located in the utica,new york area sold crack cocaine to numerous customers,at the rate of approximately one kilogram per week.members of this organization included sandra willis,the organization principal recruiter,carmen,bujo,jamaican mike,shortman,dizzy,and later,mark ramsey.the group sold crack cocaine to customers who would call phone lines.beginning in,dizzy and bujo,whom willis brought into the organization and trained to sell crack cocaine,operated one of the phone lines out of a second floor apartment on taylor avenue,which customers referred to as either t,taylor,or t block.the selling group sold crack cocaine in amounts ranging from a minimum of an eightball,consisting of grams,to multiple ounces.an eightball was typically divided into tens gram packages for,twenties gram packages for,or fifties gram packages for for resale.
pursuant to wiretaps,the appellants fuller,minott,and baker were recorded numerous times calling the drug order phone line arranging to buy crack cocaine.members of the selling organization testified that they sold frequently to fuller,minott,and baker,whom they had never known to use crack cocaine themselves.however,members of the selling group,including willis,dizzy,bujo,and ramsey,knew that the appellants engaged in resale of the crack cocaine they purchased.
the appellant minott purchased crack cocaine in large quantities from at least seven different members of the selling group.in,he bought approximately an ounce of crack cocaine each week from dizzy.he also ordered eightballs from both dizzy and bujo over the drug order phone line using coded terms such as guinness and heineken to refer to various types of drugs.willis testified that minott purchased crack from her,on and off,for three years,in quantities of between one and four eightballs.willis knew that minott resold the crack he bought.
in addition to purchasing crack cocaine from members of the taylor avenue selling group,minott introduced associates to the group.in the summer of,minott introduced his roommate,mark ramsey,to the selling group.initially,ramsey and minott jointly purchased about an eightball of crack per week from dizzy,which they subdivided and sold.carmen and shortman eventually induced ramsey to operate one of the phone lines,and minott began to make drug deliveries for the selling group.minott made at least two deliveries for ramsey,and told him that he would be willing to make more deliveries.in another instance,minott used an intermediary named pops to distribute crack.in the summer of,minott introduced pops to dizzy,and later complained to dizzy when pops began purchasing crack directly from dizzy behind minott back.
the appellant fuller had a relationship with dizzy,willis,and others in the organization for several years,over which time he bought crack cocaine on numerous occasions.fuller was frequently at the taylor avenue crack house,and was considered by willis to be a constant customer,buying anywhere between one to four eightballs at a time.in july,fuller bought crack from mark ramsey.during this period,fuller purchased at least an eightball of crack cocaine every day.willis and ramsey each provided crack on credit to fuller on at least one occasion.
willis knew that fuller sold crack out of a house at lansing street,and would occasionally deliver crack to fuller there.fuller also told willis that he had customers outside utica,in watertown.likewise,ramsey knew that fuller distributed the crack ramsey sold him.fuller complained to ramsey that his customers were dissatisfied with the crack he had gotten from ramsey,and that he had lost customers while waiting for ramsey to make a delivery.one customer testified that he purchased crack in twenties from fuller at the taylor avenue crack house and ultimately at the lansing street house,as well because the taylor avenue selling group would not sell crack in quantities smaller than an eightball.
the appellant baker purchased eighteen eightballs of crack cocaine from dizzy and bujo through the phone line during an period in.often baker would meet dizzy or bujo at the taylor avenue crack house to collect the drugs.on one day,july,baker bought five eightballs of crack cocaine from bujo and was prevented from making a sixth purchase only because operations had closed for the night.
trial began on october,and lasted six days.the jury convicted appellants on all charges with one minor exception each was sentenced principally to months imprisonment.these appeals followed.
discussion 
appellants contend that the evidence was insufficient to show that they had joined a conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine.they argue that their transactions were nothing more than purchases,which,under the exception developed in this circuit case law,do not suffice to prove a conspiracy for the transfer of illegal drugs.their argument overstates the scope of the exception.
the essence of conspiracy is agreement among two or more persons to join in a concerted effort to accomplish an illegal purpose.united states bayer.to prove a conspiracy,the evidence must show that two or more persons agreed to participate in a joint venture intended to commit an unlawful act.united states desimone,cir.to be a member of a conspiracy one must,under judge learned hand classic formulation,in some sense promote the illegal venture himself,make it his own,have a stake in its outcome.united states falcone,cir hand,aff.see also united states,cir a defendant may be deemed to have agreed to join a conspiracy if there is something more,some indication that the defendant knew of and intended to further the illegal ventures,that he somehow encouraged the illegal use of goods or had a stake in such use.internal quotation marks omitted united states borelli,cir.accordingly,unless at least two persons have a shared purpose or stake in the promotion of an illegal objective,there is no conspiracy.
as a literal matter,when a buyer purchases illegal drugs from a seller,two persons have agreed to a concerted effort to achieve the unlawful transfer of the drugs from the seller to the buyer.according to the customary definition,that would constitute a conspiracy with the alleged objective of a transfer of drugs.our case law,however,has carved out a narrow exception to the general conspiracy rule for such transactions.see,united states hawkins,cir citing several cases from our circuit to the effect that a simple drug transaction is not sufficient,by itself,to support a conspiracy conviction united states gore,cir observing that w ithout more,the mere relationship is insufficient to establish a conspiracy.under this rule,notwithstanding that a seller and a buyer agree together that they will cooperate to accomplish an illegal transfer of drugs,the objective to transfer the drugs from the seller to the buyer can not serve as the basis for a charge of conspiracy to transfer drugs.
this exception from the customary standards of conspiracy preserves important priorities and distinctions of the federal narcotics laws,which would otherwise be obliterated.the federal scheme of prohibition of controlled substances distinguishes importantly between,on the one hand,distribution of a controlled substance,which is heavily punished,and,on the other,possession or acquisition of a controlled substance,which is punished far less severely,if at all.compare listing punishments for the distribution of controlled substances with id.listing punishments for simple possession of controlled substances.no doubt,considerations underlying this distinction include a policy judgment that persons who acquire or possess illegal drugs for their own consumption because they are addicted are less reprehensible and should not be punished with the severity directed against those who distribute drugs,as well as the perception that distribution of drugs has a substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general welfare of the american people.id.at the same time,inchoate offenses,such as conspiracy and attempt are generally punished in the same manner and with the same severity as the completed offense.see id.any person who attempts or conspires to commit an offense defined in this subchapter shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense.therefore,if an addicted purchaser,who acquired drugs for his own use and without intent to distribute it to others,were deemed to have joined in a conspiracy with his seller for the illegal transfer of the drugs from the seller to himself,the purchaser would be guilty of substantially the same crime,and liable for the same punishment,as the seller.the policy to distinguish between transfer of an illegal drug and the acquisition or possession of the drug would be frustrated.the exception thus protects a buyer or transferee from the severe liabilities intended only for transferors.
in more abstract theoretical terms,it is also observed that,as a purchase or transfer necessarily involves the cooperation of both the transferor and the transferee,but for the exception,all transfers would be punishable as conspiracies to transfer,and the separate prohibition of transfers would be redundant and superfluous.it is sometimes said that the buyer agreement to buy from the seller and the seller agreement to sell to the buyer can not be the conspiracy to distribute,for it has no separate criminal object.united states wexler,cir internal alterations omitted 
while providing that the unlawful transfer from seller to buyer can not serve as the basis for a charge that the seller and buyer conspired with one another to make the illegal transfer from seller to buyer,the rule does not protect either the seller or buyer from a charge they conspired together to transfer drugs if the evidence supports a finding that they shared a conspiratorial purpose to advance other transfers,whether by the seller or by the buyer.see wexler,at raggi,concurring in part and dissenting in part noting that we have limited the application of the rule to circumstances where the indictment charges or the proof shows no more than a sale transaction internal quotations and citations omitted.thus,if the evidence supports a finding that the purchaser not only purchased drugs,but in doing so also in some sense promote d the seller drug distribution venture and intended to further it,as described in falcone,at,and,at,the seller and buyer may be found to be in a conspiratorial agreement to further the seller other sales.and if the evidence supports a finding that the seller shared with the buyer an interest in furthering resale by the buyer,the seller and buyer may be found to be in a conspiratorial agreement to further the buyer resales.
with regard to a seller conspiratorial liability for resales by the buyer,it is often said that mere awareness on the part of the seller that the buyer intends to resell the drugs is not sufficient to show that the seller and the buyer share a conspiratorial intent to further the buyer resale.see hawkins,at.this is because the seller can not be considered to have joined a conspiracy with the buyer to advance the buyer resale unless the seller has somehow encouraged the venture or has a stake in interest in bringing about its success.see falcone,at.the transferor mere knowledge of the transferee intent to retransfer to others,without anything more,would not show that the transferor had a stake or interest in the further transfer of the drugs.under some circumstances,a seller of drugs may have no interest whatever in whether the buyer uses the drugs himself or resells.consider,for example,a case in which the original possessor of the drugs holds them for his own use.a friend asks this person to let him have some of his drugs.the possessor agrees,and they effectuate a transfer,either as a gift or at the price the original possessor paid for the drugs.the original owner has become a transferor,his friend a transferee.under this scenario,however,the transferor has transferred without profit motivation and without intending that the transferee sell or give them to anyone else.so far as the evidence shows,the transferor is indifferent to whether the transferee intends to use the drugs himself,share them with friends,or resell them.on such facts,even assuming the transferee has told the transferor that he intends to sell or give the drugs to a third person,the two are not guilty of conspiracy because the transferor is genuinely indifferent to the possibility of retransfer.there is no shared intention between the transferor and the transferee that further transfers occur.referring to judge hand terminology in falcone,the transferor in this scenario is not in any sense promot ing further distribution,or mak ing it his own he has no stake in any further transfers by the transferee.see also hawkins,at it is axiomatic that more is required to establish liability for conspiracy than mere knowledge.
on the other hand,if we consider a hypothetical seller who is running a business of selling drugs in wholesale amounts,this seller may well realize that his buyers ability to buy and pay for substantial amounts of drugs,and hence,his profit,will depend on the buyers ability to resell.the business of selling wholesale quantities depends on the ability of the customers to resell.a seller in such circumstances may well share with the buyer an intention that the buyer succeed in reselling and may be seen as having a stake in the buyer resale.in such case,the liability of buyer and seller for having conspired together to transfer drugs would depend not on the seller mere knowledge of the buyer intent to retransfer,but on a further showing of the seller interest,shared with the buyer,in the success of the buyer resale.
in the recent case of united states hawkins,sru,wl.june,the district court failed to appreciate how limited is the application of the exception.see hawkins.in that case,the defendant hawkins was charged with conspiring with members of alex luna drug distribution organization for the possession of cocaine and cocaine base with intent to distribute.the evidence showed that on several occasions hawkins called members of the luna organization to negotiate a purchase of one or two.id.at.evidence was received to the effect that an eight ball grams is an amount sufficiently large that it is suitable to be broken down into several gram bags for resale while it is also small enough that it might also be bought for personal use.id.at.luna gave hawkins his cell phone number to be used for drug buys.id.at.hawkins told luna he was dissatisfied with other competing sellers and preferred working with luna.in one of hawkins calls,he told luna that the eightball he was buying was,at least in part,for two kids from work.one of them had been calling hawkins because he wanted to get high.id.on another occasion,hawkins called luna and said that he needed an eightball for a customer who was waiting for hawkins right now.id.hawkins explained to luna that while he had no money to pay for the drugs,the custo
