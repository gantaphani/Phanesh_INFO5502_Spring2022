ronald rich appeals from a decision of the united states district court for the district of vermont william sessions iii,denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.rich is serving parole under the supervision of the united states parole commission as a result of a narcotics conviction.
this case arises out of a series of legislative acts enacted,repealed or replaced over a period of more than years.fundamentally,rich appeal asks us to interpret the word revoke in the special parole statute,c ed.repealed,a statute repealed years ago.in order to decide this issue,we must determine whether our decision in strong united states parole commission,cir,interpreting that statute,has been invalidated by the supreme court decision in johnson united states,d,interpreting a similar statute,e supp.ii,dealing with supervised release.the peculiarities of rich particular situation and its relationship to the statutes in question,however,require us first to recount both rich long history of parole violations and the history of the interpretation of these statutes by the parole commission,the circuit courts and the supreme court.only by understanding these two histories can one understand why rich remains under government supervision almost years after he was first sentenced,and why he will continue to be either on special parole or in government custody for some time to come.
for the reasons stated below,we affirm the district court decision.
background 
rich has had a long history of violating parole.in december,the district court sentenced rich to two concurrent terms of imprisonment followed by an term of special parole for conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine.special parole,part of the parole regime abolished by the sentencing reform act of was a special sanction for drug offenders.it differs from regular parole in three respects first,special parole follows the term of imprisonment,while regular parole entails release before the end of the term second,special parole was imposed,and its length selected,by the district judge rather than by the parole commission third,if the conditions of special parole are violated,the parolee is returned to prison to serve the entire special parole term,and receives no credit for his time spent in supervision,or street time.strong,at quoting evans united states parole comm n,cir see also united states,cir.pursuant to the sentencing reform act of,special parole was replaced by supervised release,at.evans,at.
in,before the end of rich original prison term,the parole commission released him on regular parole.rich,however,violated the terms of his parole and in was reincarcerated for most of the remainder of his term of imprisonment.after rich prison term ended in,he began his term of special parole.
in,the parole commission revoked rich special parole as a result of a parole violation and ordered him to serve months in prison.pursuant to commission regulations then in effect,see c,rich was to resume special parole upon release.consistent with the special parole statute,c,the commission ordered that rich receive no credit for time he had spent on special parole prior to the revocation street time and that his term of special parole be diminished only by the months he would spend in prison.
that same year,the united states court of appeals for the third circuit held in fowler parole commission,cir,that when a special parole term is revoked that special parole term ceases to exist.if a special parole violator is incarcerated for less than the full term of his special parole,the court held,he serves the remainder of that term on regular rather than special parole.id.at.rich was then incarcerated in pennsylvania,and the parole commission determined that fowler controlled his status.in december,the commission converted the unserved portion of rich special parole term to regular parole.
in,however,while rich was again on parole,the supreme court held in johnson that for the purposes of supervised release the successor to special parole,revoke means suspend rather than annul and that a term of supervised release can resume following revocation and incarceration.johnson,at.in february,the commission informed rich that it had determined that johnson invalidated fowler and that it was thus vacating its own decision converting rich unserved term from special to regular parole.accordingly,the parole rich was then serving was special,rather than regular,parole.
in july,rich special parole was again revoked for driving while intoxicated and failing to comply with a special alcohol aftercare condition of his parole.the commission ordered him to serve nine months in prison.because rich parole had been converted back to special parole in february,the commission ordered his street time forfeited and ordered him to resume special parole following his incarceration.the termination of rich special parole term was pushed back to august.
in late,rich filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to challenging the commission decision converting his regular parole back to special parole and the resulting forfeiture of almost four years of street time following its revocation.rich argued that pursuant to this court decision in strong a decision similar to fowler,his special parole,once revoked,was terminated and could not be reimposed by the parole commission.he argued that the supreme court decision in johnson controlled only the interpretation of the supervised release statute,and that strong interpretation of the special parole statute remained valid law.
in july,the vermont district court denied rich petition.in a thorough opinion,judge sessions held that the supervised release and special parole statutes were substantially similar and that johnson had invalidated strong.the judge held that the commission had thus correctly interpreted johnson as allowing the reimposition of a special parole term following its revocation.
this appeal followed 
ii.discussion 
interpretation of the special parole statute 
the central question in this case is the proper interpretation of the word revoked in the special parole statute,c.pursuant to that section 
a special parole term imposed under this section may be revoked if its terms and conditions are violated.in such circumstances the original term of imprisonment shall be increased by the period of the special parole term and the resulting new term of imprisonment shall not be diminished by the time which was spent on special parole.a person whose special parole term has been revoked may be required to serve all or part of the remainder of the new term of imprisonment.
the parole commission initially interpreted c as allowing the parole commission to reinstitute special parole following a revocation,and acting under its statutory authority,a repealed,the commission promulgated regulations to that effect.see c.
this interpretation was brought into question when a number of circuits,including this one,held that the successor supervised release statute,prohibited the reimposition of supervised release after its revocation.see united states malesic,cir united states truss,cir united states rockwell,cir united states tatum,cir united states koehler,cir united states cooper,cir united states holmes,cir united states behnezhad,cir but see united states,cir concluding that courts do have power to reimpose supervised release united states schrader,cir same.according to the version of the supervised release statute then in effect,a district court could 
terminate a term of supervised release and discharge the person released at any time after the expiration of one year of supervised release extend a term of supervised release if less than the maximum authorized term was previously imposed,and may modify,reduce,or enlarge the conditions of supervised release,at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of supervised release revoke a term of supervised release,and require the person to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision,or order the person to remain at hi
