this case presents our first occasion to address the bulk cash smuggling provisions of the usa patriot act,stat,codified as amended at.defendant otilio jose challenges the district court forfeiture order in the amount of,arguing that it constitutes an excessive fine in violation of the eighth amendment.he does not challenge his straight guilty plea to counts arising from his failure to declare the amount of currency he was attempting to take with him out of the country.we hold that the forfeiture order does not constitute an excessive fine,but remand,at the request of the united states,so that the sum of can be deducted from the amount of forfeiture.
on august,jose checked two pieces of luggage on a flight departing from luis muoz mar√≠n international airport in puerto rico.jose was on his way to maarten,netherlands antilles.customs officers inspected jose checked luggage and discovered bundles of cash wrapped in tissue paper hidden in a pair of sneakers and other bundles wrapped in carbon paper hidden inside a set of bed sheets.the officers approached jose and explained to him the currency reporting requirements for transported amounts in excess of.see a a.jose declared verbally and in writing that he was in possession of.in fact,the cash on jose,and in his luggage,amounted to a hefty.jose explained that he had found the money while visiting puerto rico.he said that he was at a san juan hotel when he saw someone throw something into a trash container that individual looked around to see if anyone had seen him and then left the area.jose went down to the trash and picked up a bag which contained a large amount of money.he said to himself,this is my fortune,i found it.i put it in my bag and i go home.he claimed that he was unaware of any reporting requirements.
jose was arrested on august and later charged in an indictment with knowingly and willfully failing to file a report when he was about to transport at one time monetary instruments of more than from a place in the united states to a place outside the united states,in violation of a a the cash reporting requirement making a materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or representation in a matter within the jurisdiction of the department of homeland security,an agency of the united states,in violation of a and knowingly and willfully concealing more than in currency in an attempt to transport such currency from a place in the united states to a place outside the united states without filing a report as required by the secretary of the treasury,in violation of a the bulk cash smuggling statute.the indictment also included allegations seeking forfeiture of the based on the offenses alleged in counts one and three,pursuant to c a and b,respectively.
on november,jose entered a straight guilty plea to all three counts of the indictment.the district court advised defendant of his rights and found that he had knowingly and voluntarily waived them by pleading guilty.the court also explained to jose that by pleading guilty he could expect the government to proceed to forfeit the money involved in the offense as a result of the violations of the cash reporting requirement and the bulk cash smuggling statute.jose agreed except for the he did declare,which he expected to be allowed to keep.the government clarified that it had already filed administrative proceedings to try to return the to defendant.the government sought forfeiture of the remaining funds,which jose had attempted to smuggle,but nothing more than that.
on december,the government requested a preliminary order of forfeiture for the entire amount of.the government motion cited both sections c a the cash reporting requirement and b the bulk cash smuggling statute as authority for the forfeiture.it attached a proposed order which referenced defendant violation of sections a a and.the citation to section,rather than section,clearly was a typographical error.the government forfeiture argument at the sentencing hearing was based on both the cash reporting requirement and the bulk cash smuggling statute.
at the hearing on december,the district court stated that it was not so naive as to believe defendant story about how he came to possess the.the judge found that jose had attempted to mislead the court,and he sentenced jose to months imprisonment on each count,to be served concurrently.jose also received three years of supervised release and was ordered to pay a special monetary assessment of on each count.in light of defendant financial situation,the court did not impose a fine.judgment entered on december,no forfeiture order was included in the judgment,as provided for under.b.
on december,the government filed a motion to amend the judgment,calling the district court attention to the fact that the judgment did not include a forfeiture order and to the outstanding issue concerning the that jose had declared.on december,the district court adopted the government earlier proposed order with its typographical error and issued a preliminary order of forfeiture as to the entire amount of.the court did not amend its earlier judgment to include the forfeiture order.
in december,defendant appellate counsel filed a brief pursuant to anders california,d,asserting that there were no issues for appeal.on march,this court rejected the anders brief,but granted counsel request to withdraw.we ordered appointment of new counsel and requested briefing on whether the district court erred in failing to conform with,whether the district court erred in failing to resolve a contested issue regarding the amount of forfeiture,and whether the forfeiture order violates the eighth amendment prohibition of excessive fines.present counsel for defendant has submitted a merits brief only as to the third issue outlined in our march order.accordingly,the first and second issues have been waived.see united states vigneau,cir united states chapdelaine,cir.we consider only whether the district court forfeiture order constitutes an excessive fine in violation of the eighth amendment.
the eighth amendment provides excessive bail shall not be required,nor excessive fines imposed,nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.const.amend.viii.we review de novo whether a fine is constitutionally excessive,but give due deference to the district court factual findings.united states,cir.on appeal from a forfeiture order alleged to be an excessive fine,it is the defendant burden to show unconstitutionality.see id.at united states heldeman,cir.here,we review the forfeiture order only for plain error because jose did not raise his eighth amendment claim before the district court see united states beras,cir.to establish plain error,a defendant must demonstrate that there was error the error was plain the error affected the defendant substantial rights and the error adversely impacted the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states riggs,cir citing united states olano,d united states saxena,cir.
jose argument relies heavily on the supreme court decision in united states bajakajian,d.in bajakajian,the defendant and his family had failed to report the in cash they were attempting to take with them out of the united states on june.id.at.the defendant pled guilty to a charge of violating a a and elected to have a bench trial on the forfeiture count brought under a id.at.the district court found that,under section a,the entire was forfeitable because it was involved in the offense.id.at.nonetheless,the court ordered the forfeiture of only,believing that full forfeiture would violate the excessive fines clause.id.at.on the government appeal,the ninth circuit held that forfeiture of currency pursuant to a was per se unconstitutional because unreported currency was not an instrumentality of the crime of failure to report.united states bajakajian,cir.
on certiorari,the supreme court held that it was irrelevant whether bajakajian money was an instrumentality of his offense.at.instead,the court asked first whether the forfeiture constituted punishment and was thus a fine within the meaning of the excessive fines clause,id.at,and then considered whether the forfeiture was constitutionally is,whether the forfeiture was grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant offense,id.at.the court held that the forfeiture of bajakajian money,which was imposed at the culmination of a criminal proceeding and require d conviction of an underlying felony,constituted punishment and was thus a fine.id.at.on the question of excessiveness,the court thought it was significant that the district court had found that bajakajian offense was unrelated to any other illegal activities.id.at.bajakajian owed no customs duties to the government,and it was perfectly legal for him to possess the in cash and to remove it from the united states.his crime was simply failing to report the wholly legal act of transporting his currency.id.at.the court further considered the maximum penalties available under the statute,as well as the fact that under the sentencing guidelines the maximum sentence that could have been imposed on bajakajian was six months,while the maximum fine was.id.at.the court also found that t he harm that bajakajian caused was minimal.id.at.these observations contributed to the court conclusion that the full forfeiture of bajakajian money would be grossly disproportional to the gravity of his offense.id.at.
congress responded to bajakajian in the usa patriot act when it amended laws governing civil and criminal forfeiture in the wake of september,stat.at,amending and,and,and creating the usa patriot act inserted a criminal forfeiture provision in c a for property involved in a violation of and correspondingly deleted the reference to in a id,stat.at.
the act also defined the new crime of bulk cash smuggling at.id,stat.at.section a provides 
whoever,with the intent to evade a currency reporting requirement under section,knowingly conceals more than in currency or other monetary instruments on the person of such individual or in any conveyance,article of luggage,merchandise,or other container,and transports or transfers or attempts to transport or transfer such currency or monetary instruments from a place within the united states to a place outside of the united states,or from a place outside the united states to a place within the united states,shall be guilty of a currency smuggling offense and subject to punishment pursuant to subsection b.
section b,in turn,provides for the forfeiture of any property,real or personal,involved in the violation of section a.
although the elements of the offense defined at section a largely track those of the offense defined at section a section places its emphasis on the knowing concealment of more than in currency or other monetary instruments,rather than the requirement to file a report,as in section.indeed,congress attached to section a note expressing its finding that 
t he current penalties for violations of the currency reporting requirements are insufficient to provide a deterrent to the laundering of criminal proceeds.in particular,in cases where the only criminal violation under current law is a reporting offense,the law does not adequately provide for the confiscation of smuggled currency.in contrast,if the smuggling of bulk cash were itself an offense,the cash could be confiscated as the corpus delicti of the smuggling offense.
usa patriot act,a,stat.at emphases added.
congress was explicit that its purposes in enacting section were to make the act of smuggling bulk cash itself a criminal offense to authorize forfeiture of any cash or instruments of the smuggling offense and to emphasize the seriousness of the act of bulk cash smuggling.id.b,stat.at.congress was particularly concerned that the transportation and smuggling of large sums of cash was a warning sign of drug trafficking,terrorism,money laundering,racketeering,tax evasion and similar crimes.id.a,stat.at.further,because couriers who attempt to smuggle cash out of the country are typically employees of criminal organizations,congress believed that only the confiscation of the smuggled bulk cash can effectively break the cycle of criminal activity of which the laundering of the bulk cash is a critical part.id.a,stat.at.
congress,in enacting section,responded to bajakajian in a way that it believed would,in most circumstances,constitutionally permit the full forfeiture of currency not reported to authorities as required by section.the report of the house committee on financial services stated 
the committee believes that bulk cash smuggling is an inherently more serious offense than simply failing to file a customs report.because the constitutionality of a forfeiture is dependent on the gravity of the offense under bajakajian,it is anticipated that the full forfeiture of smuggled money will withstand constitutional scrutiny in most cases.
i,at.section makes clear that congress has now prohibited what it calls bulk cash smuggling,and that it considers this to be a very serious offense.congress has thus tipped the forfeiture equation in favor of the prosecution in bulk cash smuggling cases.bajakajian itself stated that judgments about the appropriate punishment for an offense belong in the first instance to the legislature.at.citing solem helm,d reviewing courts should grant substantial deference to the broad authority that legislatures necessarily possess in determining the types and limits of punishments for crimes gore united states,d whatever views may be entertained regarding severity of punishment,these are peculiarly questions of legislative policy.but see united states ely,cir stating that the difference between the superseded version of and could not be viewed as a meaningful change.
we turn to the question of whether the district court forfeiture order was plainly erroneous,given defendant challenge under the excessive fines clause.in considering this question,we need not,and do not,address whether congress,in enacting section,has eliminated in all instances any eighth amendment concerns with respect to bulk cash smuggling forfeitures.in light of the facts of this case,we conclude that there was no error at all,much less plain error.
we consider first whether the forfeiture order constituted punishment.see heldeman,at forfeitures are subject to the eighth amendment excessive fines clause if they constitute punishment for an offense.quoting bajakajian,at.the order here,which was imposed at the culmination of a criminal proceeding,and which require d conviction of an underlying felony,constituted punishment bajakajian,at.
next,we consider whether the forfeiture of the would be grossly disproportional to the gravity of the defendant offense.id.at.for eighth amendment excessive fine purposes,pertinent factors include whether the defendant falls into the class of persons at whom the criminal statute was principally directed other penalties authorized by the legislature or the sentencing commission and the harm caused by the defendant.heldeman,at see also bajakajian,at.beras,at.
on the first factor,we inquire whether the statute is principally directed toward defendant.given that we take the forfeiture order to be independently based on count three,we consider whether section,the bulk cash smuggling statute,is designed for offenders like jose.in its usa patriot act findings,congress recognized that couriers who attempt to smuggle cash out of the united states are typically employees of large criminal organizations,a,stat.at emphasis added.here,the district court did not find that defendant funds were not linked to other crimes,as was the case in bajakajian.see at.although it is true that the district court did not expressly find that the funds were related to illegal activities it is jose who bears the burden of showing that the forfeiture is unconstitutional.see,at heldeman,at.indeed,defendant story explaining how he found the money raises serious suspicions about whether the funds were legally derived.forfeitures based on violations of the bulk cash smuggling statute are principally directed toward money launderers,drug traffickers,tax evaders,and terrorists,as well as their couriers.see usa patriot act,a,stat.at.given the facts of this case and jose unlikely story,we can not say that section
