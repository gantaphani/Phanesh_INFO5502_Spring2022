this appeal presents a montage of issues arising at a crossroads where traditional criminal law principles intersect with the marvels of modern technology.the appeal follows on the heels of a jury verdict finding david chiaradio guilty of possessing and distributing child pornography.the defendant challenges divers aspects of the indictment,trial,verdict,and sentence.after careful consideration of the arguments on both sides,we affirm in part and remand for further proceedings.
background 
at trial,the government case relied in large part on testimony from agents of the federal bureau of investigation fbi.one agent,joseph cecchini,testified that on february,he went online in an undercover capacity to search for child pornography.agent cecchini investigation involved software known as limewire a commercially available program that enables users to transmit files to and from other members of the limewire network.users can search for files made available by other users,browse all the files made available by a particular user,and download desired files.they also may make their own files accessible for download by designating a folder on their computers that will automatically share its contents with the network.
agent cecchini employed a special version of limewire developed by the fbi,known as enhanced software,which was customized to assist child pornography investigations.it differs from the commercially available limewire program in three principal respects.
first,when a user of the commercially available version of limewire tries to download a file,the program seeks out all the users who are sharing the same file and downloads different pieces of that file from multiple locations in order to optimize download speed.eliminates that functionality it allows downloading from only one source at a time,thus ensuring that the entire file is available on that source computer.second,in its commercially available iteration,limewire responds to a search term by displaying basic information such as the names of the available files,file types,and the file sharers internet protocol ip addresses.displays not only that data but also the identity of the internet service provider isp and the city and state associated with the ip address sharing a particular file.third,has been modified so that an agent can easily compare the hash value essentially,the digital fingerprint of an available file with the hash values of confirmed videos and images of child pornography.taken together,these three modifications permit agents to download a file from a single source,learn the general location of the source,and facilitate the identification of child pornography as such.
agent cecchini testified that on february,he used to search for pedo collection,a term that he knew to be fancied by collectors of child pornography.his search turned up a number of files,including one being shared from an ip address in rhode island.he then used limewire browse function to peruse the other files being shared from that ip address and found files with titles suggestive of child pornography.the agent downloaded three such files and confirmed that they contained graphic depictions of young girls.
after serving a subpoena on the isp,agent cecchini traced the ip address to a residence in westerly,rhode island,owned by the defendant father.with this information in hand,another agent,andrew yesnowski,obtained a search warrant.
on august,a search party that included agent yesnowski and agent michael kohn executed the warrant at the westerly dwelling.the agents seized a laptop computer from the defendant bedroom and a desktop computer from a spare bedroom.the defendant took responsibility for both computers and agreed to speak with agents about his computer usage.he explained that the house had a shared wireless network connecting both computers to the internet,as well as its own internal system enabling a user of one computer to access data and files on the other computer.in response to agents questions,the defendant admitted to installing and using limewire on the laptop to download music but denied that he had ever searched for,or downloaded,child pornography.
forensic analysis revealed over images and videos of child pornography on the desktop and nearly on the laptop.there was some overlap between these inventories of child pornography,but the record remains tenebrous as to the details.
on may,a federal grand jury handed up an indictment charging the defendant with two counts of possessing child pornography,a b,and one count of distributing it,id.a.after considerable pretrial skirmishing and three days of trial,a jury found the defendant guilty across the board.the district court denied the defendant motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial.sentencing followed.
with respect to the distribution count,the district court used a base offense level of,see ussg a,and then added levels premised on various specific adjustments.through grouping,this total offense level applied to all of the counts of conviction.see id,c,a.paired with the defendant criminal history category i,this total offense level yielded a guideline sentencing range of months.
varying downward,the district court imposed concurrent month incarcerative terms on each count of conviction.the court also imposed a life term of supervised release and a special assessment on each count,see a a.the court did not impose a fine,but it ordered the defendant to pay to each of two victims who requested restitution.see id.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
we address the defendant claims of error sequentially.
multiplicity.
as an initial matter,the defendant challenges the government decision to charge him with two counts of possessing child pornography under a b.these counts,he maintains,are multiplicitous and because he has been convicted and sentenced on each count,he has been twice punished for a single crime.see const.amend.v illinois vitale.
the prohibition against multiplicitous prosecutions derives from the double jeopardy clause,which protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.united states pires,cir quoting vitale,at.a prosecution is multiplicitous when the government charges a defendant twice for what is essentially a single crime for example,when a felon has violated g by possessing a firearm,it would be multiplicitous to charge the felon with two counts simply because he had it yesterday and today.see united states destefano,wl,at cir,per curiam.determining whether an indictment is multiplicitous requires an inquiring court to examine whether a particular course of illegal conduct constitutes one or multiple offenses.see pires,at.congress intent is paramount on this point the legislature may castigate a particular act by exposing the actor to several prosecutions and punishments,or it may specify that the act should only be subject to a single unit of prosecution.see see also united states lemoure,cir observing that m ultiple punishments for the same offense are permissible if the legislature so intended.
in the case at hand,the statute of conviction prohibits knowingly possess ing one or more books,magazines,periodicals,films,video tapes,or other matter which contain any visual depiction that has traveled in,or was produced by materials which traveled in,interstate commerce if i the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct and ii such visual depiction is of such conduct.a b.here,the government seized a plethora of forbidden files during a single search of a single dwelling,yet charged the defendant with two counts of unlawful possession.the government defends its use of dual counts of possession on the ground that the proper unit of prosecution is each matter or physical medium on which images are stored.as the government would have it,the defendant utilization of two computers the laptop and the desktop exposed him to prosecution for two separate crimes.this is especially fitting,the government suggests,because the computers were located in different rooms and had different functions the laptop was used for acquiring the pornographic images,whereas the desktop was used for storing them.
the defendant counters that section a b,fairly read,criminalizes the possession of one or more computers containing offending images.it follows,the defendant says,that the government may charge only a single crime regardless of whether a defendant possesses two or images on one or computers,at least when that possession is simultaneous and under one roof.in other words,the number of matters here,the number of computers does not in itself define the proper unit of prosecution.dividing the crime of possession into two separate crimes was especially egregious in this case,the defendant suggests,because the two computers were linked that is,they shared an internal network through which files could freely move back and forth and their contents overlapped albeit to an unspecified degree.
the defendant properly preserved this issue for review,raising it by both a motion to dismiss and a motion for judgment of acquittal.consequently,his claim of multiplicity engenders de novo review.see united states gerhard,cir.our task is straightforward when,as in this case,a claim of multiplicity is premised on an indictment alleging several violations of a single statutory provision,an inquiring court must determine whether there is a sufficient factual basis to treat each count as separate.united states stefanidakis,cir,slip op.at.in making this judgment,we look to the statute of conviction to ascertain whether congress intended to punish each statutory violation separately.pires,at quoting jeffers united states,internal quotation marks omitted.the key question in this case,then,is what the legislature intended the proper unit of prosecution to be when it criminalized the possession of one or more matters containing illicit depictions.
when congress added what is now section a b to the statute criminalizing the transportation,receipt,and distribution of child pornography,it outlawed the possession of three or more books,magazines,periodicals,films,video tapes,or other matter which contain any visual depiction of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.child protection restoration and penalties enhancement act of,stat,current version at a b.no other section of the statute contained such a numerical limitation.from their inception,the offenses described in section a,the receipt and distribution offenses described in section a,and the offenses described in section a all criminalized offending acts with respect to any sexually explicit depiction of a minor.see id.current version at a protection of children against sexual exploitation act of,stat,current version at a.
in,congress changed the numerical element of section a b to make unlawful the possession of one or more books,magazines,periodicals,films,video tapes,or other matter which contain any visual depiction.see a b emphasis supplied protection of children from sexual predators act of,stat.the very title of the amending legislation zero tolerance for possession of child pornography makes manifest a legislative intent to punish the possession of even a single illicit image.but the legislative history contains no indication that congress intended to permit multiple prosecutions when it used the term one or more in section a b,nor is there any inkling that congress intended to allow prosecutors to divide simultaneous possession by a single individual of several matters containing child pornography into multiple units of prosecution,see bell united states,observing that w hen congress has the will of defining what it desires to make the unit of prosecution,it has no difficulty expressing it.we think that this is significant because,as we explain below,courts previously had treated such violations of section a b as comprising a single offense.
before the amendment,the fifth circuit considered whether an indictment could charge a defendant who possessed numerous forbidden images with multiple offenses under section a b.the court concluded that the plain language of the statute requirement that a defendant possess three or more items indicates that the legislature did not intend for this statute to be used to charge multiple offenses in such a situation.united states kimbrough,cir.we do not see why changing the number from three to one undermines this trenchant assessment in any way accordingly,we hold that the plain language of section a b memorializes congress intent,at least in circumstances similar to the circumstances of this case,that one who simultaneously possesses a multitude of forbidden images at a single time and in a single place will have committed only a single offense.in this instance,the defendant may have possessed two matters,two computers that collectively contained thousands of images,but his simultaneous possession of one or more matters transgressed the statute only once.
in so holding,we do not write on a pristine page.the second circuit answered a similar question in united states polouizzi,cir.the court found that the defendant had been impermissibly charged with eleven counts of possession when he possessed eleven files on three hard drives in two separate rooms.id.at.it examined section a b and relevant case law and concluded,as do we,that congress intended to subject a person who simultaneously possesses multiple books,magazines,periodicals,films,video tapes,or other matter containing a visual depiction of child pornography to only one conviction.id.at.
the government labors to distinguish polouizzi on the ground that,unlike in that case,see id.at,it has consistently argued the significance of dual computers in separate rooms.we find this supposed distinction unconvincing.the computers,while in separate rooms,were in the same house and were programmed so that files could move freely between them.if a defendant had multiple photo albums of images in his bedroom and living room and periodically swapped images between them,two convictions one for each album would not stand.this case,it seems to us,is the electronic equivalent of that situation.
the government reliance on case law approving the charging of multiple possession counts under section a b,see,united states hinkeldey,cir united states planck,cir,is equally misplaced.section,enacted after section,criminalizes trafficking in and possessing all child pornography,a term broad enough to include otherwise unobjectionable images of children that have been manipulated to appear pornographic.see a,child pornography prevention act of,stat.with respect to possession offenses,section a b prohibits knowingly possessing any book,magazine,periodical,film,videotape,computer disk,or any other material that contains an image of child pornography.a b emphasis supplied.the use of the word any contrasts sharply with section a b,which criminalizes possessing one or more matters containing any image.id.a b emphasis supplied.
the possession provisions of section and section are,thus,materially different.this difference between any and one or more is of decretory significance.the phrase one or more,unlike the word any,strongly suggests congress intent that multiple matters be included in a single unit of prosecution see hinkeldey,at see also kimbrough,at explaining that the difference between any and three or more is what distinguishes the offense of possession of child pornography from the offenses of transporting and receiving child pornography for purposes of the multiplicity argument.for aught that appears,the government could have charged the defendant with multiple counts of possession under section a b.but it did not do so,and we can not permit the government to emphasize the superficial affinities between these two laws and gloss over their differences in order to salvage an improvident charging decision.
the government also cites case law dealing with drug and gun possession offenses in support of its argument that section a b contemplates multiple units of prosecution in this type of child pornography case.none of the statutes underpinning those prosecutions uses the term one or more.see,g it shall be unlawful for any person under certain enumerated circumstances to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce,or possess in or affecting commerce,any firearm or ammunition emphasis supplied a making it unlawful to possess a controlled substance emphasis supplied.for this reason,the cases cited shed no light on the appropriate unit of prosecution under section a b.
the short of it is that,on the facts of this case,the defendant unlawful possession of a multitude of files on two interlinked computers located in separate rooms within the same dwelling gave rise to only a single count of unlawful possession under section a b.yet,the government charged the defendant with multiple counts of possession.his simultaneous convictions and sentences on those counts violated his constitutional right to be free from double jeopardy.see united states rivera martinez,cir.while other cases,on different facts,might appropriately give rise to multiple possession charges under section a b,the facts of this case do not support such an outcome.
we turn next to the defendant contention that the district court should have granted his pretrial motion to compel production of the source code of the program essentially,the version of the instructions used by a computer running.in the district court,the defendant claimed that he was entitled to the source code on several grounds.the court denied the motion.the only point that warrants discussion involves federal rule of criminal procedure a e,which requires the government to permit the defendant to examine and copy documents,data,and objects in its control if the items are material to preparing the defense or if the government plans to use them in its case in chief 
we review district court determinations under rule for abuse of discretion.united states correa alicea,cir.reversible error may not be found unless the objecting party can show prejudice.see united states spinosa,cir.
the fbi developed as an investigatory tool.its source code is closely held it is not shared with or accessible to the agents who use the program,let alone the public.the defendant argues that he had to obtain the source code in order to determine whether he could credibly challenge the reliability of the technology and,thus,block the expert testimony proffered by the government on the program and how it implicated the defendant.see.see also daubert merrell dow,calling on courts to ensure that an expert testimony rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.in his view,his inability to examine the source code prevented him from mounting such a challenge 
faced with the defendant motion to compel,the district court convened an evidentiary hearing.the court heard testimony from agent michael gordon,the government proposed expert.agent gordon had been involved in the testing of the program,had instructed other agents about its use,and had participated in over eighty investigations in which was employed.he demonstrated,among other things,how to check the results of an investigation manually to ensure that the files transferred had in fact come from the location identified through.he vouchsafed that,in his wide experience,no investigation had ever yielded a false positive.the district court denied the motion to compel and concluded that agent gordon testimony passed daubert muster.
we need not linger long over the denial of the motion to compel.even if the source code were discoverable under rule a matter on which we take no view the defendant can not demonstrate prejudice from its nondisclosure.the government gave the defendant a digital file recording the transfer from the defendant laptop to agent cecchini computer.it also gave the defendant a copy of the fbi guide detailing how to reconstruct an session manually using only the recording and publicly available programs.the government presented testimony indicating that its agents had used these materials to reconstruct the transfer and had verified that the files downloaded by agent cecchini came from the defendant computer.the defendant neither contradicted nor cast the slightest doubt upon this testimony.this evidence makes it pellucid that the forbidden files were located on the defendant computers and transferred to agent cecchini.consequently,any error in the application of the program was harmless.
relatedly,the defendant who does not challenge agent gordon qualifications as an expert nevertheless contends that it was error for the court to allow his expert testimony.in this regard,the defendant asserts that the technology was too untested to form an adequate foundation for the agent attestations.in making its daubert determination,the district court acknowledged that the technology had not been independently tested.relying on a compendium of other facts,however,it found sufficient evidence of reliability to permit agent gordon testimony.we review this ruling for abuse of discretion.see ruiz troche pepsi cola of bottling,cir.
evidence rule provides that if scientific,technical,or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge,skill,experience,training,or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise so long as certain requirements are met.in evaluating whether proposed expert testimony satisfies those requirements,the district court must look to a number of factors,including but not limited to the verifiability of the expert theory or technique,the error rate inherent therein,whether the theory or technique has been published subjected to peer review,and its level of acceptance within the scientific community.samaan joseph,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the defendant concedes that the evidentiary hearing held on his motion to compel was the functional equivalent of a daubert hearing.although agent gordon was not a programmer,did not know the program authors,and had never seen the source code,he had significant specialized experience with both and the manual of sessions.he testified that the program,with respect to identifying the source of particular files,had no error rate.he also demonstrated how the results of an investigation could be independently verified and made it clear that had never yielded a false positive.these showings sufficiently evinced the reliability of.consequently,permitting agent gordon to testify at trial about the program was well within the district court discretion.
in an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,the defendant laments that has not been subjected to peer review in the scientific community.this is true as far as it goes but it does not take the defendant very far.the daubert factors are not a definitive checklist or test,but form the basis for a flexible inquiry into the overall reliability of a proffered expert methodology.ruiz troche,at quoting daubert,at.here,moreover,there is a credible explanation for the absence of peer review.the record shows that the source code is purposely kept secret because the government reasonably fears that traders of child pornography a notoriously group otherwise would be able to use the source code to develop ways either to evade apprehension or to mislead the authorities.this circumstance satisfactorily explains the absence of any peer review.puerto rico united states,cir recognizing a qualified privilege for law enforcement techniques and procedures united states cintolo,cir discussing qualified privilege for confidential government surveillance information where discoverability of this kind of information will enable criminals to frustrate future government surveillance and perhaps unduly jeopardize the security of ongoing investigations.
suppression.
following the denial of his motion to compel,the defendant moved to suppress the fruits of the fbi search,alleging that the affidavit in support of the warrant was inadequate.the district court denied this motion.
the defendant arguments in support of his motion to suppress bear a strong family resemblance to his arguments in support of his motion to compel.he posits that is largely untested and insists that the affidavit filed in support of the search warrant did not sufficiently demonstrate its reliability.
the fourth amendment provides that no warrants shall issue,but upon probable cause,supported by oath or affirmation.const.amend.iv.probable cause exists when the affidavit upon which a warrant is founded demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood that an offense has been committed and that there is sound reason to believe that a particular search will turn up evidence of it.united states aguirre,cir.the issuing magistrate must examine the totality of the circumstances to determine the existence of probable cause.united states schaefer,cir.this prescription binds reviewing courts,but the issuing magistrate determination should be paid great deference.illinois gates,quoting spinelli united states,internal quotation marks omitted.
when reviewing a district court denial of a motion to suppress,the scrutiny afforded by the court of appeals must be tempered by yet another level of deference we assess the district court factual findings for clear error.see united states garcia hernandez,cir.withal,we assay the district court rulings of law de novo.see id.
in this case,the circumstances,viewed in their totality,leave no doubt that there was probable cause to support the warrant.the supporting affidavit chronicled agent cecchini investigation and spelled out how it led to the defendant ip address and,in turn,his abode.in the process,it described the technology that the fbi had developed for such investigations and had used in this case.
the defendant objects to these references to on the basis that the technology was too untested to meet the requirements of the federal rules of evidence.this argument mixes plums and pomegranates the federal rules of evidence do not apply to proceedings surrounding the issuance of a search warrant.see.d.instead,the issuing magistrate must make a practical,decision whether there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.gates,at.in this instance,the magistrate made a sensible determination,based on a detailed affidavit,that a search of the defendant residence was likely to turn up illicit images.because probable cause does not require scientific certainty,roche john hancock mut.life ins,cir,no more was exigible.
the defendant tries to attack the affidavit in yet another way,suggesting that it contained knowing or reckless material omissions about the reliability of.in particular,he focuses again on the absence of peer review.this attack is easily repulsed.here,the allegedly omitted statements what the fbi knew about the reliability of,including,but not limited to,the absence of peer review would,if included in their entirety,tend to show that was reliable.thus,the alleged omissions in the supporting affidavit were not material had the omitted statements been added,they would not have diluted the affidavit showing of probable cause.see united states rumney,cir.
put in the simplest of terms,had the affiant included the additional statements describing what was known about reliability,those statements would have served no purpose except to strengthen the affidavit.it would be wildly illogical to suppress the fruits of a search on the ground that the warrant application omitted statements that,if included,would have increased the affidavit persuasive force.united states bynum,f d,cir observing that an omission in an affidavit will not be fatal just because the officer fails to include in th e affidavit all of the information known to him supporting a finding of probable cause.
jury instructions.
the defendant presents twin claims of instructional error.we deal with them one by one.
he first asserts that he was entitled to a lesser included offense instruction on the distribution count.in his view,distribution necessarily entails possession.thus,possession must be a lesser included offense of distribution,and the jury should have been instructed accordingly.see.c.
we review de novo the trial judge decision about whether to give a lesser included offense instruction.united states boidi,cir citing united states flores,cir.the defendant is entitled to such an instruction where the lesser offense is included in the offense charged,a contested fact separates the two offenses,and the evidence would permit a jury rationally to find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense and acquit him of the greater.id.alterations,citations,and internal quotation marks omitted.
our inquiry here can stop at the first step of this pavane.in deciding whether an offense is necessarily included in the offense charged,we apply an elements test,under which one offense is not necessarily included in another unless the elements of the lesser offense are a subset of the elements of the charged offense.carter united states,quoting schmuck united states,internal quotation marks omitted.to pass the test,all the elements of the lesser included offense must be elements of the charged offense but the charged offense must include at least one additional element.flores,at.
we have stated,albeit in the context of drug trafficking,that w hile possession is certainly helpful in proving distribution,it is technically not a necessary element.united states sepulveda,cir.the same is true in this child pornography case.one can envision circumstances in which an individual could be guilty of distribution without ever obtaining possession of or even coming into contact with the contraband.for example,the broker of a deal between a person who has child pornography and a person who wishes to procure it may be guilty of distribution but not guilty of possession.united states brunty,cir observing,in drug context,that distribution may consist of arranging or supervising the delivery of contraband or negotiating for or receiving the purchase price of contraband.accordingly,possession is not a necessary element of distribution in a child pornography case,and the district court did not err in refusing to give the requested lesser included offense instruction.
the defendant second claim of instructional error contemplates that the district court should have embraced his proposed to its instruction on distribution.this stated in pertinent part that proof of possession of child pornography and even possession of child pornography with the intent to distribute child pornography is not sufficient to prove distribution.where,as here,a trial court refuses to give a requested instruction,its refusal is erroneous only if the requested instruction was correct as a matter of substantive law,not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered,and integral to an important point in the case.united states mcgill,cir.
we have canvassed the instructions as a whole.see cintolo,at.after conducting this canvass,we are satisfied that the instructions given covered substantially the same ground as the instruction requested.the court charge adequately communicated the disparate elements of possession and distribution,satisfactorily illuminated the difference between the two,and made plain what the government needed to prove to convict on each offense.while the defendant may have wanted the court to put the distinction in his chosen words,the court was under no obligation to parrot the exact language that the defendant prefers.mcgill,at.the court instructions constituted a fair and reasonably complete statement of the applicable law.our jurisprudence requires no more.
judgment of acquittal.
we now address the defendant plaint that the government introduced insufficient evidence of distribution and that,therefore,the court should have granted his motion for judgment of acquittal on the distribution count.see.we review the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo.see united states dwinells,cir.in this exercise,we examine whether,after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government,and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor,a rational factfinder could find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.united states,cir.
in the case at hand,the government had to prove that the de
