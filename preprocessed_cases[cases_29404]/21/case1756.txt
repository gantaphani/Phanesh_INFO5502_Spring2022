the government appeals from a judgment of conviction against william genao,entered march,in the united states district court for the southern district of new york kimba wood,judge.following a guilty plea,genao stood convicted of one count of making false statements to representatives of the united states attorney office and the federal bureau of investigation fbi,in violation of and was sentenced by the district court principally to six months of imprisonment.on appeal,the government argues that the district court erred in calculating genao sentence when it declined to invoke the provision of c and concluded that it lacked discretion to upwardly depart pursuant to application note to for genao aggravating,objective of obstructing a criminal investigation.we agree with the district court that the provision of c was not applicable,but hold,contrary to the view of the district court,that defendant aggravating,objective did permit upward departure pursuant to application note.
background 
genao operated international,a company located in the dominican republic that converts currency from united states dollars to dominican pesos.genao and international became involved in a conspiracy that laundered over million between and.the conspirators used proceeds from narcotic sales to purchase food stamps on the black market in the united states,deposited the food stamps into bank accounts in the names of small grocery stores controlled by the conspirators,and received credit for the full face value of the food stamps.
the principal participants in the money laundering conspiracy were amelfis hernandez and reynaldo cespedes.hernandez operated a travel agency in manhattan.she received cash proceeds from drug dealers and then arranged for the money to be transferred to the dominican republic through genao company or his bank accounts in miami.cespedes controlled a number of small grocery stores in new york.he received narcotics proceeds from hernandez,purchased food stamps on the black market with this money,and deposited the food stamps into his grocery stores bank accounts.cespedes then wrote checks from the grocery store accounts to companies controlled by genao and delivered the checks to hernandez,who,in turn,delivered them to international or directly to genao miami accounts.in this manner,millions of dollars were deposited into bank accounts in miami controlled by genao or international.genao then exchanged the dollars in his miami bank accounts for pesos from dominican businesses that needed united states dollars to purchase goods for import into the dominican republic.most of the businesses in the dominican republic that received the united states dollars were in fact representatives of the drug traffickers.
in august,the government executed a seizure warrant and froze genao accounts in miami.on august,genao met with representatives of the united states attorney office and the fbi in new york,seeking the return of the frozen funds.genao described international as a currency exchange business that acquired united states dollars from various sources and sold them at a profit in the dominican republic.genao acknowledged that he had received funds from cespedes but denied knowing that cespedes was receiving those funds from hernandez or that the funds were narcotics proceeds.genao said that his employee,alexander sued,managed international and was the only person who dealt with cespedes.
genao was arrested during the august,meeting on a complaint charging him with conspiring to launder money in violation of h.the complaint was based primarily on information provided by cespedes,who had already been arrested and had begun cooperating with the government prior to genao meetings with the federal investigators.genao continued the interview subsequent to his arrest and admitted to knowing that the checks cespedes deposited into his accounts were not legitimate business proceeds but,rather,were covered by cash that cespedes had received from hernandez.genao claimed that he did not become aware of the arrangement between cespedes and hernandez until his employee sued informed him of it at the end of or at the beginning of after the checks had been deposited into his accounts.he also claimed that he told sued to stop accepting transactions from cespedes or hernandez as soon as he became aware of their arrangement.
following his august,meeting,genao complied with the government request to provide it with certain documents from international.these documents showed that in and international continued to accept transactions from cespedes and hernandez totaling more than million.genao then requested the opportunity to make an innocence proffer,to have a meeting with the government in the hopes of demonstrating that he had been unaware of any criminal taint to the money he received from cespedes and hernandez.genao agreed to waive his right to a speedy trial,thereby permitting the government to postpone the filing of an indictment until after genao innocence proffer.
in october and november of,genao met with fbi investigators and assistant united states attorneys on three separate occasions.unable to reconcile the discrepancies between genao and cespedes accounts,the government dismissed the money laundering complaint against genao in december.
in early january,hernandez began cooperating with the government.she corroborated cespedes account,stating that genao introduced her to cespedes in and that he arranged for her to deliver cash to cespedes,to receive checks in return,and to send the checks to international in the dominican republic.
in january,the government convened a grand jury,which returned a indictment charging genao with,inter alia,lying to the government during his interviews and his innocence proffers,in violation of.on may,genao pleaded guilty to count four of the indictment,which charged him with violating by falsely claiming during the november innocence proffer that he did not learn until that the checks drawn on cespedes accounts were funded with cash cespedes received from hernandez.genao written plea agreement contained no stipulations regarding his sentence or the application of the guidelines.
prior to genao sentencing,the government argued to the district court that c,a provision,permitted the court to sentence genao under c the guideline,rather than under,the fraud guideline that generally applies to violations of.subsection c states 
if the defendant was convicted under a statute proscribing false,fictitious,or fraudulent statements or representations generally,or and c the conduct set forth in the count of conviction establishes an offense specifically covered by another guideline in chapter two offense conduct,apply that other guideline.
c.the government maintained that the guideline was more appropriate than the fraud guideline and that genao conduct violated two obstruction of justice statutes,and genao objected to the application of the guideline pursuant to the provision of c,arguing that his false statements in the innocence proffer did not constitute a violation of either or.
in addition,the government sought an upward departure pursuant to application note to,which states that an upward departure may be appropriate where a primary objective of the offense was an aggravating,objective.
in order to resolve these issues,the district court held an evidentiary hearing.it heard testimony from a number of witnesses,including genao,hernandez and cespedes.on march,the district court held a sentencing hearing.the court concluded that genao testimony at the evidentiary hearing was not credible and that the government had proved by clear and convincing evidence that genao conspired to launder money,that he lied in various proffers in an effort to direct the money laundering investigation away from him,and that his lying led to the improper termination of the criminal investigation.sentencing,march,at.
the court sentenced genao under the sentencing guidelines,the version of the guidelines in effect at the time of genao sentencing.see a a ii a united states gonzalez,cir.first,the district court determined that the provision of c could only apply if genao conduct constituted the crime of obstruction of justice,as defined in either or.the court reasoned that,in order to constitute an obstruction of justice under,a defendant false statements must be repeated in and obstruct a grand jury or other judicial proceeding.it concluded that,because no grand jury was convened in this case,genao conduct did not violate.the court also determined,without explanation,that genao conduct did not violate.accordingly,the court declined to apply the provision of c.
second,the district court addressed the government argument that it should upwardly depart pursuant to application note to,which permits an upward departure where a defendant aggravating,objective is not sufficiently reflected in the sentence he would otherwise receive.the court initially stated its intent to depart upward in order to reflect the defendant aggravating,objective of interfering with the investigation into his participation in the money laundering scheme.however,after concluding that it could not depart pursuant to the provision of c,the court also withdrew its prior decision to depart pursuant to application note to.it reasoned that a departure based on application note would effectively be a back door to allowing an upward departure that is not permitted under c.
applying the fraud guideline generally applicable to violations of,the court determined that genao offense level was six,deducted two points for his acceptance of responsibility,and sentenced him principally to six months of upper limit of the applicable guideline range 
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,the government argues that the district court erred by declining to sentence genao under the guideline and concluding that it was prohibited from departing upward to reflect genao aggravating,objective of interfering with the investigation into his money laundering scheme and preventing his arrest and prosecution.
standard of review 
where a sentencing court application of the guidelines presents a question of law,our review is de novo.see,united states matthews,cir.however,we review the district court factual determinations for clear error.id.
ii.interpretation of c 
the government first argues on appeal that the district court erred by declining to sentence genao under the guideline.in particular,the government maintains that the district court was authorized by the provision of c to apply the guideline even if genao conduct,as set forth in the indictment,does not establish the exact elements of an offense.
the provision of c applies only if the conduct set forth in the count of conviction establishes an offense specifically covered by another guideline in chapter two offense conduct.c emphasis added thus,the plain language of c indicates that c is applicable only if the conduct alleged in the count of the indictment of which the defendant is convicted establishes the elements of another offense.this interpretation of c is bolstered by the fact that replaces a previous guideline,that contained substantially broader language the prior guideline provided for whenever the indictment or information setting forth the count of conviction or a stipulation described in a establishes an offense more aptly covered by another guideline.deleted,emphasis added in united states napoli,cir,we held that the prior provision could be applied whenever the indictment or information alleges facts sufficient to establish a more serious crime the facts known to the sentencing court are sufficient to establish an offense more aptly covered by another guideline or the conduct lie s well beyond the heartland embodied in the fraud guideline.id.at.thus,we held under the prior provision that an offense could be more aptly covered by another guideline even when the elements of another offense can not be established.id.at.
following our decision in napoli,the sentencing commission replaced the prior provision with c,and,in doing so,limited its applicability to situations in which the conduct set forth in the count of conviction establishes an offense specifically covered by another guideline.this change limits the applicability of the provision to situations in which the conduct set forth in the relevant count of the indictment actually constitutes an offense covered by another guideline.accordingly,we hold that c is applicable only if the elements of another offense are established by conduct set forth in the count of conviction and proven by at least a preponderance of the evidence 
iii.interpretation of c 
after concluding that the elements of an obstruction of justice offense must be established by conduct set forth in the count of conviction and proven by at least a preponderance of the evidence in order for the court to depart upwardly pursuant to c,we now turn to the issue of whether count four of the which genao pleaded facts sufficient to establish a violation of either or.
section,entitled i nfluencing or injuring officer or juror generally,is violated whenever an individual 
corruptly endeavors to influence,intimidate,or impede any grand or petit juror,or officer in or of any court of the united states,or influences,obstructs,or impedes,or endeavors to influence,obstruct,or impede,the due administration of justice.
in united states aguilar,d,the supreme court interpreted.the court held that,in order to constitute a violation of,a defendant conduct must have some nexus,some relationship in time,causation,or logic to a judicial proceeding,so that the false statements have the natural and probable effect of interfering with that judicial proceeding.id.at.moreover,the court concluded that a defendant must have a specific intent to interfere with an actual judicial just to interfere with a federal investigation.id.applying this standard,it concluded we do not believe that uttering false statements to an investigating agent who might or might not testify before a grand jury is sufficient to make out a violation of the catchall provision of.id.at.
in united states schwarz,cir,we applied aguilar and held that,in order to violate,a defendant false statements must be made with the specific intent to obstruct the federal grand jury or another pending judicial proceeding.id.at.applying this test,we concluded that a defendant lack ed knowledge that his actions were likely to affect the judicial proceeding,and therefore lack ed the requisite intent to obstruct because he did not know that his statements would be conveyed to a federal grand jury and had not himself been called to testify before the grand jury.schwarz,at quoting aguilar,at.
we hold that the indictment in the instant case does not set forth a sufficient nexus between genao false statements and a federal judicial proceeding so as to establish a violation of.the indictment itself makes no mention of any grand jury or other judicial proceeding.moreover,even if we were able to consider conduct not specifically alleged in the indictment,the government argument would fail.genao agreed to waive his speedy trial rights so that the government could postpone filing an indictment until after his innocence proffers.genao was therefore aware at the time he made the relevant false statements that the government had not yet convened a grand jury to investigate his arrest for money laundering.indeed,no such grand jury was ever convened.accordingly,pursuant to aguilar and schwarz,genao false statements could not have been made with the specific intent to interfere with a judicial proceeding.
we also agree with the district court that the conduct set forth in count four of the indictment does not establish a violation of.section is entitled tampering with a witness,victim,or an informant.section b states 
b whoever knowingly uses intimidation or physical force,threatens or corruptly persuades another person,or attempts to do so,or engages in misleading conduct toward another person,with intent to
