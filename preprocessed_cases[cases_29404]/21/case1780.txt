frank barresi pled guilty to implicating falsely a united states citizen of pakistani descent in the terrorist attacks of september.the district court gershon,found an upward departure warranted.the court based on its decision both on the nonmonetary harms caused by the offense and its interference with government functions,neither of which is adequately taken into account in the sentencing guidelines.this determination is not challenged on appeal.in gauging the proper extent of departure,however,it appears that the court considered not only the degree of harm caused by the offense,but also barresi prior record and his lack of remorse.we hold that the district court erred in taking the latter two factors into account.accordingly,we remand for resentencing.
background 
on september,frank barresi telephoned the federal bureau of investigations fbi and suggested that the manager of the brooklyn store where his girlfriend worked might have been involved in the september terrorist attacks.barresi said that on september,the manager,who he said was middle eastern,had thrown something at barresi girlfriend and that when barresi had gone to the store to confront him,the manager had said i ca wait for you americans to die.
the fbi telephoned barresi on september.in that conversation barresi reported that the manager had said i ca wait for you americans to blow up and die and that the manager was known to hate americans.on september,an fbi agent questioned the manager,a citizen of pakistani descent,who said that on september,barresi had come to the store,had falsely represented that he was a corrections officer,and had physically threatened the manager.later that day,the same fbi agent interviewed barresi at his home.barresi initially repeated his accusation.but when told that the fbi had in its possession a recording of the september conversation this was a ruse,barresi recanted.he admitted that the manager had never made the statements and that he barresi had attempted to implicate the manager because of a personal vendetta.
the fbi arrested barresi on september,and charged him with violating a,knowingly and willfully making any materially false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement in a matter within the jurisdiction of the executive,legislative,or judicial branch of the government of the united states.barresi pled guilty on november and was sentenced on january.
at sentencing,the district court applied a base level of under,and then deducted levels for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to a.the resulting level,combined with barresi criminal history category iii,would have resulted in a month incarceration.the district court,however,exercised its discretion to depart upward.it added an additional levels,and sentenced barresi to months,the top of the resulting guidelines range.the court stated two reasons for its decision to depart.
first,it found that barresi false report had caused various agents to work on this investigation over a period of ten days,which foreseeably diverted the fbi from the enormous and almost incalculably important task of investigating the attacks of september and the danger of possible future attacks.the court therefore concluded that upward departure under,disruption of government function,was warranted.
second,the court determined that barresi offense not only had cost the fbi significant resources,but also had caused substantial nonmonetary harm to the store manager whom barresi had falsely implicated.in the presentencing report victim impact statement,the manager stated that he had been sick and unable to work for several days after the incident,that because of what barresi had said concerning others in the neighborhood,the manager was afraid to go outside his store,and that he and his wife had begun to discuss the possibility of moving back to pakistan.the court held that this harm to the manager,along with the harm to the fbi,reflected the kind of conduct addressed in application note of.that application note indicates that since a sentencing calculation focuses on monetary harms,an upward departure may be warranted where the monetary harm caused,if any,substantially understates the seriousness of the offense.the court found in particular that in barresi case,a primary objective of the offense was an aggravating,nonmonetary objective and the offense caused or risked substantial nonmonetary harm.cmt.
the district court specifically limited the grounds for its upward departure to the above provisions of the guidelines.thus the court stated that while which suggests departure for extreme psychological injury might be applicable,it was not in any way relying on that provision.it also said that it did not view barresi offense as a hate crime within the purview of,since barresi was apparently motivated by personal vendetta rather than by racial animus.the court,however,did emphasize the fact that barresi took advantage of the special vulnerability of this victim because of his ethnicity.
having determined that an upward departure was warranted,the district court next addressed the proper extent or magnitude of the departure.it emphasized first that it was taking into account two separate to the victim and one to the fbi.in addition,despite having awarded barresi two points for acceptance of responsibility,the court stated that barresi lacked remorse and held that this justified a greater upward departure.finally,the court considered the violent nature of barresi prior record and the fact that he has failed to learn from past punishment that he must obey the law.it is unclear from the transcript whether the court considered barresi prior record as a separate factor in determining the extent of upward departure or as evidence of barresi lack of remorse.at oral argument the government stated that the district court relied on barresi prior record as a separate factor.nevertheless,we will also examine the relevance of that prior record as evidence of a lack of remorse.
based on these considerations,the court increased the offense level from to and sentenced barresi to months in custody.on appeal,barresi does not object to the decision to depart upward,but challenges the magnitude of that departure.
discussion 
we review the district court decision to depart from the applicable guidelines range for abuse of discretion.united states riera,cir.we will affirm such a departure if the district court stated reasons for the departure,reviewed de novo,are of a kind or a degree not adequately considered by the sentencing commission and represent grounds that may appropriately be relied upon to justify the departure the factual findings underlying the reasons are not clearly erroneous and the extent of the departure is reasonable,giving due deference to the sentencing court.united states fei,cir.
barresi appeal raises challenges under all three headings.he argues that the district court relied on inappropriate considerations barresi criminal history and supposed lack of remorse in determining the magnitude of the upward departure that the court made clearly erroneous factual findings with respect to barresi lack of remorse in its decision and that the extent of departure was not reasonable,even accepting as legitimate the grounds articulated by the district court.
in deciding whether or not to depart from the range set by the sentencing guidelines,a court must make two separate determinations whether to depart and,if departure is warranted,how much to depart.
with respect to the first question,whether to depart at all,the law is well developed.the supreme court has established a framework for such decisions and the circuit courts,including this circuit,have filled in many of the details.see,koon united states,d united states bala,cir a court may consider imperfect entrapment in its decision to depart downwardly united states,cir a court may not depart downward based on the claim that prosecution policy led to disparate sentences in different districts united states contractor,cir defendant must receive notice of the grounds for an upward departure united states kim,cir in deciding whether to depart upward,a court may consider acts for
