arlex holguin holguin appeals from a judgment of conviction entered on september,in the united states district court for the district of connecticut janet bond arterton,judge,sentencing holguin principally to a term of imprisonment of sixty months for possessing with intent to distribute grams or more of a mixture and substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine.holguin argues that the district court erred in considering the united states sentencing guidelines guidelines mandatory for purposes of determining his criminal history and role under f,the safety valve statute,and that the district court violated his fifth and sixth amendment rights when it rejected his request for safety valve relief after finding,by a preponderance of the evidence,that role was that of a supervisor of jointly undertaken criminal activity.holguin also argues that,after united states booker,d,district courts must view as advisory the command in f that a court impose a sentence under the guidelines if it finds a defendant safety valve eligible.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
holguin was charged in a indictment with one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine count one and one count of possessing with intent to distribute grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine count two.on june,holguin pleaded guilty to count two pursuant to a plea agreement with the government.on september,the district court sentenced holguin to a term of imprisonment of sixty months,to be followed by a term of supervised release,and a special assessment of.holguin is currently serving his sentence.
holguin filed a timely notice of appeal on september.on january,holguin filed his appellate brief,arguing that the district court violated his sixth amendment right to a jury trial when it found,by a preponderance of the evidence,that holguin role was that of a supervisor of jointly undertaken criminal activity and therefore that holguin was ineligible for safety valve relief under f.on february,after the supreme court decided united states booker,d,the government moved for summary affirmance on the basis that holguin had received the mandatory minimum sentence of five years established by b b.on april,we denied the government motion,holding that full briefing was warranted on the continued viability of f,which mandates use of the united states sentencing guidelines,in light of the supreme court decision in booker.we then ordered supplemental briefing.
in holguin supplemental brief,he makes two main arguments.first,holguin argues that a sentencing court must view as advisory the requirement in f that it shall impose a sentence pursuant to the guidelines if it finds a defendant safety valve eligible,because booker held that mandatory application of the guidelines was impermissible in light of the sixth amendment.second,holguin argues that the mandate under f that courts make certain guideline determinations as a prerequisite to safety valve eligibility,likewise,can no longer stand in light of the now wholly advisory nature of the guidelines.according to holguin,the provisions of f that require a court to make determinations pursuant to the,that require a court to confirm that the defendant does not have more than criminal history point,as determined under the sentencing guidelines,f,and that the defendant was not an organizer,leader,manager,or supervisor of others in the offense,as determined under the sentencing guidelines,f should be deemed advisory after booker because the supreme court struck down the mandatory nature of the guidelines in booker.indeed,holguin argues,congress created f at a time when there was no question that the sentencing guidelines dictated federal sentencing,and congress intended the statute to operate within the framework of the guidelines.accordingly,holguin argues,district courts should now be able to sentence a defendant below the statutory mandatory minimum regardless of these provisions,where a defendant has more than one criminal history point was an organizer,leader,supervisor of the offense.
holguin also makes two related arguments under the fifth and sixth amendments.first,he argues,the district court violated his constitutional rights when it determined,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he was a supervisor in the offense of conviction because that fact was essential to his punishment inasmuch as it eliminate d the possibility of a lower sentence for him.holguin theorizes that a minimum sentence is not mandatory unless it is first determined that the defendant is ineligible for safety valve relief under f.therefore,according to holguin,his sentencing range before the safety valve finding was zero to forty years,and the district court decision to deny him relief based on its finding as to supervisory role increased his range from zero to forty years to five to forty years,in violation of the fifth and sixth amendments.
holguin argues in the alternative that his sentence violates the sixth amendment and ex post facto principles because the guidelines maximum,rather than the statutory maximum,was the relevant maximum at the time of his sentencing and he was sentenced beyond this maximum based on facts not admitted or found by a jury.according to holguin,b ecause the guidelines were mandatory at the time he was sentenced,and the top of his guideline range was below the mandatory minimum,the district court factual finding that he was a supervisor of others in the offense raised his sentence in violation of his constitutional rights.
in response to holguin arguments,the government agrees that the command in f that a district court shall impose a sentence pursuant to the guidelines should be interpreted to mean that a district court must consider the guidelines in an advisory fashion when sentencing a defendant after finding him safety valve eligible under the statute.the government disagrees,however,that the remaining references to the guidelines in subsections f and need be excised or read as advisory.according to the government,judicial in connection with those guidelines calculations is permitted under f because the only effect of the judge findings is to potentially reduce a defendant sentence,not to increase it.therefore,the government argues,subsections f and need not be read as advisory,and the district court did not violate holguin fifth or sixth amendment rights by finding facts as to holguin role and criminal history by a preponderance of the evidence in denying safety valve relief.
the government also argues that,to the extent holguin claims that the sixth amendment bars a district court from making factual findings as to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence,this claim is foreclosed by harris united states,d.finally,the government argues that the district court did not violate holguin constitutional rights by imposing the mandatory minimum sentence because the relevant maximum is not the top of the guidelines range,but rather,the years established by b b.the government argues that although holguin is correct that the guidelines were mandatory at the time of his sentencing,the supreme court has made clear that both of its holdings in booker were to apply retroactively to all cases on direct review,and there is no ex post facto problem because the change of the guidelines from mandatory to advisory was the result of judicial decisionmaking,not a law of congress.
discussion 
title,section f of the united states code,known as the safety valve statute,provides that district courts may impose sentences below the statutory mandatory minimums set forth in,and,if certain factors are present.f.specifically,a district court may sentence a defendant without regard to the statutory minimum in such cases if the defendant does not have more than one criminal history point under the guidelines the defendant did not use violence,a credible threat of violence,or did not possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon or induce another to do so in connect
