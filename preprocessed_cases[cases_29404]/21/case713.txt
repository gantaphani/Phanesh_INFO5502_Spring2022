in gall united states,d,the supreme court shed considerable light on the scope and extent of a district court discretion under the federal sentencing guidelines.see id.at.this appeal represents our first application of the teachings of gall.at the same time,it also affords us an opportunity to discuss a relatively new phenomenon the practice indulged in by some district courts,of filing,sentencing memoranda.
the circumstances are as follows.robert martin pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to distribute more than but less than grams of cocaine base crack cocaine in violation of.in the presentence investigation report psi report,the probation office set his base offense level under the federal sentencing guidelines at,and adjusted it downward to to take account of his acceptance of responsibility.see ussg.the defendant had eight prior convictions,yielding a criminal history score of that placed him in criminal history category vi.his guideline sentencing range gsr was,therefore,months.
in this case,that calculation was trumped by the defendant career offender status.see ussg see also united states jimenez,cir discussing potential trumping effect of career offender calculation.that designation,based on six of his prior convictions,yielded an enhanced gsr of months.
at the disposition hearing,the defendant moved for a downward departure or,premised on a a sentence beneath the gsr.specifically,he asked the court to sentence him to the statutory minimum.see b b.
in support of so steep a variance,the defendant argued that his criminal history score overrepresented the seriousness of his previous convictions because several of them were remote in time,one was for a misdemeanor,and others involved mitigating circumstances.he also argued that a variance was warranted because of his difficult childhood the supportive role of his wife,children,and stepchildren his newfound religious faith and his potential for rehabilitation.finally,he pointed out that a number of his codefendants had received variant,sentences.
the government responded that the defendant family circumstances were commonplace that his criminal record was a matter of great concern and that his persistent recidivism reflected scant hope for rehabilitation.given these realities,the government urged the lower court to impose a sentence of months.
the court adopted the guidelines calculations limned in the psi report with one exception having found that the defendant criminal history score overstated the seriousness of his felonious past,the court rolled back his criminal history category from vi to v.this downward departure yielded a new career offender sentencing range of months.the court then imposed a incarcerative sentence a full months below the nadir of the recalculated sentencing range.the court explained 
i ca justify going down to the sentence of ten years but i going to impose a sentence of months which is a sentence.it a tremendously tough sentence.it a tremendously tough sentence for martin to have to serve,and i think that the sentence is fully responsive to all the criteria set forth at section.it brings home the seriousness of the offense and properly addresses it.
it acts as a deterrent to others who might be tempted to step on the path that martin walked down.it responds to the specific circumstances of this case,and i believe that the sentence does recognize the positive things about martin,and i have in mind particularly the close relationship he has with his family who are here today and how important that relationship is.it really makes a difference to me to have people here showing their support for him.
i also believe that martin has demonstrated an unusually strong commitment to a life and i do believe that when he is released from prison and after he has served his very difficult sentence,he will stay on the right path and be the sort of person that he now wants to be.
i also believe that a sentence will bring his sentence in line with the sentences that i imposing on people who are in equivalent positions to martin and i have that in mind as another reason for going outside the guidelines here.
so in summary the close family relationships,the support of the family,martin own qualities which i think he expressed very well in his statement,and thirdly,to bring the sentence in line with other defendants i sentencing in this same very,very destructive drug conspiracy i will impose that sentence.
in its written statement of reasons in support of the sentence,see c,the court referenced a and stated that it was imposing a sentence due to the defendant close family ties and support the defendant personal qualities,and to be in line with the sentences being imposed on codefendants in this matter.
the government filed a timely notice of appeal.while that appeal was pending and almost one year after it pronounced sentence and entered judgment,the district court issued a supplemental memorandum the memorandum that it described as intended to distill more concisely the reasoning that underlay the sentence.the memorandum vouchsafed that the sentence had been based principally on four elements.first,the defendant had unusually strong support from his family.second,his expressions of remorse were unusually sincere and reliable.third,there was an unusually low likelihood of recidivism.fourth,the defendant was responsible for a significant but not overwhelming amount of drugs,and the sentence actually imposed was comparable to those imposed on other similarly situated coconspirators.
that was the state of the record when this appeal was argued on september.we withheld decision in anticipation that the supreme court shortly would revisit the sentencing guidelines and speak authoritatively to the relationship among them,the district court discretion informed by the section a factors,and the sentence actually imposed.that expectation was rewarded in gall,a decision that warrants some elaboration.
after pleading guilty to a charge,gall faced a gsr of months.at.the district court,taking account of several section a age,voluntary withdrawal from the charged conspiracy,familial support,and apparent hard time and imposed a probationary sentence.id.at.the court of appeals vacated the judgment,terming the sentence unreasonable and stressing that the sentence comprised a downward variance from the gsr.id.at quoting united states gall,cir.
the supreme court reinstated the sentence.see id.at.in so doing,the justices emphasized the broad sweep of a sentencing court discretion in the wake of the decision in united states booker,d,which rendered the federal sentencing guidelines advisory.see gall.at.
the gall court was careful not to throw out the baby with the bath water.the court acknowledged that the guidelines deserve some weight in the sentencing calculus,as they are the product of careful study based on extensive empirical evidence derived from the review of thousands of individual sentencing decisions.id.at.it made clear,though,that courts of appeals must grant district courts wide latitude in making individualized sentencing determinations,thus guarding against the institutionalization of an impermissible presumption that sentences are unreasonable.id.at.
to help navigate the strait between guidance and discretion,the gall court laid out a sequence of steps for sentencing courts to follow.a sentencing determination should begin with the calculation of the particular defendant gsr.as a final step in arriving at a defendant gsr,the district court must assess the appropriateness vel non of any departures see united states dixon,cir.
properly calibrated,the gsr should serve as the sentencing court starting point or initial benchmark.gall.at.nevertheless,the guidelines are only advisory,see booker,at,and the sentencing court may not mechanically assume that the gsr frames the boundaries of a reasonable sentence in every case.see gall.at.
the sentencing court next steps should include hearing argument from the parties as to the proper sentence in the particular case,weighing the applicability of the sundry factors delineated in a,reaching an ultimate sentencing determination,and explicating that decision on the record.see gall.at.this progressive sequence was adumbrated in our,jurisprudence.see,dixon,at united states,cir en banc.
this sequencing necessitates a approach,the hallmark of which is flexibility.in the last analysis,a sentencing court should not consider itself constrained by the guidelines to the extent that there are sound,reasons for deviating from them.nor should a sentencing court operate in the belief that substantial variances from the guidelines are always beyond the pale.rather,the court should consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate,sometimes magnify,the crime and the punishment to ensue.gall.at.
of course,the fact that a sentencing court possesses the raw power to deviate from the guidelines does not mean that it can or should do so casually.the court reasons for deviation should typically be rooted either in the nature and circumstances of the offense or the characteristics of the offender must add up to a plausible rationale and must justify a variance of the magnitude in question.see,united states scherrer,cir en banc,at.moreover,a certain sliding scale effect lurks in the penumbra of modern federal sentencing law the guidelines are the starting point for the fashioning of an individualized sentence,so a major deviation from them must be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.gall.at.
we hasten to add,however,that notwithstanding this need for an increased degree of justification commensurate with an increased degree of variance,there is no stringent mathematical formula that cabins the exercise of the sentencing court discretion.see id.at.indeed,after gall the sentencing the court has duly calculated the is broad,and significantly discretionary.united states,cir en banc.at that point,sentencing becomes a judgment call,and a variant sentence may be constructed based on a complex of factors whose interplay and precise weight can not even be precisely described.id.at.
gall also speaks to the principles that inform appellate review of sentencing determinations.a corollary of the broad discretion that gall reposes in the district courts is the respectful deference that appellate courts must accord district courts sentencing decisions.thus,the court of appeals must review the sentence actually imposed under a deferential standard.gall.at.in that endeavor,it must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error,such as failing to calculate or improperly calculating the guidelines range,treating the guidelines as mandatory,failing to consider the a factors,selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts,or failing to adequately explain the chosen an explanation for any deviation from the guidelines range.id.at.
once the appellate court has satisfied itself that the sentence is procedurally sound,it must proceed,under the same abuse of discretion rubric,to review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence,taking into account the totality of the circumstances.id.when the sentence is outside the gsr,the appellate court is obliged to consider the extent of the variance,but even in that posture it must give due deference to the district court decision that the a factors,on a whole,justify the extent of the variance.id.that is because the sentencing court possesses a number of institutional advantages,including a superior coign of vantage,greater familiarity with the individual case,the opportunity to see and hear the principals and the testimony at first hand,and the cumulative experience garnered through the sheer number of district court sentencing proceedings that take place day by day.id.at.
with this preface,we return to the case at hand.the government makes no claim that the district court committed any procedural error either prior to or in the course of imposing sentence.accordingly,our review is limited to the substantive reasonableness of the sentence actually imposed in probing that point,we remain mindful of two abecedarian truths.
first,because we can not desultorily substitute our judgment for that of the sentencing court,it is not a basis for reversal that we,if sitting as a court of first instance,would have sentenced the defendant differently.second,reasonableness is a protean concept,not an absolute.we think it follows that there is not a single reasonable sentence but,rather,a range of reasonable sentences.see dixon,at.consequently,reversal will result only sentencing court ultimate determination falls outside the expansive boundaries of that universe.
in considering objections to a sentence substantive reasonableness,we examine the district court contemporaneous oral explanation of the sentence,c,its written statement of reasons,id.c,and what fairly can be gleaned by comparing what was argued by the parties or proffered in the psi report with what the sentencing court ultimately did,see,at at the disposition hearing in this case,the district court emphasized that it grounded the sentence on three considerations the support that the defendant stood to receive from his family,personal qualities indicating his potential for rehabilitation,and a perceived need to avoid disparity arising out of the length of the defendant sentence relative to coconspirators sentences.the government asserts that these proffered reasons,whether taken singly or in combination,can not justify the district court deviation.
we begin our assessment of these reasons with the defendant family circumstances.the record is replete with letters from family and friends attesting to the defendant virtues as a father,and the district court had the opportunity to see the devotion of the defendant family members in person.the government seemingly grants that this ground,like every other ground on which the district court relied,is supported by the record.but in an effort to blunt the force of this showing,the government points out that the policy statements incorporated within the guidelines generally discourage the consideration of family circumstances in sentencing decisions.see,ussg.
policy statements issued by the sentencing commission are,of course,pertinent to sentencing determinations even under the guidelines.see a see also united states,cir.nevertheless,such policy statements normally are not decisive as to what may constitute a permissible ground for a variant sentence in a given case.see united states simmons,cir united states rivera,cir united states smith,cir see also kimbrough united states,d a s a general matter,courts may vary from guidelines ranges based solely on policy considerations,including disagreements with the guidelines.internal quotation marks omitted.a district court therefore may take idiosyncratic family circumstances into account,at least to some extent,in fashioning a variant sentence.see,united states grossman,cir united states lehmann,cir united states pauley,cir.
the potential for rehabilitation also may comprise grist for the sentencing court mill.to be sure,there are valid reasons for regarding professions of rehabilitation skeptically.see united states bogdan,cir it is not uncommon for defendants to discover the virtues of introspection and remorse when facing the threat of punishment.but separating wheat from chaff is primarily a task for the district court,and a founded prospect of meaningful rehabilitation remains a permissible basis for a variant sentence under the guidelines.see a c the court shall consider the need for the sentence imposed to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.see also smith,at.
should one credit the district court the standard of review inclines us in that defendant here made a particularly striking impression two years of incarceration prior to sentencing let him see the error of his former ways,renounce them,and embrace a renewed commitment to religion and family.when this metamorphosis is combined with the reciprocal commitment exhibited by his family,the likelihood of meaningful rehabilitation rises to a level meriting some weight in the section a calculus.see,united states phinazee,cir gro
