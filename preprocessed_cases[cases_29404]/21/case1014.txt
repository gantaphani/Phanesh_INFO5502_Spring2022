in these consolidated appeals,two participants in a mindless carjacking and double homicide strive to convince us that the district court sentenced them more onerously than the law permits.after a painstaking review of the record,we find that the sentencing court committed no reversible error.consequently,we leave the appellants sentences intact.

because the disputed sentences were imposed following admissions of guilt,we glean the material facts from the colloquies,the presentence investigation reports psi reports,and the transcripts of the disposition hearings.united states brewster,cir united states dietz,cir.those facts paint a grisly picture.
on the evening of june,samuel sanchez,raymond anderson,and three other men carjacked jason burgeson and amy shute at gunpoint.after confronting the pair in downtown providence,the malefactors appropriated their vehicle,drove in caravan style to a secluded area,murdered the abducted couple in cold blood,and took what little cash they had.the brutal crime attracted immediate attention and the authorities quickly rounded up five suspects.

each appellant advances three assignments of error.sanchez challenges the district court denial of a downward adjustment,its rejection of his entreaty for a downward departure,and its decision to depart upward.anderson also challenges the district court denial of a favorable adjustment and its refusal to grant a downward departure based on his state of mind at the time of the homicides.in addition,he questions the calculation of his criminal history score and,thus,his chc.we treat the common and downward departure issues first.we then address sanchez objection to the district court upward departure and anderson complaint about the supposedly unwarranted inflation of his criminal history score.
ii.role in the offense 
we begin with the appellants claims that they deserved reductions because they were minor participants in the offenses of conviction.a defendant who seeks a downward role adjustment must bear the burden of proof on that issue.united states ocasio,cir.the ensuing to reduce the defendant offense level due to his minor or minimal role in the an inquiry heavily driven by the facts.see united states cruz,cir en banc ussg,cmt.c.because the sentencing court has a superior coign of vantage,we must defer to its findings of fact unless those findings are clearly erroneous.ocasio,at.if a set of facts can lead plausibly to competing inferences,the sentencing court choice among them can not be termed a clear error.cruz,at united states ruiz,cir.
collectively,these standards are not.recognizing that reality,we have warned that absent a mistake of law,battles over a defendant status will almost always be won or lost in the district court.united states graciani,cir.
sanchez role in the offense.
sanchez asserts that he neither introduced nor used the murder weapon,eschewed any participation in the robbery of the victims,and never threatened to rape shute.on this basis,he argues that he was less culpable than his coconspirators and therefore deserving of a downward adjustment as a minor participant.ussg b.the district court rejected this assertion,and so do we.
the sentencing commission has explained that section provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.id,cmt.a.the roster of available adjustments includes a modest adjustment for minor participation and a somewhat more generous adjustment for minimal participation.id.we have ruled that a defendant who aspires to be classified as a minor participant bears the burden of proving that he is both i less culpable than most other participants in the offenses of conviction,and ii less culpable than the average miscreant involved in offenses of the same genre.see united states,cir ocasio,at.sanchez can not conceivably run that gauntlet.
we need not tarry.sanchez effectively admitted during the colloquy that he furnished the car used in committing the crimes,drove his comrades around downtown providence in search of victims,held himself available as a getaway driver should the attempted carjacking go awry,suggested where to take the victims following their abduction,searched the carjacked vehicle for valuables,and used some of the appropriated cash.he also admitted that other participants would testify that he urged one of his companions floyd to shoot the victims and that he offered to kill them himself should floyd balk.given this scenario,it beggars credulity to think that sanchez could qualify as a minor participant in the criminal activity.consequently,we discern no error,clear or otherwise,in the sentencing court denial of his request for a role reduction.
anderson role in the offense.
anderson claim that he deserved a reduction as a minor participant is somewhat more credible.he begins with the sentencing court comment,voiced during the disposition hearing,that h e was the least culpable of the gang because he did participate in the actual shooting,and he did urge or demand that these innocent young people be killed.this might be thought faint praise,but we assume,for argument sake,that it constitutes a finding sufficient to satisfy the first prong of the test for minor participation.
although anderson pleaded guilty both to conspiracy to commit carjacking and to carjacking resulting in death,the relevant charge for the comparative analysis required by the second prong of the minor participant test is carjacking resulting in death.jones united states,d holding that defines three distinct carjacking,carjacking resulting in serious bodily injury,and carjacking resulting in death.in an effort to satisfy this prong,anderson points to the sentencing court explicit finding that he lacked an intent to kill and concludes that he must perforce be less culpable than the average felon convicted of carjacking resulting in death.this conclusion does not follow from the indicated premise whether a carjacker did a subjective intent to kill is not a fact of talismanic significance to a decision in a case of carjacking resulting in death.regardless of the lack of an intent to kill,the instant record contains ample evidence from which the sentencing court reasonably could have concluded that anderson was no less culpable than the average defendant convicted of that offense.
on this record,a rational trier easily could have found that anderson recruited an accomplice sanchez who made available the car used in committing the crimes that he accompanied his coconspirators on their prowl through downtown providence as they hunted for potential victims that he served as a lookout while the group abducted not one but two innocent young people that he ordered the victims to exit the carjacked vehicle once the caravan had reached the murder site that he removed jewelry from shute person just prior to her execution and that he expressed no disapproval when his compatriots discussed the desirability of murdering the victims.given anderson continuous presence and his willing participation in the aforedescribed events,the lower court plausibly could have inferred,from the totality of the circumstances,that he had failed to prove his entitlement to a minor participation credit.see,united states,cir finding no clear error in denial of minor role adjustment when defendant participated in planning the carjacking,drove around with two coconspirators for several hours searching for a likely victim,approached the chosen victim with an armed associate,and drove the carjacked vehicle from the scene despite having heard the fatal gunshot.we conclude,therefore,that the sentencing court denial of a downward adjustment was not clearly erroneous.
iii.downward departures 
each appellant sought the benefit of a guideline provision application note that authorizes a downward departure from the base offense level mandated by the first degree murder i f the defendant did not cause the death intentionally or knowingly.ussg,cmt.the district court rejected these requests although it granted anderson a downward departure on other grounds,see supra.the appellants attempt to challenge these rejections.that is easier said than done.
as a general rule,a sentencing court discretionary refusal to depart is unreviewable.see,united states teeter,cir united states pierro,cir.at first blush,that rule would seem to apply here because the decision whether to grant a departure pursuant to application note appended to section lies completely within the discretion of the sentencing court.see teeter,at see also ussg,cmt.explaining that downward departure may be warranted emphasis supplied.but this general most general of certain exceptions.one such exception covers cases in which the sentencing court misapprehends its authority to depart.see teeter,at united states gifford,cir.
each appellant endeavors to fit his case within the narrow confines of this exception.as we explain below,neither succeeds.
sanchez departure request.
sanchez starts by adverting to case law that requires trial courts to analyze a defendant mental state after determining that section applies.see,united states carr,cir,cert.denied,d united states prevatte,cir.using these cases as a springboard,he seeks to drape the denial of his departure request in the raiment of reviewability by insisting that the sentencing court failure to make a detailed determination of his state of mind at the time of the slayings demonstrated a misapprehension of its power to depart.this argument does little to persuade us that the sentencing court was unaware of its authority.
if the district court had granted a downward departure on the basis of application note,it would have had to factor in the defendant state of mind to assess the extent of the departure.see ussg,cmt.explaining that if a departure is granted,the sentencing court should base its extent,inter alia,upon the defendant state of mind.but no such direction is provided as to the underlying decision to here,the district court denied the departure request.thus,the issue is not what analysis the district court made,but,rather,whether it was required to make particularized findings at all.we think not.
in general,sentencing courts are under no obligation to make specific findings when denying departure requests.see united states decosta,cir explaining that the district court is not required to give reasons for refusing to depart.we agree with the tenth circuit that this precept extends with undiminished force to the denial of an application note departure.see united states nichols,cir concluding that n othing in ussg requires a district court to make any findings when deciding whether to depart.indeed,we held as much,albeit in an unpublished opinion,in united states,cir table,in which we ruled that the sentencing court was under no duty to analyze the factors set forth in application note to justify its discretionary decision not to depart from the guidelines 
that holding undermines sanchez argument.because the district court had no obligation to make specific findings,we can not interpret the absence of a detailed discussion of sanchez state of mind as an indication that the court misunderstood its discretionary powers.see united states grandmaison,cir explaining that mere ambiguity in the sentencing record is insufficient to render the court refusal to depart reviewable on appeal.
in all events,we must consider the whole of the record when determining whether a sentencing court misapprehended its authority to depart.see united states deleon,cir united states morrison,cir gifford,at.here,the district court supportably found that sanchez had urged floyd to shoot the victims and had offered to kill them himself if floyd faltered.at least implicit in those findings was the court conclusion that sanchez had an intent to kill and,consequently,that he was ineligible for the desired departure.viewed in this light,it can not be said that the sentencing court misunderstood its authority.therefore,we do not have jurisdiction to review sanchez assignment of error.see teeter,at w e lack jurisdiction to review the court refusal to invoke application note unless there is some reason to believe that the court misunderstood its options.
anderson departure request.
to characterize his case as one in which the district court misperceived the extent of its authority to depart under application note.specifically,anderson spotlights the sentencing court statement that h e did have an intent to kill and complains that the court failed to realize that this finding paved the way for a possible downward departure.to prove his point,anderson singles out a passage from the transcript of the disposition hearing,in which the judge explained 
the defendant argues that he should have a total offense level of because he had no intent to kill.but as i just indicated,he is charged with that intent because he is an aider and abettor,and whether it considered a second degree murder or a first degree murder,if it was tried in the state courts the fact of the matter is that he was an accessory before the fact of murder in this case.so the total offense level of is correct.
in anderson view,this rationale reveals the court total unfamiliarity with the authority granted to it by application note.
anderson argument elevates hope over reason.the sentencing court attempt to explain why it chose not to depart,despite anderson perceived lack of an intent to kill,was not especially what is conspicuously absent from the quoted passage is any indication that the court felt constrained in its ability to depart.application note gives the sentencing court discretion to depart or not,as the court sees fit,if it finds that a given defendant did not cause the death intentionally or knowingly.on a fair reading of the court comments in this case,it seems highly likely that the court was looking to analogous state criminal law for guidance on how to exercise that discretion.the fact that the court had recognized its authority to depart under the rubric at sanchez just six days this conclusion.we therefore dismiss anderson assignment of error as unreviewable.see teeter,at.
iv.the upward departure 
at sentencing,the district court ruled that sanchez case fell outside the heartland of comparable carjacking cases and determined that a upward departure was appropriate.the court based this determination on five factors death resulting,abduction,use of a weapon,extreme conduct,and criminal purpose.each of these is a,an for a departure.see ussg death resulting,abduction,use of a weapon,extreme conduct,criminal purpose see generally koon united states,d encouraged factors are those the sentencing commission has not been able to take into account fully in formulating the guidelines.quoting ussg.if the sentencing court finds an encouraged factor in a particular case,the court is authorized to depart if the applicable guideline does not already take it into account.koon,at.
sanchez assigns error to the departure decision,insisting i that the court consideration of these five factors constituted double counting,and ii that,in all events,their application was unwarranted in his case.we disagree with these allegations.
before addressing sanchez claims,we comment briefly upon the standard of review.the law is currently unsettled as to whether the protect act,stat,to be codified at e,applies to departure decisions made prior to april,the act effective date thus,our standard of review is in doubt.compare id.directing de novo review of departure decisions,with united states dethlefs,cir describing more deferential act standard of review.here,however,we would affirm the district court departure decision under either standard,and so we leave the question unresolved.
double counting.
sanchez first that the departure factors relied upon by the district court were already adequately taken into account,either as specific offense characteristics or as other adjustments,in determining his gsr.we are fully satisfied that the sentencing court did not engage in any double counting when it considered four of the five,use of a weapon,extreme conduct,and criminal purpose as grounds for an upward departure.we explain briefly.
sanchez makes no coherent argument as to why the sentencing court use of extreme conduct or criminal purpose in the departure calculus would constitute double counting.in contrast,his argument as to abduction and use of a weapon is coherent but unavailing.it hinges on the fact that the carjacking guideline is derived from,and generally congruent with,the guideline for robbery.see ussg.seizing on this congruence,sanchez notes that the guideline for robbery allows for the consideration of abduction and use of a weapon when calculating a defendant base offense level.see id.b.
it does not follow,however,that abduction and use of a weapon are already taken into account in carjacking cases in which the murder enhancement applies.once a court decides upon the applicability of the first degree murder,id.c,proper procedure requires it to ignore the specific offense characteristics listed under the robbery guideline and move directly to ussg.the sentencing court followed this protocol in sanchez case.consequently,there was no double counting.
this leaves the sentencing court application of the death resulting factor.it is at least arguable that this can be construed as double counting the court might already have provided an enhancement for the fact that the carjacking resulted in death when it followed the instructions found in ussg c and applied the first degree murder.see united states barber,cir suggesting that the first degree murder guideline already takes into account the fact that death resulted.
this logic is not defeated by the fact that sentencing courts are authorized,in certain circumstances,to depart from the guidelines even though the reason for departure has been taken into consideration as a specific offense characteristic or other adjustment.that authorization is limited to situations in which the court determines that,in light of unusual circumstances,the weight attached to the relevant factor under the guidelines is inadequate.ussg.it would be surpassingly difficult to contend that the first degree murder which raised sanchez offense level to maximum contemplated by the sentencing guidelines attributed inadequate weight to the victims deaths.
of course,this case is different in the sense that two just slain.that distinguishing characteristic might very well suffice to counter the charge of double counting.courts may consider whether the crime resulted in multiple deaths when determining the extent of a departure,see id,and,by analogy,it would seem sensible to allow consideration of that fact in determining whether to depart at all.moreover,sanchez would have received the same base offense level had the carjacking resulted in only one death,so it might well be said that the first degree murder failed to take the second death into account.these considerations would tend to justify departing upward.united states menzer,cir using similar reasoning to support an upward departure in light of the arson guideline second degree murder.
in the last analysis,however,we need not resolve this question.even if the sentencing court engaged in double counting with regard to the death resulting matter that we do not departure as a whole would be sustainable.we have said in the past that 
a departure which rests on a combination of valid and invalid grounds may be affirmed so long as the direction and degree of the departure are reasonable in relation to the remaining valid ground,excision of the improper ground does not obscure or defeat the expressed reasoning of the district court,and the reviewing court is left,on the record as a whole,with the definite and firm conviction that removal of the inappropriate ground would not be likely to alter the district court view of the sentence rightfully to be imposed.
united states,cir see also williams united states,d,at.these requirements are fully satisfied here.
in this instance,the four remaining factors cited by the sentencing court provide ample justification for the relatively moderate upward departure.notwithstanding sanchez hyperbolic efforts to classify the extent of the departure as unreasonable,we previously have affirmed similar and even significantly larger departures,including departures based upon analogous circumstances.see,united states,cir per curiam affirming a departure from level to level due to the sordid facts in a carjacking case see also united states chapman,cir collecting first circuit cases affirming departures ranging up to as to the final element of the test,the district court made abundantly clear its belief that the only appropriate sentencing outcome for sanchez was life imprisonment.the claim is,therefore,impuissant.
sufficiency of the evidence.
next,sanchez argues that whether or not these five factors were legally available,they were factually unsupported and,thus,should not have figured in the departure calculus.this is whistling past the graveyard the record contains more than enough evidence to justify the use of each of the five factors.
a detailed exegesis would serve no useful purpose.the short of it is that the victims were abducted at gunpoint and transported to a secluded location,where they were psychologically tormented for a period of time before being murdered in order to protect the identities of the perpetrators.against this grim backdrop,only two of sanchez subsidiary arguments merit further discussion.
first,sanchez asseverates that the use of a weapon factor does not apply because he never actually used the gun.this asseveration rings hollow.the relevant guideline provision refers to the use or possession of a weapon in the commission of the offense.ussg.to warrant the application of this provision,it ordinarily suffices that the defendant and the shooter are convicted as coconspirators.see united states connor,cir indicating that section will be available where the possessor of the gun and the defendant are coconspirators,the possessor of the gun possessed it in furtherance of the conspiracy,and the defendant was a member of the conspiracy at the time of the possession of the gun.
second,sanchez makes a determined assault on the sentencing court use of the death resulting datum.sanchez attack rests essentially on two facts that sanchez himself neither seized control of the victims car nor pulled the trigger.these facts are true as far as they go,but they do not take sanchez very far.his argument unrealistically discounts his actual participation in the criminal activity.as supportably found by the sentencing court,sanchez,among other things,served a critical function as an available getaway d
