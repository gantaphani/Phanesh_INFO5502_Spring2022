appellants franklin thompson and lamar gibson appeal the district court denial of their c motions for sentence reduction section c permits a district court to exercise its discretion to reduce a sentence only if the sentence is based on a guidelines range that has subsequently been lowered and a sentence reduction would be consistent with the sentencing commission policy statements.c.
the sentencing commission policy statement applicable here prohibits a district court from reducing a defendant sentence unless a subsequent amendment to the guidelines lowers the defendant applicable guideline range.a b.in,the sentencing commission promulgated amendment,which amended the application notes to to make clear that a defendant applicable guideline range is to be determined before any departures and variances.see app.c,amend,cmt.a.
appellants argue that they satisfy the first prong of c because their sentences were based on guidelines ranges calculated using the base offense levels in the drug quantity table in guidelines.even if they are correct,amendment forecloses relief for appellants,under the second prong of c,because their applicable guideline ranges were calculated using the base offense levels for career offenders in guidelines,which have not been lowered.appellants argue that,since amendment came into effect after they committed their crimes,amendment is an invalid ex post facto law.
we now hold that,although appellants sentences were based on guidelines ranges calculated under,amendment is not an ex post facto law and operates to bar a sentence reduction for appellants.we will therefore affirm the district court judgment in both cases denying appellants motions for sentence reduction.
background 
appellants were both indicted in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania for drug offenses.gibson pled guilty in and thompson pled guilty in 
gibson sentencing 
at gibson sentencing hearing,the district court concluded that gibson was a career offender within the meaning of and determined that the base offense levels for career offenders in the career offender guidelines applied.the district court calculated gibson career offender guidelines range to be to months of imprisonment 
however,the government explained at the hearing that it did not oppose a downward departure from the career offender guidelines range because gibson had agreed to be sentenced at the high end of the otherwise applicable guideline range,the guidelines range calculated using the base offense levels from the drug quantity table in the drug guidelines.gibson app.the district court calculated gibson drug guidelines range to be to months of imprisonment 
pursuant to the parties request,the district court departed downwards from the career offender guidelines range and sentenced gibson to months of imprisonment the top end of his drug guidelines range.
thompson sentencing 
at thompson sentencing hearing,the district court similarly concluded that thompson was a career offender within the meaning of and determined that the career offender guidelines applied.the district court calculated thompson career offender guidelines range to be to months of imprisonment 
however,the parties requested at the hearing that the district court sentence thompson pursuant to a rule c b plea agreement.see fed.crim.c b.in thompson plea agreement,t he parties agree d that a variance from the otherwise applicable career offender guidelines was warranted.thompson app.accordingly,the plea agreement calculated the agreed upon guidelines range of to months of imprisonment using the pertinent base offense level from the drug guidelines the parties agreed in the plea agreement that the appropriate term of imprisonment was months the midpoint of thompson drug guidelines range.thompson app.
pursuant to the parties request,the district court varied downwards from the career offender guidelines range and imposed a sentence of months of imprisonment.the district court statement of reasons makes clear that the sentence was imposed pursuant to the parties plea agreement.
guidelines amendments 
in,after appellants were sentenced,the sentencing commission promulgated amendment to the guidelines,which included an amendment to the application notes to the policy statement in.see app.c,amend.section provides that a district court is not authorized to reduce a sentence under c unless an amendment to the guidelines has the effect of lowering the defendant applicable guideline range.a b emphasis added.
to resolve a split among the courts of appeals as to whether a defendant applicable guideline range should be determined before or after any departures and variances,the amendment to the application notes defined the phrase applicable guideline range in to be the guideline range that corresponds to the offense level and criminal history category determined before consideration of any departure provision in the guidelines manual or any variance.app.c,amend,emphasis added cmt.a emphasis added see united states pleasant,cir.the amended application notes thus preclude a defendant from obtaining a c sentence reduction if he has been designated a career offender but was actually sentenced within a offender guidelines range based on a departure or variance.see united states flemming flemming iii,cir.
several years later,in,the sentencing commission promulgated amendment to the guidelines,which retroactively reduced by two levels the base offense levels assigned to many drug quantities in the drug guidelines,including the drug quantities associated with appellants offenses.see app.c,amend.supp,app.c,amend.supp.believing that their sentences were determined by the drug guidelines,appellants filed c motions for sentence reduction pursuant to the amendment lowering the drug guidelines.
consistent with the sentencing commission policy statement,the district court concluded that appellants gibson,thompson applicable guideline ranges were their career offender guidelines ranges,which had not been affected by amendment.accordingly,the district court denied appellants motions for sentence reduction.these appeals followed.
ii.jurisdiction and standard of review 
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to.we have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to.our review over a district court decision to grant or deny a motion for sentence reduction is typically for abuse of discretion.united states mateo,cir.however,in this case,we exercise plenary review because we are presented with legal questions concerning the proper interpretation of the sentencing guidelines,united states edwards,cir,and an ex post facto challenge to the guidelines,united states audinot,cir.
iii.analysis 
a district court is authorized under c to exercise its discretion to reduce a sentence only where two requirements are satisfied.united states flemming flemming ii,cir.first,the sentence must have been based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the sentencing commission.c.second,the sentence reduction must be consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.id.we address each requirement in turn and conclude that,although appellants meet the first requirement,they can not meet the second.
were appellants sentences based on their drug guidelines ranges 
appellants argue that they meet the first requirement under c because their sentences were based on guidelines ranges calculated using the drug guidelines in,which were subsequently lowered by amendment.see app.c,amend.supp.the government responds by pointing us to the district court designation of both appellants as career offenders subject to the career offender guidelines in.
our decision in flemming ii is instructive.in flemming ii,the district court designated the defendant a career offender,and he was thus subject to the career offender guidelines.see at.however,the district court concluded that the career offender designation overstate d the defendant criminal history,warranting a downward departure.id.at.based on this conclusion,the district court accepted the government recommended sentence,which was at the top of the guide
