defendant liborio ruben hereinafter caro appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of puerto rico convicting him,after a jury trial,of six counts of bribery,in violation of a b,one count of money laundering,in violation of a a i,and one count of witness tampering,in violation of b.in this appeal,caro makes two challenges to his convictions and one challenge to his sentence.first,he asserts that the federal bribery statute is unconstitutional as applied to the facts of this case.second,caro assigns error to the district court failure to conduct an in camera review of tape recordings made by a government informant during the course of the federal investigation.finally,caro claims that the district court erred in its application of sentencing enhancements under the federal sentencing guidelines for the reasons set forth below,we will affirm caro conviction on all counts and remand the case for in light of the district court error,agreed upon by both parties,in calculating caro adjusted total offense level.
because this appeal follows a conviction,we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.see united states,cir.
during the years and,caro served as the mayor of the municipality of rincón,puerto rico.rincón received federal funds from the federal emergency management agency in excess of during the calendar years and.
in,the federal bureau of investigation hereinafter fbi commenced an investigation relating to the possible solicitation of bribes by public officials.caro was one official targeted by the investigation.in furtherance of its investigation,the fbi utilized a paid informant,josé calderón,who was an engineer in the business of providing engineering services to puerto rican municipalities.calderón was equipped with audio and video recording equipment,which he used to record conversations with municipal mayors.as a result of calderón activities as an informant,the fbi accumulated tapes of conversations between calderón and public caro.
calderón and caro met multiple times during and to discuss municipal construction projects in rincón.at these meetings,or shortly thereafter,caro solicited bribes from calderón in connection with awarding government contracts.specifically,caro solicited bribes for the preparation of two of four phases of a territorial allocation plan and the contract for the design of a floodlight tower for a municipal sports complex.the record does not support a finding that the territorial allocation plan or the floodlight tower were funded with federal monies.
at an august,meeting at the mayor office,calderón informed caro that the cost of preparing the floodlight towers would be.caro responded by requesting for awarding the contract.caro received this payment from calderón on august.in early september,caro solicited a bribe in the amount of from calderón in connection with the contract for the territorial allocation plan.this bribe was paid in cash.
caro subsequently used of the bribe proceeds to pay an invoice at a print shop related to his purchase of political materials for his reelection campaign.caro also represented on his puerto rico elections commission reports that the payments received from calderón were political contributions to his reelection campaign.
as a result of the fbi investigation,a federal grand jury returned a ten count superseding indictment charging caro with solicitation of bribes counts,extortion counts vii and viii,money laundering count ix,and witness tampering count x following a twelve day trial,a jury convicted caro of counts,ix,and x.the district court sentenced caro to a term of imprisonment totaling months and a term of supervised release.this appeal followed.
caro first challenge on appeal concerns the constitutionality of the federal bribery statute.the federal bribery statute provides in relevant part 
a whoever,if the circumstance described in subsection b of this section exists 
being an agent of an organization,or of a state,local,or indian tribal government,or any agency thereof 
b corruptly solicits or demands for the benefit of any person,or accepts or agrees to accept,anything of value from any person,intending to be influenced or rewarded in connection with any business,transaction,or series of transactions of such organization,government,or agency involving any thing of value of or more 
shall be fined under this title,imprisoned not more than ten years,or both.
b the circumstance referred to in subsection a of this section is that the organization,government,or agency receives,in any one year period,benefits in excess of under a federal program involving a grant,contract,subsidy,loan,guarantee,insurance,or other form of federal assistance.
caro does not dispute that the municipality of rincón received more than in federal funds during the relevant period,or that the value of the alleged bribery in this case exceeded.instead,caro asserts that section can not constitutionally be applied in his case,because the criminalization of alleged bribery transactions that are unconnected to federal funds or a federally funded program is not a necessary or proper means of furthering congress legitimate interest in protecting federal funds.brief for appellant at.
we review challenges to the constitutionality of a statute de novo.see planned parenthood heed,cir.in sabri united states,d,the united states supreme court held that section was not an unconstitutional exercise of congressional authority under the spending clause,const.art.i,cl,or the necessary and proper clause,const.art.i,cl.sabri.at.specifically,the court stated 
it is true that not every bribe or kickback offered or paid to agents of governments covered by b will be traceably skimmed from specific federal payments,or show up in the guise of a quid pro quo for some dereliction in spending a federal grant.but this possibility portends no enforcement beyond the scope of federal interest,for the reason that corruption does not have to be that limited to affect the federal interest.money is fungible,bribed officials are untrustworthy stewards of federal funds,and corrupt contractors do not deliver value.liquidity is not a financial term for nothing money can be drained off here because a federal grant is pouring in there.and officials are not any the less threatening to the objects behind federal spending just because they may accept general retainers.it is certainly enough that the statutes condition the offense on a threshold amount of federal dollars defining the federal interest,such as that provided here,and on a bribe that goes well beyond liquor and cigars.
id.at internal citations omitted.caro suggests a narrow reading of sabri,whereby we would view the supreme court decision as only standing for the proposition that section is facially valid.under this interpretation,caro suggests that this court may entertain challenges to the constitutionality of section in instances where it is established that there exists no direct connection between charged bribery payments and federal funds.we decline this invitation.
this court has previously rejected a challenge to a conviction under section in which the defendants contended that there was an insufficient connection between their conduct and federal funds received by a municipal police department.see united states cianci,cir.the district court in cianci instructed the a connection between the alleged bribe and federal funds was necessary.id.at.on appeal,the cianci panel concluded that the application of united states zanghi,cir,requires the court to disregard the nexus instruction upon which corrente and autiello base their sufficiency challenges to their joint federal bribery conspiracy convictions.cianci,at because the cianci panel concluded that the nexus instruction was erroneous in light of sabri,the panel affirmed the appellants convictions and implicitly held that a nexus requirement is unnecessary in offenses charged under section.
caro argues that the cianci panel misapplied sabri insofar as the panel purportedly overlooked the fact that the supreme court held in sabri that section was valid on its face,but subject to challenges.in support of his position that an challenge to section may be entertained on appeal,caro cites united states zwick,cir,and united states santopietro,cir,both of which suggest a nexus between the charged bribery and specific federal funds received by a municipality must be established to support a conviction under section.however,both zwick and santopietro predated the supreme court decision in sabri,and we find decisions to be more instructive.
in addition to this court holding in cianci,our sister circuits have also held that after sabri,section does not require a nexus between the alleged bribery and the receipt of federal funds.see united states spano,cir although sabri involved a facial constitutional challenge only,the opinion also forecloses the defendants challenge t he district court was correct in finding that a nexus between the and the federal funds received by the town of cicero was not an element of the crimes with which the defendants were charged united states kranovich,cir we hold the government was not required to establish any connection between the embezzled funds and a federal interest,apart from the express requirement in section b that the county received federal benefits in excess of united states mirikitani,cir the supreme court in sabri not only held that a federal nexus was not an element of the crime,but it held that no federal nexus must be shown at all.we now extend the implicit holding of cianci and join our sister circuits in holding that the government is not required to prove a nexus between the bribery charged and the municipality receipt of federal funds 
we now turn to the second issue raised on appeal whether the district court erred in failing to conduct an in camera review of tape recordings as requested by caro.of the tapes generated by josé calderón work as an informant,the government disclosed only of these tapes to caro prior to trial.caro moved for the production of all previously undisclosed recordings on the basis that they might contain exculpatory or impeachment evidence the district court referred this motion to the magistrate judge.in her order,the magistrate judge stated 
t he defense also filed a motion requesting discovery pursuing the disclosure of approximately audio recordings,not yet provided in discovery.the defense argues these may reveal exculpatory evidence and that the government should not be the party making such a determination.the government claims it has disclosed all tapes where defendant appears talking to josé calderón and that others are not exculpatory.
the government is instructed,unless it can argue that disclosure will jeopardize the investigation or life of arrange for ways and means in which the defense can examine those other related recordings.probably allowing for reading of transcripts 
order of august,at.caro objected to the magistrate judge order and specifically moved in the district court for a vacation of this order.in an order dated february,the district court ruled as follows 
t he united states will submit an affidavit sworn by special agent paul bingham in which he avers that he has listened to and received each of the recordings that had not been disclosed to defendant,that he represents under oath that none of them are related directly or indirectly to this case,that defendant voice is not heard in any of them and that nor sic is he or anyone related to the facts of this case mentioned in these recordings.
order of february,at.caro did not object to this order.special agent paul bingham submitted an affidavit pursuant to the district court order and upon receipt of this affidavit,the district court required the government to disclose three recordings where caro voice is heard,six additional recordings that were directly or indirectly related to the rincón investigation,and transcripts of eight recordings that were not directly or indirectly related to the rincón investigation.order of april,at.caro request for the remaining recordings was denied.caro did not move for reconsideration of this order,nor did he raise again the issue at trial.
caro now challenges the district court denial of his request for an in camera inquiry into the contents of the recordings.the government contends that caro has waived his right to assert this claim on appeal because he failed to preserve the issue at trial.we do not agree.the district court order on caro motion constituted a final resolution of the issue.caro had no basis upon which to believe that raising this pretrial discovery issue again during the course of the trial proceedings would be met with a more favorable result.fusco motors,cir where the pretrial proffer is adequate and evidence is excluded unconditionally by a pretrial order,then we think that the proponent has preserved the issue for appeal.the same rationale applies here.because appellant properly raised the brady discovery issue before the district court through pretrial motions,we find that the issue is properly preserved for purposes of appellate review.with that said,we turn to the merits of caro challenge.
we review the district court determinations under rule,brady,and giglio for abuse of discretion.see united states,cir.at the outset,we note that methods of enforcing disclosure requirements in criminal trials are generally left to the discretion of the trial court.see united states valera,cir.
the united states supreme court holding in brady requires the government to disclose any exculpatory evidence which is material either to guilt or to punishment.brady,at.information is material if there is a reasonable probability that,had the evidence been disclosed to the defense,the result of the proceeding would have been different,at internal quotation and punctuation omitted.however,a defendant right to discover exculpatory evidence does not include the unsupervised authority to search through the government files.pennsylvania ritchie,d.similarly,brady does not permit a defendant to conduct an in camera fishing expedition through the government files united states pou,cir.indeed,t here is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case,and brady did not create one.weatherford bursey,d.instead,to establish a violation of brady,a defendant must provide the court with some indication that the materials to which he needs access contain material and potentially exculpatory evidence.united states brandon,cir.
in support of his position that the district court erred in failing to conduct an in camera inspection of the tapes,caro relies on this court decision in.in,we held that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to review central communication records and tapes related to the pursuit of defendants alleged vessel,at.the defendants argued that disclosure of these materials was essential to their theory that their boat could not have traveled from the location where bales of cocaine were dumped in the ocean to the location where the defendants vessel was intercepted during the time frame suggested by the government.id.at.the defendants alleged that the records and tapes requested in discovery contained evidence that law enforcement lost sight of the vessel during its pursuit.id.at.this court held that i n light of defendants theory of the case,and in light of the fact that the government does not dispute that the logs contain the seemingly relevant times and locations of the units in the area,we find that the district court abused its discretion in finding the logs to be irrelevant without first reviewing them.id.at emphasis added.
this case is easily distinguishable.caro has presented neither a theory regarding the existence of potentially exculpatory evidence on the tapes,nor has he made any showing that the tapes would be of substantial assistance to his defense.his discovery request to the district court only stated that t he recordings not provided in discovery may contain evidence that exculpates the defendant.motion requesting discovery,at.this is insufficient to warrant an in camera review of the tapes.caro request that tape recordings containing hours of dialogue be re
