josé colón de jesús challenges both the substantive reasonableness of his upwardly variant sentence and a financial disclosure condition incident to his supervised release term after careful consideration,we summarily affirm.
background 
because this appeal follows a guilty plea,we draw the facts from the plea agreement the agreement,the undisputed portions of the presentence investigation report the psi report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states,cir,slip op.at.on july,puerto rico police officers observed an individual,later identified as the appellant,riding a horse toward them at high speed,with a firearm in his waistband.after he fell from his steed,the officers took him into custody and confiscated the firearm,which proved to be loaded with rounds of ammunition.upon a search incident to his arrest,the officers discovered two additional magazines fully loaded.moreover,the appellant acknowledged that the seized firearm had been modified to fire automatically as a machinegun.
in due season,a federal grand jury returned a indictment.count charged the appellant with knowingly possessing a firearm and ammunition after having been convicted of a felony.see g,a.count charged the appellant with knowingly possessing a machinegun.see id.o.after initially maintaining his innocence,the appellant entered into the agreement and tendered a guilty plea to count.
pertinently,the agreement memorialized the parties joint recommendation that the appellant should be sentenced near the middle of the applicable guideline sentencing range gsr.the district court subsequently accepted the appellant plea to count 
at sentencing,the court without objection adopted the calculations adumbrated in the psi report,which resulted in a gsr of months based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of iii.despite the parties joint recommendation for a guideline sentence,the court varied upward and imposed a term of immurement,to be followed by a term of supervised release.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
in this venue,the appellant advances two assignments of error.first,he asserts that his incarcerative sentence,though only the statutory maximum sentence,see id.a,is substantively unreasonable.second,he asserts that the district court erred in attaching a financial disclosure condition to his supervised release term.we discuss each assignment of error in turn.
a.the length of the sentence.
the appellant challenges his sentence as substantively unreasonable,suggesting that the guideline sentence limned in the agreement would have been sufficient.because the appellant voiced this objection at the disposition hearing,our review is for abuse of discretion.see gall united states.
when mulling a challenge to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence,considerable deference is due to the district court judgment.see united states clogston,cir.this respectful approach recognizes that even though a sentencing court is under a mandate to consider a myriad of relevant factors,the weighting of those factors is largely within the court informed discretion.clogston,at.it follows that even where as in this case the district court imposes a variant sentence,a reviewing court must afford due deference to the district court decision that the a factors,on a whole,justify the extent of the variance.gall,at.
reasonableness is itself a protean concept.united states martin,cir.in the last analysis,a sentence will withstand a challenge to its substantive reasonableness as long as it rests on a plausible sentencing rationale and reflects a defensible result.id.at.applying this yardstick,we will vacate the sentence if and only if the sentencing court ultimate determination falls outside the expansive boundaries of the universe of reasonable sentences.id.at.
here,the district court articulated a plausible sentencing rationale.it took pains to note its consideration of the factors made relevant by a and commented upon specific factors that applied to the appellant situation.the court also considered the appellant prior criminal history which was significant and included convictions for similar offenses.describing that history,the court concluded that the appellant knew clearly the consequences of weapons violations and still did learn the lesson.
after conducting this assessment,the court explicitly determined that the guideline range did not fully reflect the seriousness of the offense,the risk and harm to society,nor what has happened here.stressing the need for deterrence,the court concluded that an appropriate sentence demanded an upward variance.
the resultant sentence surpassed the top of the gsr by months.such a sentence is admittedly stern.but a stern sentence may still fall within the universe of reasonable sentences,though we have recognized that the greater the extent of a variance,the more compelling the sentencing court justification must be.united states del,cir.
here,the district court adequately justified the sentence.as the court noted,there were aggravating factors,including the appellant recidivism,the especially menacing nature of the firearm in question which to the appellant knowledge had been deliberately modified to function as a machinegun,and the extra magazines that the appellant carried.equally as important,the court tied the upward variance to specific section a factors.see united states,cir.united states scherrer,cir.en banc.on balance,we think that the court sentencing rationale is plausible,that the end result a sentence is defensible,and that,therefore,the sentence is within the broad compass of the court discretion.
in an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning,the appellant argues that the district court abused its discretion in lending societal factors,such as the crime rate in puerto rico,undue weight in the sentencing calculus.this argument can not carry the day w e have squarely held that a district court may consider and geographic factors in formulating its sentence,at,slip op.at.because considerations,such as the local crime rate,are inextricably intertwined with deterrence,it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to use the puerto rican crime rate as one of several integers in the sentencing calculus.united states,cir.
so,too,the appellant emphasis on the parties joint sentencing recommendation which the district court spurned is misplaced.when faced with a challenge to the substantive reasonableness of a sentence,a reviewing court must focus its inquiry on the sentence actually imposed,not on the relative merit of that sentence as contrasted with a different sentence mutually agreed to by the parties,at,slip op.at although a sentencing court typically has a duty to explain why it selected a particular sentence,it has no corollary duty to explain why it eschewed other suggested sentences.quoting united states,cir.consequently,we have no need to ponder the desirability vel non of the sentence recommended by the parties but eschewed by the sentencing court 
to sum up,a sentencing court has wide discretion in how it chooses to weigh the section a factors in any given case.see united states,cir.t here is no stringent mathematical formula that cabins the exercise of the sentencing court discretion.martin,at.those principles control here though the upward variance imposed by the district court is significant,it does not,on this record,warrant a finding that the sentence is substantively unreasonable.see,united states,cir,at.
supervised release.
next,the appellant challenges a financial disclosure condition that the district court imposed as a special condition ancillary to his supervised release term.since he did not contemporaneously object to the imposition of this condition,our review is for plain error.see united states garrasteguy,cir.under this rigorous standard,an appellant must demonstrate that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir.
the challenged condition obligates the appellant,during hi
