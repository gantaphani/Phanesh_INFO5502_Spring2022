this case requires us to determine whether the district court correctly attributed more than one kilogram of heroin to victor laboy when sentencing him on a drug distribution charge.we must also determine whether the district court correctly imposed a leadership role adjustment for laboy gang activities.finding no error,we affirm.
from the spring of until early,the federal bureau of investigation monitored a street gang in lawrence,massachusetts known as the latin gangsta disciples lgd.the fbi suspected that lgd members were,among other activities,selling heroin in the lawrence,massachusetts area.the fbi used surveillance devices to monitor lgd meetings and used cooperating witnesses cws to make controlled purchases of heroin from suspected lgd members.
in the summer of,appellant victor laboy made three documented heroin sales to cws on july,laboy sold heroin to a cw who originally wanted to buy from luis flores,the highest ranking member of the lgd.laboy told the cw that he could take care of the cw from his own supply that he and flores were partners and that their source of heroin was the same.indeed,the markings on the packages that laboy sold that day matched those on packages that flores sold on previous occasions.at one point,laboy suggested that he and the cw join together to sell heroin in nearby haverhill,massachusetts.after the sale,he called flores,in the cw presence,in an attempt to replenish his stock.
this scene repeated itself three days later when a cw,again unable to find flores,instead sought out laboy.laboy again supplied heroin and stated that he and flores were partners.again,he expressed interest in partnering with the cw to sell heroin in another city.
on july,a cw made a third purchase from laboy.at this meeting,laboy stated that he was no longer in partnership with flores because flores source was selling inferior quality heroin and laboy was losing money on it.now he was running his own operation and had at least one person working for him.again,he tried to recruit the cw to sell heroin on his behalf.
on july,a cw accompanied laboy in an attempt to collect money from yet another person who was dealing heroin for laboy.during their conversation,laboy told the cw about his regular customers,including one who comes every two days for six or seven bundles.they proceeded to search for wilberto colon,whom laboy identified as one of his suppliers.they planned to purchase grams from colon that day,and laboy indicated that he had purchased as much as grams from colon in the past.eventually they discarded the idea because laboy discovered that colon had just made a sale of grams.in laboy estimation,there would not be a ready market for more heroin that day.
laboy was not the only member of the lgd that sold heroin during the summer and fall of.the fbi documented more than grams of direct heroin sales by laboy associates during its investigation.several of these members acknowledged a relationship with laboy.wilberto colon discussed his heroin business with a cw in laboy presence and stated that he sold to papito,laboy street name.two cws stated that they sold several bundles a day on laboy behalf.
by the fall of,laboy had moved to salem,new town about six miles from lawrence.nevertheless,he returned to lawrence to attend lgd meetings during these meetings,lgd members discussed the distribution of drug proceeds.flores demanded that he receive from each sale by lgd members we got a business on park street i give you a bundle of heroin,i want fifty bucks out of it if i paying for it,you gon na give me my money regardless they discussed the failure of some members to contribute money to the gang fundle a fund used to purchase firearms and bail out gang members who had been arrested.members recounted violence against other gangs,and the need to protect lgd turf in lawrence from anyone else who would try to sell drugs in the area.
at one meeting,lgd member manuel rivera referred to laboy as one of several leaders of the gang,saying to lgd captain edgardo colon 
you,flores,pinchy santiago and bocerro laboy you are the ones running this you supposed to communicate at all times and let each other know what going on we an organization.
flores also referred to laboy as one of several leaders of the gang,stating that,if anything happens,i want it brought to me if not brought to me,brought to one of the heads,pinchy antonio santiago,galdi edgardo colon or bocerro laboy or chupacabra juan matias.
based on the controlled drug sales and surveillance tapes of the gang meetings,the fbi arrested laboy and several other lgd members in january.
on october,laboy pleaded guilty to three counts of heroin distribution for the three controlled purchases he made to cws at the sentencing hearing,the district court heard testimony from an fbi agent and a cw about the inner workings of the lgd and its members drug dealing.it also considered the admissions made by other lgd members who had pleaded guilty to heroin distribution,including information about quantities and frequency of sales.the court examined laboy relationship with other lgd members,both through the gang and individually.
the court found,by clear and convincing evidence that laboy and other lgd members had jointly undertaken various activities,within the meaning of to advance their collective heroin business.because of this cooperation,the court held laboy accountable for all heroin distributed by other lgd members during the course of the fbi investigation.it further found that lgd members had distributed,and thus that laboy was responsible for,more than one kilogram of heroin.finally,it found that laboy,through his role in the lgd,was an organizer or leader of an otherwise extensive organization,under.the court applied a base offense level of,with a point adjustment for laboy role in the offense,and a three point reduction for acceptance of responsibility.it sentenced him to months in prison,years supervised release and a special assessment.
on appeal,laboy offers two arguments first,that the district court erred in holding him responsible for more than one kilogram of heroin,and second,that it erred in adjusting his sentence for his leadership role in the lgd.we address each of these arguments in turn.
calculation of drug quantity 
the district court need only determine drug quantities by a preponderance of the evidence.united states batista,cir,cert.denied,d.we review such determinations for clear error id.
laboy first argues that he should be held accountable only for the drug quantities involved in his three sales to cws and not for quantities sold by other lgd members.drug quantity determinations are not limited to the amounts involved in the offense of conviction.rather,a defendant may be held responsible for drug quantities involved in his relevant conduct.such conduct may include a defendant own acts or the acts of others the sentencing guidelines provide responsibility for the acts of others in the case of jointly undertaken criminal activity,which includes any criminal plan,scheme,endeavor or enterprise undertaken by defendant in concert with others.a b.the guidelines state that a defendant may be held responsible for 
all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity,that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction,in preparation for that offense,or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.
id.in the case of controlled substances,the defendant is responsible for all reasonably foreseeable quantities of contraband that were within the scope of the criminal activity that he jointly undertook,cmt.thus,a drug dealer who engages in criminal activity with others to further their collective interests may be held liable for the quantities of drugs sold by his partners,if those sales were a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the jointly undertaken actions.
this type of liability,however,has its limit mere knowledge of another activity is not enough to show liability under.rather,the central concept is foreseeability.united states,cir.the defendant is only res
