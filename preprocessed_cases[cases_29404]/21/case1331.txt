defendant appellant philip abramo appeals from a judgment of conviction and sentence of the united states district court for the southern district of new york rakoff,arguing that his rights under the ex post facto clause were violated by the application of the sentencing manual to a murder conspiracy that concluded in.he contends that this alleged violation and his ignorance of his ex post facto rights render the provision in his plea agreement unenforceable.
abramo returns to this court several years after we vacated his conviction and life sentence,holding that the admission of eight plea allocutions of coconspirators was plain error under the intervening crawford washington decision.see united states riggi,cir.on remand,abramo pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to charges that carried a greatly reduced maximum aggregate sentence of eighteen years conspiracy to commit murder,conspiracy to commit loansharking,and receiving the proceeds of extortion,in violation of a,and,respectively.
the plea agreement contained a broad provision by which abramo agreed to forgo appealing any sentence of eighteen years or less the parties also stipulated to several guidelines particulars first,that t he guidelines provisions in effect as of november,apply to this case second,that the appeal waiver was binding even if the court employ ed a guidelines analysis different from that stipulated to t herein third,that the guidelines sentence was the statutory maximum of months.joint appendix at.
the plea was accepted by the district court at a july,plea colloquy.abramo confirmed he was knowingly relinquishing the right to appeal.
however,abramo sentencing memorandum raised an interesting ex post facto issue.the charged murder conspiracy ended in upon the death of the targeted victim.the guidelines for murder conspiracy were raised significantly in conspiracies that result ed in the death of a victim were linked to the murder guidelines.see,c id.app.c,amend.abramo argued that applying the guidelines as stipulated would violate his rights under the ex post facto clause because this significant enhancement was added after the charged murder conspiracy had ended applying the guidelines would have resulted in a range of to months.
but abramo did not move to withdraw his plea he raised the issue only for the district c ourt attention as part of its review of the a factors,as a relevant fact in assessing a fair and just sentence.joint appendix at.nor did the issue factor into his requested sentence,which sought a reduction in the month statutory maximum for the time he served on related charges in florida 
when the issue was raised at sentencing,the district court viewed the discrepancy between the and guidelines as evidence that the guidelines are not operating in the manner in which they were intended to operate.joint appendix at.the court indicated that the discrepancy therefore would not make the slightest difference in abramo sentence,it instead referenced the nature of the offense itself 
l ooking at the conspiracy to murder,why is that not an offense that calls for a n year penalty w hat crime more calls out for deterrence,for punishment,for the most severe penalties that the court allows than getting together to murder a human being 
joint appendix at.but because the court had to select a guidelines range,gall united states,it chose to apply the guidelines.abramo was sentenced to months imprisonment the month statutory maximum with a partial offset for the month sentence he served in florida.
this appeal followed.abramo argues that the application of the harsher provisions in the manual violated the ex post facto clause.he offers two theories as to why the provision is unenforceable first,his ex post facto rights were unwaivable second,any waiver was unknowing,due to his ignorance of his ex post facto rights.
discussion 
waivers of the right to appeal a sentence are presumptively enforceable.united states arevalo vigil,cir.we have repeatedly upheld the validity of appeal waivers if they are knowingly,voluntarily,and competently provided by the defendant.united states gomez perez,cir.the exceptions to the presumption of the enforceability of a waiver occupy a very circumscribed area of our jurisprudence.id.at.we construe plea agreements according to contract law principles,united states yemitan,cir,but because plea agreements are unique contracts,we temper the application of ordinary contract principles with special due process concerns for fairness and the adequacy of procedural safeguards.united states woltmann,cir internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted.
a violation of a fundamental right warrants voiding an appeal waiver.for example,we have voided appeal waivers where the sentence imposed was based on unconstitutional factors such as race,see gomez perez,at,naturalized status,see,united states jacobson,cir,or the ability to pay restitution,see,united states johnson,cir.similarly,we have voided waivers where a sentencing court failed to enunciate any rationale for the defendant sentence,and thus abdicat ed its judicial responsibility.woltmann,at internal quotation marks omitted voiding waiver because sentencing court relied on plea agreement to the exclusion of the a factors and a letter urging a sentence.
on the other hand,other meaningful errors are insufficient to void an appeal waiver.we have enforced waivers where a sentence was arguably imposed contrary to a statutory requirement.see yemitan,at enforcing appeal waiver despite potential noncompliance with requirement in c,because the noncompliance if any did not present the extraordinary circumstances of the impermissible bias or abdication cases.we also enforced an appeal waiver notwithstanding the defendant claim that the sentencing court failed to make certain downward departures prior to sentencing.united states rivera,cir see also united states buissereth,cir enforcing appeal waiver despite district court failure to rule on i objections to the report psr and ii requests for downward departures adopt findings of psr discuss the a factors and calculate applicable sentencing range.
the decisive considerations dividing these cases appear to be the nature of the right at issue and whether the sentence was reached in a manner that the plea agreement did not anticipate.united states liriano blanco,cir.as to the nature of the right,a defendant pleading guilty can waive elemental constitutional and statutory rights.united states braimah,cir see also mccarthy united states,a defendant who enters a guilty plea simultaneously waives several constitutional rights united states waters,cir holding that ex post facto challenge to statute of conviction was waived by pleading guilty without preserving the issue.however,a defendant may be deemed incapable of waiving a right that has an overriding impact on public interests,united states ready,cir,as such a waiver may irreparably discredit the federal courts,id.at quoting united states mezzanatto.as to unanticipated matters at sentencing,a defendant who waives his right to appeal does not subject himself to being sentenced entirely at the whim of the district court.united states marin,cir.
neither consideration warrants voiding abramo appeal waiver.there is no suggestion that the sentencing judge was biased or that he abdicated his judicial responsibility to the contrary,the constitutional error during sentencing arose following a careful consideration of a baffling legal issue if indeed there was any error any issue as to abramo knowledge aside,the sentencing process was exactly as anticipated the district court applied the guidelines,as contemplated by the following three stipulations from the plea agreement that the guidelines be used that the applicable guidelines sentence was eighteen years and that the agreement was binding even if the court used a different guidelines range.joint appendix at.no public interest was impaired by abramo waiver,and recognizing the waiver does not impugn the integrity of the judiciary or the sentencing process.rather,by agreeing not to appeal,abramo avoided another life sentence and capped his sentencing exposure.the gov
