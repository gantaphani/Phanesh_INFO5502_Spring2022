this appeal arises out of the conviction of joseph thorn thorn in the united states district court for the northern district of new york frederick scullin,chief judge of nine counts of violating the clean air act,c,and one count of conspiracy to promote money laundering,a a,h.the government challenges various decisions of the district court imposing the defendant sentence,and the defendant cross appeals the district court denial of his rule motion for judgment of acquittal seeking dismissal of the money laundering count.for the reasons that follow,we vacate the sentence imposed and remand for resentencing.we affirm the district court denial of the defendant rule motion.
facts and procedural background 
thorn was the owner of a environmental services,a,an asbestos abatement company in upstate new york.after a trial,a jury convicted him of nine counts counts one to nine of violating the clean air act,c,and one count count ten of conspiracy to launder money,a a i,h.subsequent to a sentencing hearing on july,the district court sentenced thorn,on october,to a total term of months incarceration followed by three years supervised release,forfeiture of,and restitution of.
various state and federal laws apply to the removal of asbestos to protect workers,the public,and the environment.see generally,regs.tit.for example,operators of removal projects involving at least linear feet or square feet of regulated material must notify government authorities prior to commencing the work so that these agencies can monitor for compliance with the law.see a i,b.workers must construct containment areas and set up negative air ventilation and filtration systems at the work site,precautions that are to remain in place until laboratory analysis confirms that the asbestos has been appropriately removed.see f g.during removal operations,workers are required to wet the asbestos with amended water to prevent the release of asbestos fibers into the air and to wear respirators and protective clothing to protect themselves.see id.g i.workers also must go through a decontamination unit before they are permitted to leave the containment area.see id.j i.removed asbestos must be kept wet,appropriately sealed,and transported to landfills specifically licensed to dispose of asbestos.see c i.accredited laboratories collect and analyze samples of the air before,during,and after the project and monitor worker exposure during the project.see f.
the government presented the following evidence at the trial and sentencing hearing a employed approximately people on abatement projects from approximately to the average time spent on friable asbestos projects by these workers was fifty to sixty percent thirty to forty percent of these workers did not use respirators ninety percent of these workers smoked cigarettes and the core group of a workers worked an average of two to five years,and some worked up to eight years.
the government argues that from to,thorn directed his workers to violate the rules and regulations governing the removal of asbestos at in excess of separate facilities,including commercial,public,and private buildings.specifically,while the indictment focused on particular projects between and,the government presented evidence both at trial and at the sentencing hearing of at least additional projects for a total of at least projects between and and over private residential projects from to.although thorn assured customers in writing that all abatements would be completed in compliance with the law,the projects often violated many state and federal laws.
the government evidence depicted thorn scheme to defraud as follows.first,he or a supervisor would submit a low bid proposal,which assumed cost savings from illegal shortcuts.once a won the bid,thorn had his office manager send a contract through the mail,promising full compliance with all applicable laws.often thorn directed employees to prepare the required project notification for the file but not to send it to the relevant regulatory agencies so that in case of discovery,he would feign clerical error,thus decreasing the chance of a regulatory inspection.thorn then directed workers to perform or rip and skip abatements,meaning that workers quickly ripped asbestos from pipes with little or no containment,resulting in the release of significant quantities of asbestos fibers into both the work area and other areas of the building.a failure to use required negative air pressure and filtration systems at the abatement sites exacerbated the harm from such practices.
thorn engaged purportedly independent laboratories and air monitoring companies as crucial elements of the scheme.these laboratories assisted him in falsifying final air clearances which represented that the asbestos had been completely removed from each site and osha personals which reported that worker exposure levels had been below osha maximums.a falsified respirator fit test results and maintained a computer file labeled fraud to generate falsified reports stating that workers had received required medical clearances.these false reports,as part of project packages,were then sent by a through the united states mail to reassure customers that the abatements had been successfully completed in full compliance with the law.
upon receipt of these packages and assurances,clients then,without knowledge of the violations,paid a for its services.thorn testified that his business grew almost geometrically each year.office manager dawn dayter testified that the funds obtained from illegal projects were used to finance the next project as well as to pay office expenses.craig ingalls,a former a employee,similarly explained that the money obtained from illegal projects was used to continue and expand the business and perform additional illegal work.
there was testimony that visible emissions of asbestos fibers were released into the air during many if not all projects,and several projects,as a result of the violations,resembled an indoor snow storm or blizzard due to the large amounts of asbestos in the air.further,despite regulations requiring thorn,as owner,to ensure his workers compliance with the aforementioned rules,see,e the employer shall ensure that employees do not eat,drink,smoke,chew tobacco or gum,or apply cosmetics in the regulated areas id.h requiring the employer to provide particular respirators to employees id.j imposing on employer the duty to insure that employees follow proper decontamination procedures,thorn did not require his workers to comply with these regulations.in some instances,thorn failed to supply appropriate replacement filters or sufficient numbers of protective gear for workers who specifically requested these mandated precautions.and thorn never provided a functioning decontamination unit,as required by law,to enable workers safely and adequately to clean their clothes and bodies before leaving the project sites.the asbestos waste either was sent to landfills dry and without proper bagging,in violation of permits and licenses,or was brought back to a where warehouse workers often very young workers,like the billetts brothers,discussed below,without proper protective devices or proper training,were directed to turn the bags inside out so the labels would not be visible and simply dump the dry asbestos in trash dumpsters.those who complained to thorn about his illegal practices were threatened with being fired and testified that they feared being blackballed from further abatement work.
the government provided detailed exposure evidence for a limited number of the approximately workers employed by thorn during the scheme.for example,the district court heard evidence concerning two brothers,angelo and jeremy billetts.thorn hired angelo at the age of fourteen to cut a grass and do other maintenance projects,but almost immediately thorn directed him to cut open and illegally dump bags of friable asbestos into dumpsters.this angelo did on a daily basis for approximately nine months for about ninety percent of each work day.during this work he became covered with substantial quantities of loose friable asbestos.with visible asbestos all over his clothes,he requested a respirator from thorn in response,thorn advised him that he could not have a respirator and that he should clean up the asbestos and not worry about it.angelo stated that thorn supervised and directed all of his work,that there was no decontamination unit for him to use to clean himself,and that he was not given any protective clothing to use during his work.
jeremy began working for a at age sixteen.he performed warehouse duties on virtually a daily basis for the first two and years of his employment,including cutting open bags of friable asbestos from abatement projects and dumping the material into dumpsters for disposal as ordinary trash and cleaning highly contaminated materials brought back from various asbestos abatement jobs,all at the direction of thorn.although this work caused significant quantities of asbestos dust to fly around him,he was never given a respirator.for the next two years of his employment,he worked at a,generally on asbestos abatement projects,the majority of which work involved illegal removal projects.occasionally he performed his old warehouse duties,including cutting and dumping bags of friable asbestos without a respirator.
the government also presented evidence from another pair of brothers,carl and brian wolcott.brian was twenty and carl was when they began working for a on abatement projects,and both have smoked cigarettes since the age of sixteen.both stated that for three years,to percent of their work was on removal projects of friable asbestos,and that visible emissions were clearly present,often in heavy concentrations at every friable asbestos abatement project on which they worked.they further declared that w ell in excess of of the time they did not wear asbestos respirators and that there was never a decontamination unit available for their use.
thorn defense consisted primarily of arguing that a was forced to violate the law to stay competitive in the corrupt abatement industry and that the more serious violations were committed against thorn direction.thorn himself testified that he directed certain activities which he knew to be violative of the law,but denied that he permitted dry removals,except in a few isolated projects where dry removal was appropriate,or that he caused false finals to be sent to clients.
following his conviction,by jury,on all counts of the indictment,thorn was directed to forfeit the full value of the contracts that were the subject of the indictment.the district court denied thorn motion for judgment of acquittal.
at sentencing,the government presented the expert testimony of stephen levin,medical director of the mount selikoff center for occupational and environmental medicine and director of the selikoff asbestos archives and research center at the mount sinai school of medicine.he initially provided general testimony regarding asbestos exposure and its risks.diseases,he stated,appear long after exposure,generally,to thirty years from the onset.he explained that w hile there are individual variations in susceptibility to the effects of asbestos none of which can be predicted in advance,the risks of scarring lung disease asbestosis and pleural thickening and cancer are proportional to the dose inhaled into the lung.there is no known dose threshold below which there is no increase in the risk of cancer.although there are still risks of diseases when workers comply strictly with the clean air act standards because asbestos abatement is a hazardous industry,workers can be protected better if they wearing respiratory protection and if wet methods of removal are used.
levin then discussed various epidemiological studies of asbestos workers.one found that one month of exposure to asbestos nearly doubled the likelihood of dying from an disease.further,levin testified that there is a synergistic relationship between the cancer causing agents in smoking products and the cancer causing agents in asbestos such that one develops an extremely higher risk of developing cancer for heavy smokers with heavy asbestos exposure.although he acknowledged that smokers arguably increase their risk of lung cancer through their volitional behavior,levin testified that asbestos exposure alone multiplied the risk of lung cancer fivefold.
levin reviewed the government evidence and conducted his own interviews of some workers to ascertain the level of asbestos exposure each experienced as a result of thorn clean air act violations.based on this information,he testified that it was his opinion 
that individuals who work with asbestos in unprotected circumstances under conditions where large concentrations of dust are present in their breathing zone have a very clear risk of developing disease,and under the conditions i have heard described and read in the documents i been provided,it my opinion that with virtual certainty among a workers there will be disease,scarring lung disease with a very high probability,and also it my view that there is a very high likelihood that among these workers lung cancer and mesothelioma is sic likely to occur.
the government then asked levin to focus on a subset of thorn workers who had worked without respirators on friable asbestos projects with visible emissions for between two and four years.levin said that i t would still be his view that there is still very high likelihood that among them significant disease would occur and representing sic serious bodily harm and even the possibility of death.
specifically with reference to angelo billetts,levin concluded that if angelo had been exposed to asbestos as angelo had described for even of each work day and not the great majority of his work day,as angelo had stated,the likelihood that he will escape developing scarring lung disease with impairment of lung function i think is virtually nil.with respect to jeremy billetts,who informed levin that he had worked at a for a longer period of time than angelo but had done the dry bag dumping for somewhat smaller percentages of each work day,levin testified that jeremy has a very high risk of substantial bodily injury,and that it very likely that he will develop scarring lung disease on the basis of that period of exposure under those conditions.levin believed jeremy risk of developing scarring lung disease was even greater than angelo because he had been exposed to the illegal abatement and dumping procedures for a longer period of time.
on cross examination,levin answered the following questions in the affirmative can you say,based upon the information that been provided to you and the testimony you heard with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that any a environmental worker was exposed to concentrations of asbestos for a duration that is with a reasonable degree of medical certainty going to result in disease and virtually impossible to avoid that he explained his yes answer by referring to the evidence of exposure before the court 
g iven the circumstances i have heard described and i have read in the transcript of testimony,when there are clouds of visible dust after the disturbance of insulation,in clouds of visible dust as has been described here,working for six months a year or currently without respiratory protection is so likely to produce scarring years later,that if the test of within reasonable medical certainty is only percent likelihood,i can say that without question.i think the likelihood is far greater than that.
he acknowledged that exposure to asbestos visible dust clouds three or four times in one year without respiratory protection might not be enough for him to feel within a medical certainty that an individual is going to develop the disease.but he explained that the information workers such as the billetts and wolcott brothers had given him suggested much greater exposure,such as routine failure to use respiratory protection for sustained periods of employment ranging from several months to multiple years.thus,he stated that among those workers who routinely did not use respiratory protection,there are surely some who are going to develop disease,whether it scarring or cancer.thorn did not call any witnesses or submit any evidence to rebut the government expert.
the probation department recommended that the district court find a total offense level of and a criminal history category of ii,for a minimum guideline sentence of months of imprisonment.the district court,however,imposed sentence of months.with respect to the nine clean air act counts,the district court did not apply a enhancement pursuant to united states sentencing guidelines b for offenses creating a substantial likelihood of death or serious bodily injury or a enhancement pursuant to for abuse of a position of trust.although the district court offense level determination for the clean air act counts,combined with criminal history category i,yielded a guideline range of to months,the district court imposed concurrent sentences of sixty months for each count.to determine the base offense level on the money laundering count,the court excluded representing funds generated by the abatement projects that were not the focus of trial and million representing funds generated by the approximately residential projects.again,the court declined to apply the enhancement for abuse of a position of trust to the money laundering count.finally,the district judge granted a downward departure on the ground that thorn money laundering offense was atypical,and departed from criminal history category ii to i,reasoning that ii overrepresented the seriousness of thorn criminal history.thus,the court imposed a month term for the money laundering conviction to run concurrently with the sixty month term imposed for the clean air act violations.
on appeal,the government argues that the district court i clearly erred by finding that the clean air act violations did not result in a substantial likelihood of death or serious bodily injury ii erred in refusing to impose an enhancement for abuse of a position of trust iii erred in excluding approximately million from the calculation of the money laundering guideline offense level iv abused its discretion in granting a downward departure on the ground that the money laundering conviction was outside of the heartland and v abused its discretion in granting a downward departure from criminal history category ii to i.the defendant argues in his cross appeal that the district court erred in denying defendants rule motion for judgment of acquittal dismissing the money laundering count.
calculation of thorn offense level 
facts relied on in sentencing need be established by a preponderance of the evidence and will be overturned only if they are clearly erroneous.united states jacobo,cir.we apply de novo review to legal questions regarding application of the sentencing guidelines.united states barrett,cir.
substantial likelihood of death or serious bodily injury 
sentencing guideline b directs a district court to increase the base offense level for a clean air act violation by nine levels i f the offense resulted in a substantial likelihood of death or serious bodily injury.sentencing guidelines manual b.application note i to which was denominated application note j at the time of thorn sentencing defines serious bodily injury as injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty or requiring medical intervention such as surgery,hospitalization,or physical rehabilitation.sentencing guidelines manual,cmt.i.neither the guidelines nor case law define substantial likelihood we adopt the meaning given to this language in the preliminary injunction context,namely,that substantial likelihood means considerably more likely.see abdul wali coughlin,cir holding that parties seeking a preliminary injunction that would grant the movant substantially all the relief he ultimately seeks and not merely maintain the status quo must show a substantial likelihood of success on the merits,that their cause is considerably more likely to succeed than fail,overruled on other grounds,estate of shabazz,d 
thus,the district court should have applied the enhancement under b if thorn clean air act violations made it considerably more likely that a person would develop an injury involving extreme physical pain or the protracted impairment of a function of a bodily member,organ,or mental faculty,or requiring medical intervention such as surgery,hospitalization,or physical rehabilitation.to trigger the enhancement,death or serious bodily injury need not result from the offense conduct in fact,such actual death or serious bodily injury could warrant an upward departure under the guideline.see sentencing guidelines manual,cmt.
the district court found 
that there was too much uncertainty in the evidence both in terms of available medical science as well as evidence of exposure in the present case to say that with any degree of certainty any personnel suffered serious bodily injury or death.the people involved here did get involved voluntarily in the underlying criminal conduct,in most instances,they willfully refused to use available safety equipment which could reduce their risk of injury.there just insufficient evidence to support the conclusion that any illness that might result from exposure to asbestos would cause serious bodily injury,so i not going to enhance it 
we respectfully disagree and think the district court ruling involved two errors of law.first,that the evidence may not have established with any certainty that a workers actually suffered serious bodily injury or death,in the district judge words,is not germane to our analysis.the enhancement applies when the offense resulted in a substantial likelihood of death or serious bodily injury and not only when the offense actually caused such illness or death.
second,it is not relevant under b that some of thorn workers may have been.as the government argues,the sentencing commission knows how to limit an enhancement based on the creation of substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to the victims of an offense and not to permit an enhancement when those put at risk were.for example,a directs district courts to apply a greater base offense level when the offense created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to any person other than a participant in the offense.sentencing guidelines manual a.section b includes no similar restriction on the class of individuals put at substantial risk by the offense conduct,and we decline to read such a limitation into the guideline.thus,we find that b is not limited to situations in which the offense conduct created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to persons other than participants in the offense.
to the extent the district court found that the evidence was too uncertain to support a finding that thorn conduct resulted in a substantial likelihood of death or serious bodily injury,we find that this factual finding constituted clear error the facts relevant to this enhancement are admittedly complicated because a workers already were at some risk of developing these injuries as a result of their decision to work in a field that is dangerous even when all precautions are taken.further,many of these workers were at risk of contracting some of these diseases,such as lung cancer,as a result of their decision to smoke,and some increased their exposure to asbestos by choosing not to wear respirators.the district court seemed to take this volitional behavior into account when it noted that the people involved were involved voluntarily and willfully refused to use available safety equipment.
that some workers smoked or failed to wear protective gear did not absolve thorn of his duty,under the law,to comply with federal laws,including his obligation as an employer not to permit violations of safety regulations.evidence shows that thorn did not direct his workers to wear respirators.more importantly,in some instances,thorn failed to provide respirators,replacement filters,sufficient quantities of protective gear,and decontamination units,despite specific requests from workers for these mandated protections.
we acknowledge that asbestos abatement is a dangerous profession that places workers at risk of developing diseases even when they and their employers comply fully with the law.but that asbestos abatement inherently imposes risks on its workers does not preclude a finding that thorn illegal behavior resulted in a substantial likelihood as opposed to some undefined possibility based on the general dangers of the industry of death or serious bodily injury to these workers.
we find that there is clear,undisputed testimony in the record that at least some of a workers were considerably more likely,as a result of thorn clean air act violations,to develop disease than if they had performed abatement under lawful conditions.levin testified,based on the evidence in the record of many workers sustained,routine exposure to visible emissions without respiratory protection,that among a workers there will be disease with virtual certainty.moreover,he offered unequivocal and unrefuted testimony concerning the billetts brothers exposure to asbestos as a result of thorn conduct.that is,as noted earlier,even assuming less exposure to asbestos than angelo had claimed in his testimony,levin opined that there was virtually no chance that angelo would escape developing scarring lung disease with impairment of lung function.
thus,given the absence of an articulated reason to reject this undisputed evidence,it was clear error for the district court to find that there was insufficient evidence that thorn conduct resulted in a substantial likelihood that at least one,if not several,of his former employees would develop devastating,diseases.
abuse of a position of trust 
guideline directs sentencing courts to increase the base offense level by two levels 
i f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust,or used a special skill,in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense this adjustment may not be employed if an abuse of trust or skill is included in the base offense level or specific offense characteristic.if this adjustment is based upon an abuse of a position of trust,it may be employed in addition to an adjustment under aggravating role if this adjustment is based solely on the use of a special skill,it may not be employed in addition to an adjustment under aggravating role.
sentencing guidelines manual.application note one explains that 
p ublic or private trust refers to a position of public or private trust characterized by professional or managerial discretion,substantial discretionary judgment that is ordinarily given considerable deference.persons holding such positions ordinarily are subject to significantly less supervision than employees whose responsibilities are primarily in nature.for this adjustment to apply,the position of public or private trust must have contributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense,by making the detection of the offense or the defendant responsibility for the offense more difficult.this adjustment,for example,applies in the case of an embezzlement of a client funds by an attorney serving as a guardian,a bank executive fraudulent loan scheme,or the criminal sexual abuse of a patient by a physician under the guise of an examination.the adjustment does not apply in the case of an embezzlement or theft by an ordinary bank teller or hotel clerk because such positions are not characterized by the factors.
id,cmt.further,note three defines special skill as a skill not possessed by members of the general public and usually requiring substantial education,training or licensing.id,cmt.
we have held that w hether a position is one of trust is to be viewed from the perspective of the offense victims and is a question of law for the court,subject to de novo review on appeal.united states wright,cir internal citations omitted.a court determination that an individual abused a position of trust in a manner that significantly facilitated the commission or concealment of the offense is a question of fact reviewed for clear error.united states hirsch,cir.
whether someone occupies a position of trust turns on the extent to which the position provides the freedom to commit a wrong,united states allen,cir per curiam quoting united states viola,cir,cert.denied,d,and does not require a legally defined duty such as fiduciary duty,united states barrett,cir.we recently explained that this standard requires that the defendant position must involve discretionary authority and that this discretion must have been entrusted to the defendant by the victim.hirsch,at.one who merely engages in dealings in a commercial transaction does not thereby occupy a position of trust.wright,at see also hirsch,at finding defendant held a position of trust because he was a broker and investment advisor entrusted with investment discretion by his investors and because he had a fiduciary and personal relationship rather than an relationship with his investors.
the district court did not add two levels to thorn base offense level for abuse of a position of trust,reasoning that we just addressed that enhancement when we gave him an enhancement for his role as owner of the corporation,organizing the activity.the particular abuse of trust,he was given the activity because of his ability to do that type of work the adjustment is based solely upon his use of a special skill,you ca use that to enhance him again.you made an adjustment under.in other words,the district court concluded that it could not enhance thorn sentence under for using a special skill because it had applied an aggravating role enhancement.see sentencing guidelines manual i f this adjustment is based solely on the use of a special skill,it may not be employed in addition to an adjustment under aggravating role.the question for us is whether the district court erred in failing to impose the enhancement because thorn abused a position of trust and did not merely use a special skill.
in arguing that the district court erred in failing to enhance both the clean air act and money laundering counts based on thorn abuse of a position of trust,the government cites to evidence in the record that thorn enjoyed considerable discretion,due to the nature of his work,to perform illegal abatements and carry out his scheme undetected for ten years.regulations prevented clients from being present,absent required safety gear and training,to oversee a work and to confirm that a was complying with all state and federal laws.clients were forced,by these circumstances,to trust that thorn certifications were truthful.thorn,the government continues,then took advantage of his discretion,by,inter alia,instructing his workers to cover windows and block entryways to prevent customers from overseeing the abatements.
the defendant argues,in response,that thorn conduct was not akin to any of the examples provided in application notes.rather,thorn position as a licensed abatement contractor did not aid him in avoiding the detection of his convicted offenses because of the substantial regulation of the asbestos industry.
as a contractor hired to abate his customer asbestos,thorn was responsible for complying with the terms of his contract,which included compliance with state and federal laws.it does not appear from the record before us that he had a close personal relationship with his clients,see hirsch,at distinguishing cases in which defendants had personal or fiduciary relationships with victims from those in which defendants and victims had contractual relationships,or that he was responsible for their,see wright,at noting that a defendant who is a fiduciary or one who is responsible for the of a victim of his crime,and as such is given discretion over spending and is thereby afforded an opportunity,not generally available,to embezzle moneys,does occupy a position of trust.nor,possibly suggestive of a position of trust,did he have special access to information which he abused,such as when an employee uses a password to print airline tickets for himself,see united states castagnet,cir,or an employee uses her access to company checks to write checks to her personal account,see allen,at.see also id.summarizing circuit cases.
thorn having discretion,as the owner of a,over how a would fulfill its contractual obligations to its clients which actions the clients always could claim had insufficiently fulfilled the contract obligations,is not the same as a clients giving thorn discretion with respect to how a fulfilled its contract obligations.united states jolly,cir remarking that even if a defendant has professional or managerial discretion in his capacity as a vice president of his company,for purposes of section the discretion must be entrusted to the defendant by the victim.rather,his clients theoretically retained the ability to oversee thorn work and ensure his substantial performance of the contract,even if such oversight was more complicated due to regulations restricting access to the site or the regulatory and scientific complexity of the project.for example,they could have demanded that thorn provide access to or at least remove the garbage bags from the windows at the work sites.further,the government presented evidence that thorn sent final air clearances to his clients to reassure them that he had completed the project in compliance with the law.this suggests that thorn clients did not blindly trust him but rather expected him to present proof that his work complied with state and federal regulations.that thorn illegal activities frustrated his clients oversight by corrupting various checks on his performance does not mean that he held a position that his victims intended to be immune from oversight and control indeed,it appears that he held a position with certain checks in place to confirm his compliance with the law and the contract,but that his illegal actions undermined these checks.viola,at the defendant may have abused his position as an employee by surreptitiously viewing the manifests and disclosing their contents,but his position as a forklift operator was not a repository of public or private trust within the meaning of.
to the extent the record includes evidence that some of thorn clients deferred to thorn,such deference arguably was due to his special skill as an asbestos contractor,a skill not possessed by members of the general public and that requires substantial education,training,and licensing.see sentencing guidelines manual,cmt.it does not appear from the record before us that thorn clients deferred to him because of some special relationship of trust or confidence rather,apparently they deferred to his expertise,as purportedly confirmed by independent laboratories and federal and state regulators.although such deference could warrant a enhancement under for use of a special skill,the district court correctly held that it could not apply that enhancement in this case because it had already applied an aggravating role enhancement under.see sentencing guidelines manual.
we do not rule,however,that the position of asbestos abatement contractor as a matter of law is not a position of trust under.as we concluded in united states laljie,cir,thorn occupation may or may not be imbued with the characteristics of a position of trust,including professional or managerial discretion and lack of supervision.if,for example,a client entrusted thorn with discretion to complete the abatement project with no supervision and without relying on the independent laboratory test results or a client had a close personal or fiduciary relationship with thorn,then conceivably a district court could find that this particular client had put thorn in a position with discretionary authority that then provided thorn the freedom to commit a difficult to detect wrong.
the district court did not make explicit findings,however,regarding the degree of discretion accorded thorn by his clients.thus,we remand this issue to the district court for specific findings consistent with this opinion,including whether any customers entrusted thorn with discretion to complete the asbestos projects without supervision and without relying on the independent laboratory test results to confirm compliance with state and federal regulations 
c.the money laundering guideline 
guideline b,as it existed at the time of thorn sentencing,instructed the sentencing court to increase the base offense level for money laundering based on the value of the funds laundered.specifically,subsection e directed the sentencing judge to increase the base offense level by four points when the value of the funds exceeded but was less than or equal to million,and subsection g directed the judge to add six levels when the value of the funds was more than million but less than or equal to million.sentencing guidelines manual b.it is appropriate to include relevant conduct,as defined in,in this calculation.see generally sentencing guidelines manual,cmt.background conduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of the offense of conviction may enter into the determination of the applicable guideline sentencing range.the background section of the commentary to explained that t he amount of money involved is included as a factor because it is an indicator of the magnitude of the criminal enterprise,and the extent to which the defendant aided the enterprise.id,cmt.background.
the government maintains that,although its trial proof focused on only projects between and,its evidence at trial and sentencing established that thorn laundered funds in connection with at least projects and not merely the that dominated the trial proof during this time period and that thorn abated at least private residences between and,for an average price of per house,as part of the same illegal scheme.the projects involved funds valued at just under million,the amount set forth in the forfeiture count of thorn indictment,and the residential abatements and the other projects,aggregated,involved funds valued at approximately million.thus,under b g,the government argues that the district court should have added six points to the money laundering base offense level of because the value of the funds laundered was greater than million.
the defendant raised concerns before the district court that apprendi new jersey,d,might require the court to include only,the funds identified in the indictment as being subject to forfeiture.as the defendant contends on appeal 
in the context of money laundering,the sentence ultimately imposed is driven by the value of the laundered money.the amount of funds is a constitutionally significant factor which must be plead sic in the indictment and submitted to a jury.in the present case,the government pled and the jury found the proceeds of the money laundering conspiracy to be.the government is bound by its indictment and the jury finding.
directly following the defendant apprendi argument at sentencing,the district court stated that it had some concerns about that as well in light of the facts of this case and the evidence presented,so it found that a adjustment is more appropriate than six.thus,the district court calculated the money laundering guideline level by including only the funds involved in the projects that were the main focus of the trial and by excluding the approximately million for the remaining projects and the or so private home abatements.as a result,because the district court calculated the value of the laundered funds to be more than but less than million specifically,it applied b e rather than g and thus added four points to thorn money laundering base offense level.
as a matter of law we differ with the district court to the extent that it agreed with the defendant argument that apprendi precluded it from including funds derived from uncharged projects.the supreme court held in apprendi that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.at.following defendant sentence,we concluded that apprendi does not apply to enhancements that determine a sentence that is within the applicable statutory maximum and that would otherwise be above the applicable statutory minimum.united states norris,cir,cert.denied,d.thorn was convicted of conspiracy to commit money laundering,in violation of a a i,h.the statutory maximum term of imprisonment for this offense is twenty years.a.if the district court had found,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the value of the laundered funds was over million,as the government maintains it should have done,the bottom of thorn guidelines range would have been below the statutory maximum term of imprisonment,and apprendi would have been implicated only if the sentencing judge had imposed a sentence within the new range but greater than the statutory maximum of months.
the defendant acknowledges on appeal that his apprendi argument was rejected by norris,yet he persists in making the argument.we find that the district court determination that apprendi prevented it from considering the approximately million in calculating thorn money laundering offense level was legal error,in light of norris.we remand to the district court to make factual findings consistent with this opinion regarding whether any of the funds derived from these uncharged projects constitute relevant conduct under.
ii.downward departures 
a district court may impose a sentence outside the range established by the applicable guidelines,if the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind,or to a degree,not adequately taken into consideration by the sentencing commission in formulating the guidelines that should result in a sentence different from that described.sentencing guidelines manual quoting b.the supreme court has clarified,however,that although a district judge retains some discretion in sentencing under the guidelines,
b efore a departure is permitted,certain aspects of the case must be found unusual enough for it to fall outside the heartland of cases in the guideline.to resolve this question,the district court must make a refined assessment of the many facts bearing on the outcome,informed by its vantage point and experience in criminal sentencing.whether a given factor is present to a degree not adequately considered by the commission,or whether a discouraged factor nonetheless justifies departure because it is present in some unusual or exceptional way,are matters determined in large part by comparison with the facts of other guidelines cases.district courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations,especially as they see so many more guidelines cases than appellate courts do.

in view of the district courts institutional advantage,the decision of a district court to depart in a particular case is reviewable under an abuse of discretion standard.id.at.it is not our role to substitute our judgment for that of a district court as to the appropriateness of the sentence imposed.united states galante,cir.the test of discretion asks whether the circumstances relied upon to justify a downward departure are so far removed from those found exceptional in existing case law that the sentencing court may be said to be acting outside permissible limits then,and only then,should we rule it has misused its discretion.id.however,
t he abuse of discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.the question of whether a factor is a permissible basis for departure under any circumstances is a question of law,and a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.t he district court decision to depart may be overturned where the factor relied on by the district court,in light of the circumstances,is not unusual.

money laundering downward departure 
the district court granted defendant motion for a downward departure on the money laundering offense,finding that thorn crime was outside the heartland of the money laundering guideline 
the heartland of crimes that the money laundering sic are intended to encompass are those involving widespread and schemes such as those associated with organized crime,racketeering offenses,or serious drug crimes and conspiracies.that is not the situation here.
the defendant business,asbestos abatement and removal,was at its core legitimate.had defendant operated that business in accordance with the regulations governing the asbestos abatement industry,we would not be here today.the thrust of defendant crime is his violation of those regulations,not engaging in a conspiracy to conduct financial transactions that involved the proceeds of mail fraud with the intent to promote the carrying on of further mail fraud.there is no question that defendant used the money he received through the mail from his customers whom he defrauded by improperly performing asbestos abatement work,and sending them false laboratory test results and assuring that he would he would or had removed the asbestos in compliance with the appropriate state and federal regulations,pay his laborers and staff,office staff,purchase supplies,and finance additional asbestos abatement projects.however,these financial transactions were only tangentially related to the essence of the defendant crime his failure to perform asbestos abatement projects in compliance with appropriate state and federal regulations.nor did the defendant attempt to conceal his fraudulent conduct through the use of these financial transactions.
the crime here is simply not the type of money laundering fraud that would warrant a to sentence.to apply the money laundering guideline to this type of violation when the money laundering computations were derived from that guidelines sic relationship to drug crimes would produce a custodial range that grossly exaggerates the seriousness of the actual conduct.
for all of these reasons and the reasons cited by the defendant in his submissions,the court finds that this case is outside the heartland of the money laundering guideline and therefore will depart downward from the sentence.
thus,although the guidelines calculation performed by the court called for a range of imprisonment between and months,the district court sentenced thorn to months imprisonment on the money laundering count.
we believe that the district court made an error of law in granting a heartland departure in this case,to the extent it based its decision on a finding that thorn offense was atypical,and thus outside of the heartland,because he did not launder the proceeds of serious crimes like drug trafficking and organized crime.in so doing,we make reference to a ruling of this circuit,united states mccarthy,cir,which was decided seventeen days after thorn sentence was imposed and thus could not have been known to the district court at the time of thorn sentencing.mccarthy involved a conviction for,inter alia,embezzling from erisa trust funds and the subsequent laundering of those funds.the defendant sought a downward departure because his conduct was outside of the heartland of typical money laundering conduct.id.at.the district court in that case,however,denied the request.on appeal,the defendant argued that the district court erred as a matter of law by not deeming his money laundering activity to be atypical and not sentencing him instead under the embezzlement guideline,as the guidelines section most applicable to his conduct.in rejecting this argument,we observed that the district court correctly found that the defendant conduct did not represent an atypical money laundering case,since the way in which the funds were laundered was critical to the scheme success.id.at.further,we were not persuaded that the defendant money laundering conviction was atypical because the laundered funds were not the proceeds of serious crimes like drug trafficking and organized crime,because we do not believe the money laundering guidelines are limited only to proceeds derived from drugs or organized crime.see also united states kayode,stating,in a similar case,that the court was not persuaded that the money laundering guideline covers only proceeds from drug or organized crimes and collecting cases cited to with approval in mccarthy,cert.denied,d 
in addition to our recent statement in mccarthy that the money laundering guideline is not limited only to proceeds derived from drugs or organized crime,we note that the commentary to specifically refers to specified unlawful activity a legal term defined at c which incorporates crimes itemized in as well to include a wide variety of crimes,well beyond drug and organized crimes,such as the destruction of aircraft,prohibited transactions involving nuclear materials,and mail fraud the specified unlawful activity underlying thorn money laundering conviction this suggests that the sentencing commission,in writing the guideline,was aware that congress had defined specified unlawful activity quite broadly,and,by not stating otherwise,had incorporated this broad definition into the heartland of the guideline.
further,the guideline applicable to money laundering offenses,provided,at the time of thorn sentencing,for an enhancement to the offense level when drugs were involved in the offense.sentencing guidelines manual b.as the government argues,that the commission provided for an enhancement when the laundered funds derived from drug activity is further evidence that heartland consists of more than just drug crimes.additionally,this guideline,at the time of thorn sentencing,used the value of the laundered funds to determine the seriousness of the crime and did not use the underlying criminal behavior as the measure of the seriousness of the offense.see id.
the defendant in fact concedes that the language of the statute would embrace the conduct for which the defendant was indicted and convicted here,but he asserts that congress intended the statute,which was enacted as part of the abuse act of,primarily to combat large amounts of money being laundered by the drug trade and organized crime.in support of this argument,thorn does not cite any controlling circuit case law,however,and he fails to less.
in light of the foregoing,that money laundering is not limited only to proceeds of serious crimes like drug trafficking and organized crime,we remand for consideration by the district court in accordance with the dictates of mccarthy.
criminal history downward departure 
the government appeals the district court decision to grant thorn a downward departure from criminal history category ii to i.the presentence report psr recommended a criminal history category of ii based on thorn november,conviction for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated and his june,conviction for offering to file a false instrument that falsely represented that his business had the required insurance.although the record suggests that defendant did not expressly move for a downward departure from criminal history category ii to i the district court found that thorn criminal history was overrepresented and was better represented by criminal history category it did not make any findings,however,to explain its conclusion that category ii overrepresented the seriousness of thorn criminal history.in response,the government asked the court to confirm that the judge was downwardly departing from ii to i,and when the court responded,yes,the government said okay.the government offered no objection to this departure at the time of sentencing.
the government concedes,as it must,that provides for a downward departure when a defendant criminal history category significantly overrepresents the seriousness of the particular defendant criminal history.but it argues that the district court offered no reasoning to support its conclusion that category ii overrepresented the seriousness of thorn criminal history.further,the government asserts that there is nothing about the defendant criminal history that would take him outside of the heartland of category ii rather,that thorn previously had been cited for civil violations of both osha and wage regulations and that his conviction involved falsified documentation for his business suggested a particularly high risk of recidivism 
the defendant responds that the government had an opportunity at sentencing to object to the district court decision to grant a downward departure.because the government did not object or oppose the district court decision,the defendant asserts that the government waived any objection to the departure.he does not cite any case law,however,to support this argument.alternatively,the defendant argues that the departure was supported by the credible evidence,considering the age of his previous convictions.
we conclude that the government did not forfeit its objection to the criminal history departure because it had inadequate notice that the district court intended to depart on the ground that thorn criminal history score significantly overrepresented his criminal past.before sentence is imposed,the district court must give the government both notice of the court intention to depart,including the factors that the judge is planning to rely upon,and some brief explanation as to why these factors warrant a departure,and an opportunity to be heard as to why the contemplated departure is unwarranted.united states jagmohan,cir see also united states alba,cir finding that the government had not waived an objection to a departure,even though it had not presented the argument to the court at the time of sentencing,because the government had not received adequate notice of the possibility of departure.as we noted in jagmohan,
the value of prior notice is manifold.first,it will alert counsel to the need to present any available challenge to the accuracy of those factors on which the court intends to rely and to the propriety of their use for a departure.united states kim,cir.just as defense counsel often will alter the argument made to the court at sentencing once counsel is given notice of the court intention to depart upward,see,so too might the focus of the government presentation prior to the imposition of sentence change if it is informed of the court intention to depart downward.for example,notice will direct the government to address the technical questions presented by the guidelines such as whether a departure is permitted on the basis of the factors raised by the sentencing court.furthermore,notice will permit both parties to develop the record further,giving the sentencing court a sounder basis for assessing the contemplated departure and making appellate review of a departure easier.
at sentencing,the district court acknowledged that thorn had raised numerous grounds for downward departure and then stated that another factor is the criminal history.this language suggests that the district court at sentencing was raising for the first time the issue of whether category ii overrepresented the seriousness of thorn criminal history,an issue that thorn had not raised specifically in his sentencing memoranda or orally before the district court.by not informing the government prior to sentencing of its intention to depart downward on the ground that thorn criminal history score overrepresented the seriousness of thorn criminal history and providing the government an opportunity to research and present its opposition to this intended departure,the district court did not comply with jagmohan and alba.thus,we conclude that the government did not forfeit its argument that the district court abused its discretion in granting a downward departure from category ii to see alba,at the government can scarcely be penalized for failing to raise issues before the district court of which it had no notice.hence,the government is entitled to advance these arguments on appeal.
although whether a criminal history score significantly overrepresents the seriousness of a defendant criminal record may be a permissible ground for a downward departure,see sentencing guidelines manual,the district court did not articulate its findings of fact or conclusions of law that support a finding that category ii significantly overrepresented thorn criminal history absent some explanation of its reasoning,we are unable to assess whether the district court abused its discretion in granting a downward departure on this ground.thus,we remand this issue to the district court for specific findings consistent with this opinion.see united states tropiano,cir we will vacate a sentence and remand for resentencing if the district court fails to follow the procedures for making such a departure.united states moore,cir.holding that in making a departure on the ground that defendant criminal history category significantly overrepresents the seriousness of a defendant criminal history,the sentencing judge must state the specific reason for doing so citing c and cervantes,at,cert.denied,d.
iii.defendant rule motion for judgment of acquittal 
the defendant cross appeals the district court denial of his trial motion for judgment of acquittal with respect to the money laundering count.
as we have summarized 
we review a denial of a motion for acquittal to determine whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.a ll reasonable inferences are to be resolved in favor of the prosecution and the trial court is required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government with respect to each element of the offense.united states artuso,cir quoting united states skinner.
united states writers research,cir.
the indictment charged thorn with conspiracy to commit promotion money laundering in violation of a a,which makes it a crime when one,knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity.the indictment named mail fraud as the specified unlawful activity that thorn allegedly sought to promote through his financial transactions.thus,although the government did not charge thorn with mail fraud,it had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that thorn had intended to promote mail fraud through his financial transactions.see united states pierce,cir.
we have found that the language of a a i demonstrates that congress 
sought to reach conduct that went beyond the concealment of proceeds of criminal activity.indeed,the words of this provision of the statute,in conjunction with the definitions provided in c,demonstrate that congress intended to make unlawful a broad array of transactions designed to facilitate numerous federal crimes.
united states skinner,cir footnote omitted skinner involved the use of the proceeds of sales of narcotics to purchase postal money orders and to mail these money orders to pay the source of the drugs,who had fronted the drugs to the seller.we concluded that the money laundering statute covered this conduct,even though any promotion of the drug trafficking conspiracy was de minimis,because the transactions in reality represented only the completion of the sale.id.at.in united states piervinanzi,cir,cert.denied,d,we determined that the transfer of funds overseas did not merge with the underlying bank fraud.we reasoned that since the transfer was integral to the success of both fraudulent schemes,it is undeniable that the attempted transfers were designed to promote the underlying crime of bank fraud.id.
the defendant argues that this circuit as well as several others wrongfully permits convictions for promotion money laundering based merely on evidence that the proceeds of a fraudulent scheme were received and deposited in a financial institution.the defendant urges us to adopt the reasoning of cases from the fifth,seventh,and eleventh circuits and find that promotion money laundering requires the expenditure of unlawful gains with the specific intent that the expenditure will advance and further the unlawful activity the defendant maintains that merely spending money obtained through mail fraud on legitimate office expenses does not,as a legal matter,constitute promotion money laundering.
first,the defendant claim that we wrongfully permit conviction under the money laundering statute upon evidence of mere receipt and deposit of funds is misleading.rather,as skinner and piervinanzi instruct,we demand evidence that the receipt and deposit of laundered funds was made with the intent to promote the specified underlying unlawful activity,be it,for example,by promoting continued illegal activity or by being essential to the completion of the scheme.
moreover,given the deferential standard of review that applies to this appeal,there was ample evidence,drawing all inferences in the government favor,from which a reasonable jury could conclude that thorn and his confederates deposited the funds into their operating accounts with the intent to promote the continuation of the scheme.an office manager,dawn dayter,testified that the funds were used,in part,to finance the next project.when asked if this process would continue for each of the projects that occurred during the course of her employment where improper activities occurred,she replied,yes.and numerous former employees testified that the standard operating instructions from thorn were to promise full compliance with federal and state laws to mail contracts that purported to create a legal obligation to keep this promise to mail falsified test results to clients to perpetuate their belief that this promise had been kept,but to violate regulations to save money and time.thus,a reasonable juror could infer from this evidence that thorn and his cohorts intended,with each deposit,to fund future projects that would similarly involve mail fraud.the deposit was not merely the completion of the scheme but enabled the conspirators to continue conducting the illegal abatement scheme.
thus,we find that the district court did not err in denying thorn rule motion,even under defendant restrictive theory of promotion money laundering.
conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,we vacate the sentence imposed and remand to the district court for resentencing.we affirm the district court denial of defendant rule motion.
thus,all citations will be to the united states sentencing guidelines,unless otherwise indicated.see a a directing the sentencing court to consider,as a factor in imposing sentence,the sentencing range established for the offense as set forth in the guidelines in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.
