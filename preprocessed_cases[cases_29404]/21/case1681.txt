background 
the facts and history of this case are set forth in the opinions of the district court.united states guidice,cr.dlc,wl,at may,united states guidice,wl,at.guidice,along with two,was named in a indictment charging two counts of extortion and two counts of conspiracy to commit extortion.these charges arose out of the defendants alleged efforts on behalf of the gambino crime family to extort money from clothing manufacturers.
in january,shortly before trial was scheduled to begin,guidice agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit extortion,a.as part of the agreement,the government would move to dismiss any open counts against guidice.the agreement stipulated that guidice applicable guidelines offense level was,and that b ased on the information now available to the attorney office,guidice criminal history category was based on these figures,guidice presumptive guidelines sentence would be months in prison,and the parties so stipulated.the agreement noted the parties understanding that neither the probation department nor the court is bound by the above guidelines stipulation,either as to questions of fact or as to the determination of the proper guidelines to apply to the facts,and that the defendant will have no right to withdraw his plea of guilty should the sentence imposed by the court be outside the stipulated sentencing guidelines range of to months.
guidice pled guilty on january.at the plea hearing,guidice acknowledged his understanding that the statutory maximum sentence for the offense to which he was pleading guilty was years,that the plea agreement sentencing calculations were not binding on the court,that his lawyer prediction of the likely sentencing range might not be correct,and that he could not withdraw his plea even if his sentence differed from what was calculated in the agreement.guidice also acknowledged his understanding that the district judge would conduct her own sentencing calculation after receiving the investigation report psr from the probation department probation.guidice,wl,at.
after the judge accepted guidice guilty plea,but prior to sentencing,probation submitted a draft of its psr,which concluded that guidice should be sentenced as a career offender pursuant to of the guidelines.the basis for this conclusion was a new york state conviction for assault that probation found constituted a crime of violence under,but which had not been so categorized by defense counsel and the government when calculating the stipulated sentencing range for the plea agreement.this conviction,in the context of guidice entire record,qualified him as a career offender.the possibility that guidice could be sentenced as a career offender had evidently not been presented to him by his lawyer nor indicated in the agreement.probation conclusion,which was ultimately determined by both defense counsel and the government to be correct,resulted in an offense level of and a criminal history category of vi.under this accounting,the presumptive guidelines sentencing range would be months.
in light of this calculation,defense counsel and the government drafted a new plea agreement that stipulated to a presumptive guidelines range of months,and allowed guidice to move for a downward departure on the grounds that his criminal history category the seriousness of his criminal history or the likelihood of recidivism.guidice,however,rejected the revised plea agreement and instead filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea.the district court denied this motion,united states guidice,wl,and that denial is not appealed here.
guidice subsequently requested the appointment of new counsel,and sent the court a letter stating,among other things,that i recognize that i no angel,but twelve or more years in prison under the psr calculation is a death sentence for me.the court granted guidice request for the appointment of new counsel,and his new attorney filed a new motion to withdraw the guilty plea.the basis for this second motion to withdraw was that prior counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by inaccurately estimating guidice sentencing exposure,resulting in a plea that was invalid because it was neither voluntary nor intelligent.
the district court denied the motion because guidice had failed to meet the prejudice prong of the ineffective assistance test articulated in strickland washington,d,by showing that but for counsel errors he would have gone to trial.guidice,wl,at.the court expressly found that guidice letter stating that a lengthy prison term would be a death sentence did not provide a basis for the court to conclude that there is a reasonable probability that guidice would have chosen to go to trial rather than execute the plea agreement at the time he was afforded that choice.id.the court noted that guidice had not provided any other evidence of prejudice,such as an affidavit representing that he would have chosen to proceed to trial if he had been informed by prior counsel that the draft plea agreement likely contained an error,or a recital of any weaknesses in the government case that would have influenced his decision to proceed to trial.id.the court further observed that it is difficult for a defendant who was made aware of the actual sentencing possibilities of a plea to demonstrate that he suffered prejudice as a result of counsel error.id.at.because guidice had thus failed to demonstrate prejudice,according to the district court,it was unnecessary to decide whether counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness as required under the performance prong of strickland.id.at.while the court thus denied guidice ineffective assistance claim,it indicated that it would entertain a motion for a downward departure at sentencing.id.at.
guidice asked the court to reconsider its decision,and submitted an affidavit swearing that he would have proceeded to trial if he was advised that his guidelines were months.at the sentencing hearing in late june,the district court denied the application for reconsideration.it then asked the parties whether they would like to adjourn the sentencing in order to take time to consider the supreme court decision in blakely washington,d,which held a state guidelines regime unconstitutional and implicitly put in question the constitutionality of the federal guidelines.after both sides said they were prepared to proceed,blakely notwithstanding,the court determined that the range of months recommended in the final version of the psr which was identical to that recommended in the draft psr was consistent with the guidelines.on defense counsel motion,however,the court departed downwardly,based on guidice age and poor health,to a prison term.judgment was imposed accordingly,and guidice timely appeal followed.
ii.arguments on appeal 
on appeal,guidice challenges the district court denial of his motion to withdraw his plea,arguing that ineffective assistance of counsel invalidated the plea,and that the district court erred when it applied the guidelines mandatorily in imposing sentence.guidice argues that the court erred when it determined that he was aware of the actual sentencing possibilities he faced and thus could not demonstrate prejudice.in fact,guidice argues,since both defense counsel and the government concurred in calculating his likely sentencing range at months,he had every
