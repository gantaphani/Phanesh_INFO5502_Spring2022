in this appeal,herbert derman challenges the district court denial of his application for relief.he argues that the supreme court holding in apprendi new jersey,d announced after we rejected his direct appeal but before the expiration of the time within which he was eligible to apply for a writ of that we set aside his conviction.although his appeal is ably argued and raises intricate issues including one that has divided our sister circuits and another that is of first impression at the appellate level,it is in the end unavailing.consequently,we affirm the district court dismissal of the application for relief.
background 
we limn those facts pertinent to the instant appeal,referring readers who crave more exegetic detail to our opinion affirming the petitioner conviction.see united states derman,cir.
beginning in,marcel rosenzweig oversaw an underground greenhouse on property owned by the petitioner.this facility housed a huge operation.the venture prospered for several years.
when word of a marijuana grow leaked in,police officers visited the site.they were thrown off the scent by a legal greenhouse that rosenzweig and his cohorts ran to conceal the illegal activities below.because the officers did not realize what lay beneath,their search revealed only trace amounts of marijuana.
in an abundance of caution,rosenzweig moved the enterprise to a different locus.the culprits continued growing and distributing marijuana until the federal government cracked the case four years later.a federal grand jury sitting in the district of massachusetts soon indicted the petitioner and six other persons including rosenzweig.the indictment charged the defendants with,inter alia,conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana.see a.as part of the conspiracy charge,the indictment specifically mentioned a statutory provision mandating a minimum sentence for conspiracies involving at least marijuana plants.see id.b a.
all the defendants,save only the petitioner,pleaded guilty to the charges.the petitioner maintained his innocence,asserting that he had no knowledge of either the underground greenhouse or its unlawful contents.the district court instructed the jury on the standard issues,but not on the question of drug quantity.the jury found the petitioner guilty on the conspiracy count and on a related forfeiture count 
the jury returned its verdict on july.the district court denied the petitioner motions and scheduled the disposition hearing to take place on march.drug quantity was a contested issue.see united states,cir t he base offense level of a at sentencing should reflect only the quantity of drugs he reasonably foresees it is the object of the conspiracy to distribute after he joins the conspiracy.the relevant measure of drug quantity in this case was the number of marijuana plants involved.leaving recidivism to one side,a defendant convicted of participation in a conspiracy that involves fewer than fifty plants can receive an incarcerative sentence of no more than five years.b d.if the conspiracy involved fifty plants or more,the maximum sentence is twenty years.id.b c.for a conspiracy of plants or more,the maximum sentence is forty years.id.b b.finally,for a conspiracy of plants or more,the maximum sentence is life.id.b a.the number of marijuana plants also can dictate a mandatory minimum sentence five years for plants or more,id.b b,and ten years for plants or more,id.b a.
in this instance,the probation department prepared a presentence investigation report the psi report concluding that the petitioner was responsible for marijuana plants.the petitioner objected,claiming that he could not reasonably have foreseen the vast amounts of marijuana grown underneath his property and elsewhere.on that basis,he argued that his sentence should not be more than five years.see id.b d establishing a default statutory maximum for a quantity of marijuana less than fifty plants.
the district court flatly rejected the petitioner contention.focusing on the fact that plants was the number of marijuana plants needed to trigger a mandatory minimum sentence,see id.b a,the court stated i would have to find that the sky was green to conclude that there were at least a thousand plants that were foreseeable in this conspiracy at the time that the petitioner entered into it that said,the court proceeded to calculate the total number of plants attributable to the petitioner.the court presumed that the petitioner reasonably could have foreseen an output of plants a month a total of plants over the span of the conspiracy.the court then sentenced the petitioner to an incarcerative term of months one month above the applicable mandatory minimum.
the petitioner appealed his conviction,but not his sentence.we rejected his direct appeal on may.derman,at.in the course of that appeal,he assigned no error implicating either the jury instructions or the lower court assessment of drug quantity.
the petitioner had ninety days from the date of entry of our judgment to file a petition for a writ of certiorari to the supreme court of the united states.see.the supreme court decided apprendi on june,within that window.apprendi core holding is that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.at.the petitioner trial seemingly flouted this principle after all,the district court did not instruct the jury on a increased the maximum penalty for the petitioner crime from five years the default statutory maximum to life imprisonment.compare b d with id.b a.the petitioner claims that he instructed his appellate counsel to file a certiorari petition on this ground during the period in which that opportunity was available to him,but that counsel neglected to comply.so ended direct review of the petitioner conviction and sentence.
the petitioner thereafter retained a new lawyer.on april,he launched a collateral attack in the district court.see.he asserted that the court had sentenced him in violation of apprendi,and that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel because his appellate attorney had ignored his instructions to file a petition for a writ of certiorari.
the district court held a hearing on october.ruling from the bench,the court dismissed the petition.three days later,the court elaborated on its reasoning in a written rescript.to summarize,the court rejected the petitioner apprendi claim for three reasons.it held that apprendi could not be applied retroactively to the petitioner habeas claim that the petitioner had waived any and all objections to his sentence by failing to challenge the sentence on direct appeal and that,in all events,the district court failure to submit the drug quantity question to the jury was harmless because the record contained overwhelming evidence that the number of marijuana plants involved in the plot exceeded the number necessary to bring an elevated maximum sentence into play.on much the same basis the court also rejected the petitioner ineffective assistance claim.
this appeal ensued.we granted a certificate of appealability to decide the apprendi issues.see c.
ii.finality 
we begin our analysis by determining the applicability of apprendi to this determination that requires us to decide when the petitioner conviction became final within the meaning of the relevant statute.
whether a convicted defendant may find refuge in a rule of criminal procedure newly announced by the supreme court depends in large part on timing.if the conviction is not yet final when the supreme court announces the rule,then inferior courts must apply that rule to the defendant case.griffith kentucky,d.if,however,the conviction is already final,then the defendant ordinarily may not avail himself of the newly announced rule.teague lane,d 
but words often are chameleons,taking on different shades of meaning in different contexts.the question,then,is how to define the word final in this setting.at the time the court decided teague,the definition seemed clear a conviction becomes final when a judgment of conviction has been rendered,the availability of appeal exhausted,and the time for a petition for certiorari has elapsed or a petition for certiorari filed and finally denied.griffith,at.
but the law,by its nature,evolves over time,and the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,stat,casts a shadow on the griffith definition.in that statute,congress for the first time established time limits applicable to the filing of habeas petitions a prisoner state or federal has one year from the date on which his conviction becomes final within which to seek federal habeas relief see d.in discussing finality in this context,congress employed slightly different terminology in regard to the time limits applicable to state as opposed to federal prisoners.the period for filing a petition from a state court conviction begins to run on the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.d a.the period for filing a petition challenging a federal court conviction is described more tersely that period begins to run from and after the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final id.
in gendron united states,cir per curiam,the seventh circuit determined that the linguistic differences in the two provisions meant that congress intended divergent versions of finality for state and federal convictions.the court reasoned that w here congress includes particular language in one section of an act but omits it in another section of the same act,the language will not be implied where it has been excluded.id.at.since congress used the phrase expiration of the time for seeking such review only in regard to state prisoners,the court concluded that federal prisoners who decide not to seek certiorari with the supreme court will have the period of limitations begin to run on the date the court of appeals issues the mandate in their direct criminal appeal.id.
in kapral united states,cir,the third circuit took issue with this interpretation.the court expressed concern that gendron invited a series of unfortunate results.taken at face value,the gendron rationale means that a federal prisoner can file a collateral attack in the district court and then continue his pursuit of direct review by filing a certiorari petition.id.at.moreover,under that rationale,finality will be defined differently for limitation purposes than for purposes of the teague new rule analysis.id.at.far from gendron rationale creates an artificial distinction between state and federal distinction that congress,given the common origin and purpose of the two aedpa provisions,would have had no reason to draw.id.at.in light of these realities,the court determined that congress intended sections and to operate on the same time line.id.thus,under the third circuit reading of the aedpa,a state or not become final until the later of the date on which the supreme court affirms the conviction and sentence on the merits or denies the defendant timely filed petition for certiorari,or the date on which the defendant time for filing a timely petition for certiorari review expires.id.at.
although the fourth circuit has followed gendron,see united states torres,cir,a clear majority of the circuit courts that have addressed the question have marched in lockstep with kapral.see,kaufmann united states,cir united states garcia,cir united states gamble,cir per curiam united states burch,cir.we too find the kapral formulation the more persuasive.while it would be pleonastic to rehearse the third circuit analysis,we feel obliged to emphasize a factor that has special relevance to the instant appeal the relationship between the finality of the defendant conviction and the announcement of new rules of criminal procedure by the supreme court.
five years after teague was decided,the court made pellucid that a state conviction and sentence become final for purposes of the teague analysis when the availability of direct appeal to the state courts has been exhausted and the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari has elapsed or a timely filed petition has been finally denied.caspari bohlen,d.accordingly,were we to follow gendron lead and distinguish between the finality of state and federal convictions,we would be forced to deny federal prisoners the benefit of a new rule available to similarly situated state prisoners.such a result is,and we do not think that congress intended the nature of the particular sovereign detaining the prisoner to have such a powerful impact on which defendants may avail themselves of a new rule.indeed,we can discern no sensible reason why congress might wish to classify prisoners in this peculiar under the best of circumstances,such a taxonomy would be difficult to administer.
certainly,the minor variation in language between section and section,respectively,does not demand such an awkward result.section directs that a federal court judgment be final and that term has a meaning in federal law.see,griffith,at.hanover ins.united states,cir.section contains the same directive with respect to state court convictions,but finality is a concept that has differing meanings under the laws of the several states.compare,warren state,if one convicted of a crime takes no action to perfect his right to appeal,the statute of limitations begins to run from the date of final conviction,with.ann.defining finality for purposes of state habeas proceedings in a manner similar to d a.thus,congress chose to ensure uniformity by explaining what final means in the context of a federal habeas petition that seeks to challenge a state court conviction.no similar need existed with respect to federal court convictions and,thus,the explanatory language was omitted in section.
we will not paint the lily.we hold that a conviction for a federal defendant who fails to file a petition for a writ of certiorari becomes final when the period in which he seasonably might have done so expires.this levels the playing field as between state and federal prisoners desirous of seeking federal habeas relief.
our construction of section resolves the threshold question presented in this appeal.because the supreme court decided apprendi while the petitioner still had breathing room within which to file a petition for certiorari,his conviction was not yet final at that time.it follows inexorably that the apprendi rule applies to the petitioner case.griffith,at.what remains to be seen is whether apprendi aids the petitioner cause.
iii.the merits 
we next trace the contours of the apprendi error that occurred during the petitioner trial and decide whether it necessitates vacation of the petitioner sentence.
a.the apprendi error.
the government concedes that the petitioner case suffers from a strain of apprendi error.in hindsight,the trial court should have asked the jury to determine,beyond a reasonable doubt,whether the underlying conspiracy involved a drug quantity sufficient to trigger a sentence higher than the default statutory maximum.see united states barnes,cir.explaining the genesis of the default statutory maximum in an analogous context,cert.denied,d see also b d setting maximum for a conspiracy involving fewer than fifty marijuana plants.absent such a determination,the sentence imposed by the district years and one open to question.
the petitioner tries to define the district court error more broadly.he asserts that the court transgressed apprendi by determining the drug quantity that was reasonably foreseeable to him rather than tendering that question to the jury.in other words,he claims that the court should have submitted to the jurors not only the question of drug quantity the conspiracy but also the individualized question of what drug quantity was attributable to him as a coconspirator.we do not agree the apprendi error is far narrower in scope than the petitioner suggests.
in edwards united states,d,the supreme court held that,as long as the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant participated in a conspiracy,and the court sentences him within the statutory maximum applicable to that conspiracy,the court may determine both the amount
