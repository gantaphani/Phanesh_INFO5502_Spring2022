corey wiggin was convicted,after a jury trial,of conspiracy to distribute cocaine.the conspiracy involved at least twenty kilograms of cocaine per year and continued for several years.wiggin,years old at the time of sentencing,received the statutory minimum term of imprisonment of ten years.
on appeal,wiggin presents one challenge to his conviction and one to his sentence.he first argues that the district court,in denying his claim of incompetency to stand trial,misapplied the legal standard by not properly considering whether he had the ability to assist his counsel.the main argument for incompetency was that wiggin suffered mental deficiencies from an accident which led him,against his,to refuse to enter a plea agreement under which he might have received only a sentence.as to his sentence,wiggin urges that ambiguities in the jury instructions and verdict slip could have misled the jury into believing the amount of cocaine involved in the overall conspiracy and the amount attributable to him had to be the same,and that therefore the jury did not truly make a drug quantity finding.we affirm wiggin conviction and sentence.
a.the trial and sentence 
on february,wiggin and six others were charged by indictment with conspiring to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine in violation of a and the government tendered plea agreements to wiggin and some of the other defendants,offering reduced sentences in exchange for cooperation.several of the robert defelice,who had sold wiggin substantial quantities of cocaine,and todd burley,the dealer who had sold to these offers and agreed to testify.wiggin,however,refused.
the government had offered as part of its proposal to wiggin to stipulate that the amount of cocaine involved in his case was grams this stipulation would have permitted the court to sentence wiggin to as little as five years in prison.see b b statutory minimum of five years imprisonment for distribution of amounts from grams up to,but not including,five kilograms.wiggin attorney,who considered the offer very reasonable,communicated it to wiggin and recommended that he accept it.wiggin refused,in part because he believed defelice and burley would not testify against belief he maintained even after his attorney showed him proof that the men had reached plea agreements and had consented to testify.wiggin stated at the competency hearing discussed later that defelice had told him that he had nothing to worry about and that he was going to testify to anything against me.
at trial,the government presented evidence that wiggin had dealt cocaine from through.burley and defelice testified against wiggin.their testimony and that of other witnesses showed that defelice had sold cocaine to wiggin thirty to forty times,that the quantities per transaction varied but towards the end were often eight to ten ounces,and that the largest quantity defelice had sold to wiggin was fifteen ounces.defelice testified that wiggin had told him he subsequently resold the cocaine to multiple people.further,burley testified that wiggin personally brought money to burley home to pay for cocaine at least three times and accompanied defelice to burley home to make payments on at least twenty occasions 
at the conclusion of the trial,the district court instructed the jury that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that wiggin conspired to distribute cocaine.if the jury found that the government had so proved,it had to go on to consider the weight of the cocaine that was involved in the conspiracy and is attributable to the defendant.the court added 
a given amount of cocaine was involved in the conspiracy if the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the conspirators agreed to distribute that amount of cocaine.a given amount of cocaine is attributable to the defendant if he knew or could have reasonably foreseen that the conspiracy involved that amount of cocaine.the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt both that the conspiracy involved a given amount of cocaine and that the defendant knew or could have reasonably foreseen that a conspiracy involved that amount of cocaine.
on september,the jury returned a guilty verdict against wiggin 
we,the jury in the above captioned case,return the following verdicts 
not guilty x guilty 
we,the jury,find that the weight of cocaine involved in the conspiracy described in count one of the indictment and attributable to defendant was 
drug weight 
x five kilograms or more of cocaine 
five hundred grams or more,but less than five kilograms,of cocaine 
less than five hundred grams of cocaine 
based on this drug quantity finding,the district court sentenced wiggin to the statutory minimum of ten years imprisonment,see b a,to be followed by five years of supervised release.
b.the competency issue 
on september,which was a week after the jury returned its guilty verdict but prior to sentencing,wiggin attorney moved pursuant to for a hearing to determine whether wiggin had been competent to stand trial.the attorney and wiggin mother submitted affidavits stating,inter alia,that wiggin had broken his neck in a motorcycle accident and had subsequently suffered memory loss and a reduction in cognitive capacities,had abused marijuana and cocaine for years,had unwisely rejected the favorable plea offer,had had difficulty remembering events and providing answers to his attorney questions,and had not given his attorney important details about the criminal case prior to trial.wiggin attorney attempted to explain the belated timing of his motion in an affidavit,stating that he was first apprised of wiggin memory loss and his reduced cognitive ability on the fourth day of the trial by his mother and his girl friend.
the district court held an initial hearing on the competency motion on june.two psychologists testified for the defense,having examined wiggin after the trial had concluded.the first,alexandria weida,a forensic psychologist for the commonwealth of massachusetts,stated that she had met with wiggin on two occasions and administered various psychological tests,including the test and the wechsler memory scales.she testified that when she asked wiggin whether he understood terms such as conspiracy,he answered in the affirmative but could not provide a coherent explanation when pressed for details.she also said wiggin was confused about the role of his attorney and the consequences of plea bargaining.weida concluded that at the time of the trial,wiggin was not able rationally to understand the proceedings and charges against him and was not competent to fully assist his counsel.
the second psychologist,frederick kelso,met with wiggin in may and also concluded that wiggin had been incompetent to stand trial.kelso cited two causes a mental defect and cognitive deficits caused by mild traumatic brain injury,and the mental disease of cocaine abuse.kelso testified that wiggin had a minimal understanding of the concept of conspiracy.he stated that he had administered a test that showed wiggin had trouble thinking in abstractions the sort of results he observed were very commonly seen in certain kinds of patients who have suffered a traumatic brain injury.kelso opined that wiggin decision to trust defelice assurances that wiggin did have anything to worry about,even after his attorney told him defelice would testify for the prosecution,was connected to wiggin difficulty in thinking in abstractions.kelso concluded that wiggin assessment of the possibility of accepting a plea deal had not been rational.
william ryan,a forensic psychologist with the federal bureau of prisons,testified for the government.ryan testified that he had interviewed wiggin in the fall of and had subjected him to a test called the minnesota multiphasic personality inventory,edition.he stated that wiggin results indicated that he had basic comprehension skills and could understand and consistently answer questions and he was exaggerating any mental illness he suffered,suggesting either a cry for help or some deliberate attempt to portray himself as very mentally ill.ryan testified that he had spoken with staff members at the prison where wiggin was incarcerated and had been told that wiggin functioned adequately and understood directions.he also testified that,during an interview,wiggin was able to count backward by threes,indicating an ability to concentrate,and was able to give adequate definitions of legal terms such as perjury,witness,verdict,and sentence.wiggin was unable adequately to define several other legal terms when first asked,but when ryan explained them to him and then asked later if he remembered what they meant,wiggin was able to recall the definitions.
according to ryan,wiggin said during the interview that he had not trusted his attorney at trial but later realized his attorney had been trying to help him.asked on whether he found wiggin decision to trust his friends and family instead of his attorney irrational,ryan responded it may not have been a good decision,but there was no irrational,you know,mental illness entering into that decision.based on,inter alia,the testing he administered,his interview of wiggin,and his interviews of prison staff,ryan opined that wiggin suffered from depressive symptoms,stress disorder,and a cognitive disorder possibly due to head trauma.however,he concluded that wiggin was nonetheless functional,rational,and competent.he testified that wiggin conversed,he discussed,he remembered,he retained what he learned,it all impressed me as a person who was competent to stand trial.
after hearing this testimony,the district court found that the defense had not established by a preponderance that wiggin was incompetent to stand trial.however,the court noted that it was troubled that the record was not developed with respect to wiggin possible organic brain injury the testifying psychologists had inferred such an injury,but no physician had examined wiggin for purposes of the competency hearing.the court therefore ordered that wiggin be examined by albert drukteinis,a physician and forensic psychiatrist,to establish whether or not he does suffer from some mental defect or disease and offer an opinion on whether wiggin was mentally competent to stand trial.
drukteinis examined wiggin pursuant to the district court order and submitted a report on august.on september,he testified that wiggin was competent to stand trial drukteinis said wiggin has some problems with memory,concentration,maintaining attention,though there was no real evidence that those problems were because of traumatic brain injury.drukteinis report stated that wiggin had told him that at the time of trial he did not think the criminal charges he faced were serious,and that he thought so in part because his friends and his parents,his fiancée,and not seem particularly worried.asked by defense counsel whether he thought wiggin faith in his family rational,drukteinis replied i do see where that would be irrational.i think people listen to lots of different sources in that kind of a predicament.drukteinis testified that wiggin failure to assist defense counsel stemmed more from wiggin lack of trust in his attorney than from any mental disease or defect.
wiggin himself also testified at the september hearing.asked by his attorney what he thought when he was told his friends were going to testify against him,wiggin replied i did think it was true.he stated that defelice had told him he would not testify for the prosecution and that he had no reason to doubt defelice assurances.asked why he rejected the plea offer and went to trial,wiggin replied i just,to be honest with you,i do know.i just,my family and my friends,i was listening to them.
following this testimony,wiggin counsel summarized his competency argument,saying wiggin faith that his friends would not testify against him was related to his mental defects.he did know me,i was saying things he did want to hear,wiggin attorney argued.he rejected that and that an irrational position.
after listening to defense counsel summation,the district court ruled from the bench that wiggin had been competent to stand trial.the court stated 
i think wiggin has made a series of just terrible decisions that are certainly not the product of informed consideration,but i credit drukteinis evaluation and i credit ryan evaluation that he was competent to stand trial at the time of trial.he is competent to stand trial now i find by a preponderance of the evidence that he simply did not suffer from a mental disease or defect that renders him mentally incompetent that is,that he was or is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceeding against him or to assist properly in his defense.
defense counsel objected that ryan and drukteinis made determinations of competency at the time of examination,not at the time of the september trial.the court replied a s drukteinis made clear,there nothing to suggest that wiggin condition was any different at the time of trial than it was at the time ryan examined him or drukteinis examined him.
a.the competency determination 
the determination of a criminal defendant competency to stand trial is governed by the standards laid out at this provision states that at any time prior to sentencing,the defendant or the attorney for the government may file a motion for a hearing to determine the mental competency of the defendant.the court shall grant the motion,or shall order such a hearing on its own motion,if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant is incompetent.id.a.it further provides 
if,after the hearing,the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant is presently suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense,the court shall commit the defendant to the custody of the attorney general for hospitalization.
we uphold a district judge determination of competency after a hearing unless that determination is clearly erroneous.united states santos,cir.wiggin,as we understand his argument,contends that the district court erred in concluding that he met the second prong of the competency he was able to assist properly in his defense.he argues that the error is demonstrated by two things that the court referred to the understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings prong of the test a few times without also referring at the same time to the second prong,and that the evidence showed that wiggin could not in fact assist his counsel.he also argues that point demonstrates that the district court incorrectly applied the law to the facts,and that as a result our review in this instance should be plenary,instead of for clear error.
none of these arguments has any merit.as to point and the standard of review issue,the district court at the time it made its competency determination specifically and correctly described both prongs and issued a finding as to each it stated that wiggin simply did not suffer from a mental disease or defect that renders him unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceeding against him or to assist properly in his defense.further,the court also described the second prong correctly at least three other times during the hearing it noted during separate colloquies with defense counsel and an expert witness that competency requires the capacity to adequately participate in one defense and to meaningfully assist in one defense it also concluded the competency hearing by reiterating that it had found that wiggin did not have a mental disease or defect that deprived him of the ability to adequately assist in his defense.
this is not an instance in which a court articulated what is said to be an incorrect rule of law.in that circumstance,a matter of pure law,we would review the question de novo.here the trial court articulated the correct standard.indeed,we have upheld findings of competency where the district court offered far less of an articulation,saying the court need not parse the definition of competency nor arrive at specific findings as to each component.united states,cir reviewing for plain error see also id.at not only can we ascertain no pl
