steven camacho,jamie rodriguez,and antonio feliciano collectively,the defendants appeal from a decision of the united states district court for the southern district of new york keenan,holding that it lacked jurisdiction to grant the defendants motion for a new trial pursuant to federal rule of criminal procedure because the motion was untimely under both the current and the former versions of the rule.for the reasons that follow,we affirm.
background 
on july,after a trial,the defendants were convicted of conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin,distributing and possessing with intent to distribute heroin,using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime,and possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number.in addition,the jury found camacho and rodriguez guilty of conspiring to suborn perjury and conspiring to obstruct justice by preventing the testimony of a witness through threats and intimidation.on november,the district court sentenced camacho and rodriguez to months imprisonment,five years of supervised release,a fine,and an assessment of per count of conviction on december,it sentenced feliciano to months imprisonment,five years of supervised release,and a special assessment.
the defendants appealed.on appeal,we vacated the defendants convictions for using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime in light of the supreme court decision in bailey united states,d,affirmed the remainder of the convictions,and remanded for on the remaining counts.see united states hernandez,cir.our mandate issued on july.
on remand,the district court enhanced all of the defendants sentences pursuant to b,for possession of a dangerous weapon in connection with a drug offense.this enhancement increased camacho and rodriguez sentences on the drug trafficking counts to months imprisonment and feliciano sentence on the drug trafficking counts to months imprisonment.the sentences on the other counts remained the same.the defendants appealed,and we affirmed the district court amended judgment by summary order.see united states hernandez,cir.this mandate issued on july.
on july,approximately five years after the jury returned its verdict,the defendants moved for a new trial under federal rule of criminal procedure on the ground of newly discovered evidence.the version of rule in effect at the time the defendants filed their motion the current rule provided,any motion for a new trial grounded on newly discovered evidence must be filed within years after the verdict or finding of guilty.acknowledging that their motion was untimely under this version of the rule,the defendants argued that the timeliness of their motion was governed instead by the former version of the rule in effect at the time of the subject crimes and all prior court proceedings the former rule or former version.under that version,a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence was timely as long as it was filed before or within two years after final judgment.amended.
the district court found it unnecessary to decide which version of rule controlled,holding that the motion was untimely under each.specifically,the district court explained that under the former rule,the judgment would have become final,and the limitations period would thus have begun to run,upon the issuance of the court of appeals mandate of july,which affirmed the district court judgment in part,vacated it in part,and remanded for resentencing.accordingly,the district court denied the defendants rule motion for a new trial.see united states camacho,jfk,wl,dist.lexis.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
the primary issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in holding that final judgment under former rule entered upon the issuance of our first,as opposed to our second,mandate.we review this question,as one of law,de novo.see united states monus,cir see also united states pardue,cir united states burke,cir united states,cir.
we have previously interpreted the meaning of final judgment as used in the former rule.in romero united states,cir per curiam,we held that when an appeal is taken from a criminal conviction,the period runs not from the date of the entry of the judgment of conviction in the district court,but from the date of the issuance of the mandate of affirmance by the appellate court.id.at.we then expressly declared in united states reyes,cir,as we had suggested in romero,that the relevant date is the issuance date,not of the appellate court judgment,but rather of its mandate.id.at.finally,in united states lussier,cir,we join ed our sister circuits in holding that,in the absence of a stay of the mandate,the supreme court action on a petition for certiorari has no bearing on the timeliness of a rule motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.id.at.
the defendants argue that final judgment could not have entered prior to the issuance of our second mandate,affirming the district court resentencing of the defendants,because the supreme court has made clear that a judgment of conviction includes both the adjudication of guilt and the sentence.specifically,the supreme court in deal united states,d,set forth this definition of the term conviction in the context of c,which provides for a longer term of imprisonment i n the case of a criminal defendant second or subsequent conviction under the subsection.id.at.a plurality of the court offered a similar description of a criminal judgment in teague lane,d,to support its conclusion that the retroactivity approach to determine when a decision announcing a new rule should be given retroactive effect to be applied to habeas corpus petitions challenging convictions should apply as well to collateral attacks on criminal sentences.id.at.in addition,the court interpreted the term judgment to include the district court sentence in flynt ohio,d and berman united states,with respect to the final judgment rule,allowing for appellate review of final criminal judgments.
in support of their position,the defendants also rely on the fourth circuit holding in united states dodson,cir.the defendant in dodson was convicted of five counts of a multicount indictment and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment.following a direct appeal,the fourth circuit,by mandate issued on june,upheld dodson conviction and sentence on one count,vacated his conviction and sentence on another count,and affirmed dodson convictions on the remaining counts but vacated his sentences on those counts and remanded for resentencing.id.at.after resentencing,the fourth circuit issued a mandate on october,affirming the district court amended sentence.id.eleven months later,in september,dodson filed a motion under,attacking his conviction.id.pursuant to the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act aedpa,this motion had to be filed not more than one year from the date on which the judgment of conviction bec ame final.generally,in the fourth circuit,where a federal prisoner does not petition for certiorari in the supreme court,as dodson did not,his judgment of conviction becomes final under upon the issuance of the court of appeals mandate.dodson,at.the fourth circuit was thus presented with the question,almost identical to the one at issue here but in the context of,of whether the defendant conviction became final upon the issuance of the first or of the second mandate.the court chose the later date,explaining 
b y the time of the enactment of the aedpa in,it was well recognized that a criminal judgment includes both a conviction and its associated sentence,so that a judgment of conviction can not be final with respect to a given count until both the conviction and sentence associated with the count are final.this meaning is both longstanding and continuous in the law.
considering the weight of other case law,we,however,are not convinced by the defendants argument.the supreme court has explicitly recognized that f inality is variously defined,and that like many legal terms,its precise meaning depends on context.clay united states,d.thus,for example,although a criminal judgment becomes final for p
