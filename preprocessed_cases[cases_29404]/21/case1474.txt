defendant robert hertular appeals from a judgment of conviction entered on april,by judge naomi reice buchwald after a jury trial in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.hertular stands convicted of four crimes conspiracy to import five kilograms or more of cocaine,see a,distribution of five kilograms or more of cocaine,knowing that it would be imported into the united states,see id.a,b b ii forcibly impeding or intimidating a federal officer,see and obstruction of justice,see id.b.he is presently incarcerated serving a prison term of months years.through counsel,hertular challenges his conviction on the grounds that the trial evidence was insufficient to support the jury guilty verdicts on the counts of a forcibly impeding or intimidating a federal officer and b obstructing justice the district court erroneously instructed the jury on the elements of obstruction of justice and the sentence is infected by procedural error and,in any event,is substantively unreasonable.in a pro se submission,hertular raises myriad other challenges.
because we conclude that the trial evidence,even when viewed in the light most favorable to the government,was insufficient to support a guilty verdict under the count count three,we are obliged to reverse the conviction on that count and to vacate the sentence and to remand for resentencing in light of that reversal.we reject hertular remaining appellate arguments as without merit and,therefore,affirm his conviction in all other respects.
background 
evidence supporting the challenged counts of conviction 
the trial evidence convincingly demonstrated that in the period between and january,belizean national robert hertular conspired with others to import more than six tons of cocaine into the united states.because hertular raises no sufficiency challenge to his conviction on the conspiracy and substantive counts of narcotics trafficking,we do not detail this evidence further.instead,we focus on the evidence adduced to prove the challenged counts of forcibly impeding or intimidating a federal officer and obstruction of justice.we summarize that evidence in the light most favorable to the government.see,jackson virginia,d united states jones,cir.
hertular initial meetings with dea agent williams 
in,hertular was charged by belizean authorities with trafficking in kilograms of cocaine,which drugs hertular admitted belonged to him and were destined for the united states.after securing bail release,hertular initiated cellular telephone contact with special agent vincent williams,then assigned by the drug enforcement administration dea to belize to investigate drug trafficking between that country and the united states.at that time,agent williams had never met hertular,much less given him the agent unlisted cell phone number.
as a result of the call,agent williams and hertular met on september,at which time hertular expressed an interest in cooperating with united states authorities.hertular generally described his drug trafficking operation,identifying various belizean government officials as confederates.he admitted to transporting large quantities of cocaine by plane and speedboat from colombia to belize and to using vhf radios and satellite phones to communicate with his fellow traffickers during transport operations.
agent williams and hertular met again on december,at which time hertular gave the agent a vhf radio and satellite phone that he indicated had been used to coordinate a may cocaine shipment.at this meeting,however,agent williams informed hertular that the dea would not use him as a confidential informant.the agent had no further contact with hertular until april.
april,hertular uncharged threat to agent williams 
on april,agent williams was surveilling the belize residence of confidential informant liston mccord when he observed hertular entering the premises.both agent williams and mccord testified at trial to the events that ensued.
specifically,mccord testified that,once inside his home,hertular told him that a vehicle belonging to dea agents was parked outside the premises.when mccord feigned indifference,hertular advised him to get rid of the car.
moments later,agent williams called mccord to inquire about defendant presence.although mccord took this call out of hertular presence,when the conversation concluded,hertular asked the informant if he was cooperating with the dea.mccord denied any such involvement,and hertular again advised him to get rid of the surveilling agents,going so far as to offer mccord hand grenades to achieve that goal.when mccord responded that there was no need to get that drastic,hertular stated that he could get mccord anything he wanted.trial tr.at.hertular even offered to get rid of the agents himself,but mccord declined,stating that he had nothing to hide from the dea.id.
after hertular left mccord home,agent williams followed defendant and signaled him to pull over into a parking lot.there,agent williams warned hertular to be mindful of his associations.id.at.agent williams testified that this incensed hertular,who replied that he could associate with anybody he want ed and reminded agent williams that he was a guest in belize.id.hertular stated that he was tired of the dea and the american embassy and that he was willing to kill a dea agent or an american embassy employee.id.at.in response to this threat,agent williams warned hertular that if he were to make a hit on the agent,hertular should make sure that he does it right the first time because he wo get a second chance.id.
agent williams reported hertular threat to american embassy officials.in response,the embassy threat level was raised and extra security measures were implemented.for example,hertular photograph was circulated to all embassy employees,and a rule was implemented,requiring all agents and embassy personnel to travel in pairs.
december,hertular charged threat to agents williams and kelly 
by the end of,the dea had opened a formal investigation into hertular drug trafficking activities and was conveying its findings to assistant united states attorneys in the southern district of new york with a view toward securing a federal indictment.
on december,hertular called dea agent raymond kelly recently assigned to belize on his cell phone and requested a meeting near the residence of another dea agent.agent kelly cell phone number,like that of agent williams,was unlisted and should have been unavailable to hertular.similarly,there was no obvious way in which hertular could have obtained the residential addresses for dea agents stationed in belize.
agents kelly and williams met hertular that same day at the designated site.as the three men sat in kelly car,hertular stated that he knew he was the subject of a dea investigation and that an indictment was likely to be returned against him in the near future.he told the agents that he did want that to occur.id.at.when agent kelly denied any investigation,hertular promptly rebutted the denial by playing the tape recording of an intercepted conversation between kelly and a confidential dea informant regarding ralph fonseca,a senior belizean government official with whom hertular was suspected of trafficking drugs.hertular explained that dea cellular and been tapped,that a call had been intercepted between agent williams and an assistant united states attorney discussing the possibility of hertular indictment,that individuals within the american embassy routinely provided hertular with information,and that he knew the identities of several dea informants.hertular stated that he wanted the investigation against him stopped,in return for which he would consider cooperating with the dea.
in the ensuing conversation,hertular admitted that,since,he had been a member of the fonseca organization,a group involved in drug trafficking and money laundering in the united states and europe.hertular implicated a former belizean prime minister and police commissioner in the organization and identified the belize alliance bank as the entity used for money laundering.hertular stated that his further cooperation would depend on dea agreeing in writing to various demands,for example,allowing defendant to live in europe.the agents indicated that they would have to consult with their superiors and the prosecutors.meanwhile,they asked hertular for a copy of the recorded conversation that he had played for them.
hertular left the scene to make a copy of the requested recording.when he returned a half hour later,his attitude was confrontational.specifically,hertular refused to give the agents a copy of the requested tape,stating that he intended to give it instead to fonseca.further,hertular made statements to the agents that are the basis for the charge in this case.specifically,hertular told the agents it would be in their best interest to back down from this investigation because he would have to protect himself.id.at.when agent kelly asked hertular if he was suggesting that the safety of dea agents in belize was in jeopardy,hertular replied that the agents better protect themselves and watch their backs,because the fonseca organization would hire hit men from colombia or mexico to take the agents out.id.agent kelly dismissed hertular threats with an expletive,whereupon the agents ended the meeting.
the lacked arrest authority in not attempt to take hertular into custody for threatening their lives.they did,however,advise embassy officials of these threats.as a result,not only was the rule again put into effect,but additional dea agents and arms were dispatched to belize,guards were stationed outside agents homes,new procedures were implemented for agents leaving their homes or driving around town,and all agents were required to use phone cards,rather than their cell phones,to conduct business.
court proceedings against hertular 
arrest,extradition,and trial 
on january,approximately two weeks after the events just detailed,a grand jury sitting in the southern district of new york returned an indictment charging hertular with two counts of drug trafficking,forcibly impeding and intimidating a federal officer,and obstruction of justice.in response to a formal request from the united states,belizean authorities arrested hertular on january,and,on or about july,extradited him to the southern district of new york to face trial.hertular was tried on a superseding indictment and,on march,a jury found him guilty on the four counts for which he now stands convicted 
sentencing 
hertular report recommended an offense level of,which,with a criminal history of i,yielded a guidelines sentencing range of life imprisonment.defendant disputed this calculation insofar as his offense level reflected a enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon pursuant to b and another enhancement for obstruction of justice pursuant to.as to the first challenge,hertular argued that there was no evidence that he ever actually possessed the grenade he offered to supply mccord.as to the second,he submitted that a enhancement would constitute impermissible double counting in light of his conviction for obstruction of justice.the district court rejected both arguments as meritless.moreover,because it concluded that the obstruction of justice enhancement was surely appropriate,the district court observed that the weapon possession enhancement was irrelevant as hertular guidelines range would have provided for life imprisonment even at offense level.sentencing tr.at.
the district court did not,however,sentence hertular to life imprisonment.after hearing from the parties as to how the factors specified in a should be weighed,the district court decided that a sentence was sufficient to serve the sentencing goals identified in that statute.accordingly,it sentenced hertular to prison terms of months on each of the two drug trafficking counts,months for forcibly impeding a federal officer,and months for obstruction of justice,all terms to run concurrently.
ii.discussion 
a.the sufficiency challenges 
hertular asserts that the trial evidence was insufficient to support the jury guilty verdicts on the counts of forcibly impeding or intimidating a federal officer and obstruction of justice.the rule of constitutional sufficiency derived from the due process clause states that no person may be found guilty except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.in re winship,d see also jackson virginia,at.a defendant raising a sufficiency challenge bears a heavy burden because,while we review such a claim de novo,we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,and we will uphold a conviction if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.emphasis in original accord united states jones,at united states hardwick,cir.
applying this stringent test,we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support hertular conviction for forcibly impeding a federal officer but sufficient to support his conviction for obstruction of justice.
forcibly impeding or intimidating a federal officer 
title a states that any person who forcibly assaults,resists,opposes,impedes,intimidates,or interferes with a federal officer while the officer is engaged in or on account of the performance of official duties is guilty of a crime hertular asserts that the trial evidence was insufficient to satisfy the statute force element because no proof was adduced that his threats to murder dea agents posed immediate harm.as discussed below,our precedent applying to threats requires some proof of the assailant present ability to inflict injury giving rise to an objectively reasonable apprehension of immediate harm.because such proof was lacking in this case,we are obliged to identify merit in this part of hertular sufficiency challenge and to reverse his conviction on the count.
as the supreme court has observed,congress purpose in enacting was expansive to protect both federal officers and federal functions.i ndeed,furtherance of the one policy advances the other.united states feola,d united states walker,cir noting purpose to deter harm to certain federal officials and to deter interference with their law enforcement activities united states sommerstedt,cir the goal of congress in enacting was to give maximum protection to federal officers.internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,in united states bamberger,this court recognized,in accordance with general principles of statutory construction,that t he word forcibly in section necessarily limit ed the proscribed acts to fewer than would fit the definition of the unmodified verbs alone,cir.
in bamberger,we declined to construe the statute force element so narrowly as to require the actual use of physical force to support a conviction.we held that threats of force could also support a conviction in certain circumstances.see id.for a threat to satisfy the force element of,however,we required proof that the alleged threat would objectively inspire fear of pain,bodily harm,or death that is likely to be inflicted immediately.see united states walker,at.
those core principles still inhered in the statute after its amendment,which,in relevant part,used the term simple assault to classify a misdemeanor violation.as we noted in united states chestaro,cir,that term incorporated its definition,which included a threat to inflict injury upon the person of another which,when coupled with an apparent present ability,causes a reasonable apprehension of immediate bodily harm.id.at internal quotation marks omitted see also united states delis,cir discussing meaning of assault.thus,in united states temple,cir,we applied walker in reviewing a sufficiency challenge to a misdemeanor conviction.in sum,our bamberger through the principle that,for a threat to qualify as a a misdemeanor offense,the government must prove that the defendant instilled a reasonable apprehension of bodily harm likely to be inflicted immediately.
in its appellate brief,the government devotes considerable effort to demonstrating that hertular statements to agents kelly and williams satisfy the first prong of this test,a point that defendant does could.the trial evidence would certainly permit a reasonable jury to find that hertular threats were real and that he had the ability to put them into effect.thus,the threats could instill an objectively reasonable fear of pain,bodily harm,or death in any united states official stationed in belize who heard them.indeed,to the extent subjective responses can be relevant to objective assessments,the significant protective actions taken by united states authorities in belize in response to hertular charged threats support this conclusion.see united states walker,at observing that the victim subjective state of mind is not irrelevant to determining whether the amount of force threatened or displayed was sufficient to make fear reasonable.thus,hertular sufficiency challenge necessarily focuses only on the second prong of the test described above,which requires some evidence that,at the time the charged threats were made,it was apparent that defendant had sufficient present ability to act on them to instill in the agents an objectively reasonable apprehension of immediate harm.see united states temple,at united states chestaro,at.
discussing this immediacy requirement in temple,we stated that a n implied threat to use force sometime in the indefinite future is insufficient to support a conviction.united states temple,at.in that case,the victim received a voice mail message stating,i gon na f you up.id.at.we ruled that such a temporally vague threat did not pose the sort of immediate or imminent harm required by the statute.id.in so holding,we noted that most convictions under involved encounters.id.we did not,however,suggest that every threat would necessarily satisfy the immediate or imminent harm requirement for a conviction.indeed,a contrary conclusion must be drawn from temple approving citation to dictum in united states walker,which,in the context of a encounter,see at,indicated that a jury considering a count might appropriately be charged that a threat of bodily harm in the future,such as i will get you after work,would not be sufficient to support a guilty verdict,united states temple,at quoting united states walker,at.thus,even in the case of a encounter,the immediacy requirement demands some evidence that the threat was accompanied by an apparent present ability to inflict the injury.id.at emphasis added see united states bamberger,at observing that threat of harm is not forcible unless it is a present threat that defendant has the ability to carry out immediately.
the eleventh circuit has similarly construed,holding in united states fallen that the threat to inflict the injury must be coupled with an apparent present ability actually to inflict it,cir internal quotation marks omitted.fallen concluded that the apparent present ability requirement was satisfied in that case by evidence that the defendant had not only threatened to kill agents if they did not leave his property but had stated that he was in possession of a firearm.id.at 
the facts in this case are not at all akin to fallen.when hertular told agents kelly and williams that it was in their interest to back down from their investigation into his narcotics trafficking because he would have to protect himself,he did not indicate by word or deed that he was then armed or even that he was contemplating any present action against the agents.trial tr.at.rather,hertular threatened the agents with death at some unspecified future time,telling them to watch their backs,because if they continued to conduct their investigation,the fonseca organization would hire hit men from colombia or mexico to take them out.id.this is somewhat analogous to the threat of future harm referenced in the jury charge approved in walker to illustrate circumstances inadequate to support a conviction.see united states walker,at see also united states temple,at.
the government nevertheless argues that a jury could have inferred from the totality of the circumstances that it was objectively reasonable for the agents to have feared immediate harm.hertular was,after all,a drug trafficker who had,on two occasions,explicitly threatened to kill united states officials.he communicated the charged threat at a meeting with the agents that took place at night in a car in a foreign country in a relatively deserted area.moreover,hertular had demonstrated his ability to gain access to dea agents private telephone numbers and home addresses.further,he had offered to supply another person with a deadly weapon,a hand grenade,to get rid of dea agents,a fact that agent williams knew at the time of hertular charged threat.
to be sure,these circumstances would have instilled in the agents an objectively reasonable fear that hertular homicidal threats were serious and real.under our precedents,however,that is not sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the agents were being threatened with immediate harm.hertular threats implied two conditions precedent to the execution of his homicidal threats the dea would have to continue its investigation into hertular activities and,if it did,the fonseca organization would hire hitmen in other countries and transport them to belize to carry out the threat.because such conditions suggest the expected passage of some time,a jury could not reasonably find that,when hertular threatened the agents,he had the apparent present ability to take their lives so that the agents would have an objectively reasonable fear of immediate harm.no different conclusion is warranted from the agents dismissal of hertular threat.even if this action might have signaled to hertular that the dea would not cease its investigation,hertular reference to hiring and transporting hitmen from other countries,coupled with the total lack of evidence that hertular was then armed or ready to take action against the agents,precluded a jury finding that the agents faced an objectively reasonable threat of immediate harm.see united states temple,at united states walker,at.
in identifying a sufficiency defect with respect to hertular conviction,we by no means suggest that persons may threaten the lives of federal law enforcement officers with impunity,as long as they do not signal a present ability to inflict bodily harm.quite the contrary.as this court noted at oral argument,a b criminalizes threaten ing to assault,kidnap,or murder a federal law enforcement officer with intent to impede,intimidate,or interfere with the performance of official duties.because this statute contains no force element,there is no burden to prove a defendant present ability to execute the threat giving rise to an objectively reasonable fear of immediate bodily harm.
in a submission,the government concedes that on its face,a b covers hertular conduct.government june,rule j letter at.it notes simply that conduct can violate more than one statute,and it urges us to uphold the conviction in light of our recognition that the statute purpose is to prohibit any acts or threats of bodily harm that might reasonably deter a federal official from the performance of his or her duties.id.at quoting united states walker,at.this excerpt from our walker decision can not be read in isolation.specifically,it can not override our precedents holding that threatened conduct satisfies the force element of only when there is some evidence of the defendant present ability to execute the threat so as to give rise to an objectively reasonable fear of immediate harm.because such evidence is lacking in this case,we are compelled to reverse hertular conviction.
obstruction of justice 
to the extent the same threatening conduct was the basis for hertular obstruction conviction pursuant to b defendant submits that the trial evidence was insufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find the requisite specific intent to interfere with the communication of information relating to the commission of a federal offense to a united states law enforcement officer.see united states genao,cir noting that b conviction requires a specific intent to interfere with the communication of information.hertular argues that the evidence at most demonstrated an intent to stop the agents from pursuing an indictment against him.this challenge merits little discussion.
the trial evidence shows that,on december,when hertular threatened the lives of dea agents,he knew that,in pursuit of an indictment against him and his confederates,information was regularly being communicated by confidential informants to dea agents in belize and from dea agents to federal prosecutors in new york.indeed,hertular advised the agents that tape recordings of such conversations had been intercepted,and he even played one such recording for them.on this record,a reasonable factfinder could easily have concluded that when hertular told the agents it was in their best interest to back down from their investigation and warned them that hit men from colombia or mexico would be hired to take them out,trial.tr.at,his specific intent was to hinder or prevent not simply the filing of an indictment but any communication to or among federal law enforcement officials that could lead to his indictment.see generally united states veal,cir observing that b criminalizes threats intended to prevent person from being an eyewitness or investigating official with regard to federal crime under investigation.accordingly,we reject hertular sufficiency challenge to his obstruction conviction as patently without merit.
b.the jury instruction challenge 
in charging the jury as to the specific intent element of obstruction of justice under b,the district court gave the following instruction 
by specific intent,i mean that the defendant must have acted knowingly and with the unlawful intent to hinder,delay or prevent the communication to a federal law enforcement officer or judge of the united states of information relating to the commission or possible commission of a federal offense.the defendant must have known or foreseen that the information was likely to result in or affect a judicial proceeding.however,the government need not prove that an official proceeding was pending or about to be instituted at the time of the defendant actions.i instruct you that a criminal prosecution,of which an indictment is a part,qualifies as a judicial proceeding.
trial tr.at emphasis added.hertular submits that the emphasized language manifests error because the language of b,unlike that of other obstruction statutes,does not specify an intent to affect an official or judicial proceeding.see,d specifying intent to obstruct a judicial proceeding id.a a referencing intent to prevent the attendance or testimony of any person in an official proceeding id.a b requiring intent to prevent the production of a record.in an official proceeding id.a b making it federal crime to kill or attempt to kill with intent to retaliate against any person for providing specified information to law enforcement officer pending judicial proceedings.the argument is unconvincing for at least two reasons.
first,hertular not only failed to object to the challenged omission that would normally limit our review to plain error,see.d,b his counsel specifically endorse d it.trial tr.at stating,in response to government request to add highlighted language to charge,with respect to that change,i endorse that change.such endorsement might well be deemed a true waiver,negating even plain error review.see generally united states quinones,cir discussing true waiver concept.as this court observed in united states giovanelli,a defendant who has invited a challenged charge has waived any right to appellate review,cir internal quotation marks omitted united states ferguson,cir observing,in discussing invited error,that when defendants obtain precisely what they affirmatively sought,it ill behooves them now to complain united states young,cir holding that not even the plain error doctrine permits reversal on the ground that the trial court granted a defendant request to charge.
second,even on plain error review,hertular challenge fails because he can not demonstrate that the purported error is plain,much less that he sustained any prejudice or that the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of his judicial proceedings was called into question.see united states olano,d discussing four prongs of plain error analysis accord united states thomas,cir en banc.to be sure,f states that f or purposes of this section,which includes b,an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense.see united states gonzalez,cir holding that reaches conduct intended to prevent communication of information during investigatory stage.nevertheless,in arthur andersen llp united states,a b case,the supreme court ruled that there was a difference between saying that a judicial proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted and saying that a proceeding need not even be foreseen,d internal quotation marks omitted.the court ruled that a defendant could not act with the mens rea necessary to violate b if,when engaging in the obstructive conduct he does not have in contemplation any particular official proceeding in which the obstructed information might be material.id.at.following arthur andersen,this court in united states quattrone,cir,identified error in an instruction that told a jury that it need not find any nexus between the defendant actions and the pending investigations to convict him of obstruction pursuant to b.
the trial record indicates that the challenged language in this case was proposed by the government,endorsed by the defendant,and included in the charge by the district court in order specifically to ensure the nexus finding specified in arthur andersen.to the extent the charge may have imposed an intent requirement beyond that strictly required by arthur point we need not conclusively decide on this does not even attempt to show that he was prejudiced by the district court placing a heavier burden on the government,see united states kaplan,cir noting that defendant asserting plain error generally bears the burden of persuasion as to prejudice,or that the challenged charge seriously affected the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of his judicial proceedings,see united states quinones,at.
accordingly,even if hertular endorsement of the challenged charge did not waive appellate review,we identify no plain error in the district court b instruction.we therefore affirm the obstruction of justice count of conviction.
c.the sentencing challenge 
hertular submits that his sentence is infected by procedural error and,in any event,is substantively unreasonable in light of sentences imposed on certain confederates.because we vacate hertular sentence in light of our reversal of his conviction,we do not decide the question of substantive reasonableness in advance of resentencing.nevertheless,to facilitate the district court task on remand,we here explain why we identify no merit in defendant procedural challenges.
the decision to vacate and remand for resentencing makes it unnecessary to consider hertular substantive reasonableness challenge 
where we overturn one or more counts of conviction but leave others in place,our general rule has been to remand for de novo sentencing proceedings.see burrell united states,cir.as we have explained,
a district court sentence is based on the constellation of offenses for which the defendant was convicted and their relationship to a mosaic of facts,including the circumstances of the crimes,their relations to one another,and other relevant behavior of the defendant.when the conviction on one or more charges is overturned on appeal and the case is remanded for resentencing,the constellation of offenses of conviction has been changed and the factual mosaic related to those offenses that the district court must consult to determine the appropriate sentence is likely altered.for the district court to sentence the defendant accurately and appropriately,it must confront the offenses of conviction and facts anew.
united states quintieri,cir accord united states draper,cir.
in reversing hertular conviction,we recognize that the conduct proved to support this count was clearly criminal under b,and most likely under a b.thus,although our reversal of hertular conviction changes the constellation of offenses relevant to sentencing,the factual mosaic may be little altered.nevertheless,mindful that the law entrusts district courts,not courts of appeals,with the primary responsibility for weighing the totality of circumstances relevant to sentencing,we conclude that,even in these circumstances,we must vacate the defendant sentence and remand the case to the district court so that it may decide,in the first instance,whether a conviction on three rather than four counts affects its assessment of the sentencing factors detailed in a see gall united states,d recognizing district court responsibility to decide what weight to accord a factors united states cavera,cir en banc noting appellate court secondary role in sentencing court of appeals do es not consider what weight we would ourselves have given a particular factor,but considers only whether the factor,as explained by the district court,can bear the weight assigned it under the totality of circumstances.
only when the district court has made that assessment and entered a new final judgment would it be appropriate for a panel of this court to consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.if hertular were to appeal a sentence imposed on remand as substantively unreasonable,he would bear the burden identified by our recent precedents to show that the challenged sentence can not be located within the broad range that can be deemed reasonable.united states jones,at see united states cavera,at.
hertular procedural challenges lack merit 
hertular asserts procedural error in the district court calculation of his sentencing guidelines range.see gall united states.at.because these calculations are not affected by our decision to reverse defendant conviction,we address these arguments now to facilitate the district court task on resentencing.
obstruction of justice 
relying exclusively on his argument that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions either for interfering with and intimidating a federal officer in violation of or for obstruction of justice in violation of b,hertular asserts that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level for obstruction of justice pursuant to.it is not clear that hertular preserved this argument in the district court.see united states gallerani,cir holding that objection is preserved for appellate review only when it is articulated in the trial court with sufficient distinctness to alert the court to the nature of the claimed defect even if we were to resolve that question in defendant favor,however,no relief would be warranted.
first,we observe that force is not required to find obstruction under.therefore,the sufficiency problem we identify in this element of hertular conviction is irrelevant to the application of to defendant guidelines calculation.
second,for the reasons discussed supra at,we determine that the evidence was sufficient to prove hertular guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of obstruction of justice in violation of b.we therefore easily conclude that the evidence was sufficient to permit the district court to find obstruction by the lesser standard applicable to guidelines determinations.see united states garcia,cir holding that j udicial authority to find facts relevant to sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence survives booker.accord united states jones,at.
b possession of a dangerous weapon 
hertular submits that the district court erred in applying a b enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon to his offense level calculation.he asserts that there was no evidence to support an inference that he actually possessed the weapon at issue,the hand grenades he offered to supply mccord.hertular argument fails for two reasons.
first,the evidence was sufficient to support an inference that it was more likely than not that hertular actually or constructively possessed the offered hand grenades.see united states herrera,cir a defendant is subject to a enhancement under b for possession of a dangerous weapon if he constructively possessed the weapon by having dominion or control over the item itself,or dominion over the premises where the item was located alteration,ellipsis,and internal quotation marks omitted see generally united states jones,at,deferring to district court preponderance finding where probability of certain facts existence was more likely than not.by his own admission,hertular was a significant drug trafficker in an organization with such deep roots into the belizean government that could supply him with clandestinely recorded conversations between united states agents assigned to belize and federal prosecutors in new york.that same organization had sufficiently corrupted employees of the united states embassy in belize as to give hertular access to otherwise unavailable information about the identities of government informants and the residences and contact numbers for dea agents.under these circumstances,the evidence was sufficient to support an inference that when hertular said he could supply mccord with grenades,defendant was not talking idly.see gall united states.at clarifying that standard applies to appellate review of all sentencing decisions united states legros,cir explaining that standard reviews questions of fact only for clear error.rather,hertular more likely than not had such grenades in his possession,either actually or constructively through.see generally united states paulino,cir constructive possession exists when a person knowingly has the power and the intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object,either directly or through others.emphasis,ellipsis,and internal quotation marks omitted united states pimentel,cir holding that pinkerton theory of liability applied to prove that defendant carr ied weapon within meaning of c.indeed,that conclusion is reinforced by the purpose for which hertular offered the grenades to remove dea agents then on mccord property.unless hertular had the grenades in his actual or constructive possession,there would have been no point in offering them to effect a task that defendant urged be achieved promptly.
second,even if the evidence could not support an offense level increase to pursuant to b,that would not,by itself,have made any difference to the calculation of hertular guidelines sentencing range.as the district court observed,an offense level of would also have yielded a recommended lifetime sentence.thus,any misapplication of b to this case would have constituted a harmless error in the guidelines calculation not warranting resentencing.see united states lenoci,cir observing that alleged d grouping error was harmless where offense level would have been same even absent error.
b role enhancement 
hertular challenge to the district court application of a role enhancement to the calculation of his offense level merits little discussion.b provides for a enhancement if a defendant was a manager or supervisor but not an organizer or leader in a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.hertular does not dispute that the drug conspiracy for which he was found guilty involved five or more participants.he argues only that he should not have been treated as a manager or supervisor because the enhancement was not applied to a similarly situated confederate prosecuted before a different judge.we are not persuaded.
a defendant is properly considered as a manager or supervisor under b if he exercised some degree of control over others involved in the commission of the offense or played a significant role in the decision to recruit or to supervise participants.united states blount,cir alterations,ellipsis,and internal quotation marks omitted.the fact that other persons may play still larger roles in the criminal activity does not preclude a defendant from qualifying for a b enhancement.see united states wisniewski,cir.
in general,we review a district court determination that a defendant deserves a leadership enhancement under de novo,but we review the court findings of fact supporting its conclusion only for clear error.see united states paccione,cir.where,as in this case,the defendant did not challenge the applic
