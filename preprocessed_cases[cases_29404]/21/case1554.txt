dupes was arrested in colorado in august of on unrelated federal charges of interstate travel to have sex with a minor.following that arrest,the federal government initiated an investigation of him in new york.officials executed a search warrant at his manhattan apartment and seized a home computer containing child pornography.dupes pled guilty to possession of child pornography and received a sentence of months imprisonment.he also pled guilty to the charges stemming from his colorado arrest for interstate travel to have sex with a minor and received a sentence of twelve months imprisonment,to run consecutively with the child pornography sentence.in october of,dupes was released from prison and began serving a term of supervised release.
in may of,dupes and five of his in the internet holdings scheme were charged by indictment with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities fraud.dupes pled guilty to both counts.at an october sentencing hearing,judge pauley sentenced dupes to months imprisonment to be followed by three years of supervised release,running concurrently on both counts in addition to the mandatory and standard conditions of supervised release,the court imposed several special conditions relating to dupes prior sex offenses.the court adopted these special conditions from the presentence report that the probation office had prepared.special condition required dupes to undergo a evaluation and participate in a sex offender or sic mental health treatment program approved by the probation officer.it further required him to waive his right of confidentiality in any records for mental health assessment and treatment imposed as a consequence of this judgment to allow the probation officer to review the defendant course of treatment and progress with the treatment provider.special condition directed dupes to 
register with the state sex offender registration agency in any state in which he resides,is employed,carries on a vocation or is a student,as directed by the probation officer.the defendant shall adhere to the registration and notification procedures of the state in which he resides.

discussion 
dupes challenges his special conditions of supervised release on three grounds.first,he claims that the imposition of special conditions of supervised release relating to his prior sex offenses violates the double jeopardy clause.second,he asserts that the requirement that he waive therapeutic confidentiality in connection with sex offender treatment exceeds the sentencing court authority under d and section b of the sentencing guidelines.third,he argues that the condition requiring his registration as a sex offender with state agencies violates the tenth amendment.dupes also attacks the constitutionality of his restitution order,claiming that the mandatory victim restitution act mvra violates the sixth amendment under the principles established in the line of cases.finally,dupes has submitted a supplemental pro se brief raising various other challenges to his conviction and sentence.
conditions of supervised release 
standard of review 
the propriety of conditions of supervised release are judged by an abuse of discretion standard.united states brown,cir.although the district court enjoys broad discretion in imposing these conditions,its discretion is not untrammeled and our court will carefully scrutinize unusual and severe conditions.united states myers,cir internal citations and quotation marks omitted.any error of law constitutes an abuse of discretion.see united states johnson,cir.a challenge to conditions of supervised release that presents an issue of law is generally reviewed de novo,but we review dupes claims for plain error because he failed to raise them before the district court at sentencing.united states sofsky,cir under the plain error standard,before an appellate court can correct an error not raised below,there must be an error,that is plain and that affects substantial rights.if these conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to correct the error,but only if it seriously affects the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.see id.at citing jones united states,d.
the double jeopardy claim 
the double jeopardy clause protects a defendant from successive punishments for the same criminal offense.united states dixon,d.dupes claims that the district court violated the prohibition against double jeopardy by imposing a punishment relating to the two sex offenses for which he previously had been sentenced.we can not agree.the challenged conditions of supervised release are an authorized punishment for dupes securities fraud conviction,not a successive punishment for his prior sex offense convictions.
the district court has broad authority pursuant to d to impose any condition of supervised release that it considers to be appropriate,provided such condition reasonably related to certain statutory sentencing factors listed in section a and a of that title,involves no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary to implement the statutory purposes of sentencing,and is consistent with pertinent sentencing commission policy statements.d myers,at.th
