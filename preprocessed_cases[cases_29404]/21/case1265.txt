defendant appellant aafia siddiqui appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york berman,entered on september,convicting her after a jury trial of one count of attempted murder of united states nationals in violation of b one count of attempted murder of united states officers and employees in violation of one count of armed assault of united states officers and employees in violation of a and b one count of using a firearm during a crime of violence in violation of c and three counts of assault of united states officers and employees in violation of a.the district court sentenced her principally to years imprisonment.siddiqui urges this court to reverse her convictions and,failing that,to vacate her sentence.we address five of the arguments that siddiqui raises on appeal here and the remaining issues in an accompanying summary order.
background 
offense conduct 
around dusk on july,afghan national police anp detained aafia siddiqui,a united pakistani national,in ghazni city,afghanistan,on suspicion of attempting to attack the governor of ghazni.when police took her into custody,siddiqui possessed,among other things,various documents that discussed the construction of weapons,referenced a mass casualty attack,and listed a number of new york city landmarks.afghan authorities brought siddiqui to an anp facility for questioning.later that evening,the governor of ghazni delivered the materials found in siddiqui possession to the united states army.
the following morning,the united states dispatched a team to the anp facility with the objective of interviewing siddiqui and ultimately taking her into american custody.the team most dressed in military fatigues consisted of two fbi agents and members of a military special forces unit.afghan officials brought the team to a poorly lit room partitioned by a yellow curtain.the room was crowded with afghan officials,and unbeknownst to the americans,siddiqui was sequestered unrestrained behind the curtain.
the presence of a large number of afghan officials led members of the american team to believe that they had been brought to the room to discuss the terms of their access to siddiqui.one of the team members,a chief warrant officer,moved to a chair near the curtain dividing the room.after quickly glancing behind the curtain and seeing nothing,he set down his m rifle and turned to engage the afghan officials in conversation.moments later,siddiqui gained control of the rifle,aimed it at members of the american team,shouted,and fired.the team interpreter lunged at and struggled with siddiqui.as the interpreter wrestled with her,the chief warrant officer drew his sidearm and shot siddiqui in the stomach.
team members then attempted to restrain siddiqui,who was fiercely resisting and screaming statements.one witness recalled siddiqui stating,i am going to kill all you americans.you are going to die by my blood.another recounted that siddiqui yelled death to america and i will kill all you motherfuckers.
eventually,the americans were able to subdue siddiqui enough to begin to render emergency medical aid to her.after providing preliminary treatment at the scene,the americans transported her to a number of military bases in afghanistan to undergo surgery and receive further care.on july,american forces moved siddiqui to bagram airfield to recuperate.
while recovering at bagram,siddiqui was guarded by an fbi team.she was tethered to her hospital bed in soft restraints.during the course of her stay at bagram,siddiqui provided a number of incriminating,statements to two members of the security team.in particular,she asked about the penalty for attempted murder stated that she had a number of documents in her possession at the time of her arrest and recognized some of them when shown to her said that she had picked up a rifle with the intention of scaring the american team and escaping and noted that spewing bullets at americans was a bad thing.
the government filed a sealed criminal complaint against siddiqui in the southern district of new york on july.on august,the government transferred siddiqui to the united states for prosecution.a month later,siddiqui was indicted.
soon after the indictment was filed,the district court ordered that siddiqui undergo psychiatric evaluations of her competence to stand trial.in a report issued on november,leslie powers opined that siddiqui was not currently competent,citing,among other things,siddiqui reports of visual hallucinations.later,powers revised her assessment,finding that siddiqui was malingering to avoid prosecution.other experts arrived at the same conclusion,although one expert commissioned by the defense opined that siddiqui was not competent.the district court held a competency hearing on july.after canvassing the relevant evidence,the court found siddiqui competent to stand trial.
in advance of trial,the district court ruled on a number of motions,some of which are relevant here.siddiqui first moved to dismiss all of the counts of the indictment.as to count one,siddiqui claimed that the attorney general failed to timely issue the required written certification that her offense attempted murder of united states nationals was intended to coerce,intimidate,or retaliate against a government or a civilian population.d.siddiqui also contended that counts two through seven,charging violations of,and c,should be dismissed because the statutes do not have extraterritorial application under the circumstances of her case.the district court denied siddiqui motions.
the district court also considered the government motion in limine to admit certain documents and other evidence recovered from siddiqui at the time of her arrest by afghan officials.these documents,some of which were in siddiqui handwriting and bore her fingerprints,referred to attacks on the united states and the construction of various weapons.the court found this evidence admissible pursuant to federal rule of evidence b to show siddiqui motive,intent,identity,and knowledge.in finding the documents admissible,the court rejected the argument that the evidence would cause siddiqui unfair prejudice,concluding that the documents were no more sensational than the crimes charged.the court also noted that it would instruct the jury that the documents were not to be considered as propensity evidence.
at trial,the government presented six members of the american interview team who testified that siddiqui gained control of the chief warrant officer rifle and fired at them.three more witnesses who did not directly observe the shooting testified that they heard m rifle shots.a government expert testified that the fact that no gunpowder residue was found on the curtain hanging in the room did not necessarily indicate that an m had not been fired because someone standing between the curtain and the weapon could have absorbed the residue.the government also introduced the b documents discussed above 
the defense put forth a forensic metallurgist who,based on the lack of forensic evidence of a discharge of a m rifle at the crime scene,testified that he did not believe an m had been fired in the room.in particular,he found it implausible that someone could discharge an m rifle in a room without bullet fragments or gunpowder residue being recovered by authorities.the defense also introduced deposition testimony of an anp officer that when siddiqui was arrested she possessed documents describing how to make explosive devices,among other things,and that while in afghani custody she made statements and asked not be turned over to the united states.he also stated that he saw an american soldier walk behind the curtain prior to hearing shots fired,although he did not directly observe the shooting significantly,the officer testified that he observed a technician remove two rifle shells from the scene.
against the advice and over the objection of her attorneys,siddiqui took the stand to testify in her own defense though her testimony at times lacked focus,she was able to provide her version of the events that transpired on july.according to siddiqui,she was sitting behind a curtain in a room at the anp facility when she heard american voices.she feared being taken into american custody and peeked through an opening in the curtain with the hope of finding an escape route.siddiqui testified that she was then shot from multiple directions.she stated that she never picked up,aimed,or fired an m rifle at the americans.
siddiqui claimed that she could not confirm that she possessed documents at the time of her arrest in afghanistan because she was in a daze.ja.she stated that the bag in which the documents were found was not hers but rather was given to her.when confronted with the document referencing mass casualty attacks and listing new york city landmarks,siddiqui testified that it was a possibility that the document was in her own handwriting.ja.
after the defense rested,the government presented its rebuttal case.two fbi agents who were members of siddiqui security detail during her recovery at bagram recounted several incriminating statements that siddiqui made to them.before receiving this testimony,the district court held a hearing to determine whether siddiqui gave these statements voluntarily at that hearing,the two fbi agents testified,as did siddiqui.the district court determined that siddiqui statements were voluntary.
on february,the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts of the indictment.the district court sentenced siddiqui on september.in addition to a number of other enhancements,the court applied the terrorism enhancement pursuant to.in applying the enhancement,the court found that siddiqui offense was calculated to influence the conduct of the government by intimidation,namely,attempting to frustrate the interview team efforts to detain her.further,based on a number of statements siddiqui made before and at the time of the shooting,the court determined that siddiqui conduct was calculated to retaliate against the united states government.the district court sentenced siddiqui principally to years imprisonment and five years of supervised release.
siddiqui timely appealed her convictions and sentence.
ii.discussion 
denial of siddiqui motion to dismiss the indictment 
siddiqui raised below,and now reasserts,several challenges to the indictment.according to siddiqui,the district court should have dismissed count one,which charged a violation of,because the united states attorney general did not timely issue the certification required by d.she also argues that the remaining counts are deficient because the underlying statutes do not apply extraterritorially in an active theater of war.we disagree.
section d provides that n o prosecution for any offense described in this section shall be undertaken by the united states except on written certification of the attorney general that such offense was intended to coerce,intimidate,or retaliate against a government or civilian population.siddiqui relies on speedy trial principles to conclude that a prosecution is commenced at the time of arrest or the filing of formal charges.but siddiqui argument here encounters an obstacle the original complaint on which siddiqui was arrested did not charge a violation of.the first instrument to do so was the indictment,which was filed the same day the attorney general issued the d certification.
siddiqui has an answer to the problem.she points out that the statute requires certification prior to a prosecution for an offense described in this section.d emphasis added.in her view,the attorney general is required to issue the certification before an accusatory instrument describing facts that could constitute a violation of is filed,regardless of whether that instrument actually charges a violation of.siddiqui reasons that because the criminal complaint filed on july,described conduct proscribed by,the attorney general certification filed the day of the indictment was untimely.
siddiqui argument offers an unusual reading of what appears to be straightforward statutory language a reading that would undercut the very purpose of the provision.section d requirement that the attorney general issue a certification before prosecution for any offense described in shall be undertaken is most naturally read as a requirement that the attorney general issue the certification either at the time of or before the filing of the first instrument charging a violation of.this view furthers the purpose of d namely,ensuring that the statute reaches only terrorist violence inflicted upon united states nationals,not s imple barroom brawls or normal street crime.see conf,at,reprinted in.
under siddiqui interpretation of the provision,the attorney general would have to issue the certification any time someone engaged in conduct that could be covered by the statute.this would deprive the attorney general of the opportunity to sort through the facts of each case to determine if it merited certification and prosecution under the statute.more simply put,siddiqui interpretation would undercut d primary objective.accordingly,the district court did not err in denying siddiqui motion to dismiss count one of the indictment.
siddiqui next contends that counts two through seven of the indictment should be dismissed because the charging statutes and c do not have application extraterritorially in an active theater of war.this argument is without merit.
congress has the authority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial boundaries of the united states.united states yousef,cir quoting eeoc arabian am.oil,d.the ordinary presumption that laws do not apply extraterritorially has no application to criminal statutes.united states al kassar,cir.when the text of a criminal statute is silent,congressional intent to apply the statute extraterritorially must be inferred from the nature of the offense.id.quoting united states bowman.
the statutes underlying counts two through seven apply extraterritorially.subsequent to the filing of siddiqui brief,we held that applies extraterritorially.al kassar,at.we reasoned that the nature of the offense protecting personnel from harm when acting in their official capacity implies an intent that the statute apply outside of the united states.id.we see no basis for expecting congress to have intended to limit these protections to personnel acting within the united states only.for the same reason,applies extraterritorially.see united states benitez,cir see also united states hasan,d.like,the nature of the offense protecting united states officers and employees engaged in official duties from harm implies a congressional intent that apply outside of the united states.see al kassar,at.
as for,which criminalizes the use of a firearm during commission of a crime of violence,every federal court that has considered the issue has given the statute extraterritorial application where,as here,the underlying substantive criminal statutes apply extraterritorially.see,united states belfast,cir united states ahmed,cr.pkc,wl,at march,united states mardirossian,d.we see no reason to quarrel with their conclusions.
siddiqui argument that the statutes,even if generally extraterritorial,do not apply in an active theater of war is unpersuasive as the government points out,it would be incongruous to conclude that statutes aimed at protecting united states officers and employees do not apply in areas of conflict where large numbers of officers and employees operate.the district court appropriately denied siddiqui motion to dismiss counts two through seven of the indictment.
admission of documents under federal rule of evidence b 
the district court admitted documents allegedly found in siddiqui possession that explained the construction and use of various weapons and described a mass casualty attack on a number of new york city landmarks for the purpose of demonstrating siddiqui knowledge,motive,and intent.siddiqui argues that her defense that she never picked up and fired the chief warrant officer rifle removed those issues from the case and thus admission of the documents was improper.
a district court evidentiary rulings encounter trouble on appeal only where the district court abuses its discretion.united states mercado,cir.a district court abuses its discretion when its evidentiary rulings are arbitrary and irrational.id.but even when an evidentiary ruling is manifestly erroneous,the defendant will not receive a new trial if admission of the evidence was harmless.cameron city of new york,cir.
federal rule of evidence b provides that evidence of a defendant prior crimes,wrongs,or other acts can not be used to prove that a defendant was a bad fellow and most likely remains one that he has a criminal nature or propensity and the acts in question are consistent with his nature or tendency towards crime.however,this type of evidence may be admissible for other legitimate purposes,such as demonstrating motive,opportunity,identity,intent,and knowledge.id.under our inclusionary approach,all other act evidence is generally admissible unless it serves the sole purpose of showing a defendant bad character.united states curley,cir 
a defendant may,however,forestall the admission of rule b evidence by advancing a theory that makes clear that the object the b evidence seeks to establish,while technically at issue,is not really in dispute.see united states colon,cir.for example,a defense theory that the defendant did not commit the charged act effectively removes issues of intent and knowledge from the case.see id.at united states ortiz,cir.siddiqui defense was just that i did fire the m.
but even assuming that siddiqui defense theory effectively removed any issue of her intent or knowledge,the documentary evidence remained relevant to demonstrate siddiqui motive.motive has been variously defined as the reason that nudges the will and prods the mind to indulge the criminal intent,united states benton,cir internal quotation marks omitted the rationale for an actor particular conduct,united states awan,cir and an emotion or state of mind that prompts a person to act in a particular way,charles alan wright and kenneth graham,federal practice and procedure federal rules of evidence.although it does not bear directly on the charged elements of a crime,evidence offered to prove motive is commonly admitted.united states salameh,cir.and unlike issues of knowledge and intent,the defendant motive an explanation of why the defendant would engage in the charged conduct becomes highly relevant when the defendant argues that he did not commit the crime.
for instance,in salameh,the defendants were charged with a conspiracy to bomb the world trade center.id.at.the district court admitted documents possessed by the defendants that bristled with strong sentiment.id.at.on appeal,we found those documents admissible to demonstrate the conspiracy motive.id.
here,the documents the government introduced pursuant to rule b detail,among other things,the construction of fertilizer and plastic explosives.one document in particular discusses radioactive bombs,biological weapons,and chemical weapons.that document also contains the phrase mass casualty attack and lists a number of new york city landmarks,including grand central terminal,the empire state building,the statute of liberty,and the brooklyn bridge.taken together,these documents,which were in siddiqui possession at the time afghan officials took her into and some of which were in her handwriting,supply a plausible rationale for why siddiqui would fire a rifle at the american interview team,namely,she harbored an animus.this motive was relevant to the ultimate issue in dispute at trial whether siddiqui picked up and fired the m rifle at the american interview team.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the documents pursuant to rule b 
but even if we agreed with siddiqui that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the documents,that would not end the matter.there would remain the question of whether the error was harmless.an evidentiary error is harmless if the appellate court can conclude with fair assurance that the evidence did not substantially influence the jury.united states cadet,cir internal quotation marks omitted.several factors bear on the inquiry whether the evidence was tied to an issue that was plainly critical to the jury decision whether that evidence was material to the establishment of the critical fact or whether it was instead corroborat ive and cumulative and whether the wrongly admitted evidence was emphasized in arguments to the jury.curley,at internal quotation marks omitted.but the most critical factor is the strength of the government case.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
here,although the government by its own admission repeatedly referenced the documents introduced at trial,government br,the jury also had ample testimony before it regarding statements siddiqui made at the time of the shooting from which it could conclude that siddiqui harbored an animus towards the united states.and most importantly,the strength of the government case was overwhelming.among other evidence,six members of the american interview team testified that siddiqui gained control of the chief warrant officer rifle and fired at them.another three government witnesses who did not observe the shooting testified that they heard m rifle shots.moreover,after siddiqui testified,the government introduced the testimony of two fbi agents who had interviewed siddiqui.according to those agents,siddiqui,among other things,asked what the penalty for attempted murder was and noted that spewing bullets at americans was a bad thing.
siddiqui counters that her forensic expert opinion that an m rifle had not been fired in the room effectively neutralized the government case against her.however,this forensic expert testimony was undermined by one of siddiqui own witnesses,who testified that two rifle shells were recovered from the room,and by a government expert testimony that the absence of certain forensic evidence from the room was not necessarily inconsistent with the firing of a weapon.
siddiqui also asserts that our decision in united states colon,cir,requires us to grant her a new trial.she argues that colon mandates that we assess the strength of the government case without reference to the government of siddiqui or the incriminating statements she made at bagram and that colon requires a new trial because the admission of the documents forced her to testify and she was harmed by doing so.we disagree.
in colon,the defendant was charged with heroin distribution.id.at.his defense was that he did not engage in the charged act.id.at.nevertheless,the district court admitted evidence concerning two prior instances in which the defendant had sold heroin to demonstrate knowledge and intent an obvious error.id.at.the defendant then testified,and,in the words of his counsel,the assistant attorney made a jackass out of him.id.at brackets in original.specifically,the cast doubt on the defendant credibility and delved deeply into the circumstances surrounding the defendant prior involvement with heroin.id.because the record in colon demonstrated that the defendant case was badly damaged by the erroneous admission of the evidence,and because the defense may have felt that there was no alternative but to have the defendant testify as a result,we granted the defendant a new trial.see id.at.
here,we need not resolve the issue of whether colon necessitates that we measure the strength of the government case without reference to either siddiqui or the admission of the incriminating statements she made at bagram.even without that evidence,the government case against siddiqui can only be fairly characterized as devastating.
we also disagree with siddiqui claim that colon requires a new trial because the admission of the b evidence forced her to testify and her defense was badly damaged by that testimony.unlike in colon,the introduction of the b evidence here did not necessitate siddiqui testimony from an objective,strategic standpoint.the b evidence was somewhat cumulative on the issue of whether siddiqui harbored an animus,given that numerous witnesses testified as part of the government that she made statements during the shooting incident.further,even after the introduction of the b evidence,defense counsel advised siddiqui not to testify,we
