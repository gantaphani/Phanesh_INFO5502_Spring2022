following a guilty plea on a weapons charge,angel romero galindez,who many years earlier had four times over been convicted of murder,was sentenced as an armed career criminal to twenty years imprisonment.claiming an assortment of errors permeated the proceedings below,romero galindez appeals,asking this court to vacate his guilty plea and sentence.having carefully considered the matter,we affirm.
background 
since,romero galindez,who was convicted of committing four murders between the ages of sixteen and seventeen,had been serving time in the puerto rico state correctional system in,the then year old,had been granted parole and was staying at some type of rehabilitation center.according to romero galindez,he received a call at the center from his sister,who expressed concern for her life following a gang at the housing project where romero galindez had grown up.worried,romero galindez left the center to speak with the involved gang members and,once the issue was resolved,reportedly contacted his probation officer to turn himself in.
on march,puerto rico police officers,having learned that romero galindez,a state fugitive because of his departure from the rehabilitation facility,was residing at the public housing project,went there and arrested him.romerogalindez consented to a search of the apartment,which resulted in the seizure of an ak assault rifle and ammunition.he admitted the rifle was his.
federal authorities stepped in and romero galindez was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g,and the armed career criminal act,e.following plea negotiations,romero galindez,who was represented by counsel throughout all court proceedings,waived his right to a trial by jury and sought to plead guilty.the plea agreement indicated that the minimum term of imprisonment required by statute was no less than fifteen years and no more than life in prison.it also reflected the parties agreement that should romero galindez not be found an armed career criminal,the government would recommend he be sentenced at the higher end of that range,while the defense would advocate for the lower end.the parties stipulated,however,that should romero galindez turn out to be an armed career criminal,the parties would recommend a sentence.
the change of plea hearing took place on january,before a magistrate judge.upon questioning,romero galindez informed the judge that the plea agreement had been explained to him and that he understood what it said.the government reiterated that,in the event romero galindez was found to be an armed career criminal which defense counsel conceded was a near guarantee,the parties were suggesting the mandatory minimum sentence.the judge went on to explain the penalty faced by romero galindez.she indicated that the g charge carried a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment and three years supervised release but,if romero galindez was found to have violated the armed career criminal act,then you considered a career criminal,and then the statutory maximum does not apply.after some more back and forth,romero galindez pled guilty and the judge found him qualified to do so.
the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation.in it,she indicated that romero galindez expressed his understanding of the maximum penalties,which the report stated was not less than fifteen years imprisonment or more than life,with a term of supervised release of not more than five years.the report recommended the guilty plea be accepted,which the district court judge then did.
the presentence investigation report psr issued.romero galindez base offense level was put at but the enhancement for his armed career criminal status brought him up to.with three points taken off for acceptance of responsibility,the total offense level ended up at.the psr noted the statutory minimum penalty was fifteen years and the maximum was life.the guideline range,given the total offense level of and criminal history category of vi,was to months imprisonment fifteen to seventeen and a half years.the report also noted that the statutory term of release was not more than five years,and the guideline range for supervised release was two to five years.
romero galindez sentencing hearing took place over three days,the important date for our purposes being august,when his sentence was handed down though the government stood by its sentence recommendation,the district judge was unconvinced.emphasizing romero galindez four prior murder convictions and the fact that an ak is an offensive weapon,the judge indicated the statutory minimum would not be a sufficient deterrent.though the judge went through the guidelines calculation delineated in the psr,he was clear that the court is going to provide a statutory sentence,not a guideline sentence.he then sentenced romero galindez to months twenty years in prison,with five years of supervised release to follow.
romero galindez timely appealed,challenging both the validity of his plea and the reasonableness of his sentence.
validity of plea 
romero galindez says his plea was not knowing and voluntary because the judge failed to inform him of the statutory minimum fifteen years and maximum life at the change of plea hearing,and got the maximum term of supervised release wrong,calling it three years instead of five.the government,for unknown reasons,only addresses the second half of this argument.while it does not dispute that the term of supervised release was stated incorrectly,it claims it does not matter because it is clear from the record that romero galindez was aware of the correct term and the difference between the stated and actual term of years is not so great.
since romero galindez did not object or seek to set aside his plea below,review is for plain error only.united states santiago,cir.the rubric is familiar there must be an error,that was plain,which affected substantial rights,and seriously impacted the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.
the error here is plain.rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure provides that at the change of plea hearing the court must inform the defendant of,and determine that the defendant understands any maximum possible penalty,including imprisonment,fine,and term of supervised release.b h.the court must do the same for any mandatory minimum penalty.b i.none of this was done here.while the magistrate judge explained that the g maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment would not apply if romero galindez was found to be an armed career criminal as he had been charged,she never went on to say what the mandatory minimum and maximum penalty would be in that event.and,as the government concedes,the judge also misstated the maximum term of supervised release as being three years rather than five.
nonetheless,even though the judge clearly erred,romero galindez claim falters under the plain error requirement that his substantial rights be affected,which requires that romero galindez show a reasonable probability that,but for the error,he would not have entered the plea.united states dominguez benitez,d see also santiago,at.this he can not do.
in support of his claim of error,romero galindez relies on united states rivera maldonado,cir and united states santo,cir.
in rivera maldonado,the defendant was erroneously informed in both the plea agreement and the change of plea colloquy that he faced,at most,three years of supervised release,when in fact the maximum was life.at.the correct term of supervised release was contained in the psr,and relied upon at sentencing by the judge who sentenced the defendant to supervised release for life.id.at.as in this case,all were in agreement that the error was plain.id.emphasizing the dramatically altered sentencing stakes for the defendant,this court went on to find a reasonable probability that the defendant would not have entered the plea had he understood his exposure.id.at.
similarly,in santo,we found that the defendant having been informed in the plea agreement,and at the change of plea hearing,that the mandatory minimum was five years imprisonment instead of the correct ten years which he was ultimately sentenced to was an error that reasonably could have affected his decision to change his plea to guilty at.as in rivera maldonado,the correct information was provided to the defendant in the psr and at sentencing.santo,at.
there are some important differences between the above cases and the one at hand.we start with romero galindez minimum and maximum term of imprisonment.
significantly,unlike in rivera maldonado and santo,the mandatory minimum and maximum term of imprisonment was stated correctly in the plea agreement,a document that romero galindez acknowledged at the plea hearing that he understood.at the plea hearing,the magistrate judge never contradicted the information contained in the plea agreement,rather she neglected to mention it.further,at the hearing,the government attorney twice accurately stated that the statutory minimum was fifteen years though did not reference the mandatory maximum of life while explaining the parties agreement to recommend the minimum sentence.that makes this case more akin to united states sevilla oyola,cir,in which the judge failed to advise the defendant of a certain maximum penalty at the plea hearing.though we ultimately found the issue waived on appeal,we concluded the defendant could not establish plain error specifically,a reasonable probability that he would not have plead guilty because the omitted maximum penalty was correctly contained in the psr,which the defendant confirmed he understood during the plea colloquy.id.at.
as far as,the minimum and maximum terms of imprisonment were correctly stated in the magistrate judge report and recommendation regarding plea acceptance.the same goes for the psr.three versions of the psr issued before sentencing,each of which accurately stated the statutory minimum and maximum term of imprisonment.at the sentencing hearing,when the judge explained what penalties romero galindez faced,the information provided was accurate as well.
no more is needed.all indications are that romero galindez was made aware of the mandatory minimum and maximum imprisonment term during plea negotiations,as evidenced by the plea agreement.that range was then correctly reiterated in the report and recommendation,in three psrs,and at sentencing.romero galindez never expressed surprise or hesitation at any of these junctures given all this,romero galindez can not demonstrate a reasonable probability that he would not have entered the plea but for the statutory sentence range being omitted from the plea hearing.see dominguez benitez,at.
misinforming the defendant of the applicable term of supervised release also gives no ground for setting aside the plea in this case.the relevant term of supervised release was not referenced in the plea agreement and,as the government concedes,was incorrectly stated at the change of plea hearing as being three,as opposed to five,years.however,like the statutory minimum and maximum imprisonment term,the applicable term of release was accurately stated in the magistrate judge report and recommendation,in the three versions of the psr,and at the sentencing hearing by the judge while he explained the penalties on the table.again,romero galindez did not balk at any of those points in time.
united states ortiz garcía cir is instructive.in that case,both the plea agreement and the judge at the change of plea hearing failed to explain the maximum penalty faced by the defendant however,the information was accurately stated in the psr and by the judge at sentencing,and the defendant lodged no objection.id.at.based on the defendant failure to object,the government urged this court to find no rule violation,but we were unmoved.id.at.the record revealed that the judge had not confirmed at sentencing that the defendant had read and discussed the psr with his attorney as required by federal rule of criminal procedure i a.id.at.we explained that had the record shown that the defendant had reviewed the psr prior to sentencing,that might indeed negate ortiz claim that the rule error affected his substantial rights,given ortiz failure to object to the psr.see also santiago,at finding that the district court confirming that the defendant had reviewed the psr with his attorney disproved his contention that he was caught by surprise.
here,romero galindez makes no allegation that he did not read and discuss the psr prior to sentencing,nor does anything in the record compel that conclusion on top of this,the erroneous information regarding the pertinent term of supervised release did not dramatically alter the sentencing stakes for the defendant,a factor we were concerned with in rivera maldonado.at see id.emphasizing the dramatic difference between a three year period of supervised release and a lifetime of supervised release.though we by no means minimize the restraining nature of supervised release,the two year difference between three and five years of supervised release is but a small fraction of the penalty that romero galindez was facing.see,united states munoz,wl,cir per curiam unpublished the court understatement of the supervised release term by two years was a relatively small fraction of the maximum term of imprisonment life that the defendants faced.and the transcript of the sentencing hearing makes clear that the primary concern for romero galindez and the court was the length of time that he would be imprisoned,specifically how old he would be when he got out.defense counsel expressed fear was that a sentence,given romero galindez age,would effectively turn into a life sentence.there was no debate about,or worry voiced over,what term of supervised release he would face.
these things combined compel us to conclude that romero galindez has failed to satisfy his burden to show that in light of the term of supervised release,the probability of a different result is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.dominguez benitez,at quoting strickland washington,d.
the guilty plea stands.
reasonableness of sentence 
the second half of romero galindez appeal takes aim at his sentence.he disputes its procedural and substantive reasonableness,offering the following.first,romero galindez says his criminal history category set forth in the psr,and cited at the sentencing hearing by the court,was miscalculated.second,he claims the court impermissibly disregarded the sentencing guidelines as a starting point.and finally,according to romero galindez,the judge relied on improper sentencing factors,public opinion and the supposed lenient treatment romero galindez received in state court,while putting too much weight on his prior convictions.
the government counter is again less than complete,hitting just some of romero galindez claimed errors.in short,the government argues that overall the guidelines calculation was sound and the court considered proper factors,like deterrence and the serious nature of the offense,when it came up with an eminently reasonable twenty year sentence.
our review is for abuse of discretion,which means discerning whether the challenged sentence is procedurally sound and substantively reasonable.united states gallardo ortiz,cir see also gall united states,d.we look for procedural blunders,like improper guidelines calculations or an insufficient explanation from the judge,as well as whether the sentence imposed is in fact substantively reasonable.united states politano,cir.t he linchpin of a reasonable sentence is a plausible sentencing rationale and a defensible result.united states martin,cir.
with these specifications in mind,we take romero galindez arguments in turn.
criminal history calculation 
romero galindez,though he agrees that his adjusted offense level was correctly calculated,claims that his criminal history score was mistakenly tallied at,resulting in a criminal history of vi,when it should have been,which would mean a criminal history category of iv.we need not delve too deeply into the particulars of the argument it suffices to note that romero galindez thinks probation,in deciding what guidelines provisions were applicable,did not properly take into account that he was under eighteen years old when he committed his prior crimes whether this argument has merit is not something we need to get into because even assuming it does,romero galindez can not prevail.
if we find an alleged guideline error would not have affected the district court sentence,we may affirm.united states marsh,cir.in other words,we think the alleged error harmless.united states mcghee,cir citing williams united states,d o nce the court of appeals has decided that the district court misapplied the guidelines,a remand is appropriate unless the reviewing court concludes,on the record as a whole,that the error was harmless,that the error did not affect the district court selection of the sentence imposed.the record,though,must make the innocuous nature of the error unmistakable.see united states ortiz,cir mcghee,at.
it does just that here.as we said above,the judge was explicit that he was not going to sentence romero galindez according to the guidelines.the judge made this point pellucid while delving into romero galindez criminal history.he noted that the applicable criminal history category was vi and that romero galindez had in excess of thirteen criminal history points.app the following exchange then took place 
the court he has in excess of is that correct it does really make any difference because the court is going to provide a statutory sentence,not a guideline sentence.
the probation officer points.
the court.so he gets off.he off the page.all right.but that not important.
the sentencing judge made it apparent that romero galindez criminal history category did not affect the ultimate sentence imposed.furthermore,the judge was firm in his thinking that the guidelines yielded too lenient of a sentence more on this below.we think it safe to assume that if the judge thought the punishment too permissive at a criminal history category of vi,he would not have gone for the even more permissive sentence imposed by the supposedly correct category of iv.indeed,the record suggests the judge might not have found the category of iv to accurately reflect romero galindez criminal history.
as such,assuming for the sake of argument that there was some error in his criminal history calculation,the record reveals that it did not alter the district court sentence selection.see,united states tavares,cir finding the district court failure to choose between the conflicting criminal history categories proffered by the government and the defense was harmless error as the court made clear that the guidelines sentencing range was irrelevant to the sentence it was going to hand down.
ii.attention to the guidelines 
citing the above dialogue where the sentencing judge indicated that romero galindez criminal history points d id make a difference and were not important,romero galindez claims that the judge improperly disregarded the sentencing guidelines as a point.
our case law instructs that the guidelines are simply the starting point and initial benchmark for crafting a sentence.united states king,cir quoting gall,at.while a sentencing court must give respectful consideration to the guidelines,booker permits the court to tailor the sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well.pepper united states,d quoting kimbrough united states,d.
here,the judge unambiguously indicated that he was not going with a guidelines sentence for a variety of reasons more fully discussed below.this is not the same as disregarding the guidelines as a starting point.at the sentencing hearing,the judge distinctly went through the guidelines computation,detailing romero galindez base offense level,criminal history,status as an armed career criminal,acceptance of responsibility,total offense level,and guideline sentence range.the judge indicated that he had reviewed the psr and its guidelines computations,as well as the sentencing factors set forth in.far from indicating inadequate attention to the guidelines,the record shows that the court considered the option presented by the guidelines even if they may have been calculated incorrectly and then,for clearly enumerated reasons,rejected it as producing an overly lenient sentence.this was an option well within its prerogative to take.
iii.sentencing factors 
finally,romero galindez criticizes the factors considered by the sentencing judge in fashioning the twenty year sentence,alleging that too much weight was placed on his previous crimes and their corresponding sentence,as well as public perception we are unpersuaded.
a sentencing court deviation from the guidelines should typically be rooted either in the nature and circumstances of the offense or the characteristics of the offender.martin,at a.the record reveals that romero galindez sentence was grounded in both.
for one,the court honed in on the grave nature of the offense romero galindez had committed.the court reflected that this is a serious case because it is an ak,which is an offensive weapon with a magazine of over and bullets within the magazine.the court also focused on the serious nature of the crimes of romero galindez youth.the court noted that,in eighteen years,i have never had a defendant come into my courtroom with four murders.
while romero galindez faults the court for highlighting these crimes,claiming that the judge only emphasized the number of previous convictions as opposed to the circumstances surrounding them,the record belies his contention the judge was clearly concerned with the serious nature of the earlier crimes,not just that they numbered four.he underscored that the earlier misdeeds were for first and second degree murder,including a carjacking,and that all involved weapons.the fact that the current crime and the previous ones all involved weapons demonstrated,for the judge,the defendant proclivity towards weapons.furthermore,the court did not forget that the murders were committed over a dozen years ago in romero galindez youth,rather it emphasized that fact multiple times.
romero galindez also avers that the court tried to compensate for a perceived overly lenient state court sentence for the four murders.we disagree.to start,as a general proposition,there is nothing wrong with the court factoring a generous prior sentence into the equation.as we have explained,a sentencing court may consider whether,in a series of past convictions,the punishment appears to fit the crime.united states flores machicote,cir.if the court concludes that an asymmetry exists which results in a substantial underestimation of the defendant criminal history,it may vary the sentence upward to reflect past leniency.id.in particular,the court may consider,as it seems to have done here,whether the leniency of a past sentence led to the defendant recidivism such that a stronger sentence may now be required.id.at 
and though the judge stated a few times that i can not be a softy,or something along those lines another thing romero galindez is not happy with we do not see a problem.the sentencing transcript shows that the judge,as opposed to fretting over public opinion,was concerned with the fact that a lenient or soft sentence would not serve as a general deterrent.the judge repeatedly made this point,questioning what disincentive value a statutory minimum sentence would have the goal of afford ing adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,one of the enumerated factors,is a legitimate concern.a b see also flores machicote,at deterrence is widely recognized as an important factor in the sentencing calculus.
that ends this aspect of the matter.romero galindez had a history of violent crimes and,upon impermissibly leaving the state custody that those crimes landed him in,got his hands on an ak.we scarcely think it was unreasonable for the district judge to think a statutory minimum sentence was not adequate.sentences are not one size fits all,instead there is almost always a range of reasonable sentences for any given offense.united states santiago rivera,cir internal quotation marks omitted.romero galindez sentence falls well within that range.
conclusion 
discerning no error that would either invalidate romero galindez plea,or require vacating his sentence,we affirm.
since this appeal follows a guilty plea,
