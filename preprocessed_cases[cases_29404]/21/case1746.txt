elice rizzo rizzo appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york denny chin,judge,entered on july,sentencing her,inter alia,to months imprisonment for bank and identification fraud.as part of its sentencing decision,the district court applied a two level enhancement pursuant to section b of the united states sentencing guidelines or guidelines because it found that rizzo had engaged in jointly undertaken criminal activity that involved theft from the person of another.rizzo argues on appeal that the district court application of the section b enhancement was clearly erroneous because the evidence was insufficient to support its findings.for the reasons discussed below,this court agrees.we remand for resentencing.
background 
on april,rizzo pled guilty to an indictment charging her with two counts of bank fraud,in violation of,and one count of identification fraud,in violation of a.in the course of her plea allocution,rizzo stated that between april and january,she used false identification at several citibank and chase manhattan bank branches in westchester county,manhattan,and elsewhere in order to make unauthorized withdrawals of money from other people accounts.rizzo admitted to obtaining approximately from citibank accounts and approximately from chase manhattan bank accounts.rizzo also admitted to using altered identification documents of other persons,specifically driver licenses and credit cards,to commit these acts.
the presentence report psr prepared by the probation department in advance of rizzo sentencing determined that the applicable guideline range was to months imprisonment,based on rizzo criminal history category of iv and a total offense level of.the psr calculated rizzo total offense level utilizing a a base offense level of six,pursuant to a,for the charged offense b an eight level enhancement,pursuant to b e,because the amount of loss exceeded c a two level enhancement,pursuant to b,for the possession of more than five means of identification produced from another means of identification and d a reduction of three levels,pursuant to a,for acceptance of responsibility.
the probation department declined to recommend a two level enhancement for an offense involving theft from the person of another,pursuant to b,which the government had argued was appropriate because rizzo offense involved the use of identification cards stolen directly from the victims persons.letter from steven feldman to probation officer jefferies of,at.at the probation department disagreed,noting that the government had not provided any evidence directly relating that the defendant was involved in the theft of stolen property from the person of another.psr at.the probation department also noted that it was just as likely that rizzo bought the stolen property from someone or found them.id.because of the lack of concrete information regarding these thefts,the probation department concluded that the enhancement was unwarranted.id.
at sentencing,the government objected to the psr and requested that the court apply the theft from the person of another enhancement.the government conceded that it had no evidence that rizzo herself had stolen the documents from another person.it argued,however,that rizzo was involved in a jointly undertaken criminal activity involving such thefts and that rizzo was responsible for them as reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity that constituted relevant conduct under a b.
in support of its argument,the government pointed to evidence concerning one of rizzo victims identified here as victim.victim,according to the psr,reported her credit card stolen on october,six months after rizzo began her fraudulent scheme.the psr did not indicate nor was any evidence introduced concerning the manner in which victim credit card was stolen or,more specifically,whether or not it was taken from her person.days after the theft,however,on october,rizzo used an altered version of victim driver license to withdraw money from her citibank account.letter br.from steven feldman to chin,of,at.at two days later,on october,rizzo was arrested and found in possession of victim credit card and the altered driver license.id.
in addition to the evidence concerning victim,the government pointed to the fact that rizzo used driver licenses from seven different bank customers over a period,indicating,in its view,that rizzo actions were part of a larger criminal scheme.id.the government also argued that d river licenses are generally kept in wallets and purses,and common sense dictates that these items are commonly stolen through or pickpocketing.id.at.at 
persuaded by the government arguments,the court concluded that a lthough there is no direct evidence,there is strong circumstantial evidence that there were thefts from the persons of others.tr.of sentencing at.at while the district court recognized that there is no evidence that rizzo was personally involved in the thefts,it found that there was jointly undertaken criminal activity.id.at.at.
the district court based its conclusions on several facts presented by the government.it noted that rizzo obtained identification documents from seven different victims and that rizzo offense occurred within a time period of only nine months,id.at,at accepting the government reasoning that given that it happened with respect to seven victims over a period of time that it not an accident or coincidence that rizzo must have been working with someone,the pickpocket or thief at a minimum.id.at.at in addition,the district court reasoned that the type of identification documents licenses and credit cards are things that people are careful about.id.at.at finally,in a clear reference to victim,the district court relied upon the brief timing between the alleged theft of the documents and the point at which rizzo attempted to use them.id.at 
upon concluding from these facts that rizzo was involved in a jointly undertaken criminal activity that involved the theft of documents from the persons of others,the district court found that the theft of documents was foreseeable to rizzo.the district court reasoned that the person or persons involved in rizzo scheme knew that if they obtained identification documents and provided them to rizzo,she would use them to get money from the victims bank accounts.id.at as a result,the district court applied section b.it increased rizzo offense level by two and calculated rizzo total offense level at,resulting in a revised guideline range of to months imprisonment.
after the district court determination of the applicable guideline range and before its actual imposition of sentence,one of rizzo other victims identified here as victim testified.although victim testimony was not directed at the section b enhancement issue,she testified that her wallet had been stolen a before rizzo withdrew money from her accounts using false identification documents.like victim,however,victim did not identify the manner in which her wallet was taken.tr.of sentencing at.at victim also stated that investigators originally assumed that rizzo had obtained access to her information in some manner unconnected to the old theft and that they ultimately never determined how rizzo obtained her information.id.rizzo counsel requested that the court reconsider its ruling on the two level enhancement in light of victim statements.the court denied that application.
thereafter,the court imposed a sentence at the top of the revised guideline range,sentencing rizzo to months imprisonment,five years supervised release,a special assessment of,and restitution in the amount of.on july,rizzo filed a timely notice of appeal.
