jermaine whindleton appeals his sentence for being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.under the armed career criminal act acca,a defendant convicted under g faces a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years if he or she has three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense.id.e.whindleton concedes that one of his prior convictions qualifies as an acca predicate,but challenges on appeal the other two convictions identified by the district court.
we must resolve,first,whether whindleton prior conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance under new york penal law qualifies as a serious drug offense.second,we must resolve whether whindleton prior conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon under massachusetts general laws ch,b,qualifies as a violent felony.precedent informs our resolution of the former and mandates the latter.since we conclude that both of the challenged convictions qualify as acca predicate offenses,we affirm whindleton sentence.
whindleton was arrested after using the barrel of a shotgun to strike christopher frey in the head during an argument in june of over a drug debt that frey owed to whindleton.whindleton was later indicted for knowingly possess ing a mossberg,model,gauge shotgun after having been convicted of four felonies in violation of g and e.specifically,whindleton had been previously convicted of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree in new york in assault in the second degree in new york in assault with a dangerous weapon adw in massachusetts in and possession with intent to distribute in massachusetts in.
a conviction for being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g,requires the defendant to possess a firearm after any one felony conviction.a jury found whindleton guilty of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon on april.
an enhanced sentence under the acca,e,requires the defendant to violate g after three prior convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,as these terms are defined by the statute.if the acca applied to whindleton criminal history,he faced a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years.e.if not,he faced a maximum sentence of ten years.id.a.
at sentencing,whindleton conceded that his massachusetts conviction for possession with intent to distribute qualified as a serious drug offense.over whindleton objection,the district court concluded that whindleton new york conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree also qualified as a serious drug offense,and that whindleton massachusetts conviction for adw qualified as a violent felony.as a result,the district court imposed the mandatory minimum sentence under the acca of months,or years.
section g prohibits any person who has been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year from shipping,possessing,or receiving firearms.g.the acca increases the mandatory minimum sentence for this crime to fifteen years if the defendant has three prior convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,or both,committed on occasions different from one another.id.e.in this case,whindleton argues that the district court erred when it concluded that his conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree qualified as a serious drug offense,and that his conviction for adw qualified as a violent felony.
whether a prior conviction qualifies as an acca predicate offense is a legal question we review de novo.united states carrigan,cir.we employ a categorical approach,under which we may consider only the offense legal definition,forgoing any inquiry into how the defendant may have committed the offense.united states holloway,cir see also united states bryant,cir applying the same approach to controlled substances offenses.
the categorical approach is modified if the defendant was convicted under a statute which sets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative.see descamps united states,d.under the modified categorical approach,the court may consult a limited class of documents to determine which alternative formed the basis of the defendant prior conviction.id.if these documents do not identify the basis of the defendant prior conviction,the court must ensure that each of the possible offenses of conviction would qualify as an acca predicate.holloway,at.
new york criminal sale of a controlled substance 
whindleton first argues that the district court erred in concluding that his conviction for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree under new york penal law qualifies as a serious drug offense under the acca.the acca defines a serious drug offense as an offense under state law,involving manufacturing,distributing,or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute,a controlled substance,for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.e a ii 
a person violates new york penal law when he knowingly and unlawfully sells a narcotic drug.new york defines sell to mean to sell,exchange,give or dispose of to another,or to offer or agree to do the same.penal law emphasis added.since whindleton record of conviction does not specify on what theory he was convicted,we must ensure that any form of the conviction would qualify as a serious drug offense under the acca.see holloway,at.whindleton argues that his conviction does not qualify as a serious drug offense since an offer to sell does not involv e manufacturing,distributing,or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute,a controlled substance.
we have previously held that,b y using involving,congress captured more offenses than just those that are in fact the manufacture,distribution,or possession of,with intent to distribute,a controlled substance.united states mckenney,cir.the definition of a serious drug offense also encompass es offenses that are related to or connected with such conduct.id.at quoting united states king,cir.
for example,in mckenney,we held that a defendant conviction for conspiracy to violate a state controlled substances law by agreeing to possess with intent to deliver cocaine qualified as a serious drug offense under the acca.id.at.there was no argument that the defendant did,in fact,possess cocaine with intent to deliver,or that the defendant even took an overt step in that direction.id.at nn.nevertheless,we held that the conspiracy standing alone was sufficient.id.at.we explained that the relationship between the inchoate offense of conspiracy and its object its entire purpose is plainly close enough that a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute is,under the acca,an offense involving possessing with intent to distribute.id.at alterations in original.
whindleton concedes,as he must,that courts have interpreted the acca language to include conspiring or attempting to manufacture,distribute,or possess with intent to distribute drugs as well as aiding and abetting the distribution of drugs.see,mckenney,at conspiracy king,at attempt united states madera,d,accessory liability.but,he maintains,an offer to provide drugs is simply not the equivalent of either a conspiracy,attempt,or aiding and abetting.
we understand whindleton argument to be that an offer to sell is farther removed from its object than these inchoate crimes we have said that n ot all offenses bearing any sort of relationship with drug manufacturing,distribution,or possession with intent to manufacture or distribute will qualify as predicate offenses under the acca.mckenney,at.critically,t he relationship must not be too remote or tangential.id.
other circuits,considering this question for different statutes,have concluded that offers to sell controlled substances are sufficiently related to or connected with drug distribution to qualify as serious drug crimes.in texas,for example,the delivery statute was violated by a person knowingly or intentionally offer ing to sell what he states is a controlled substance.united states vickers,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.texas law did not require the defendant to have any drugs to sell or even intend ever to obtain the drugs he is purporting to sell.id.the fifth circuit nevertheless concluded that the texas conviction qualified as a serious drug offense under the acca.id.at.the fifth circuit explained that t he expansiveness of the word involving supports that congress was bringing into the statute reach those who intentionally enter the highly dangerous drug distribution world.id.at.
joining the fifth circuit,the eighth circuit held that knowingly offering to sell drugs is a serious drug offense under the acca.united states bynum,cir.the eighth circuit rejected the defendant assertion that the offer must be genuine,made in good faith,or be accompanied by an actual intent to distribute a controlled substance to involve drug distribution.id.at.s o long as the defendant has intentionally made an offer to sell a controlled substance,he or she has intentionally enter ed the highly dangerous drug marketplace as a seller.id.third and fourth alterations in original quoting vickers,at.
under the new york statute at issue in this case,a defendant can be convicted of offering to sell a controlled substance even if the offer is not accepted,and even if the defendant does not yet possess the controlled substance.see people mike,see also people samuels.however,the new york court of appeals has explained,in order to support a conviction under an offering for sale theory,there must be evidence of a bona fide offer to sell,that defendant had both the intent and the ability to proceed with the sale.mike,at.
these two requirements for a bona fide sale more closely align the offer to sell a controlled substance with its ultimate distribution.while there need not be proof that the offer was accepted,there must be proof that the defendant intended to proceed with the sale.see id.a fraudulent offer,such as when one offers to sell the brooklyn bridge,lacks the intent to consummate the sale and so would not suffice.pascual holder,cir per curiam quoting united states savage,cir.and,while there need not be proof that the defendant already possessed the controlled substance,there must be proof that he or she had the ability to proceed with the sale.see samuels,at mike,at.a conviction would not stand without proof that the defendant had the ability to procure the controlled substance he purportedly offered to sell.see mike,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
like our sister circuits,we conclude that an offer to sell a controlled substance like an attempt to sell or a conspiracy to sell is necessarily related to and connected with its ultimate goal,the distribution of controlled substances.we reject any requirement that the defendant already possess the controlled substance or that the offer be accepted it is sufficient in this case that the defendant entered the drug marketplace with the intent and ability to proceed with the sale of a controlled substance if his or her offer were accepted.
whindleton argues that this conclusion stretches the definition of a serious drug crime too far.according to whindleton,s uch an expansive reading of the acca undermines the categorical approach mandated for determination of qualifying predicates,and do es harm to the cannon sic of strict construction of criminal statutes,or the rule of lenity.under such a standard,he contends,the mere possession of any drug,regardless of quantity,is related to or connected with possession with intent to distribute.
while the term involving may be expansive,it is not limitless mckenney,at.we hold today only that an offer to sell under new york law requiring the intent and the ability to proceed with a sale sufficiently involv es the distribution of drugs to qualify as a serious drug offense under the acca.
massachusetts assault with a dangerous weapon 
whindleton next argues that his conviction for adw under massachusetts general laws ch,b,does not constitute a violent felony under the acca.the acca defines the term violent felony as any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that 
i has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or 
ii is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another 
e b.in this case,the district court concluded that whindleton adw conviction qualified as a violent felony under the acca force clause,the first clause of the definition,and the residual clause,the catchall provision in the second clause after the enumerated offenses.
the supreme court has recently invalidated the residual clause as unconstitutionally vague.johnson united states,d.that issue has dropped out of our case 
whindleton does not challenge the constitutionality of the force clause after johnson.the supreme court specified that its decision in johnson does not call into question application of the act to the four enumerated offenses,or the remainder of the act definition of a violent felony.id.at.we focus on whether whindleton conviction for adw has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,such that it qualifies as a violent felony under the acca force clause.e b i.our precedent answers the question.
the massachusetts adw statute is violated by w hoever,by means of a dangerous weapon,commits an assault upon another.laws ch,b.the massachusetts common law recognizes two theories of assault attempted battery and threatened battery.commonwealth porro,battery,in turn,has been defined as harmful or offensive touching.see commonwealth burke.as such,the crime of simple assault has been held to encompass attempted or threatened touching if offensive.see united states martinez,cir.the crime of adw adds one additional element,namely,that the assault was perpetrated by means of a dangerous weapon.commonwealth melton.
this circuit has already held that a defendant adw conviction clearly satisfies the acca force clause.united states am,cir.in am,we quoted the massachusetts supreme judicial court as holding that a n assault is defined as either an attempt to use physical force on another,or as a threat of use of physical force.id.at quoting commonwealth gorassi.by its terms,we explained,the massachusetts statute at issue,which criminalizes an assault upon another by means of a dangerous weapon has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force as required by acca.id.citations omitted 
generally,a ruling of law by a panel of this court is binding upon subsequent panels.arecibo cmty.health care,puerto rico,cir.an exception to the doctrine of stare decisis applies if a n existing panel decision is undermined by controlling authority,subsequently announced,such as an opinion of the supreme court united states rodriguez pacheco,cir first and second alterations in original citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
whindleton challenges the continuing vitality of our holding in am based on the supreme court decision in another critical acca case named johnson united states.in johnson,the defendant had been convicted under florida battery statute,which could be violated by any intentional physical contact,no matter how slight,such as a tap on the shoulder without consent,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the court held that the phrase physical force in the acca means violent force that is,force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.id.at.because the florida statute could be satisfied by physical force that did not amount to violent force,the court held that a conviction under it did not qualify as a violent felony under the force clause.see id.at.
whindleton argues that johnson undermines the holding of am s ince assault,even with use of a dangerous weapon,is based upon either an attempted or threatened battery that may be accomplished by a mere touching.after careful review,we conclude that johnson in no way undermines am,and we remain bound by its holding.see united states chanthachack,app x,cir per curiam citing am as controlling precedent after johnson.
it is critical that the statute at issue
