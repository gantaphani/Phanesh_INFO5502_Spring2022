the government appeals from a sentence imposed in the united states district court for the northern district of new york frederick scullin,upon anthony wills,who was convicted of cocaine and crack possession and conspiracy to possess these substances with intent to distribute them.the government claims that the sentence was unreasonable because the district court erred as a matter of law in its application of a c and a specifically,the government argues,in fashioning a sentence the court should not have considered wills likely future deportation under the need to protect the public,a c,or the extent of the difference between wills sentence and his,a.the government further argues that when these factors are removed from the analysis,as they should be,the length of the resulting sentence is unreasonably low.wills contests the government arguments,but does not himself appeal the sentence.we hold that the district court did not properly apply the statutory factors listed in a.accordingly,we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.
background 
anthony wills and seven were charged with one count of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and crack and distribute the substances in utica,new york.wills was also charged individually with three counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine and crack and distribution of these substances.all of wills except one who was a fugitive and one who was found incompetent to stand trial pled guilty to the conspiracy count against them.wills went to trial on all four counts on which he was charged and in october was found guilty on the conspiracy count and two of the substantive counts.the jury also found that wills was an organizer or leader of five or more participants in a conspiracy.
wills was sentenced in november.the statutory minimum for his crimes was years imprisonment.b a.the sentencing guidelines range,which was considered by the district court and uncontested by the parties,was months approximately to years.at sentencing,which occurred after the supreme court issued its opinion in united states booker,d,wills argued for a sentence.the district court imposed a sentence of months imprisonment,or approximately years.
at sentencing,the district judge considered the factors listed in a.first,with respect to the nature and circumstances of the offense,a,he held that the offense involved a very large amount of cocaine and cocaine base given the community in which it occurred and thus was very serious.second,regarding the history and the characteristics of the defendant,the judge noted that wills had no prior criminal convictions and that the court had received several letters of support from wills family and friends as to his character.
the judge next considered the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant under a c,and noted that wills would be deported immediately after his prison sentence was served.the judge alluded to this court opinion in united states restrepo,cir,in which we held that deportation could not be the basis of a downward departure,id.at.but the judge concluded that the nature of the sentencing guidelines was critical to the holding in restrepo.he further held that since the guidelines are advisory after booker,at,deportation is now a factor that the court should consider in relation to the protection of the public.in addition,the judge referred to deportation as an additional punishment when summarizing his conclusions.
the court then considered the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants,a,and noted that the longest sentence imposed on wills was months imprisonment,or eight years.the court acknowledged that the jury had found that,unlike five of his,wills was the leader of the conspiracy and had not cooperated with the prosecution nevertheless,the court found that the sever ity of the sentence disparity between wills and his five was not appropriate.the judge issued a written statement of reasons that essentially summarized his oral findings.

federal courts review sentences imposed after booker for reasonableness.at.see also united states mejia.cir.reasonableness review involves consideration not only of the sentence itself,but also of the procedures employed in arriving at the sentence.united states fernandez,cir,cert.denied,d.furthermore,this review focuses primarily on the sentencing court compliance with its statutory obligation to consider the factors detailed in a.united states canova,cir.a sentencing judge commits a procedural error if the judge select s a sentence in violation of applicable law.united states crosby.a sentence based on a procedural error that is not harmless will not be found reasonable.id.
w here the record indicates misunderstanding by a district court as to the statutory requirements and the sentencing range or ranges that are arguably applicable,or misperception about their relevance,we may conclude that the requisite consideration has not occurred.united states toohey,cir.no robotic incantation of the factors is required,but a sentence is not reasonable if legal errors,properly to be considered on appeal,led to its imposition.crosby,at.although district courts enjoy considerably more discretion after booker,a district court can not import its own philosophy of sentencing if it is inconsistent with the a factors.united states rattoballi,cir quoting united states dean,cir.
deportation 
the government argues that the district court erred as a matter of law by factoring into wills sentence his likely deportation following incarceration.the judge explained at the sentencing hearing that he deemed deportation relevant under a c,which requires a court to consider the need for the sentence imposed to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.the court noted that as a result of wills deportation,he would face the additional punishment of deportation and would not be much of a threat to the public,at least of this country.
deportation as punishment 
it was improper for the district court to factor deportation in as an additional punishment.indeed,this was the exact treatment rejected in restrepo,a case under the mandatory guidelines regime.in that case,we noted that the district court reduction of the prison term in recognition of those hardships caused by deportation does not eliminate the hardships or make the effects less harsh rather,it advances the day when deportation will occur.restrepo,at now,after booker,we reaffirm the reasoning of restrepo and apply it to wills sentence,which was partly based on the purported additional punishment of deportation.
deportation and protection of the public 
restrepo,as just noted,stated that deportation was not a proper ground for a downward departure because deportation should not be treated as additional punishment,but this court opinion did not address deportation with a view to protection of the public under a c.indeed,we have not previously addressed the latter question on this issue,we note that even assuming that the public protected under a c is only the american public,see small united states,d remarking on the commonsense notion that congress generally legislates with domestic concerns in mind quoting smith united states,d,criminal conduct committed abroad is capable of harming americans.for example,street violence against tourists and the effects of drug smuggling initiated by deportees may injure citizens.there is also a risk of illegal reentry,which,if realized,would further undermine protection of the public in this country.indeed,some defendants subject to deportation will have just been convicted of illegal reentry.see,united states,cir,cert.denied,wl,district court should not have considered defendant deportation in imposing a sentence in part because defendant had been convicted of reentry after deportation.
in addition,a sentencing scheme in which future deportation may lead to diminished sentences would weaken the deterrent effect of punishment.some potential criminals may consider deportation preferable to imprisonment and would therefore not be as deterred from committing future crimes if they
