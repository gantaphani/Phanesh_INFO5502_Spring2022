victor,a puerto rican dairy farmer,pleaded guilty to conspiracy to adulterate milk,in violation of,and causing the delivery of adulterated food into interstate commerce,in violation of a,a and.this appeal by the government of the sentence imposed presents the questions of how loss is to be calculated under b and whether the district court erred in finding that the defendant did not violate a position of public trust under.
background 
the commercial milk industry in puerto rico is regulated by the officina de reglamentaci√≥n de la industria lechera oril,a division of the puerto rico department of agriculture.oril licenses dairy farmers to produce milk according to assigned quotas,and designates the milk from each farm to a specific processing plant.the designated plant then hires truck drivers to collect the milk from its assigned dairy farms for delivery to the plant.prior to accepting the milk,these drivers perform tests to make a preliminary determination that the milk is of acceptable quality.if the driver accepts the milk for delivery,he completes a daily manifest with information regarding the volume of milk being transported to the processing plant from that dairy farm.when the milk arrives at the plant,it is emptied from the tanker truck into large silos.the milk from all the dairy farms assigned to that processing plant is mixed in the silos regulations then require that a sample be tested both by the processing plant and oril to ensure that the milk is acceptable for consumption and to detect any adulteration.if the milk is approved,it is then distributed to consumers,both inside and outside of puerto rico,and the processing plant compensates each dairy farmer according to the volume of milk he contributed.
a farmer acting in concert with an employee and two truck drivers employed by his assigned processing plant,tres monjitas,tres,adulterated milk from his dairy farm with water and salt the water increased the volume of the milk for which he was compensated the salt masked detection of the water by increasing the weight of the adulterated product.the procedures used at the processing plant in testing the quality of its milk were unable to detect the type of contamination that occurred here.in total,once mixed into the silos at tres,scheme caused liters of adulterated milk to be disseminated to the public.
was indicted,along with his,on several charges.he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to adulterate milk in violation of and two counts of delivering or causing to be delivered for introduction into interstate commerce adulterated food in violation of a,a,and.
at sentencing,pursuant to b,the counts were grouped together into a combined offense level.the district court then increased that offense level,pursuant to b,for the loss attributable to the defendant adulteration scheme although the government argued that such loss should be based on the amount paid by consumers for all milk in the silos contaminated as a result of calculation which would have resulted in a district court rejected that measure.the court also refused to figure the loss using the amount of tainted milk in the tanker trucks assigned to the defendant farm,which would have resulted in an enhancement of levels.rather,the court calculated the loss under b based upon the price tres paid to for the volume of water he had added to his milk.the court reasoned that the guideline had been applied that way in previous cases with similar facts,and the court was obligated to give the provision a consistent application.the court also explained why it thought this standard was an appropriate assessment of the loss.the government further advocated that the defendant receive a increase under for violating a position of public trust,but the district court also rejected that request.the court did not offer its grounds for this decision.
taking into account all the relevant offense level departures,the district court arrived at a final offense level of,and sentenced the defendant within the normal range.received years probation for each count,to run concurrently,as well as a fine and a special assessment for each.
ii.discussion 
calculation of loss under b 
the court here calculated the loss attributable to the defendant under b as the amount the processing plant paid for the water added to the plant milk supply.further,because the milk at issue was sold to consumers despite its adulterated state,the court reasoned that the actual loss to the consumers was the actual amount of water added to each liter of milk bought by them,which obviously reduced the amount of grade a milk that they would otherwise had sic obtained.although this statement suggests that the district court considered the actual loss caused by conduct and found it to be minimal,the court also considered the intended loss in this case.it reasoned that the defendant having added salt to mask the adulteration evinced a clear intent that the milk be sold and consumed,rather than disposed of for a total loss.
we review a district court findings of fact for clear error,and give due deference to its application of the sentencing guidelines to those facts.united states caraballo,cir.where,however,we determine the legal meaning of a is how loss is to be calculated under b our review is de novo.see united states walker,cir holding in a case under that the appropriate method for calculating loss amounts under the guidelines is a prototypical question of legal interpretation reviewed de novo.
in crimes involving fraud,the base offense level under the guidelines is increased if the amount of loss caused by the defendant conduct is greater than.sentencing guideline b a defendant who misrepresents the quality of a consumer product is responsible for the difference between the amount paid by the victim for the product and the amount for which the victim could resell the product received.id.at cmt.a where the product misrepresented by the defendant is worthless,loss should be calculated using the entire price paid for the product,unreduced by any offsetting value.id.at cmt.thus,according to the government,the loss here should be calculated on the basis of the amount paid by the ultimate consumers for all of the tainted milk in the cents per liter.this can be based on either the actual loss caused by conduct,or the loss intended by him.this is because the guidelines direct that whichever measure results in a greater figure should be used to apply the enhancement under b.id.
in assessing loss under b in this case,we consider all the relevant factors to that calculation the value of the adulterated milk the relevant volume of adulterated milk and the relevant price paid by the victim or victims of conduct.
we first determine the value of the adulterated milk.the government contends that because the adulterated milk could not lawfully be distributed in interstate commerce,a,and was subject to seizure,a the value of the milk in the silos was zero as a matter of law.because the milk would have been worthless had the scheme been terminated before the adulterated product was sold,it should not acquire an increased value merely because the defendant scheme was successful and the tainted milk reached the consumers.we accept this argument,and hold that where a product can not be sold lawfully it has a value of zero for the purpose of calculating loss under b.the value of the milk is the same whether we apply actual loss or intended loss.
next,we determine the relevant volume of milk to be considered in calculating the loss here,that is,how much milk was rendered valueless by scheme.b states that a food shall be deemed adulterated if any substance has been added thereto or mixed or packed therewith so as to increase its bulk or weight,or reduce its quality or strength,or make it appear better or of greater value than it is.accordingly,all of the milk in the silos with which the watered down milk from farm was mixed became adulterated,and its reduced quality constituted a loss.united states roggy,cir holding that where the defendant applied a pesticide to raw oats which had not been approved by the epa for such use he was properly held responsible under for not only the oats he sprayed,but also those oats that were indirectly contaminated by being at the same facilities as the sprayed oats united states west,cir holding,in case involving meat adulteration,that proper calculation of loss included the value of good meat that was mixed with the adulterated meat provided by the defendant.this statutory definition and our reading of it make sense where,as here,the adulterated product the milk and the adulterating product the water ceased to be independent entities after they were combined.
although it is clear from the statute why the total volume of milk in the silos provides the appropriate volume in assessing actual loss,it merits further explanation why the same amount of milk should be used to figure intended loss as well.pleaded guilty to causing adulterated milk to be introduced into interstate commerce.a plea of guilty and the ensuing conviction comprehend all of the factual and legal elements necessary to sustain a binding,final judgment of guilty and a lawful sentence.united states broce,d.we construe the mixing of the milk in the silos before its eventual distribution as a necessary factual predicate to its entering interstate commerce,and plea as admitting that he knew the adulterated milk he provided would enter the silos at the plant.it is irrelevant that he did not know the exact volume of milk contained in the silos because regardless of how many liters were there,he knew and intended that it would all be adulterated.intended,in the context of b,means results of the defendant conduct that are both foreseeable and an essential component of the success of the defendant fraudulent scheme.
finally,we look to the relevant price term to use in assessing loss under b.in assessing the loss attributable to the defendant conduct,it is the price paid by the victim that is relevant.see,cmt.thus,under either the actual or intended loss measure we must determine the victims of the defendant scheme.if the processing plant were the only victim,then the appropriate price term to use would be the amount tres paid its providing dairy farms for the milk they contributed this was the term employed by the district court at sentencing.instead,the government contends that the cents per liter paid by personal consumers for the milk is the proper price to use.
unfortunately,neither comment to the guideline nor the language of b itself offers any direction on how to determine the relevant victim or victims of a fraudulent scheme for this purpose.despite this lack of direction,we have no trouble concluding that both tres and the ultimate consumers of the adulterated product were victims of crimes.although tres alone paid money directly to the defendant for the worthless milk,the plant was able to pass along the contaminated milk to distributers for the same price it would have received had the milk been pure.it was the ultimate consumers who suffered a real loss as a result of the scheme they believed that they were purchasing actual grade a milk,when in fact they paid value for a tainted product.the plant was one victim of the scheme,but the consumers were the ultimate victims,and thus the price they paid for the milk is the relevant price term under b although this money did not all go into pocket,t he offender gain from committing the fraud is an alternative estimate that ordinarily will underestimate the loss.id.at cmt.there being two victims in this case,there are two price terms to choose between in calculating loss.because the guideline does not direct courts to apply the lesser price term where the object of the fraud has been resold by the initial victim,we apply the higher price paid by the cents per liter.see id.at cmt.again,this is the case under either actual or intended loss,as guilty plea established that he knew the milk was going to enter interstate commerce and thus would end up in the hands of consumers.
despite the defendant contentions to the contrary,consumers who purchased the adulterated milk in this case suffered an actual loss of cents per liter.contends that because no consumers became sick as a result of his scheme,there was no actual loss on their part.not only is his supposition insupportable,however,for there is no way to know with any certainty if anyone suffered from consumption of the adulterated milk,but it would be irrelevant even if true.where a product has a value of zero as a matter of law,but consumers pay for the product as if it had value,the buyers have been robbed of the benefit of their bargain.consumers have every reason to believe that the milk they buy,whether from supermarkets,wholesalers,or processing plants,is grade a and meets with all fda and,in this case,oril regulations.where the milk does not meet these standards,as a result of a defendant conduct,the consumers suffer an actual loss and the defendant is responsible for that loss.support for this reasoning is in an example in the application notes to this guideline provision.comment notes that if the fraud by the defendant consists of selling or attempting to sell in worthless securities,or representing that a forged check for was genuine,the loss under the section would be.id.at cmt.we find that example applicable to the instant case.
although no first circuit case law exists directly on point,the fourth circuit has interpreted b in a manner consistent with this understanding of actual loss.that court held that where a drug is represented to possess fda approval,but in fact does not,and its safety is unknown,that drug does not provide consumers with the benefit of their bargain because the product is not what it purports to be.united states marcus,cir.we find this reasoning persuasive,and conclude that the consumers here who reasonably believed they were purchasing milk compliant with all government health regulations,but in fact received a different product of unknown safety,were denied the benefit of their bargain and suffered an actual loss.
moreover,as all the factors leading to this calculation of actual loss were foreseeable and essential to the success of adulteration scheme,the intended loss in this case is the identical figure.
finally,argues that the government was guilty of sentencing factor manipulation.he asserts that participants in the investigation which resulted in his arrest discovered the adulteration of the milk before it was added to the silos,and thus conduct by the government led to an increased volume of tainted milk.contends that he can not be held responsible under the guidelines for any loss which is attributable to the government conduct.
with regard to calculating actual loss,is unable to make out a case of sentencing factor manipulation,as he has not made the required showing of bad faith on the government part.see united states rizzo,cir.as for loss which intended to occur as a result of his scheme,the addition of the salt to his watered down milk product shows that he did not intend to get caught before the adulterated milk reached the silos.even had the agents prevented the adulterated milk from reaching the silos,therefore,it would not change the measure of loss for purposes of the sentencing guidelines because the loss a defendant intends to cause by his fraudulent scheme is used when it is greater than the actual loss caused,cmt.
district court determination on public trust 
the presentence report in this case recommended that be given an upward adjustment under for abuse of a position of public trust,and this adjustment was not objected to by the defendant the district court,however,found that in prior cases with similar facts such an enhancement had been rejected.to be consistent with these prior rulings,the court did not apply the enhancement for abuse of public trust.
we determine the legal meaning of the sentencing guidelines de novo,and review the district court for clear error.caraballo,at.we then give due deference to the district court application of the guidelines to those facts.id.
section of the sentencing guidelines provides for a enhancement i f the defendant abused a position of public or private trust in a manner that signi
