background 
matthews has a history of convictions for robbery and burglary offenses dating back at least to,when he was convicted of robbery in violation of penal law and two counts of burglary in violation of penal law,resulting in a youthful offender adjudication.his motion focuses principally on his most recent convictions and their relationship to his past troubles with the law.
matthews most recent convictions 
in,in a superseding federal indictment,matthews was charged with one count of bank robbery,in violation of a,and one count of conspiracy to commit bank robbery,in violation of the charges.the government filed an enhanced penalty information alleging that matthews had previously been convicted of several serious violent felonies that his record included convictions in on two counts of robbery in violation of penal law,and convictions in of bank robbery in violation of a and b,and conspiracy to commit bank robbery in violation of and that,on the charges,the government would therefore seek enhanced punishment for matthews under the provision of c.
section c provides,in pertinent part,that if a person convicted in a court of the united states of a serious violent felony has previously been convicted and those convictions have become final on separate prior occasions in a court of the united states or of a state of or more serious violent felonies,that person,n otwithstanding any other provision of law,shall be sentenced to life imprisonment.c a i.for purposes of this section,serious violent felony is defined to include robbery as described in section,or and conspiracy to commit any of the above offenses.id.c f i.see also united states snype,cir snype because the new york penal law statutory elements of robbery,including,parallel those required to establish robbery under,a,and a,new york state convictions for first and second degree robbery by definition qualify as serious violent felonies under c f i.
at a jury trial in september,at which matthews was represented by james greenwald of the office of the federal public defender,matthews was found guilty of the charges.in,the district court found,over defense objections,that matthews had previously been convicted of at least two serious violent felony offenses,and it sentenced him to,inter alia,concurrent terms of life imprisonment.on direct appeal,for which matthews was represented by new counsel,his conviction and sentence were affirmed.see united states matthews,cir noting people matthews,which had affirmed matthews first set of adult convictions,and united states matthews,cir which had affirmed his second set of adult convictions.
matthews motion 
in march,matthews,proceeding pro se,filed the motion that is the subject of the present appeal,asserting four claims.he alleged principally that he was denied effective assistance of counsel iac at trial because greenwald had hired,as an investigator to assist in matthews defense,a former police officer with whom greenwald knew matthews had a prior negative relationship matthews motion at.the motion alleged that the investigator,richard haumann,had been a deputy police chief in syracuse,new york,and that he had arrested and viciously assaulted matthews and addressed matthews with racial disdain and insensitivity at a time when matthews was accused of the attempted murder of a police officer.id.the motion alleged that due to the conflict of interest stemming from this history,haumann and greenwald failed to conduct an adequate investigation into possible defenses for matthews against the charges.
the other claims asserted in matthews motion were that he was denied effective assistance of counsel on his direct appeal because his new attorney had,inter alia,failed to communicate with him and to raise meritorious issues on appeal,including the iac allegations against trial counsel,of which she was aware that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enhance his sentence under c because the court did not ascertain that matthews predicate crimes were violent or that the predicate convictions were final and that his life sentences violated the eighth amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.
the motion requested a hearing,a determination of the relief to which matthews was entitled on these claims,a reduction of his sentence.matthews also made several requests that the court furnish him with trial and hearing transcripts appoint counsel to represent him in connection with the motion.those motions were denied.however,the district court instructed the government to file a response to matthews motion and stated that the matter would be taken on submission.
the government,in its opposition to matthews motion,submitted a memorandum arguing that his claims should be rejected for a variety of reasons.as to the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel,the government argued a that matthews failed to prove deficient performance as required by strickland washington,d,in that his allegations were general,cursory,vague,and lacking in reference to specific incidents that might substantiate his claim of conflict between himself and the investigator hired by trial counsel,and b that matthews failed to prove the prejudice element of the strickland test because,given the district court description of the trial evidence as to matthews guilt as overwhelming,matthews could not show a reasonable probability that but for deficient performance on the part of his attorney the outcome of his trial would have been different.government memorandum in opposition to petitioner motion pursuant to government memorandum at.as to the claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel,the government argued a that counsel had simply made a cho ice to advance stronger arguments on appeal and eliminate weaker ones id.at and that her choice thus did not amount to constitutionally deficient performance see id.at,and b that other arguments against application of the career offender statute would not have been proper issues for appeal because they had not been raised in the district court see id.at.
the government opposed matthews claim that the district court lacked jurisdiction to impose a life sentence under c a i on the grounds a that that claim was procedurally barred because matthews had not raised it on direct appeal from his conviction,and b that the claim lacked merit because the district court had properly determined,based on adequately supported findings,that c was applicable based on matthews prior commission of at least two serious violent felonies.see id.at.
as to matthews eighth amendment claim,the government argued a that the claim was procedurally barred because matthews failed to raise it on direct appeal,and b that it lacked merit in light of this court decision in snype,at holding that a life sentence pursuant to c does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.see government memorandum at.
after the government filed its memorandum,matthews requested and received leave to amend his motion.however,the may,order granting that permission instructed that any amendment be filed on or before july no amendment was fil
