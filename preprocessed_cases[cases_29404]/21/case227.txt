ryan butterworth was convicted by a jury in on federal criminal charges arising from his involvement in a distribution operation.he initiated a collateral attack on his sentence after the supreme court,in alleyne united states,d,held that any fact leading to the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.the district court denied butterworth motion for habeas relief under.butterworth appeal presents us with an issue of first impression for this circuit whether the rule announced in alleyne applies retroactively to sentences challenged on an initial petition for collateral review.we conclude that alleyne does not so apply.we therefore affirm the district court denial of butterworth habeas petition.
background 
acting on an informant tip that butterworth and his roommate were engaged in a drug trafficking operation out of their shared apartment in westbrook,maine,agents searched trash bags outside of the building.the search uncovered evidence of drugs,and the agents obtained a warrant to search the apartment.inside they seized bags of marijuana,a scale,and most relevant for this appeal,grams of cocaine from the inside of a soda can.butterworth was tried and convicted of two drug trafficking counts conspiracy to distribute and to possess five grams or more of cocaine base count,and aiding and abetting the possession of five grams or more of cocaine base with intent to distribute count.a,b b,and.
for purposes of setting the applicable mandatory minimum sentence under b a iii,the prosecutor asked the judge at the sentencing hearing to find butterworth responsible for fifty grams or more of cocaine base,not just the grams that the agents seized.the district court granted that request,basing its decision on witness testimony that butterworth bragged he was earning per night equivalent to about fourteen grams at the going rate,and that he had been selling crack cocaine for at least two weeks before his arrest.this drug quantity finding increased the mandatory minimum sentence from ten to twenty years for each count the trial judge sentenced butterworth to that twenty year minimum on each count,to run concurrently.b a iii.
butterworth timely appealed his conviction and sentence to the first circuit.anticipating the position eventually adopted by the supreme court in alleyne,he argued that a jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt any fact leading to the imposition of a higher mandatory minimum sentence.united states butterworth,cir.we rejected this argument,as we were required to do by the supreme court holding in united states harris,d.harris addressed the court earlier holding in apprendi new jersey,which had declared that any fact,other than the fact of a prior conviction,that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutorily prescribed maximum sentence must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.harris expressly declined to extend apprendi logic to mandatory minimum sentences,thus allowing judges to continue finding facts that raise mandatory minimum penalties.harris,at.in short,at the time of butterworth direct appeal and his diligent but unsuccessful petition for certiorari,the controlling case law dictated that so long as the applicable statutory minimum based on the judicially found facts fell below the default statutory maximum based on the jury findings,the sixth amendment was satisfied.butterworth,at citing united states lizardo,cir,cert.denied,d united states goodine,cir,cert.denied,d.since the maximum penalty for five grams of cocaine base was forty years,u.b b,imposition of a minimum sentence based on judicially found facts did not violate butterworth sixth amendment rights according to the law at the time he was sentenced.id.at 
six years later,in,the supreme court overruled harris,explaining that the distinction between facts that increase the statutory maximum and facts that increase only the mandatory minimum was inconsistent with our decision in apprendi new jersey,and with the original meaning of the sixth amendment.alleyne.at citation omitted.therefore,a ny fact that,by law,increases the penalty for a crime is an element that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.id.
seeking the benefit of the court new interpretation of the sixth amendment,butterworth promptly moved to vacate his sentence under.the district court denied butterworth motion for habeas relief,but issued a certificate of appealability coa to decide whether alleyne is retroactively applicable.we allowed butterworth appeal to go forward on that issue.see grant chase comm r,cir ruling that a coa from a district judge as to an issue is itself sufficient to permit an appeal of the issue in and proceedings.
ii.analysis 
it is common ground that butterworth sentence was determined under procedures that would fail to suffice under alleyne.today,the jury,not the judge,would have to determine drug quantity if that quantity were to increase the mandatory minimum sentence.and it would need to do so under a beyond a reasonable doubt burden of proof.
alleyne,though,was not the law when butterworth was convicted and sentenced.like thousands of others,he was tried in full accord with the law as it stood prior to alleyne.generally,new rules of law do not apply to cases concluded before the new law is recognized.tyler cain,d citing teague lane,d.otherwise,every change could unsettle hundreds or thousands of closed cases,and courts might even hesitate to adopt new rules for fear of unsettling too many final convictions and settled expectations.see jenkins delaware,d stating that the incongruities resulting from the problem inherent in prospective must be balanced against the impetus the technique provides for the implementation of reforms,which otherwise could not be practically effected john jeffries,the right remedy gap in constitutional law,yale,questioning whether warren constitutional protections such as miranda would have been erected if every confessed criminal then in custody had to be set free.
congress has directed its attention to deciding whether a new rule of law applies to requests that prior convictions be reopened.it enacted f,which governs the limitations period for federal relief under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa.section f provides 
a year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section.the limitation period shall run from the latest of 
the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final 
the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by governmental action in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states is removed,if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action 
the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the supreme court,if that right has been newly recognized by the supreme court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review or 
the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.
butterworth arguments to this court rest upon f and f,but since his f argument is outside the scope of the certificate of appealability and arguably not preserved,we deal with f first.
does alleyne create a newly recognized right that retroactively applies on initial petitions for collateral review 
before determining whether alleyne qualifies as a newly recognized right that is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review,we must address the threshold question of whether section f permits courts of appeals to make a retroactivity determination on an initial petition for collateral review.we agree with the reasoned analysis on this issue undertaken by the seventh circuit in ashley united states,cir,which reached its conclusion by contrasting section f,governing initial petitions for collateral review,with section h,the corresponding provision for second or successive petitions.in order to obtain authorization to file second or successive section h motions,a petitioner must show that,in relevant part,his motion relies upon a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,that was previously made unavailable.h emphasis added section f omits the by the supreme court qualifier that appears immediately after made retroactive to cases on collateral review,and so to treat the h formulation as identical to f is not faithful to the difference in the language.ashley,at.therefore,we join our sister circuits in concluding that d istrict and appellate courts,no less than the supreme court,may issue opinions on initial petitions for collateral review holding in the first instance that a new rule is retroactive in the absence of a specific finding to that effect by the supreme court.see also garcia united states,cir deciding that f does not require the retroactivity determination to be made by the supreme court before a district or appellate court can make such a finding,and noting that the same distinction in statutory language exists in the comparable provisions for state prisoners in d wiegand united states,cir any federal court can make a retroactivity decision under f united states swinton,cir same united states lopez,cir same marquez united states,app x,cir unpublished citing,inter alia,ashley,and rejecting petitioner suggestion that only the supreme court may decide the retroactivity question but see dodd united states,d stevens,dissenting disagreeing with the majority assumption that lower courts may make the retroactivity determination for purposes of what is now codified as section f,and arguing that the prior prepositional phrase by the supreme court contained in section f modifies the phrase made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.
we can therefore proceed to the merits of butterworth section f argument.since butterworth filed his motion well within one year of alleyne,his motion is timely if alleyne triggered a new limitations period for cases on collateral review.in order to show this,butterworth needs to establish that alleyne recognized a new right that is retroactively applicable on collateral review.
butterworth easily convinces us that alleyne is a newly recognized right,and the government properly concedes the point.the supreme court has explained that a case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant conviction became final,and that a holding is not so dictated unless it would have been apparent to all reasonable jurists.chaidez united states,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.harris governed butterworth sixth amendment argument at the time his conviction became final in,and in order to reach its conclusion in alleyne,the court had to overrule harris.alleyne,therefore,was not a garden variety application of the sixth amendment to a new set of facts,chaidez.at,but instead a new obligation on the government,teague,at,namely the requirement that it prove facts leading to a higher mandatory minimum penalty to a jury,beyond a reasonable doubt.our conclusion that alleyne was a new rule brings us into accord with the other circuit courts to have decided the issue.see,united states reyes,cir in re payne,cir simpson united states,cir.
by far the taller hurdle for butterworth is the retroactivity question,and this is where his claim under section f fails.although alleyne retroactivity is an issue of first impression for this circuit we did already decide that apprendi itself was not retroactively applicable on collateral review in sepulveda united states,cir.our analysis in sepulveda informs,and arguably dictates,our decision here,and we now reach the same conclusion about retroactivity for alleyne as we did for apprendi.
in sepulveda,we applied the supreme court analysis in teague,at,to determine the of the apprendi rule.sepulveda,at.we explained that teague generally bars retroactive application of new rules of criminal law,but admits of two exceptions.sepulveda,at.the first allows retroactive application of new rules that either a prohibit criminal punishment for certain types of primary conduct,or b forbid the imposition of certain categories of punishment for particular classes of defendants.id.this exception is just as patently inapposite to the rule of alleyne as it was to apprendi,because requiring juries to find drug quantities leading to higher mandatory minimums beyond a reasonable doubt neither places any particular type of conduct beyond the reach of the criminal law nor pretermits any particular type of punishment for a specific class of defendants.id.butterworth challenge under section f,therefore,relies upon the second teague exception.
the second exception is for watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.id.at quoting graham collins,d.in order for a new rule to fall within this second requirement,an infringement of the rule must seriously diminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction,tyler,at,and alter the accepted understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the integrity and fairness of a criminal proceeding,sepulveda,at.
supreme court precedent elucidates just how difficult it is to fit into the watershed exception.indeed,the court has noted that since we operate from the premise that such procedures would be so central to an accurate determination of innocence or guilt,we believe it unlikely that many such components of basic due process have yet to emerge.graham,at quoting teague,at.admitting that the precise contours of this exception may be difficult to discern,the court has cited gideon wainwright,d which established the right to counsel for state defendants charged with a felony as the lone example of the type of rule coming within the exception.saffle parks,d.
in sepulveda,we noted that gideon representation by counsel is fundamental to a fair the legal landscape and dramatically revised the common understanding of what the due process clause demands in a criminal trial.sepulveda,at.the apprendi rule represented no such seismic shift to the bedrock procedural elements of our constitutional protections for criminal defendants.raising the burden of proof and factfinding from the judge to the jury,while implicating important constitutional protections did not seriously diminish the likelihood of the accuracy of conviction to the extent required by teague,in part because a defendant has necessarily already been convicted at the sentencing stage.id.at.we stated that findings by federal judges,though now rendered insufficient in certain instances by apprendi,nonetheless are adequate to make reliable decisions about punishment.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.nor did apprendi alter our concept of ordered liberty at the time it was handed down.id.at quoting netherland,d.after all,even in the era,findings of fact made by a sentencing judge,under a preponderance standard,remain an important part of the sentencing regimen.id.at.
we found ourselves in good company when we rejected apprendi retroactivity,as we joined every circuit court to have reached the issue,id.at collecting cases,and none have concluded otherwise since then.see,swinton,at coleman united states,cir united states brown,cir per curiam united states mora,cir.the heft of our precedent and that of our sister circuits bearing on apprendi lack of retroactivity weighs heavily upon butterworth chances to prevail due to the close analytical ties between apprendi and alleyne.the majority opinion in alleyne stated that the court could not reconcile harris with its reasoning in apprendi because apprendi definition of elements necessarily includes not only facts that increase the ceiling,but also those that increase the floor.both kinds of facts alter the prescribed range of sentences to which a defendant is exposed and do so in a manner that aggravates the punishment.at.the way in which alleyne operated as a logical extension of apprendi forecloses the possibility that we could have been correct in sepulveda,yet find for butterworth here.unable to discern any difference between statutory maximums and mandatory minimums that is material for a retroactivity dete
