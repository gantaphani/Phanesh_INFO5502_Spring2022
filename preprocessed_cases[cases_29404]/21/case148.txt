in this appeal,tomás sepúlveda hernández attempts to raise multiple claims of sentencing error.concluding,as we do,that his claims are both unpreserved and unpersuasive,we affirm.
background 
the facts and proceedings that culminated in the challenged sentence are chronicled in our previous opinion,see united states sepúlveda hernández,cir,and we assume the reader familiarity with that account.we offer only a synopsis here.
a jury convicted the appellant of a medley of crimes stemming from his serial roles as the supplier to,of,and eventual lessor of a network based in la trocha ward,vega baja,puerto rico.see id.at.on appeal,we trimmed the appellant convictions reducing them to convictions for conspiracy and aiding and abetting the distribution of drugs,simpliciter,vacated his sentence,and remanded for resentencing.see id.at.in the process,we upheld the district court determination,holding the appellant accountable for kilograms of marijuana.see id.at.
at resentencing,the district court,without objection,recalibrated the guideline sentencing range gsr the appellant base offense level was,see ussg a enhancement for a leadership role was added,see id.a a designation of criminal history category i was made and these subsidiary findings cumulatively yielded a gsr of to months.the government argued for a sentence.the appellant sought a sentence.the district court proceeded to sentence the appellant at the apogee of,but within,the gsr,imposing a month term of immurement on each count of conviction,to run concurrently.the court explained i think the offense that you engaged in,the actions that you engaged in,the amount of drugs,the persons that you harmed,seriously creates a very serious and complex situation you were not just a participant,a simple seller.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
in this venue,the appellant first asseverates that the court below failed adequately to explain its reasons for the sentence.normally,claims of sentencing error are reviewed for abuse of discretion.see gall united states,d united states martin,cir.but this standard of review is altered where,as here,the appellant has failed to preserve a claim below.see united states duarte,cir.in that event,review is for plain error.see id.to prevail under plain error review,an appellant must show that an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the appellant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of judicial proceedings.id.
the claim of error sub judice boils down to an assertion that the district court did not adequately state its reasons for imposing a sentence at the peak of the applicable gsr.because the appellant did not raise this claim below,our review is for plain error 
congress has made it abundantly clear that a sentencing court is required to state in open court the reasons for its imposition of the particular sentence.c.this statutory directive must be read in a practical,way.united states dávila gonzález,cir.thus,it is sufficient for the sentencing court simply to identify the main factors driving its determination.see united states vargas garcía,cir.put another way,the sentencing court explanation need not be precise to the point of pedantry.united states turbides leonardo,cir.
when a sentence is imposed within the gsr,the adequate explanation requirement is less stringent than if the sentencing court had imposed a variant sentence.see united states ruiz huertas,cir united states ocasio cancel,cir.and in all events,the sentencing court rationale sometimes can be deduced by comparing the parties arguments at sentencing with the court actions.see united states rivera clemente,cir,slip op.at.
here as noted above,the district court succinctly summarized its reasons for imposing a month sentence.the court relied principally on the seriousness of the offense.see a a.though the court made a conservative estimate,see sepúlveda hernández,at,it found that the sale of crack cocaine alongside the sale of marijuana exacerbated the seriousness of the appellant criminal conduct.the sprawling nature of the enterprise and the large number of participants in the drug ring compounded the gravity of the crimes.see a.
what is more,the court acknowledged the presence of some mitigating factors.it counterbalanced those factors,however,by acknowledging at various points during the disposition hearing the deleterious impact of the appellant criminal conduct on the community,the appellant victimization of others,and the protracted duration from at least to of the illicit activities.
we have said before and today reaffirm that w here the record permits a reviewing court to identify both a discrete aspect of an offender conduct and a connection between that behavior and the aims of sentencing,the sentence is sufficiently explained to pass muster under section c.united states fernández cabrera,cir.we add that an adequate explanation need not be an elaborate explanation.here,we find adequate the district court succinct explanation of why it imposed a sentence.it follows,a fortiori,that there was no error in this respect,plain or otherwise.
to be sure,congress also has ordained that if the spread in a particular guideline range exceeds months,the sentencing court must state the reason for imposing a sentence at a particular point within the range.c.the spread here is months,so this provision applies.in this instance,however,the court explanation allows us to infer why the court selected a sentence at the high end of the gsr.see rivera clemente,at slip op.at.manifestly,there was no plain error.
the appellant next plaint is that the district court ignored the parsimony principle.this plaint generally calls into question the substantive reasonableness of the sentence,which depends largely on whether the sentence imposed represents a defensible result supported by a plausible rationale.united states denson,cir.whatever the standard of review this claim of error lacks force.
the parsimony principle requires a sentencing court to impose a sentence sufficient,but not greater than necessary to comply with various enumerated purposes,see a,including recognition of the seriousness of the offense,respect for the law,just punishment,deterrence,protection of the public,and rehabilitation,see id.a.that principle,however,recognizes that sentencing is more an art than a science there is not a single reasonable sentence for a particular defendant commission of a particular crime but,rather,a universe of reasonable sentences.see united states clogston,cir.here,the district court founded explanation of its sentencing rationale defeats the appellant claim considering the nature,circumstances,and gravity of the crimes of conviction and the appellant central role in those crimes,the sentence falls within the wide universe of reasonable sentences.put another way,the sentence imposed represents a defensible result supported by a plausible rationale.denson,at.so viewed,the parsimony principle was not flouted.
finally,the appellant suggests that his sentence is infirm because the district court engaged in double counting.this suggestion prescinds from the notion that the district court erroneously relied on the appellant role as a leader of the criminal enterprise to justify the sentence even though the court already had factored the appellant leadership role into the sentencing calculus by imposing a enhancement.see ussg.
we need not linger long over this suggestion.although double counting may in some iterations raise fairness concerns,see,united states maisonet gonzález,cir,the appellant has not made out a cognizable claim of double counting.rather,the appellant throws this claim into the mix as a seeming afterthought he tacks it onto the end of his brief in a single perfunctory sentence.courts are not required to do counsel work,and we treat this forlorn attempt to advance a argument as waived.see united states zannino,cir reiterating the settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,are deemed waived.
we hasten to add that even if
