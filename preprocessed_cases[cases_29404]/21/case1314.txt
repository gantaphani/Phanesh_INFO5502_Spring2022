joseph bruno,the and former majority leader of the new york state senate,appeals his conviction in the united states district court for the northern district of new york sharpe,for honest services mail fraud.see.the prosecution arose from bruno failure to disclose conflicts of interest arising from his receipt of substantial payments from individuals seeking to do business with the state.an indictment alleged that bruno devised a scheme and artifice to defraud the state of new york and its citizens of the intangible right to his honest services by a contacting for personal compensation and enrichment,and b entering and attempting to enter into direct and indirect financial relationships with,persons or entities who were pursuing interests before the legislature or state agencies,and by concealing,disguising,and failing to disclose the existence of such compensated contacts and financial relationships,and the resulting conflicts of interest.
bruno moved before trial to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the honest services statute was unconstitutionally vague as applied to cases charging only the nondisclosure of conflicts of interest.the district court denied the motion,and the case proceeded to trial.following a trial and seven days of deliberations,the jury convicted bruno of two counts of honest services fraud counts four and eight,acquitted him of five counts counts one,two,five,six,and seven,and could not reach a verdict on one count count three as to which the district court subsequently declared a mistrial.the district court sentenced bruno principally to two years imprisonment.this appeal followed.
while bruno appeal was pending,the supreme court decided united states skilling,d,and held that,the honest services statute,criminalizes only fraudulent schemes effectuated through bribes or kickbacks and does not criminalize mere failures to disclose conflicts of interest.id.at.
as the government acknowledges that the convictions under counts four and eight must now be vacated,this appeal focuses on whether bruno may be retried under the standard announced in skilling on those counts as well as on count three.at oral argument,the government conceded that at a retrial its evidence would be the same.bruno asks that we analyze the sufficiency of the government evidence in the first trial because,if the evidence were insufficient,double jeopardy would,bruno contends,bar retrial on the counts in question.although we hold that skilling requires us to vacate the convictions on counts four and eight,because our review of the record convinces us that the government adduced sufficient evidence under the skilling standard,double jeopardy does not bar retrial on those two counts.we also hold that double jeopardy does not bar retrial on count three because,regardless of the sufficiency of the evidence,the double jeopardy clause does not preclude a retrial on a charge that resulted in a hung jury.accordingly,we vacate the counts of conviction and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
viewed in a light most favorable to the government,its proof established as to count four that between march and december,bruno received approximately in consulting fees from two companies owned by an albany business man,jared abbruzzese,and his business partner,wayne barr.as to count eight,the government evidence established that bruno received from abbruzzese in the form of a payment disguised as proceeds from the sale of a racehorse.the government theory was that these payments were intended to influence bruno in his official capacity.
specifically,the government proof established that abbruzzese held an interest in evident technologies,a nanotechnology company,and that he sought to be compensated by evident to help it obtain state funding.by september,abbruzzese had successfully assisted evident in obtaining million in funding from the state of new york.under the terms of a grant from the state,evident was to receive three annual installments.the timing of the installment payments was,however,controlled by bruno as senate majority leader.immediately following the announcement of the evident grant,bruno authorized the payment of,half the promised amount of the first annual installment.
as compensation for abbruzzese assistance,evident issued a warrant to niskayauna development,llc niskayauna,a company controlled by abbruzzese,allowing it to purchase up to shares of evident common stock.under the terms of the warrant,the shares would vest in three installments the first upon the issuance of the warrant and the second and third when evident received the two subsequent installments under the grant.
although evident was promised two additional annual installments,as of october,bruno had not authorized them.abbruzzese arranged a meeting in december with bruno office to discuss the past due payments.bruno did not attend but the secretary to the senate finance committee,who reported directly to bruno,did and told abbruzzese that he could not tell him whether or not the money would be forthcoming.subsequently,evident ceo,clint ballinger,placed frequent calls to the secretary inquiring about bruno approval of the past due installments.
in early february,returning from a trip with abbruzzese,bruno brought up the possibility of entering into a consulting agreement with communication technology advisors llc cta and capital technology advisors llc c ta,two companies owned by abbruzzese and barr.abbruzzese told bruno that he would consider the idea.a few days later,bruno called abbruzzese and suggested that abbruzzese pay him a month for consulting services.after abbruzzese rejected bruno initial offer,the parties agreed that bruno would receive a month a month for cta and a month for c ta.
on february,five days after bruno first suggested the consulting arrangement,bruno directed the secretary to move the money to evident.the secretary did so by executing a document called a senate majority initiative form,which required bruno approval and which authorized an additional payment of.the following week,bruno formally entered into consulting agreements with cta and c ta for the previously agreed payments.the agreements vaguely provided that cta and c ta shall enjoy bruno consulting services with respect to appropriate matters which are mutually agreeable to bruno and the companies.the agreements also gave bruno sole discretion to determine the schedule on which he would provide his services.
from march through december,bruno,through his consulting company capital business consultants cbc,received a total of from cta and c ta.bruno companies,including cbc,were run from his senate office by his staff who,at bruno direction,performed the companies administrative and bookkeeping work.in his annual statement of financial disclosures,bruno stated that he was employed by cbc as a consultant and received fees for his consulting services.
at trial,the government undertook to prove that this arrangement was not for consulting services but was intended to conceal payments to bruno for expediting his approval of the evident grant installments.for example,the government evidence showed that,against the advice of francis gluschowski,the deputy counsel to the senate majority,bruno neither kept any records of the work he did for cta and c ta nor generated any written work product.also,bruno executive assistant,patricia stackrow,could not identify any work bruno did in return for the payments he received.furthermore,barr testified that he had no expectations regarding bruno role as a consultant and that he was not aware of any work bruno may have done in return for the consulting payments.although abbruzzese admitted that he did not require or receive any written work product or time records from bruno,he testified that bruno helped him become a better people person and a better manager.he also testified that bruno was very powerful and that when people saw him with bruno it would influence people in how they saw the company,partly because bruno was the senate majority leader.
in april,about a month after receiving his first consulting payments from c ta and cta,bruno recommended barr appointment to the new york racing association board of trustees nyra board or board.governor pataki ultimately accepted bruno recommendation and appointed barr to the board.that same month,bruno,abbruzzese,and another individual,jerry bilinski,entered into a partnership to breed thoroughbred racehorses.the horses included two thoroughbred mares and their foals,one named christy night out.
pursuant to the c ta and cta agreements,bruno employment was set to expire in december.in bruno termination letter,dated december,barr thanked bruno o n behalf of c ta and cta for his fine help with respect to various golf course opportunities in florida,general telecommunications advice,and in particular,introduction to lenny fassler.
that same month,abbruzzese,who served as chairman of the board of directors of a company known as motient corporation,directed motient to hire cbc.pursuant to an agreement dated december,motient agreed to pay cbc a month for consulting services including,without limitation,general advice with respect to the telecommunications regulatory environment,as well as telecommunications business opportunities that exist for motient.the motient agreement commenced on january,and lasted through june.
in july,immediately following the termination of the motient agreement,barr,at the direction of abbruzzese,sent an email to rob macklin,general counsel of motient and secretary of terrestar networks,another company controlled by abbruzzese,noting that cbc consulting work was more appropriate for terrestar.at that point,terrestar entered into an agreement with cbc.the terms of the terrestar agreement were similar to the terms of the cta,c ta,and motient agreements bruno was paid per month for consulting services with respect to appropriate matters which were mutually agreeable to him and terrestar and bruno was given sole discretion to determine his own schedule in providing services to terrestar.
although the terrestar agreement was set to expire on december,terrestar decided to terminate the agreement in august because its new ceo had developed concerns as to whether bruno was actually providing services to the company.because of this early termination,bruno did not receive of anticipated income.abbruzzese testified that in an effort to make good on the terrestar contract,he committed to buy bruno interest in christy night out for.abbruzzese testified that although he did not believe the horse was worth that amount,he did not believe the horse was worthless.the government,on the other hand,presented evidence that the horse was,at best,worth only a small fraction of that amount.ultimately,abbruzzese simply gave the horse away.
in,evident was required to seek new office space and the senate staff worked with evident ceo to find it.their efforts were successful as a consequence of a million grant from the state,personally sponsored and approved by bruno,under which evident was able to relocate to a building on the campus of russell sage college.the russell sage grant was used to renovate an existing building to provide office space to evident and two other companies.because abbruzzese had assisted in the discussions with bruno regarding the russell sage grant,evident board of directors voted to authorize the final third of abbruzzese warrant to vest on november.although abbruzzese third warrant was not scheduled to vest until evident received the last installment of the evident grant,abbruzzese requested that the russell sage grant count as vesting the final third of his warrant because he believed that the state was not go ing to honor its full commitment.
five days after abbruzzese warrant vested,abbruzzese wrote bruno a check for half of the amount he originally promised to pay for christy night out.although abbruzzese still owed bruno for the horse,in an agreement dated march,bruno forgave the debt in exchange for abbruzzese interest in the six horses owned by the partnership.by all accounts this was a bad deal for abbruzzese two of the partnership horses eventually sold for over and the partnership owed but never paid abbruzzese for the sale of a colt in.abbruzzese testified that he did poorly in this transaction,but that the transaction allowed him to ma ke good on the terrestar contract and ma ke good on getting out of all the horse dealings with jerry bilinski.according to abbruzzese,he made good on severing all his economic ties for.bruno did not disclose the horse partnership or abbruzzese payment in his annual statements of financial disclosure.
discussion 
on appeal,bruno argues that we should vacate his conviction for honest services mail fraud in light of skilling,dismiss the indictment because it does not charge a valid crime review the sufficiency of the evidence under skilling new standard and enter a judgment of acquittal on counts three,four,and eight because under skilling the evidence is insufficient to convict on those counts.we address each issue in turn.
whether the conviction should be vacated skilling united states and bruno honest services fraud conviction counts four and eight 
skilling united states 
skilling arose from the prosecution and conviction of jeffrey skilling,enron former chief executive officer,for conspiracy to commit honest services wire fraud.at.the court examined the scope of and held that t o preserve the statute without transgressing constitutional limitations,the honest services statute criminalizes only fraudulent schemes to deprive another individual of his honest services through bribes or kickbacks.id.at.the court expressly rejected the government argument that also encompasses undisclosed by a public official.finding that the government did not allege that skilling accepted bribes kickbacks,the court vacated his conviction.id.at.
b.the effect of skilling on bruno honest services conviction 
bruno argues,and the government concedes,that his honest services fraud conviction on counts four and eight must be vacated because,in light of skilling,the district court charge incorrectly stated the law.after our review of the record,we agree.pursuant to the law in effect at the time,the district court instructed the jury that the indictment charges that bruno committed honest services fraud by failing to disclose material conflicts of interest and related material information,and that a conflict of interest exists when the public interest in the proper administration of the official office and the official interest in his private economic affairs clash or appear to clash.however,the district court did not require the jury to find that bruno accepted bribes or kickbacks to be convicted of honest services fraud.in light of skilling,this failure to limit honest services fraud to bribes and kickbacks was error.see united states riley,cir finding plain error where the fraudulent act is the of a conflict of interest,and the jury was not instructed on the distinctions drawn by skilling.accordingly,we vacate bruno conviction on counts four and eight.
ii.whether the indictment should be dismissed 
bruno also argues that the indictment should be dismissed because the only charges made in the indictment fail to charge a valid crime under skilling.pretrial,the government took the position that its page indictment did not charge a bribery or kickback theory of honest services fraud,but rather,a failure to disclose a material conflict of interest theory.see ja.on appeal,the government position has shifted somewhat.now the government contends that the indictment can be read as also charging bruno with a bribery or kickback theory of honest services fraud and that,in any event,it is unnecessary for this court to reach the issue of the sufficiency of the indictment because the government,without broadening the charges,intends to seek a superseding indictment based on the same underlying evidence and alleging the same statutory violations.
we need not decide whether,as the government now contends,the indictment can be read as also charging a bribery or kickback theory.while the indictment alleges sufficient facts to support a bribery charge,it does not explicitly charge a bribery or
