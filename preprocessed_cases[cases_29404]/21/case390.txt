alex curet appeals his career offender sentence of months after a plea of guilty to three counts of conspiracy to distribute cocaine base and distribution of cocaine base within feet of a school.his appeal raises an issue that we have not resolved before whether a massachusetts disposition qualifies as a conviction for purposes of the career offender guidelines,a.we hold that it does,and that federal law controls the issue.we affirm curet sentence.
alex curet and a were indicted on december.count one charged that,beginning on september,and continuing until at least october,curet conspired with others to distribute at least five grams of cocaine base in boston,in violation of a.two instances of distribution,on september and october,each involving at least five grams of cocaine base,were within feet of a school,providing the basis for counts two and three.b b iii.
on december,the government filed an information to establish that curet had a prior state felony conviction in april for possession of a class d substance with intent to distribute and of a drug violation near a school,in violation of.laws ch.this information,see,subjected curet to a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years 
curet initially pled not guilty to all three counts of the indictment.on october,at a change of plea hearing,curet pled guilty to all three counts.sentencing was initially scheduled for january,but was postponed several times.
on december,the initial report psr found that curet a had a base offense level of,because he was responsible for distribution of grams of cocaine base,and b was a career offender under the guidelines,because he had at least two prior felony convictions a youthful offender adjudication of distribution of class b substances and distribution of a controlled substance in a school zone a disposition for resisting arrest,which took place when curet was seventeen years old and the april conviction for distribution of class d substances that was outlined in the information.this led to a total offense level of,and a guideline imprisonment range of to months.
on january,curet pro se filed a letter with the court challenging the information and requesting a hearing before sentencing.on february,curet attorney filed a notice of intent to challenge the information,on the basis that the conviction was unconstitutional.
the government moved to strike the notice of intent the same day,for failure to satisfy the statutory requirement that a person claiming that a conviction alleged in the information was obtained in violation of the constitution of the united states shall set forth his claim,and the factual basis therefor,with particularity in his response to the information.id.c.
on february,curet objected to the psr,challenging the designation,but solely on the basis that the drug conviction was constitutionally invalid.
the next day,curet challenged the information,arguing that the april felony drug conviction was constitutionally infirm on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel and because his guilty plea to that offense was not knowing and voluntary.the government response contested all of curet claims and argued that it was clear from the plea colloquy that curet claims were without merit.
on december,the government filed its sentencing memorandum,recommending a sentence of months.on january,the government filed a supplemental response regarding the memorandum,stating that curet constitutional claims regarding the april drug conviction had been heard and resolved against him in the state district court which had accepted the plea and imposed the sentence.
sentencing took place on february.at the outset of the hearing,the prosecutor explained that he had discussed the information issue with curet counsel,and that because the massachusetts state court had rejected curet claims,their view was that the challenge to the here is moot,obviously subject to if he were able to appeal the state court judge denial of the motion to vacate.the district court twice asked curet counsel whether he agreed,and counsel responded with i agree with that statement.turning to curet objections to the psr,the district court asked whether the objection to curet career offender status,which was based on the same conviction as was at issue in the information,was waived by virtue of the earlier discussion,and curet attorney agreed that the objection was waived.
the district court found,as had the psr,that after consideration of the career offender provisions,curet was subject to a total career offender offense level of.curet attorney agreed with these calculations.
the court then found that curet had three state career offender predicates the youthful offender adjudication,the resisting arrest disposition,and the drug conviction.curet attorney did not object to the counting of all three of these convictions as career offender predicates.the court then found,as had the psr,that curet guideline range was to months,to which there was again no objection.
counsel for the government and for curet made their sentencing recommendations to the court,and then curet spoke,explaining that he had delayed in pleading guilty because he was hoping for a favorable plea agreement,and was still kind of confused about this whole career offender and situation.he said that he had not meant to plead guilty to the intent to distribute charge in,but rather simply to possession,and that he did understand why that conviction was deemed a prior drug conviction,as it should have been vacated.
the district court then sentenced curet to the months recommended by the government,varying downward from the guidelines.curet timely appealed.
curet raises three challenges to his sentence that the district court committed reversible error in failing to conduct a hearing and colloquy regarding the information,that he was improperly classified as a career offender under the federal sentencing guidelines,and that the provisions of the fair sentencing act of,stat,and the attendant modifications of the guidelines,should retroactively apply to him.each challenge fails.
a.the information as to the april state drug conviction 
curet argues that the district court was required to conduct a hearing pursuant to c as to the april state conviction,notwithstanding his attorney representation to the court that the issue was moot given the state court refusal to vacate his conviction.this error,he argues,warrants reversal.curet also argues that even if such a hearing was not required,the district court was required to conduct the colloquy prescribed by b.both claims fail.curet expressly waived his right to a hearing,and did not expressly request a colloquy.while the district court should have conducted a colloquy,curet is unable to demonstrate plain error and thus this lapse does not provide grounds for altering curet sentence.
section imposes a set of mandatory prerequisites to obtaining a punishment based on the fact of a prior conviction.carachuri rosendo holder,d.if a prosecutor intends to seek increased punishment of a defendant by reason of one or more prior convictions,the prosecutor must,before trial or entry of a plea of guilty,file an information with the court stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.a.if such an information is filed,the statute imposes an obligation on the court to conduct a colloquy with the defendant 
if the united states attorney files an information under this section,the court shall after conviction but before pronouncement of sentence inquire of the person with respect to whom the information was filed whether he affirms or denies that he has been previously convicted as alleged in the information,and shall inform him that any challenge to a prior conviction which is not made before sentence is imposed may not thereafter be raised to attack the sentence.
id.b.one purpose of the colloquy is for the court to provide the required information to the defendant.
after the colloquy,i f the person denies any allegation of the information of prior conviction,or claims that any conviction alleged is invalid,he shall file a written response to the information.id.c.if such a response is filed,the court shall hold a hearing to determine any issues raised by the response which would except the person from increased punishment.id.only convictions that occurred within a window preceding the filing of the information may be challenged.id.e.if,after a hearing,the court determines that the person has not been convicted as alleged in the information,or that a conviction alleged in the information is invalid,the court may not impose an increased punishment based on that prior conviction.id.d.however,if the defendant files no response to the information,or if the court determines,after hearing,that the person is subject to increased punishment by reason of prior convictions,the prior conviction may be used to support an increased punishment.id.d.
in this case,curet initially filed a response under c,challenging the constitutionality of his april conviction.however,at sentencing,curet attorney explicitly waived this claim,in light of the massachusetts state court refusal to vacate that conviction 
as a result,the court was not required to hold a hearing to determine any issues raised by the response,as required by c,because the response had been affirmatively withdrawn and waived curet argument necessarily rests upon a claim that the court failure to conduct the colloquy under b constitutes reversible error.
we review failure to conduct a b colloquy for harmless error where there is an objection,and for plain error in the absence of an objection.united states dickerson,cir.here,there was no objection.curet attorney made no objection.we do not view curet statements at sentencing as requesting such a colloquy,but rather as explaining the reason why he took so long to plead guilty.this reading is supported by the context of his attorney waiver of the challenge to the information.as a result,review is for plain error.
to demonstrate plain error,curet must show that there is an error the error is plain or obvious the error affected curet substantial rights,which in the ordinary case means it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings and the error seriously affect s the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.united states de jesús viera,cir second alteration in original quoting united states gerhard,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
as a matter of statutory construction,the statute itself does not make a violation of b grounds to decline to impose an enhanced sentence.in contrast to a,subsection b does not by its terms state that an enhanced sentence can not be imposed in the absence of a colloquy.see a no person who stands convicted of an offense under this part shall be sentenced to increased punishment by reason of one or more prior convictions unless an appropriate information is filed.moreover,d makes clear that i f the defendant files no response to the information the court shall proceed to impose sentence upon him as provided by this part,with no mention of the court compliance with b as a necessary prerequisite.id.d.
we have held that t he mere failure to conduct a b colloquy is harmless error a ny reversible error could only stem from specific problems related to the predicate convictions.united states henry,cir.curet does not raise any specific problems related to his predicate conviction on appeal and so the argument fails.
moreover,a primary purpose of b is to provide notice of the convictions on which the government sought to rely for the purposes of the sentencing enhancement.henry,at see also united states espinal,cir the purpose of b is to ensure defendants are fully aware of their rights.quoting united states baugham,internal quotation marks omitted.this purpose is made clear by the interplay of b and c.section b provides that at the colloquy,the defendant may den y that he has been previously convicted as alleged in the information.b.section c begins by providing that i f the person denies any allegation of the information of prior conviction,or claims that any conviction alleged is invalid,he shall file a written response to the information.id.c.accordingly,the typical basis for finding reversible error on the basis of a b violation is that such a violation prevented a defendant from filing a response under c which may have been successful.see espinal,at finding that failure to conduct a b colloquy was not harmless error in part because had such a colloquy been held,it is at least possible that the defendant would have filed a written response united states ruiz castro,cir finding that failure to conduct a b colloquy was not harmless error where the court can not conclude either that the defendant appreciated his ability to challenge the prior conviction for sentencing purposes or that any challenge to the prior conviction would have been futile,overruled on other grounds by united states flowers,cir.
here,the fact that curet had filed a response under c,but later chose to withdraw it,demonstrate s that curet fully understood which convictions were referenced in the information.henry,at.
while there was no plain error here,the district court did have an obligation to conduct an inquiry under b,as defendants are entitled to the colloquy regardless of whether the c objection was waived.see carachuri rosen.at,characterizing the court obligation to conduct an inquiry under b as mandatory.the district court failure to conduct such an inquiry was,as the government concedes,error,but it does not provide grounds for reversal here.
career offender classification 
the legal interpretation of the guidelines at issue here is reviewed de novo.united states vázquez botet,cir.
to be deemed a career offender,a defendant must,among other requirements,have at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.a.curet argues that he did not have two valid predicate convictions,and was therefore improperly classified as a career offender under the sentencing guidelines.
curet career offender classification was originally based on three prior convictions the conviction for distribution of class d substances that was outlined in the information,a youthful offender adjudication of distribution of class b substances and distribution of controlled substance in a school zone,and a disposition for resisting arrest,which took place when he was age seventeen.
to the extent that curet raises any challenge to the use of the state conviction as a predicate offense,that challenge is based on the argument,which was rejected above as a result,that conviction is a valid predicate offense.
curet claim that the youthful offender adjudication is not a valid predicate offense is correct,as the government concedes,under our decision in united states mcghee,cir.mcghee overruled prior circuit precedent,on which the district court relied,and held that massachusetts youthful offender adjudications are not career offender predicates,because such adjudications are not classified as adult convictions under state law.id.at.
as a result,the validity of curet career offender classification turns on whether his disposition is a valid career offender predicate.curet raises two arguments as to why it is not a valid predicate.first,curet contends that under mcghee and the relevant language of the guidelines,state law governs whether the disposition is a conviction within the meaning of the guidelines.curet reasons that because massachusetts does not consider dispositions to be convictions,the disposition may not be deemed a conviction for purposes of the guidelines.second,curet argues that,even if federal law governs whether the disposition is a conviction,the relevant portions of the guidelines indicate that such a disposition is not a conviction.
both of curet arguments fail the district court did not err in counting curet disposition as a career offender predicate conviction under the guidelines 
we explain the nature of curet disposition under massachusetts law.
massachusetts guilty filed dispositions 
the effect of a disposition in massachusetts is to suspend sentencing of the defendant such a disposition occurs after either a verdict or plea establishing the defendant guilt.the seminal state decision explains 
it has long been a common practice in this commonwealth,after verdict of guilty in a criminal case,when the court is satisfied that,by reason of extenuating circumstances,or of the pendency of a question of law in a like case before a higher court,or other sufficient cause,public justice does not require an immediate sentence,to order,with the consent of the defendant and of the attorney for the commonwealth,and upon such terms as the court in its discretion may impose,that the indictment be laid on file 
commonwealth simmons,omission in original quoting commonwealth dowdican bail,internal quotation marks omitted.while dowdican bail refers to guilty verdicts,the procedure often occurs in the context of guilty pleas.see,commonwealth stroyny,those guilty pleas were placed on file.macdonnel commonwealth,h e pleaded guilty and the complaint was placed on file.both the commonwealth,commonwealth powell,and the defendant,simmons,at,must consent to placing a case on file.there is some language suggesting that massachusetts law does not regard dispositions as convictions because,under state law,a judgment of conviction does not enter unless sentence is imposed,and placing a case on file,by definition,means that a sentence is not imposed at that point.simmons,at.we need not decide this question.
the practice of placing cases on file has been explained as a predecessor to modern probation,because it allow s the sentencing judge discretion in circumstances adjudged to be unduly harsh.id.at.when a disposition occurs,the court retains the ability,at any time,to remove the indictment from the file,and to sentence the defendant.id.at.in its most recent decision addressing this practice,the supreme judicial court sjc explained that the purpose of placing a case on file is to suspend sentencing indefinitely,not to prevent a guilty finding from entering on the record.powell,at emphasis added citation omitted.the sjc reasoned that where a guilty plea was entered,and the judge said she had placed the case on file but declined to enter a guilty finding,the case was,in fact,not placed on file,but rather the judge disposition constituted a continuance without a finding id.
in this case,the psr clearly states that the disposition was guilty,filed,and that was not challenged.curet now asserts that there is no evidence in the record that curet in fact pleaded guilty or nolo contendere,but there was no objection to the psr description of the charge of resisting arrest as guilty,filed.
the psr also makes clear that curet disposition took place in the roxbury district court.the government asserts,and curet concedes,that the fact that curet was proceeded against in district court means that he was proceeded against as an adult,even though he was seventeen at the time of the offense.see.laws ch,establishing the roxbury division of the boston municipal court,and providing that c ases of delinquent children under.laws ch,which govern youthful offenders,are excepted from the jurisdiction of that court,and instead the juvenile court located in the city of boston has jurisdiction see also.acts ch,abolishing the jurisdiction of the district court juvenile sessions as of the date the juvenile court for each jurisdiction becomes operational,or january,whichever shall first occur.against this background,we turn to the federal question of the meaning of conviction.
the claim that state law controls 
curet first argument is that state law controls the determination of whether a disposition is an adult conviction within the meaning of the guidelines.curet argument hinges upon the application note defining a prior felony conviction 
prior felony conviction means a prior adult federal or state conviction for an offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,regardless of whether such offense is specifically designated as a felony and regardless of the actual sentence imposed.a conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen or older is an adult conviction.a conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted,a federal conviction for an offense committed prior to the defendant eighteenth birthday is an adult conviction if the defendant was expressly proceeded against as an adult.
cmt.emphasis added.curet argues that under the language of this application note,in order for a conviction for an offense committed under the age of eighteen to be an adult conviction,it must be classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted.curet argues that because massachusetts law does not define dispositions as convictions,his disposition is not a conviction within the meaning of the guidelines.
this argument fails.as a textual matter,the application note itself presupposes that there is an independent,federal definition of the term conviction,and the purpose of looking to the law of the jurisdiction of conviction is simply to determine whether the conviction is adult in nature.
there is no dispute here that under state law,curet was treated as an adult.the note,which is addressed to that issue,does not assist his argument that state law governs what is a conviction.the application note states that a conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted.id.emphasis added.the plain language makes clear that this application note provides that the law of the jurisdiction of conviction only governs in determining whether a conviction is an adult conviction,not in determining whether there is a conviction in the first place 
the guidelines provide detailed guidance on what constitutes a conviction.application note provides that t he provisions of definitions and instructions for computing criminal history are applicable to the counting of convictions under.id.cmt.this application note directs that convictions of a certain type be counted,and other guidelines and commentary which elaborate upon the events to be counted essentially define that which is a conviction.united states pierce,cir.
second,curet reading is undermined by the remainder of the application note.the sentence immediately prior to the sentence curet relies on provides that a conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen or older is an adult conviction,with no reference to state law.cmt.this sentence reinforces that the question of what constitutes a conviction is separate from,and logically prior to,the question of whether such a conviction is an adult conviction.
moreover,interpreting the guidelines in the manner curet advocates would result in an inconsistent definition of conviction within this application note.state law would govern whether a particular disposition of a case constitutes a conviction for those under the age of eighteen,but the guidelines would determine whether that disposition is a conviction for those over eighteen.we see no reason why the guidelines would take such an inconsistent approach regarding what constitutes a conviction,and do not read them that way.
third,our case law holds that for purposes of the career offender provisions,whether or not a state disposition constitutes a conviction is determined by reference to federal law and the guidelines,not state law.united states lindia,cir.while lindia did not address the particular language that curet relies upon,it does illustrate that typically federal law governs the matter.
our decision in mcghee is not to the contrary.there,we addressed the question of whether a massachusetts youthful offender conviction of someone under the age of eighteen was an adult conviction under the guidelines.at.at issue in mcghee was not the definition of conviction,but rather the question of whether the conviction is classified as an adult offense under the laws of the jurisdiction of conviction.at quoting cmt.in mcghee,there was no dispute about whether the youthful offender adjudication was a conviction the dispute focused on whether it was an adult conviction.mcghee accordingly held that state law is relevant to determining whether a conviction is an adult conviction,not whether it is a conviction.
curet argument that the guidelines do not deem guilty filed dispositions to be convictions 
curet argues that,even if federal law under the guidelines governs what constitutes a conviction,the relevant guideline provisions require that his disposition not be deemed a conviction,and thus may not serve as a career offender predicate.this belated argument also fails 
the career offender guidelines provide that the provisions of.apply to the counting of convictions for career offender purposes.cmt.curet argument relies on d.this section is entitled offenses committed prior to age eighteen,and provides,in full 
if the defendant was convicted as an adult and received a sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month,add points under a for each such sentence.
in any other case,
a add points under b for each adult or juvenile sentence to confinement of at least sixty days if the defendant was released from such confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense 
b add point under c for each adult or juvenile sentence imposed within five years of the defendant commencement of the instant offense not covered in a.
curet argues that subsection b is the only provision that could apply to his disposition,and that because there was no sentence imposed as a result of such disposition,subsection b does not apply,and the disposition is not a conviction.curet also points to the application note interpreting this section,which explains that for offenses committed prior to age eighteen,only those that resulted in adult sentences of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month,or resulted in imposition of an adult or juvenile sentence or release from confinement on that sentence within five years of the defendant commencement of the instant offense are counted.id.cmt.
we do not need to address the merits of curet interpretation of d and the application note.curet argument assumes as its premise that d governs all offenses committed prior to age eighteen.this premise is incorrect,and instead a separate subsection requires treating the disposition as a conviction.
section f,entitled diversionary dispositions provides,in full 
diversion from the judicial process without a finding of guilt,deferred prosecution is not counted.a diversionary disposition resulting from a finding or admission of guilt,or a plea of nolo contendere,in a judicial proceeding is counted as a sentence under c even if a conviction is not formally entered,except that diversion from juvenile court is not counted.
the final portion of this provision undermines curet premise that only subsection d applies to offenses committed prior to age eighteen if that were so,there would be no need for the language except that diversion from juvenile court is not counted.subsection f thus may apply to offenses committed prior to the age of eighteen,so long as its other requirements are satisfied.see united states fraser,cir per curiam finding a disposition that occurred prior to age eighteen was a countable diversionary disposition under f united states dipina,cir assessing whether certain juvenile dispositions were diversionary within the meaning of f.
the question is whether the disposition is a diversionary disposition resulting from a finding or admission of guilt.we hold that the disposition in this case is a diversionary disposition within the meaning of this subsection.
curet,correctly,does not dispute that the disposition is diversionary in nature.diversionary dispositions involve circumstances where either the adjudication or the sentence was deferred in some way,dipina,at,as is the case here.
dispositions also involve a finding or admission of guilt within the meaning of the guidelines.the application note to the diversionary disposition provision explains that the diversionary disposition must involve a judicial determination of guilt or an admission of guilt in open court.cmt.the existence of a event,and not the formal entry of an adjudicatory judgment,determines whether and when there has been a countable conviction.pierce,at.this is so because subsection f,by its own terms,provides that a diversionary disposition with a finding or admission of guilt is a conviction under the guidelines even if a conviction is not formally entered.f see also united states martinez melgar,cir rejecting defendant argument that a qualifying prior sentence requires formal entry of a plea or of a judgment of conviction based on the plain meaning of this section.
the nature of a disposition under massachusetts law means there has been a event within the meaning of f.it means that there has either been a verdict or a plea of guilty in the case.moreover,the sjc has made clear that the purpose of placing a case on file is to suspend sentencing indefinitely,not to prevent a guilty finding from entering on the record.powell,at citation omitted.
our holding that dispositions constitute diversionary dispositions within the meaning of the guidelines accords with our holdings in prior cases.see griffiths ins,cir holding that a disposition was a conviction for purposes of the immigration and nationality act united states morillo,cir holding that a massachusetts continuance without a finding amounts to a diversionary disposition under f.
as said,the disposition procedure in massachusetts is a predecessor to modern probation.simmons,at.it allows for the court to abstain from imposing a sentence against a defendant if both parties consent and the court finds such a result consistent with the interests of justice.this disposition falls squarely within the purpose of the diversionary disposition provision.see cmt.
because the disposition was a diversionary disposition,it must be counted as a sentence under c.id.f.because it counts as a sentence under that subsection,it also counts as a conviction for career offender purposes,pursuant to cmt.this conviction is also an adult conviction within the meaning of the guidelines,as curet was expressly proceeded against as an adult under state law,as is discussed above.the disposition is a valid prior conviction for career offender purposes.in conjunction with curet conviction,curet has two valid career offender predicates,and the district court did not err in finding that curet was a career offender 
retroactive application of the fair sentencing act and the sentencing guidelines amendment 
curet final claim is that the fair sentencing act of fsa,stat,the amendments to the sentencing guidelines implementing that act,should be retroactively applied to him.this claim fails.
curet was sentenced on february,the relevant quantity of cocaine base was grams.at the time he was sentenced,defendants were subject to a mandatory minimum of five years for grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base.b b iii.defendants who committed such a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense were subject to a mandatory minimum.id.b b.under the fsa,grams would not subject a defendant to a mandatory minimum grams or more are required for a mandatory minimum.b b iii see also,a,stat.at.
however,we have held that the fsa does not apply to individuals who were sentenced before the fsa was signed into law on august.united states goncalves,cir,cert.denied,d,wl.here,curet sentencing took place before the fsa became effective,and so the fsa does not apply 
curet also makes an argument based on the amendment to the federal sentencing guidelines in the wake of the fsa.the fsa provided the united states sentencing commission with emergency authority to make conforming amendments to the sentencing guidelines that the commission determined were necessary,stat.at.on october,the sentencing commission promulgated a temporary emergency amendment.among other changes,this amendment altered the drug quantity tables of the guidelines,located in and,increasing the required quantity to be subject to each base offense level in a manner proportionate to the statutory change to the mandatory minimums effectuated by the fsa.at.these changes were as permanent amendments to the guidelines on may,may.on july,the commission announced that it had decided to make the amendment to the drug quantity tables retroactive,july.this took effect on november,when the new edition of the guidelines became effective.see c including amendment to the guidelines,which altered the drug quantity tables based on the fsa,in the list of amendments that are given retroactive effect.
while the amendments to the guidelines are retroactive,they are of no help to curet because he is a career offender.if only the amended guidelines were the basis for the sentence,curet would have a somewhat reduced base offense level under the amended drug quantity table a reduction from to.see c.but this base offense level is irrelevant given curet career offender status.for career offenders,a separately specified base offense level is to apply if it is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable.id.b.here,curet was subject to a career offender base offense level of,because the maximum statutory penalty he could have been subject to was life imprisonment.see b b maximum statutory penalty for those who commit a drug violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense is life imprisonment.this career offender offense level,which was reduced by for a total of,renders irrelevant any reduction in the base offense level.
finally,curet argues that even if the guidelines themselves do not apply to him,the fact that they were made retroactive should mean that the fsa itself is retroactively applicable.curet cites no authority for the proposition that the sentencing commission determination to make certain guideline provisions retroactive could somehow give retroactive force to a statute,and it is illogical.the provision granting the commission authority to make provisions of the guidelines retroactive provides no such authority it simply provides that i f the commission reduces the term of imprisonment recommended in the guidelines applicable to a particular offense or category of offenses,it shall specify in what circumstances and by what amount the sentences of prisoners serving terms of imprisonment for the offense may be reduced.u.indeed,the sentencing commission own promulgation of the retroactive amendment explains that t he fair sentencing act of did not contain a provision making the statutory changes retroactive,and the commission amendment to the guidelines does not make any of the statutory changes in the fair sentencing act of retroactive.at.curet final claim fails.
the district court committed no reversible error in sentencing curet.curet has been ably represented,but we reject his arguments and affirm his sentence.
under the version of then in effect,an individual who was convicted of violation of a with respect to grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base,b b iii,and who committed the a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final,was subject to a mandatory sentence of imprisonment of not less than years,id.b b.in the absence of such a prior felony conviction,the statute provided a mandatory minimum.prior conviction required under for imposition of the mandatory minimum may only be established if before trial,or before entry of a plea of guilty,the united states attorney files an information with the court stating in writing the previous convictions to be relied upon.id.a.various other requirements exist,and the information may be challenged by the defendant.see id.
curet does not claim that he has appealed the state court denial of his motion to vacate or otherwise attempted to vacate the conviction subsequent to his sentencing hearing in this case.
both parties as well as the district court described the state court refusal to vacate the conviction as rendering moot the challenge.we do not adopt that characterization.it is not entirely clear whether the term was intended to refer to the legal effects of the decision on the examination of the conviction under,or,instead,used in a more general sense to indicate that the challenge to the conviction was no longer worth pursuing.however,curet attorney ultimately agreed that the challenge was waived.the decision would not of itself have precluded all challenges to the information under.
nothing in indicates that a defendant written response to an information,and a corresponding request for a hearing under c,can not be waived.indeed,the fact that the court must impose sentence upon the defendant i f the defendant files no response to the information makes clear that a court has no independent obligation to conduct a hearing under c in the absence of a response to the information.see d.
because curet challenge to the information fails on its own terms,we need not address whether a successful challenge would result in the challenged prior conviction no longer qualifying as a career offender predicate.section,by its own terms,applies only to sentencing as provided by this part.d.we have held that is triggered only by enhancements to defendants statutory minimum or maximum penalties under that part,and not to increases in defendants guidelines ranges based on the fact of prior convictions.united states sanchez,cir.
we do not address the government contention that curet waived any challenge to his career offender status because he agreed,at the sentencing hearing,with the district court conclusion that he was a career offender.
there are a few instances where indictments have been placed on file before any admission of guilt has taken place,see commonwealth jones,count of the indictment was not tried but was placed on file with a plea of not guilty.commonwealth bishop,p,wl,at.may,t he jury returned a verdict of not guilty,after which the trial judge placed the charge on file,although this practice is questionable after commonwealth powell,which would seem to require such a disposition to be treated as a continuance without a finding.
curet did object to the inclusion of the disposition in the psr to the extent that it fails to reflect that count possession of class d was dismissed,and that the disposition was for the charge of resisting arrest count,and the psr was corrected to reflect this fact.
this language is distinct from that of the armed career criminal act acca.the acca,unlike the guidelines,mandates that w hat constitutes a conviction of such crime shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held.a.it is for this reason that curet reliance on united states carey,d,is misplaced.there,the court held that a disposition was not a conviction for purposes of determining whether an individual is an armed career criminal under the acca.id.at.carey reached this conclusion based on the fact that massachusetts courts do not denominate dispositions convictions.id.at.we do not comment on whether carey was correctly decided,but even assuming it was,the acca language at issue in carey differs from the language of the guidelines at issue here.
the argument is arguably waived,as it was not made until curet response to a j letter.this argument was not influenced by mcghee or any other intervening authority,and could and should have been made in the initial brief.curet briefing only argued that state law controls whether a disposition constitutes a conviction.nevertheless,since we reject the argument on its own terms,we bypass the question of waiver.
we do not need to address whether the requirement of subsection d b that,for offenses committed before the age of eighteen,the sentence must have been imposed within five years of the defendant commencement of the instant offense,applies to diversionary dispositions that occur before the age of eighteen and that are not diversions from juvenile court.here,the defendant disposition took place in october,and the instant offense conduct began in september,well within the period.
curet also argues that his resisting arrest disposition is not a crime of violence within the meaning of the guidelines an
