under the armed career criminal act acca,codified at e,a person convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm who also has three previous convictions for a violent felony is sentenced to a minimum of fifteen years in prison.the two appeals before us raise a recurring issue whether a federal court may conclude that a conviction under massachusetts simple assault and battery statute qualifies as a violent felony under the acca,e b i,merely because the state indictment used the boilerplate language did assault and beat.
our cases hold that massachusetts simple assault and battery statute covers multiple offenses that at least one of these offenses,harmful battery,qualifies as a violent felony under the acca and that charging language in a state court indictment alleging that the defendant did assault and beat his victim suffices to identify the harmful battery offense.
this last reached by us in united states mangos,cir has been challenged often,on the basis that the did assault and beat charging language is boilerplate and thus fails to identify the harmful battery offense.despite this criticism,we have considered ourselves bound by mangos and have reaffirmed its holding on multiple occasions.united states rivera,cir united states holloway,cir united states estevez,cir united states santos,cir.
the appellants in the present cases,curtis holloway and richard calvo,urge us to revisit and abandon the mangos rule,in light of the supreme court decision in johnson united states,which held that a florida battery offense did not qualify as a violent felony under the acca.although johnson is not directly on point we nevertheless conclude that it casts sufficient doubt on the reasoning set forth in mangos to require us to take a fresh look at the issue.after doing so,we agree that mangos rule that the boilerplate charging language of assault and battery alone establishes a violent felony is no longer good law it follows that further analysis is ordinarily required in the district courts before the conclusion can be reached as to whether the offense at issue qualifies as an acca felony.that further analysis would normally involve a looking to the documents permitted under shepard united states,and b consideration of whether the conduct described in those documents falls within the force clause or the residual clause of the acca.
the question of the appropriate next steps in these two cases is more complicated because the district courts in the instant cases relied on our previous pronouncements about the did assault and beat charging language when sentencing the appellants under the acca force clause.we vacate both sentences and remand for further consideration as noted,and for resentencing.
in,a federal grand jury in the district of massachusetts returned a indictment charging holloway with being a felon in possession of ammunition in violation of g.in,holloway entered a conditional guilty plea.
first sentencing and appeal 
at sentencing,the government argued that the district court should sentence holloway to a mandatory prison term under the acca on the basis of his three prior massachusetts convictions for assault and battery.the government noted that each of holloway convictions was accompanied by an indictment alleging that he did assault and beat the victim.citing mangos and its progeny,the government argued that this charging language sufficed to identify the offense of harmful battery,which is a violent felony under the acca.holloway claimed that the did assault and beat charging language was not peculiar to harmful battery rather,it was used to charge all types of assault and battery,including a type that would not qualify as a predicate offense under the acca.because it was unclear which battery offense he had been convicted of,holloway argument continued,the district court could not sentence him as an armed career criminal.the district court accepted holloway argument and sentenced him to time served.
the government appealed holloway sentence,arguing that the sentencing decision was erroneous in light of mangos.we agreed,noting that holloway contention is foreclosed by our precedent which holds that a massachusetts charging document that states the defendant assault ed and beat the victim is sufficient to establish the conviction was for a violent battery.united states holloway,cir.we vacated holloway sentence and remanded for resentencing.id.at.
second sentencing and current appeal 
on remand,holloway again argued that the district court could not rely on his massachusetts convictions for assault and battery to sentence him under the acca.the district court,as it was bound to do,rejected holloway argument and sentenced him to the mandatory prison term,to be followed by three years of supervised release.holloway now appeals this sentence,claiming that johnson requires reconsideration of the charging language rule.
calvo sentencing followed a similar path.in,a federal grand jury in the district of massachusetts returned a superseding indictment charging calvo with,among other things,being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of g.calvo pled guilty to this particular count.
at sentencing,the government argued that the district court should sentence calvo to a mandatory prison term under the acca because he had three prior massachusetts convictions for assault and battery.as at holloway sentencing,the government noted that calvo assault and battery convictions were accompanied by the did assault and beat charging language that identified harmful battery as the offenses of conviction.like holloway,calvo argued that the charging language was mere statutory boilerplate.the district court rejected calvo argument,noting that it was foreclosed by the case law.it sentenced calvo to the mandatory prison term,to be followed by five years of supervised release.calvo appeals,advancing,in all material respects,the same argument as that advanced by holloway.
ii.discussion 
legal backdrop 
we review de novo the legal conclusion as to whether a prior conviction qualifies as a violent felony.united states,cir.
under the acca,a prior offense will qualify as a violent felony if it is both punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and either i has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or ii is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.e b.clause i is sometimes referred to as the force clause.see,united states davis,cir.the portion of clause ii following the enumerated offenses is known as the residual clause,at.
when determining whether a defendant prior offense qualifies as a violent felony under the acca,the sentencing court in the first instance,and we on de novo review,take a categorical approach.taylor united states.under this approach,we consider whether the offense of conviction,as legally defined,qualifies as a violent felony under either of the acca two clauses.id.this approach is deemed categorical because we may consider only the offense legal definition,forgoing any inquiry into how the defendant may have committed the offense.begay united states,taylor,at.
in implementing this categorical approach,the first step is to identify the offense of conviction.united states giggey,cir.this can prove challenging when a defendant is convicted under a statute that covers multiple offenses.id.in such a case,a court may look to a restricted set of documents,indictment,plea colloquy,jury instructions to ascertain which of the multiple offenses served as the offense of conviction.shepard,at giggey,at.if those documents do not identify the offense of conviction,however,the conviction may only serve as a predicate offense if each of the possible offenses of conviction would qualify as a violent felony.see shepard,at.under these conditions,if at least one of the possible offenses of conviction would not qualify as a violent felony,the conviction is unusable for acca purposes.in such a case,it is impossible to tell whether the defendant was convicted of a violent or offense.
the statute at issue here,massachusetts simple assault and battery,covers multiple offenses.specifically,the statute encompasses three types of battery harmful battery offensive battery and reckless battery commonwealth boyd.so far,we have held only that the first of these three types,harmful battery,qualifies as a violent felony under the acca.see,rivera,at.
because the assault and battery statute covers multiple offenses,a sentencing court first task is to identify which battery offense served as the offense of conviction.mangos involved this aspect of the categorical approach.in mangos,the district court relied on the defendant prior conviction under massachusetts assault and battery statute when sentencing him as a career offender.at.mangos appealed his sentence,arguing that,because it was unclear which battery offense he had been convicted of,his conviction could not serve as a predicate offense.id.we rejected the premise of his argument,explaining that the indictment in his case,which charged that he did assault and beat his victim,sufficed to identify the offense of conviction as harmful battery,a crime of violence.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,we interpreted the charging language in the most reasonable the assault amounted to a beating of the victim.holloway,at.after mangos,the rule in this circuit was straightforward did assault and beat charging language suffices to identify the harmful brand of battery for purposes of sentencing under either the acca or the career offender provision of the sentencing guidelines.rivera,at holloway,at estevez,at santos,at.
issues on appeal 
the appellants argue that our prior interpretation of the massachusetts charging language has been undermined by johnson.in their view,johnson requires that we must consider how the charging language is interpreted under state law rather than impose our own construction upon it.we agree.
the government response is.first,it argues that the charging language argument raised by the appellants is foreclosed holloway under both the law of the case and law of the circuit doctrines and calvo under the law of the circuit doctrine.although the government concedes there are exceptions to these doctrines,it maintains that the court decision in johnson does not implicate them.
the government argues in the alternative that,even if johnson does implicate an exception to these doctrines and requires us to abandon our charging language rule,we would still have to uphold the sentences of the appellants.the government asserts that all three types of massachusetts battery offenses qualify as violent felonies under the acca,obviating any need to rely on the charging language.we consider the arguments in turn.
law of the case and law of the circuit 
under the law of the case doctrine,when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.arizona california.the doctrine has two branches.united states moran,cir.one of these branches provides that a legal decision made at one stage of a criminal or civil proceeding should remain the law of that case throughout the litigation.id.holloway appeal implicates this branch,which binds,for example,a successor appellate panel in a second appeal in the same case.id.the law of the circuit doctrine,implicated by both appeals,is a close cousin of the law of the case doctrine.it dictates that i n a circuit newly constituted panels ordinarily are constrained by prior panel decisions directly or even closely on point.united states guzman,cir.
there are,of course,exceptions to these doctrines.the most exception,common to both doctrines,applies when a n existing panel decision is undermined by controlling authority,subsequently announced,such as an opinion of the supreme court.igarta united states,wl at cir,quoting united states rodriguez pacheco,cir.see ellis united states,cir law of the case eulitt ex rel.eulitt me.dep t of,cir law of the circuit.a supreme court opinion need not be directly on point to undermine one of our opinions.a supreme court holding can extend through its logic beyond the specific facts of its case.los angeles county humphries,wl at.we need not describe other exceptions to these rules because we conclude an intervening supreme court decision has cast into doubt the logic of the mangos per se equivalence rule.
in johnson,the supreme court considered whether the florida felony offense of battery by a ctually and intentionally touch ing another person qualifies as a violent felony under the acca force clause.at.the supreme court ultimately held that it did not.id.at.the court explained that the acca force clause applies only where the offense at issue has as an element the use of violent is,force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.id.because the florida battery offense at issue lacked such an could be satisfied by any intentional physical contact,no matter how slight the court held that it failed to qualify as a violent felony under the force clause.id.at.
johnson,to be clear,does not undermine our first holding in mangos that harmful battery under massachusetts battery offense which has as an element the use of violent qualifies as a violent felony under the acca.it is also true that the appeals here are concerned only with whether particular charging language in a massachusetts state court indictment suffices to identify the harmful type of battery,an issue johnson did not address.a close inspection of the supreme court analysis in johnson,however,reveals a significant tension between the reasoning of johnson and the reasoning in mangos.
johnson makes clear that in considering whether an offense should be considered a violent felony under the acca,federal courts must utilize state court constructions of state law.to define whether an offense is a violent felony under the acca,the supreme court has always begun with what it has characterized as the categorical approach,johnson.at,which asks whether the elements of the offense are of the type that would justify its inclusion within the force or residual provision s,without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.james united states,chambers united states.if the statute clearly prohibits only one kind of conduct,then the question is whether that conduct satisfies the definition of violent felony in the acca.but when statutes criminalize a range of conduct,some of which may fall outside the acca definition,courts must first determine what offense was at issue in the underlying conviction.courts may consider limited as charging documents and jury show which one of the prohibited offenses the defendant was convicted of committing.shepard,at,chambers.at beginning a categorical analysis by concluding,based on charging documents,that the defendant was convicted only of not reporting to prison under a statute that penalized a range of conduct,including escape.
if this underlying evidence clearly shows the basis for the defendant conviction,then the remaining question is whether that specific offense falls into the definition of a violent felony,chambers.at.but if it is unclear from the record,then courts face a further quandary which offense should courts assume was the basis for conviction 
where the offense of conviction encompasses both violent and offenses,and the government has failed to show under shepard that the offense qualified as a violent felony,johnson seems to establish that the government has not met its burden.when a florida statute defined assault and battery as involving either physical injury or touching without consent and none of the relevant documents showed which was the basis for johnson conviction,the supreme court concluded that the government had proved no more than touching without consent.johnson.at.
when considering whether the florida battery offense qualified as a violent felony under the acca force clause,johnson also established that a federal court is bound by the construction of state law rendered by the highest court of the state.at johnson fankell,neither this court nor any other federa
