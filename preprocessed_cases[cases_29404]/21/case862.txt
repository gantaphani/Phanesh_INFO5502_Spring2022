after jody dixon pleaded guilty to five counts of mailing threatening communications,see,the district court determined that he harbored an intent to make good on his graphic threats.that finding precipitated a enhancement under the applicable federal sentencing guideline.see ussg b.the court then imposed a incarcerative sentence,corresponding to the top of the guideline sentencing range gsr.
in this appeal,dixon principally contends that the district court erred in applying the intent enhancement.that contention requires us to construe,for the first time,the mechanics of that enhancement.secondarily,dixon contends that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence.after careful consideration of these initiatives,we uphold both the intent enhancement and the overall sentence.
background 
roughly three years prior to the commission of the offenses of conviction,a middlesex county massachusetts assistant district attorney,jill goldstein,prosecuted dixon for breaking and entering and related offenses.on february,dixon entered guilty pleas to a number of those charges and was ordered to serve over three years in prison.
we to september.on that date,while serving his sentence at the correctional center sbcc in shirley,massachusetts,dixon mailed six envelopes three to goldstein,two to middlesex county district attorney martha coakley,and one to massachusetts attorney general thomas reilly.the envelopes,each of which contained a vile letter,were delivered the following day.
the letters sent to goldstein included phrases such as kill jill repeated over sixty times,you will die soon,and i hope you have forgotten are sic little date with a switch blade.at least one of these missives appeared to have been smeared with bodily substances blood and excrement.one of the notes addressed to coakley appeared to have been similarly smeared.in that communique,was and had been diagnosed with hepatitis b and my aids infected body fluid.enjoy.
the envelope mailed to reilly contained both a letter and a white powder.laboratory testing later revealed that the white powder was not anthrax as initially suspected but a harmless compound.the letter itself appeared to have been smeared with the same sorts of bodily substances as the other letters.its text read as follows ashes to ashes and they all fall down.think of all the memories lost like i give a shit.actually i do give a shit and here it is along with my aids infected blood.enjoy.
while none of the intended recipients personally opened the envelopes,the office employees who performed that task were fearful that they might have contracted infections.one of those staffers subsequently underwent several blood tests to ensure that dixon diseases had not been transmitted to him.meanwhile,laboratory studies disclosed that blood and matter consistent with fecal material were,in fact,smeared on the letters.
because all the envelopes contained dixon name,inmate number,and address,the authorities had no difficulty in figuring out who was responsible for the mailings.on september,the same day that the letters were delivered,a massachusetts state trooper and a postal inspector repaired to sbcc.dixon waived his miranda rights,see miranda arizona,d,and freely admitted writing and mailing the letters.
dixon made a number of other damaging admissions to the investigators.for example,he explained that he would really like to kill goldstein because of the way she had treated him during the prosecution of the breaking and entering offenses.complaining that goldstein thought she was better than the rest,he boasted that he would murder her the next day if he was not incarcerated.he even spelled out his plan he would lurk in a hallway of the cambridge courthouse and use a knife to do the deed because he wanted to get up close and personal and watch goldstein body drop to the floor.
although dixon disclaimed any personal antipathy toward either coakley or reilly,he nonetheless stated that,if given the opportunity,he would cave both their heads in with a baseball bat.finally,he admitted that he had,in fact,smeared his blood and excrement on the letters.in that regard,he explained that,having contracted hiv and hepatitis b and c,he wanted other people to experience those diseases.he also professed a belief that it would be easier to pass along hepatitis than hiv through contact with the bodily substances coated on the letters.
in due course a federal grand jury,while eschewing a true bill with respect to one of the coakley letters,charged dixon with five counts of sending threatening communications through the united states mail.see.within a matter of months,dixon pleaded guilty to all five counts.the district court ordered the preparation of a presentence investigation report the psi report.
the base offense level for the offenses of conviction was.see ussg a.the psi report recommended a enhancement because the offenses involved conduct evincing an intent to carry out the threats.see id.b.it also recommended a enhancement on the ground that more than two threats had been directed at goldstein,see id.b,a enhancement on the ground that the intended victims were government officials,see id,a enhancement under grouping rules,see id,and a reduction for acceptance of responsibility,see id.
dixon objected only to the recommended intent enhancement.he contended that he had sent the letters in order to remain in prison and that he never wished to harm the intended recipients.in support of that position,he produced a psychological evaluation performed by scott bresler.in his report,bresler,relying in part on psychiatric records from both sbcc and bridgewater state hospital bsh,concluded that dixon was in a psychologically unbalanced state when he was first seen at bsh less than a month after sending the threatening communiques.bresler also noted that,once dixon had been transferred from sbcc to bsh,he told the resident psychologist who diagnosed him as suffering from obsessive compulsive and generalized anxiety disorders that he believed he lived better in jail than on the streets.in a personal interview with bresler,dixon reiterated his preference for life in prison,denied any memory of writing the letters,and claimed that he had no intentions whatsoever of harming the recipients.bresler opined that dixon never intended to follow through on his threats and only sent the letters because he understood that doing so would lead to indictments and ultimately,to further incarceration.
the government countered with its own psychological evaluation,performed by christine scronce.while scronce agreed that dixon might have committed the offenses in part to extend his immurement,she did not believe that this motivation negated a conclusion that dixon wished to harm the intended recipients of the letters.although dixon told her that he did not really think that the recipients could contract his diseases through contact with the bodily substances smeared on the letters,scronce questioned the veracity of that statement.she noted,among other things,dixon admission to her that he wrote the letters in order to lash out at the recipients,his lament that he did not realize that others would open the mail,his assurance that he never meant to harm unknown third parties leaving the clear implication that he did mean to harm the addressees,and his admission to the investigators that he hoped the addressees would contract his diseases.based on these and other facts,scronce concluded that,at the time he committed the offenses,dixon believe d he might be able to harm his victims by including his blood and feces in the letters.
the district court convened the disposition hearing on march.the court explained that its practice,under the newly inaugurated advisory guidelines regime,was to calculate and consult the guidelines first and then consider whether there are any of the a factors that would indicate that another sentence would be more reasonable and appropriate.
in calculating the gsr,the district court overruled dixon objection to the intent enhancement while it acknowledged dixon apparent desire to remain behind bars,the court found that such a desire was not inconsistent with an intent to bring the threats to fruition and that dixon who,in the court view,subjectively believed that he could transmit his diseases by smearing the letters with his blood and feces was guilty of conduct evincing an intent to carry out the threats.the district court envisioned its finding on the intent enhancement as reinforced by dixon mailing of multiple letters and his statement to the investigators that he meant to harm the intended recipients.in the course of this ruling,the court deemed immaterial whether or not the diseases actually could be transmitted through the mail.
the intent enhancement,when coupled with the uncontroversial adjustments described above,yielded a total offense level of.dixon was in criminal history category vi.those integers produced a gsr of months.see ussg ch,pt.a sentencing table.despite dixon importunings,the court concluded that the factors enumerated in a did not warrant any deviation from the gsr.it then imposed an incarcerative term of months,explaining its rationale for doing so in exquisite detail.this timely appeal ensued.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,dixon assigns error to both the intent enhancement and the reasonableness vel non of his sentence.we discuss these claims sequentially.
a.the intent enhancement.
the statute underlying the offenses of conviction criminalizes the knowing use of the mails to deliver a communication containing a threat to injure the addressee.to obtain a conviction thereunder,showing that the perpetrator had an intention of seeing the threat through to fruition is not required.see united states koski,cir.rather,it is sufficient to show that i the accused intended to make the menacing statement and ii the intended recipient reasonably could have regarded it as a threat.united states schneider,cir.
even though proof of a defendant intent to carry out a threat is unnecessary for establishing guilt under the statute of conviction,the sentencing commission has made it relevant to an evaluation of the seriousness of the conduct involved in the offense and,thus,to the determination of an appropriate sentence.see ussg b calling for a enhancement i f the offense involved any conduct evidencing an intent to accomplish such threat.whether dixon conduct evinced an intent to carry out his threats implicates questions of both fact and law,and dixon mounts challenges on both fronts.we afford review to his challenges,see united states,cir,but consider the essentially legal question of whether the facts sufficiently establish the requisite intent de novo,see united states,cir.
the factual challenges.as a factual matter,dixon asserts that the lower court clearly erred in drawing an inference that he believed he could transmit hiv and hepatitis by smearing his bodily substances on correspondence and,thus,in determining that he intended to harm the addressees.in drawing the disputed inference,the court relied principally on the following evidence i the letters were smeared with dixon blood and feces ii they expressed his desire to infect the intended recipients and iii dixon was and had been diagnosed with hepatitis b and 
nothwithstanding this evidentiary array,dixon argues that the court inference is clearly erroneous.he notes that the court never determined that it would be possible to transmit the viruses by mailing letters permeated with bodily substances.without such proof,he avers,the remaining evidence is too flimsy to ground the court finding.this argument lacks force.
to be sure,a district court charged with determining whether a defendant believed it to be possible to effectuate a threat is free to consider the apparent impossibility of using a given means to achieve a given end.see,state block,holding that a defendant could not intend to commit a crime if the means employed are so clearly unsuitable that it is obvious that the crime can not be committed.withal,objective impossibility does not necessarily preclude subjective belief.see united states joiner,cir finding that defendants had the necessary scienter even though they incorrectly believed they could use financing statements to create a fraudulent lien on real estate.although there may be cases in which factual impossibility is so plain as to negate any finding of subjective belief say,for example,that the question was whether the defendant believed she could kill a person by hitting him over the head with a strand of spaghetti,this is not such a case.even if we assume,for argument sake,that it is impossible to transmit hiv hepatitis by smearing bodily substances excreted by an infected person on a there is not a shred of proof to that effect in the assumed fact is far from obvious.indeed,at least one of the individuals who handled the threatening letters subsequently underwent extensive testing precisely because of his fear that infection might be possible.
dixon also attacks,as against the weight of the evidence,the district court conclusion that his admissions to the investigators provided additional support for an intent enhancement.emphasizing dixon desire to remain behind bars,the absence of any proof that his diseases were communicable via the tainted letters,and bresler testimony,dixon seems to be saying that the district court clearly erred in attaching any weight to his admissions to the investigators.
review is deferential.under that standard,we must accept the lower court findings of fact unless,after perusing the record as a whole,we are left with a strong and abiding conviction that a mistake has been made.see united states gypsum.the record here does not encourage such a conviction the evidence is conflicting,and the resolution of these conflicts depends on which set of inferences the trier finds persuasive.where,as here,the sentencing record supports two or more competing inferences,the sentencing court choice among them can not be clearly erroneous.see united states ruiz,cir.
viewed in this light,dixon challenges collapse.we hold,without serious question,that the sentencing court did not clearly err in finding that dixon actually believed that he could transmit his diseases by smearing his bodily substances on the letters.nor did the court clearly err in attaching weight to the admission that he meant to injure the intended recipients of his unsanitary epistles.
the legal challenge.dixon next asseverates that the government failure to offer proof that it would have been possible for him to transmit his diseases by mail precluded the district court,as a matter of law,from applying the intent enhancement.this is a legal rather than a factual argument,suggesting that the facts as found by the sentencing court simply do not justify imposition of the enhancement.consequently,the argument engenders de novo review.see,united states newell,cir united states taylor,cir.
although the district court looked to the totality of the circumstances in reaching its decision to invoke the intent enhancement,dixon correctly points out that the record contains no evidence that it would be possible to transmit hiv and hepatitis viruses by smearing bodily substances on correspondence.building on this foundation,he maintains that his beliefs and intentions with respect to his smearing of the letters provide no support for an intent enhancement and that the remaining facts are insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the enhancement.
this claim of error boils down to the thesis that factual impossibility is a legal defense to the imposition of the intent enhancement.we reject that thesis.
factual impossibility occurs when a circumstance unknown to the defendant prevents him from achieving a specific objective see united states waldron,cir.on dixon thesis,the proscribed objective is injuring the intended recipients and the unknown circumstance is the impossibility of transmitting his diseases by bodily substances smeared on correspondence.we proceed to examine the premise on which this thesis rests.
recognizing that conduct falling short of a completed criminal objective still may pose a real threat to social order,we long have held that factual impossibility is not a defense to either liability or sentencin
