alberto rodriguez appeals from his conviction in the united states district court for the district of rhode island for being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g and e.rodriguez raises four issues whether the district court properly denied his motion to dismiss under the speedy trial act sta or the act whether rodriguez suffered from ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney did not a government witness whether the district court properly denied rodriguez motions for acquittal or for a new trial on the basis of insufficient evidence and whether the district court abused its discretion in refusing the jury request for trial transcripts.we affirm.
background and facts 
on november,in the early morning,police officers in the city of providence,rhode island,were following a red car driven by a female relative of rodriguez.he was sitting in the passenger seat,and two women were sitting in the backseat.when the car twice failed to signal when turning,one police cruiser turned on its lights and sirens and tried to pull the car over.the car sped ahead,and after a short chase,a second cruiser blocked it by driving in front of it.before the car came to a full stop,rodriguez jumped out and began to run.officer martin hames saw that rodriguez was wearing yellow sunglasses pushed up on his forehead.officer scott petrocchi chased rodriguez for about seconds through several backyards,staying within ten feet and never losing sight of him.early in the chase,petrocchi noticed that rodriguez was carrying a black gun,and,using a radio strapped to his shoulder,he radioed his fellow officers,warning that it looks like the suspect had a gun in his hand.petrocchi testified to seeing rodriguez drop the gun to the ground in the rear yard of or glenbridge avenue.
petrocchi caught rodriguez soon after he dropped the gun.rodriguez refused to put his hands in the air or get on the ground even though petrocchi ordered him to do so at gunpoint.when petrocchi attempted to handcuff rodriguez,he struggled to avoid arrest and in the process injured petrocchi hand.a second officer arrived on the scene and helped petrocchi handcuff rodriguez.petrocchi told hames where rodriguez had dropped the gun,and the gun was subsequently found there lying on the ground.the gun was a glock caliber pistol loaded with ten rounds.yellow sunglasses were lying near the gun.
rodriguez was indicted by a federal grand jury on april,and convicted by a jury on september,after a trial.prior to trial,on august,rodriguez filed a motion to dismiss the case because of an alleged speedy trial act violation.the court held a hearing on the motion to dismiss and denied it on the same day,august.at trial,rodriguez stipulated that he had a prior felony record and that the gun found in this case had traveled in interstate commerce.petrocchi testified that while chasing rodriguez,petrocchi had observed him to be carrying a firearm,a black firearm in his right hand.in his radio broadcast at the time of the chase,introduced at trial,petrocchi stated that it looks like he got a gun in his hand.petrocchi testified further that he saw rodriguez drop the firearm in the backyard of glenbridge avenue and that he then chased him into the yard of glenbridge.petrocchi later clarified that pretty much right as i broadcasted the description,we were in that backyard is when he dropped it.on,petrocchi reiterated that rodriguez had dropped the gun in the back of glenbridge before running into the back of glenbridge.petrocchi testified that he could not remember whether there was a fence between the two yards.on redirect,he modified his testimony to indicate that he had found the gun in the yard of glenbridge,not,and that was consistent with his police report.on recross,he indicated that he jumped over a fence to get into the backyard of glenbridge.
petrocchi testified that he and hames walked back to the spot where rodriguez had dropped the firearm and identified that area again as glenbridge.petrocchi testified that he had found the gun.hames testified that he himself had in fact found the gun.officer shawn kennedy offense report and testimony corroborate hames testimony.kennedy testified that after he saw that rodriguez had been apprehended,he went back to the area where the pursuit had started and radioed to petrocchi,we got a glock.petrocchi responded,i saw it in his hand when i came around the corner.
detective paul renzi testified that he did not test the gun for fingerprints,explaining that it was the policy of the unit at the time of the incident not to fingerprint firearms that were seized on someone person.on,he testified that the policy not to test weapons for fingerprints had changed after rodriguez arrest.renzi further testified that even though he had the sunglasses found near the gun,he failed to fingerprint them either because he had visually observed the glasses for the presence of latent prints and seen none.
the defense called evelyn carabello,the driver of the red car and a grandmother of rodriguez son.she testified that she did not see rodriguez holding a gun that night.she further testified that while the police were chasing rodriguez,susan shorty bianchi,another passenger in the car,had gotten out of the red car and walked toward the area where the gun was later found.the defense also called xiomara guitard,another passenger.she testified that when the police were trying to pull over the red car,bianchi showed her a black gun and whispered that it was hers.she said that bianchi had later followed the police into the backyard as they chased rodriguez.guitard testified that she had lied when she had earlier denied being a passenger in the car and when she had denied seeing a gun.
in rebuttal,the government called bianchi,who testified that the gun was not hers,that she had never seen it before,that she never showed anyone the gun,and that she had remained on the street during the time that the police were chasing rodriguez through the backyards.this differed markedly from a witness statement bianchi had earlier provided to an attorney who is not otherwise named in the record.in the witness statement,made on december,within a week of rodriguez arrest,bianchi said that after seeing the defendant get out of the car and start running,she got out of the car got rid of the gun,which was a calibur sic glock rounds walked back to the scene and seen what was going on,and what i seen was alberto getting arrested for my gun.before her trial testimony began,defense counsel,aware that bianchi would likely recant the version of events she provided in the witness statement,moved to limit the government examination of bianchi so as not to cause himself or his law firm to become a witness in the case if he had to reveal the existence of the prior inconsistent statement.the court denied the motion.on,defense counsel did not ask about her prior witness statement but rather asked only one question,confirming that the bianchi was over seven months pregnant at the time of her testimony.
the government introduced a second radio broadcast made right after the chase,in which petrocchi reported that rodriguez had had a gun in his hand,in order to rebut the defense suggestion that petrocchi direct testimony on the issue had been recently fabricated.
several months after conviction,the district court sentenced rodriguez to twenty years in prison,near the bottom of the advisory guidelines range.rodriguez does not contest his sentence.
discussion 
speedy trial act 
rodriguez appeals from the district court denial of his motion to dismiss on sta grounds,arguing that the government did not bring him to trial within the time prescribed by the sta.this court reviews a district court denial of a motion to dismiss based upon the sta de novo as to legal rules and for clear error as to factual findings.united states maxwell,cir.
the sta requires a trial to begin within days of the filing of an information or indictment or the defendant initial appearance.c.the act,however,acknowledges the variety of criminal cases and that in some cases there may often be good reasons for a longer delay.as recently described by the supreme court,
t o provide the necessary flexibility,the act includes a long and detailed list of periods of delay that are excluded in computing the time within which the trial must start.see h.for example,the act excludes delay resulting from other proceedings concerning the defendant,h,delay resulting from the absence or unavailability of the defendant or an essential witness,h,delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is mentally incompetent or physically unable to stand trial,h,and a reasonable period of delay when the motion for severance has been granted,h.
much of the act flexibility is furnished by h,which governs continuances this provision permits a district court to grant a continuance and to exclude the resulting delay if the court,after considering certain factors,makes findings that the ends of justice served by granting the continuance outweigh the public and defendant interests in a speedy trial.this provision gives the district court limits and subject to specific accommodate limited delays for needs.

rodriguez argues that the district court erred on two occasions by excluding periods of time before rodriguez trial.we disagree.we begin with a description of the chronology of the case,highlighting the disputed time periods and the district court orders.
a the chronology 
rodriguez was arraigned on april.the court then ordered that all motions be filed by may.it scheduled trial to begin on may.the court also granted additional time for rodriguez to examine discovery and prepare pretrial motions and therefore ordered exclusion of the time period from may to may.rodriguez does not dispute this exclusion.on april,the court scheduled the case for jury empanelment on june.
on may,rodriguez filed two motions a motion to continue empanelment and a motion for enlargement of time.in the motion to continue empanelment,rodriguez wrote,inter alia 
now comes the accused,alberto rodriguez,by and through his counsel,and moves this honorable court to continue the empanelment in this matter,currently set for june,to the court august empanelment calendar the time requested pursuant to this motion is excludable pursuant to h,in that the interest of justice in allowing the parties sufficient time to investigate the case and complete discovery prior to the filing of motions outweighs the interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.the defendant is faced with a possible life sentence and is entitled to thoroughly investigate all possible defenses.
in the motion for enlargement of time,which sought thirty days for the filing of pretrial motions,rodriguez wrote,
the time requested pursuant to this motion is excludable pursuant to h,in that the interest of justice in allowing the parties sufficient time to investigate the case and complete discovery prior to the filing of motions outweighs the interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial 
the court granted both may motions in orders dated may but docketed may.the motion for enlargement of time was granted in a margin order,but the motion to continue empanelment was allowed in an independent order in which the court,stating its reason,continued the case specifically to the august trial calendar,as rodriguez had requested.that order stated,as follows 
the defendant motion to continue empanelment is granted.this matter is continued until the august trial calendar.pursuant to rule f of the local rules of the district of rhode island for the united states district court,the filing and disposition of this motion constitutes excludable time as defined by f such a period is excludable,for the reasons stated above,and because the interest of justice in allowing the defendant to fully understand his constitutional rights regarding the criminal charges pending against him outweighs the interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
defendant argues the period between june,and july,was inappropriately excluded because the defendant had,in effect,sought only days extension in both of the pretrial motions allowed on may 
on july,the court scheduled the case for jury empanelment on august,in keeping with its may order.on july,rodriguez attorney filed a motion to withdraw dated july but docketed july.on july,the court granted the motion to withdraw,writing that 
defendant motion to withdraw is granted.this matter is continued until the september trial calendar.pursuant to rule f of the local rules of the district of rhode island for the united states district court,the filing and disposition of this motion constitutes excludable time as defined by f.such period is deemed excludable,for the reasons stated above,and because the interest of justice in allowing the defendant to fully understand his constitutional rights regarding the criminal charges pending against him outweighs the interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.
on july,the court appointed a new attorney for rodriguez,and the new counsel entered an appearance on that date.on august,the court scheduled the case for jury empanelment on september.on august,rodriguez filed a motion to dismiss the indictment based on an alleged sta violation.the government opposed the motion on august,and after a hearing on the motion on august,the court denied it the same day.at the hearing,rodriguez conceded that the only excluded time periods at issue were those following the court may and july orders namely,the periods from june and from july and that he would need to succeed in demonstrating that both time periods were improperly excluded in order to establish an sta violation 
b analysis 
we think the period from june was rightly excluded.the defendant argues that both his motion for enlargement of time and motion to continue empanelment expressly requested thirty days of excludable time and thus that the district court erred in granting excludable time beyond the thirty days to the date to which the empanelment had been continued.but while the motion for enlargement of time requested thirty days,the motion to continue empanelment expressly requested that empanelment be continued until august,and justified that request by citing and discussing the interest of justice exclusion,h.the motion stated 
t he time requested pursuant to this motion is excludable pursuant to h,in that the interest of justice in allowing the parties sufficient time to investigate the case and complete discovery prior to the filing of motions outweighs the interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.the defendant is faced with a possible life sentence and is entitled to thoroughly investigate all possible defenses.
by separately granting both the motion for a enlargement of time and the motion to continue empanelment,currently set for june,to the court august,empanelment calendar,the court was responding to the defendant separate requests for excluded time.
it is true the court order continuing empanelment until the august trial calendar cites a provision of the sta,see supra footnote,and does not cite h,the ends of justice provision.the court stated,however,that s uch a period is excludable,for the reasons stated above,and because the interest of justice in allowing the defendant to fully understand his constitutional rights regarding the criminal charges pending against him outweighs the interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial emphasis supplied.thus the court expressly referred to the interest of justice,a phrase indistinguishable from ends of justice,in addition to acting in direct response to a motion citing h as its basis.the court later amplified its intentions in its earlier finding at the hearing on the motion to dismiss,stating,
the intent of that order granting the motion to continue empanelment,and i think it a clear meaning on the face of it,is to do two things.one is to provide that the time contemplated by,requested by the defendant in the motion,in this case two motions,to continue empanelment and to delay the deadline for filing order deals only with the motion to continue the empanelment,the longer one.the purpose is to provide that that time is excl
