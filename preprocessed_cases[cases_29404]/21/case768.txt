keith goodhue goodhue here challenges his criminal sentence.the government concedes that the sentence needs recalculation under the appropriate criminal history category so remand is in order.goodhue further argues that the district court erred when it calculated his base offense level from the total weight of a mixture containing undetermined amounts of methamphetamine precursor components.we find merit to goodhue underlying contention that the government ought isolate and separately weigh the controlled substances in such a mixture or demonstrate the inability to do so.nevertheless,we hold that the district court did not commit plain error in approximating the actual weight of the precursor components.
factual and procedural history 
on november,goodhue discovered his wife lying unconscious in the bedroom of their apartment.goodhue promptly called.the paramedics and the police responded,and goodhue led them to the bedroom.the paramedics were unable to resuscitate goodhue wife so they transported her to the hospital,where she later recovered.
while in the bedroom,the police observed a stained glass tube that they suspected to be drug paraphernalia.the officers also noticed children beds,toys,and clothes and learned that two small children slept in the room.the police then conducted,with goodhue assistance,a search for needles and syringes that could pose a danger to young children.the police discovered three needles and syringes in a dresser drawer,a glass evaporator with an attached rubber hose,a glass jar with coffee filters stained red,and a bottle of lye.
the police read goodhue his miranda rights,and he signed a consent form to search the rest of the residence.goodhue led them to more drug paraphernalia.the various liquids and powders seized were submitted to the massachusetts state police crime laboratory for analysis.the crime laboratory analysis of the substances seized from goodhue home revealed the following controlled substances grams of red phosphorous grams of iodine grams of red devil lye grams of a mixture containing ephedrine and grams of a mixture containing pseudoephedrine.ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are common precursor chemicals for the manufacture of methamphetamine.
on july,goodhue pleaded guilty in federal district court to a felony information for possession of the listed chemicals with intent to manufacture methamphetamine in contravention of c.on november,the district court sentenced him to imprisonment for months followed by three years supervised release.
goodhue raises the following three issues on his timely appeal that the district court erred in the calculation of his base offense level under the united states sentencing guidelines that the district court incorrectly determined his criminal history category and that the resulting sentence was not reasonable in light of the factors enumerated in a.appellant br.at.
the government concedes that the district court miscalculated goodhue criminal history category and requests a limited remand to correct this aspect of the sentence appellee br.at.in light of this concession,remand is proper.on remand,the district court may reconsider the entire sentence,making review for reasonableness premature.see united states,cir.as a result,goodhue sole remaining issue on appeal is whether the district court correctly calculated his base offense level.
we have jurisdiction over this sentencing appeal pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
an issue is preserved for appeal when the appellant adequately preserved the issue through a timely and contemporaneous objection to the district court.see united states wihbey,cir.when an issue has been preserved,review of a district court factual findings relevant to a sentencing calculation is for clear error.united states alli,cir.review of a district court interpretation and application of the united states sentencing guidelines is de novo.united states robinson,cir.
an issue is waived,however,where the appellant intentionally relinquishes or abandons it.united states rodriguez,cir.an appellate court will normally not review waived issues.id.alternatively,an appellant forfeits his claim by failing to make a timely assertion of a right id.appellate review of a forfeited claim is for plain error only,and such a standard can be satisfied only if an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant substantial rights,but also seriously impaired the fairness,integrity,or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.united states duarte,cir see also united states riggs,cir united states,cir.
the standard of review that will apply to goodhue appeal thus turns on whether he adequately preserved his claim before the district court.accordingly,we scrutinize goodhue arguments on appeal to determine if he made the same arguments below.
goodhue claims on appeal that the district court erred when it used the aggregate weight of the entire mixture containing undetermined amounts of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine to calculate the sentence.appellant br.at.the district court calculated the applicable advisory guideline range under section by starting from a drug weight of weight of the entire mixture instead of the isolated weights of the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine components within the mixtures.sentencing transcript.at.in so doing,the district judge calculated the base offense level at,but expressed concern with this approach.id.at.
at sentencing,the government advocated the position that when a mixture contains undetermined or undeterminable amounts of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine,the district court ought simply apply the section tables to the aggregate weight of the mixtures.id.at.goodhue trial counsel objected to this approach.id.at.trial counsel argued that the district court must not apply the total weight of the mixture to the tables,but ought instead approximate the weight of the pure precursor components through any reasonable method.id.at.the reference to any reasonable method sought to direct the district court to application note of section which allows the court to estimate the weight of drug quantity when the components can not be segregated.sentencing guidelines manual cmt.
goodhue trial counsel argued that the reasonable method that the court ought follow was the yield analysis of united states barnett,cir,which calculated how much methamphetamine actual could be processed from pseudoephedrine.tr.at barnett,at.the approximated amount is then applied to the methamphetamine actual drug quantity table.as trial counsel would have it,the court would utilize a ratio of one gram of mixture to grams of methamphetamine actual.tr.at barnett,at.trial counsel objected,therefore,not to using the grams of mixture as the starting point of the sentencing calculation,but to applying the aggregate weight of the mixture to the ephedrine and pseudoephedrine tables in section instead of the approximated yield of methamphetamine actual under section.
the district court recognized,however,that the trial counsel proposed yield analysis would produce grams of methamphetamine actual from the grams of mixture.tr.at.under section,this would still result in a base offense level of.id.at.faced with this calculation,trial counsel conceded that he incorrectly read and applied the guidelines.id.at 
goodhue now,on appeal and with new counsel,seeks to the trial counsel objection raised to the district court as one challenging the use of the grams of mixture as the starting point of the calculation.compare appellant br.at,with tr.at.as described above,goodhue trial counsel bypassed a challenge on that threshold ground and focused instead on a legal theory as to how the guidelines ought apply to the grams of mixture.see tr.at.by failing to object to the use of the aggregate weight of the mixture,goodhue trial counsel forfeited that issue for appeal.see united states figuereo,cir applying a plain error review where a defendant objected at sentencing but on a basis not before the appellate panel.as a result,we will review only for plain error.see id.at.
