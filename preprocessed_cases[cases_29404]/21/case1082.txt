randall cofske appeals from the district court denial of his motion under to vacate,set aside,or correct his sentence.in substance,cofske claims that his trial counsel and appellate counsel were ineffective in failing to object to the calculation of his sentence under the sentencing guidelines.specifically,he argues that when he committed the federal offense for which he was being of stolen firearms in violation of j he did not have the prior conviction that was used to increase his base offense level bol under a.
cofske committed the federal offense in,but we start with the earlier state offense that lies at the heart of his present appeal.on october,cofske was charged in the ware district court in massachusetts with breaking and entering in the daytime with the intent to commit a felony.under the trial system then used by massachusetts,cofske waived his right to a jury trial and instead elected a bench trial in the ware district court the first tier on august,the judge found cofske guilty of the charge and sentenced him to days in prison.cofske then appealed,seeking a trial de novo the second tier before a jury of six under massachusetts law this appeal vacated the initial conviction.wilson honeywell.he was convicted again by a jury in the northampton district court on january.
after cofske conviction and appeal in ware,but before his conviction in northampton,cofske committed the federal firearms offense.on or about october,cofske and two other men broke into a salem,virginia,residence and stole about ten handguns.using cofske car,they then transported the guns to massachusetts where they were later sold.the grand jury indicted cofske on july,for possession of stolen firearms in violation of j and for transportation of stolen firearms in violation of i.
on march,pursuant to a written plea agreement,cofske pleaded guilty to the charge of possession of stolen firearms.as part of that agreement the prosecution dismissed the charge and agreed to recommend a single specific offense adjustment based on the number of firearms involved offset by a reduction for acceptance of responsibility cofske in turn agreed among other things to take the position at sentencing that his base offense level should be set at pursuant to a a,which mandated a bol of for firearms possession if the defendant had one prior felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.
the original presentence report psr listed cofske bol as,concluding that he had no such prior conviction.after the government objected,the probation officer amended the psr to include the massachusetts breaking and entering conviction already described and increased his bol to.cofske attorney urged in turn that the breaking and entering charge did not become a conviction until january,at the second tier,which was after the federal offense,and therefore could not be counted as a prior conviction under.the probation officer responded that the first tier conviction was the relevant prior conviction,and the psr left the bol at.
cofske was sentenced on july.at sentencing,cofske attorney abandoned the argument that cofske did not have a prior conviction and stated that the revised psr took up acknowledgment of the government objection which was quite correct and part of my error at the time.it starts out with a base level of pursuant to a.the district court then adopted the calculations of the revised psr,which included the breaking and entering conviction in both cofske criminal history category chc calculation under section,and his bol under section.
the court determined that cofske bol was,his adjusted offense level was and his chc was v the applicable guideline sentence range was to months.after denying cofske motion for a downward departure,the district court sentenced cofske to months in prison.cofske raising the issue he raises this court affirmed both his conviction and sentence.united states cofske,cir,cert.denied,d.
cofske then filed a motion under asserting that,at the time of his federal firearms offense,he had not been convicted of the breaking and entering offense because his conviction in the ware district court had been nullified by his appeal seeking a de novo jury trial.he further argued that this conviction was impermissibly used to enhance his bol and chc,and that his trial counsel and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to object to its inclusion in his sentence computation.
on may,the district court denied cofske motion.the court found that the conviction was the relevant conviction for purposes of section a a and that there was no error in the calculation of cofske sentence it determined that cofske was therefore not prejudiced by his counsel actions,as required by strickland washington,d,and found it unnecessary to evaluate the reasonableness of cofske attorney decision not to object to the bol calculation.the district court later denied cofske requests for reconsideration of the decision.
on february,cofske applied for a certificate of appealability,c,solely to urge that his trial and appellate counsel were ineffective in allowing his conviction to increase his bol.on april,the district court denied his application,reaffirming its may,finding and also holding in the alternative that the breaking and entering conviction counted as a prior conviction even if the correct date of conviction were deemed january.cofske united states,d.
on november,this court granted cofske certificate of appealability and directed the parties to address the following two questions 
under the massachusetts trial court system in effect at the time of cofske conviction,what is the force and effect of a district court conviction once the defendant has appealed to a trial de novo 
does the reference to a prior felony conviction in section a a include convictions 
we also granted cofske request for expedited briefing,because on his calculation,his proper sentence had already expired.
although the language of is quite general,the supreme court has restricted collateral attack for claims that do not allege constitutional or jurisdictional errors such claims are said to be cognizable only where the alleged error presents a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice or an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.hill united states,d.thus,a guideline violation alone is not automatically a basis for relief under.knight united states,cir.
however,if the claim is repackaged as one of ineffective assistance of counsel,as cofske is here,it becomes a constitutional claim.not every error amounts to ineffectiveness.see lema united states,cir.an ineffective assistance of counsel claim will succeed only if the bears the burden on both points,scarpa dubois,cir shows that counsel performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,and that but for the error or errors,the outcome would likely have been different,strickland,at.
since the absence of any error in sentencing would eliminate any prejudice,and therefore cofske ineffectiveness claim,it is useful to begin by considering the correctness of the bol calculation.at the time of cofske sentencing in july,a a stated that a defendant bol for the firearms conviction should be set at if the defendant had one prior felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.however,neither the guideline language nor the commentary answered the question,prior to what 
certainly the guideline would be satisfied if the prior conviction occurred before the federal crime itself was committed.but on this reading,we would have to count the ware district court conviction as a prior conviction,even though it had been vacated as a result of cofske filing an appeal for a second tier trial,months before cofske committed the federal offense.
whether such a vacated conviction still counts for guideline purposes is a matter of federal rather than state law.see united states mateo,cir.looking only at guideline language,one could argue the matter both ways.before he committed the federal crime,cofske had one prior felony conviction of the required cla
