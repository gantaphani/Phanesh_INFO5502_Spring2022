new york state prisoner allen harper appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york eric vitaliano,judge lois bloom,magistrate judge dismissing as untimely his pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed pursuant to.see harper.ercole,cv,wl,at.the district court assumed that harper was entitled to equitable tolling for a period of hospitalization.it nevertheless concluded that the petition was untimely because harper failed to demonstrate diligence in pursuing his claim in the time between his hospital discharge and filing.we now clarify that a litigant who seeks equitable tolling based on extraordinary circumstances and who establishes causation is required to show reasonable diligence in pursuing his claim throughout the period he seeks to have tolled.once tolling ends and the limitations clock resumes,a petition is timely as long as it is filed before the total untolled time exceeds one year.here,the record shows that at the time of harper hospitalization,days had run and days remained on the statute of limitations thus,if the limitations period is tolled for the period of harper hospitalization his filing days after discharge was within one year of the total untolled time after his conviction became final and,thus,was not untimely.accordingly,we vacate the judgment of dismissal and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
harper new york state conviction 
allen harper was convicted in after a jury trial in kings county of robbery in the first and second degrees,see penal law,and criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree,see id.since repealed.sentenced as a persistent violent felony offender,harper is presently serving concurrent indeterminate prison terms of twenty,sixteen,and.harper conviction was affirmed in on both direct appeal,see people harper,dep t,and review by the new york court of appeals,see people harper,n.
b.the petition 
the chronology of harper filing 
under the antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of aedpa,stat,harper state conviction became final on may,ninety days after the new york court of appeals denied his motion to reargue.see people harper,dillon conway,cir.consequently,under aedpa limitations period,see d,harper had until may,to file a federal habeas petition under.with days remaining in the period,harper was hospitalized on february,and remained confined until june.days later,on august,harper filed his petition,raising constitutional challenges to his conviction based on preliminary jury instructions,the denial of a suppression motion,and statements made by the prosecutor in summation.
in presenting these claims,harper acknowledged that his petition was not filed within one year of his conviction becoming final.nevertheless,he urged that aedpa limitations period be equitably tolled as a result of the extraordinary circumstances presented by his hospitalization.harper explained that while hospitalized,he underwent multiple surgeries,experienced complications,and did not have access to his legal papers.respondent,who had custody of harper and presumably his medical records throughout times relevant to this appeal,does not contend otherwise.
the magistrate judge recommendation of dismissal 
harper petition was referred to magistrate judge lois bloom,who issued a report on june,recommending that the petition be dismissed as untimely.see harper ercole,wl,at.the magistrate judge assumed that harper satisfied the requirements for equitable tolling during the period of his hospitalization.nevertheless,she concluded that such tolling did not excuse harper untimely filing because petitioner had not pursued his rights diligently in the days after his hospital discharge.id.at.the magistrate judge observed that diligence would have required harper to file an unpolished,yet petition within an unspecified shorter time.id.
harper objections to the report and recommendation 
harper objected to the magistrate judge report,providing further information as to both his hospitalization and subsequent recuperation.as to the former,harper explained that he underwent six surgeries,was confined to the bed,and was heavily medicated,affecting his consciousness and rendering him unable to write.objections to r r.as evidence of his diligence while hospitalized,harper noted that on april,he managed to send a letter to the eastern district pro se clerk requesting an extension of time to file his petition.harper letter to pro se clerk,requesting extension until at least,the day of june,when i anticipate that i should have access to the necessary legal documents and be able to complete the petition.a date stamp confirms the court receipt of the letter on may,but the record does not indicate a response 
as to his recuperation,harper explained that,after his june,hospital discharge,he remained on medication and under doctors orders to take it easy because he was still healing and recovering.objections to r r.specifically,during the days from june,to august,when he filed his petition,harper was only able to sit up for short periods of time,requiring him to work slowly to complete the petition,because the doctors feared that any attempt to move around too much could rupture the approximately one foot incision in his abdomen that had been left partially open to heal from the inside out.id.to substantiate his allegations as to the severity of his condition,harper authorized disclosure of his medical records.see id.respondent appears not to have produced any of harper prison medical records for the court,nor did he challenge harper more detailed assertions as to his condition.
the district court dismissal of harper petition 
the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation to dismiss harper petition as untimely,concluding that even if harper had sufficiently demonstrated extraordinary circumstances during the days following his release from the hospital,he failed to exercise reasonable diligence throughout the day period that he seeks to have tolled.harper ercole,wl,at.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
as the supreme court recently confirmed,aedpa limitations period may be tolled only if,consistent with the general requirements of equity,a petitioner demonstrates that he has been pursuing his rights diligently,and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.holland florida,quoting pace diguglielmo,see smith mcginnis,cir.while equitable tolling is warranted only in rare and exceptional circumstances,baldayaque united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted,courts do not apply its requirements mechanistically,see holmberg armbrecht,observing that e quity eschews mechanical rules.rather,the exercise of a court equity powers must be made on a basis,mindful that specific circumstances,often hard to predict in advance,could warrant special treatment in an appropriate case.holland florida.at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted accord dillon conway,at.
on an appeal from a district court denial of equitable tolling,we review findings of fact for clear error and the application of legal standards de novo.see belot burge,cir.in this case,the district court assumed from harper undisputed allegations that he satisfied the requirements for equitable tolling of the period of his hospitalization.thus,the issue on this appeal is one of law whether equity required harper to demonstrate diligence not only for a period warranting tolling but thereafter through the date of filing.we now clarify that the requirements of tolling must be satisfied throughout the period to be tolled.if a party carries this burden,the statute of limitations is suspended for the duration of the extraordinary circumstances supporting tolling,and filing is timely if made before the total untolled time exceeds the limitations period without need for further inquiry into diligence.we have deviated from this general rule of equitable tolling when extraordinary circumstances do not come to a determinate end,in which case diligence through filing determines the timeliness.see generally valverde stinson,cir.that,however,is not this case.
to explain that conclusion,we begin by discussing the requirements for equitable tolling.
extraordinary circumstances 
to be eligible for equitable tolling,a petitioner must demonstrate extraordinary circumstances beyond his control that prevented him from timely filing his petition.baldayaque united states,at internal quotation marks omitted.
identifying extraordinary circumstances 
the term extraordinary refers not to the uniqueness of a party circumstances,but rather to the severity of the obstacle impeding compliance with a limitations period.see bolarinwa williams,cir diaz kelly,cir.we have recognized that medical conditions,whether physical or psychiatric,can manifest extraordinary circumstances,depending on the facts presented.see,bolarinwa williams,at holding mental illness may equitably toll aedpa limitations period brown parkchester,cir holding medical condition could support equitable tolling in title vii case.consistent with this precedent,we conclude that hospitalization may demonstrate extraordinary circumstances,again,depending on the facts presented.here,the district court assumption that harper hospitalization constituted extraordinary circumstances finds support in the petitioner unchallenged representation as to the significant length of his confinement during which he underwent six surgeries,requiring him to be confined to bed and heavily medicated 
the causation requirement attending extraordinary circumstances 
to secure equitable tolling,it is not enough for a party to show that he experienced extraordinary circumstances.he must further demonstrate that those circumstances caused him to miss the original filing deadline.see,valverde stinson,at explaining need for causal relationship between the extraordinary circumstances on which the claim for equitable tolling rests and the lateness of the filing.a court may conclude that such causation is lacking where the identified extraordinary circumstances arose and concluded early within the limitations period.in such circumstances,a diligent petitioner would likely have no need for equity to intervene to file within the time remaining to him.see,hizbullahankhamon walker,f d,cir declining to grant equitable tolling for petitioner period of solitary confinement at beginning of limitations period see also allen lewis,f d,cir identifying no causation to support equitable tolling of period occurring eleven months before aedpa filing deadline fisher johnson,cir concluding causation not established where period to be tolled occurred more than six months before aedpa filing deadline.respondent does not and can not argue that this case presents such a causation concern.the extraordinary circumstances of harper hospitalization arose after days of the limitations period had run and continued past the deadline.in short,no filing time remained when the extraordinary circumstances ended.
we have suggested that a court also may find causation lacking where a petitioner has been so neglectful in the preparation of his petition that even in the absence of the extraordinary circumstances,a reasonable person in the petitioner situation would have been unable to file in the time remaining within the limitations period.valverde stinson,at see also belot burge,at this comports with the principle that equity will not intervene to reward negligence.see pace diguglielmo,at equity always refuses to interfere where there has been gross laches in the prosecution of rights.internal quotation marks omitted baldwin cnty.welcome ctr.brown,one who fails to act diligently can not invoke equitable principles to excuse that lack of diligence.we have cautioned,however,that causation should not be used to fault a party for failing to file early or to take other extraordinary precautions early in the limitations period against what are,by definition,rare and exceptional circumstances that occur later in that period.valverde stinson,at.
this case presents no negligence to undermine causation.a reasonably diligent person could have prepared a petition in the days remaining on the aedpa limitations period when harper encountered the extraordinary circumstances of his hospitalization.indeed,after discharge,harper himself filed his petition in days,within the time that would have remained available to him under aedpa had he not been hospitalized.under these circumstances,it can not be argued that undue delay,rather than the identified extraordinary circumstances,caused harper to miss the original aedpa filing deadline.
in sum,the undisputed record demonstrates both that harper was subject to extraordinary circumstances for the period of his hospitalization and that those circumstances caused his failure to file for relief within aedpa limitations period.
consistent with the maxim that equity aids the vigilant,see,e,iavorski,cir,a petitioner seeking equitable tolling of aedpa limitations period must demonstrate that he acted with reasonable diligence throughout the period he seeks to toll,belot burge,at.this standard calls for reasonable diligence,not maximum feasible diligence,holland florida.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted,which a petitioner may satisfy by showing that he act ed as diligently as reasonably could have been expected under the circumstances,baldayaque united states,at emphasis in original.
the district court assumption that harper acted with reasonable diligence while hospitalized finds support in harper unchallenged description of the severity of his condition and the fact that he,nevertheless,sought to protect his right to seek relief by submitting a letter to the court requesting an extension of time within which to file his petition.
determining the timeliness of harper filing 
if,as the district court assumed,equitable tolling suspends aedpa statute of limitations for the period of harper hospitalization,his august,filing was within one year of the total untolled time after his conviction became final.the district court concluded that the filing was nevertheless untimely because harper failed to demonstrate reasonable diligence in pursuing his petition in the days after his hospital discharge.the conclusion rests on a mistake of law,an assumption that diligence must be shown through filing even after equitable tolling has ended on a date certain and where the total untolled time has not exceeded the limitations period this court has repeatedly stated that a party seeking equitable tolling must show diligent pursuit of his claim throughout the period he seeks to toll.belot burge,at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added see zerilli edelglass.transit,cir holding that person seeking equitable tolling must show that she acted with reasonable diligence during the time period she seeks to have tolled internal quotation marks omitted johnson nyack,cir equitable tolling requires a party to pass with reasonable diligence through the period it seeks to have tolled.if such a showing is not made,equitable tolling should be denied or at least circumscribed to the period for which diligence and causation are established.but if such a showing is made along with the other requirements for equitable tolling,a court may suspend the statute of limitations for the period of extraordinary circumstances and determine timeliness by reference to the total untolled period without requiring a further showing of diligence through filing.
such an approach to determining the timeliness of a filing is consistent with the general rule of equitable tolling articulated by the supreme court principles of equitable tolling usually dictate that when a time bar has been suspended and then begins to run again upon a later event,the time remaining on the clock is calculated by subtracting from the full limitations period whatever time ran before the clock was stopped.united states ibarra,see haekal refco,cir observing in context of commodity exchange act filing that w hen equitable tolling is applied,the limitations period is deemed interrupted when the tolling condition or event has ended,the claimant is allowed the remainder of the limitations period in which to file his action see also go
