petitioner melvin poindexter,a federal prisoner who was convicted in the united states district court for the district of connecticut of narcotics offenses and sentenced as a career offender,appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york,lawrence kahn,judge,dismissing his petition for habeas corpus under which alleged chiefly that poindexter received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial,that his sentence violates apprendi new jersey,d,and the international covenant on civil and political rights,iccpr or covenant,and that he is actually innocent with respect to career offender status.the district court ruled that poindexter petition was more properly an application under,rather than under that the petition would be a second or successive application,for which filing permission from the court of appeals was required and that such permission had not been received.accordingly,the court transferred the application for relief to this court for consideration of whether to grant leave to file,and it otherwise dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction.on appeal,poindexter argues principally that the court had jurisdiction under because adequate relief is unavailable to him under and because he asserted a claim of actual innocence.for the reasons that follow,we disagree and affirm the judgment.
background 
the following account of the proceedings involving poindexter prior to his present application is taken from his present petition and from united states fullwood,cir.poindexter i,cert.denied,d,which,on direct appeal,affirmed poindexter conviction.
a.the prior proceedings 
in,following a jury trial in the district of connecticut,poindexter was convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute,in violation of a,and conspiracy to distribute cocaine,in violation of.in conformity with the practice,the quantity of cocaine that the government contended was involved in poindexter offenses was neither alleged in the indictment nor found by the jury.the district court,in calculating poindexter sentence under the sentencing guidelines guidelines,found that the quantity of cocaine involved in his offenses exceeded kilograms,giving him a base offense level of.the court also found that,in light of three of his prior convictions,to wit,assault with a firearm,sale of narcotics,and possession of narcotics,poindexter should be classified as a career offender,which increased his offense level to and placed him in criminal history category vi,see guidelines.the court sentenced him,within the guidelines recommended range,to,inter alia,a prison term of months.
poindexter appealed his conviction to this court,contending that the district court had erred in various suppression and evidentiary rulings.all of poindexter contentions were rejected his conviction was affirmed,see poindexter i,at and the supreme court denied certiorari in.
in,poindexter filed in the district of connecticut a pro se motion under to vacate his conviction.he alleged that his sentence was illegal,that statements used against him at trial had been coerced,that he was denied due process,and that he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel.that motion was denied.the district court denied poindexter a certificate of appealability,as did this court,see united states poindexter,cir,cert.denied,d.
b.the present application 
in may,represented by counsel,poindexter filed his present application in the northern district of new york,styling it a petition pursuant to and the petition.the petition alleged that poindexter sentence is being unlawfully executed because he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial attorney failed to advise him to plead guilty in order to secure a more lenient sentence the sentence was calculated in violation of his rights under apprendi and in violation of articles,and of the iccpr by denying him due process,equal protection,and the benefit of a subsequent law referring to apprendi that lightened the penalty for his offense and he is actually innocent of being a career offender.
the government,directed by the court to respond to the petition,moved to dismiss on numerous grounds,including that the apprendi claim lacked merit because poindexter sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum for his offense,given his prior criminal record that apprendi is not retroactive and may not form the basis for a collateral attack that poindexter procedurally defaulted his apprendi claim by not asserting it on his direct appeal,and his present petition made no suggestion that he could meet the test in order to excuse his default that the petition was untimely,having been made more than four years after poindexter conviction became final upon the supreme court denial of certiorari following his direct appeal,and more than three years after the running of the applicable statute of limitations and that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the present petition.as to the jurisdictional point,the government contended that the petition was improperly filed under and should be construed as a motion under because it challenged poindexter conviction and his sentence as imposed the government argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain such a motion because poindexter had filed a prior motion that was denied on its merits,and he had not obtained the requisite court of appeals authorization for the filing of a second or successive motion.
the government motion was referred to magistrate judge david peebles for report and recommendation.the magistrate judge recommended that the government motion be granted on the ground of lack of jurisdiction 
because this petition challenges poindexter conviction and resulting sentence,rather than the execution of that sentence or the conditions of his confinement,and represents a second or successive motion brought under to challenge his conviction and sentence without the required court of appeals permission,i recommend a finding that this court lacks jurisdiction in the matter.additionally,in light of my finding that the petition in this matter should be treated as a motion brought under section,and considering that a prior motion by petitioner under that section was dismissed on the merits,i recommend that the petition be transferred to the second circuit court of appeals to consider whether to grant poindexter leave to file a second or successive petition,in which event the second circuit would then presumably transfer the petition to the district of connecticut,as the district of conviction and sentencing.
report and recommendation dated january,at.the district court approved and adopted the magistrate judge report.the petition was transferred to this court to the extent that it sought relief within the scope of.judgment was entered dismissing the petition insofar as it sought relief under.
following the transfer,this court directed poindexter to file,on or before april,an application for leave to file a second or successive motion.he failed to file such an application,and that phase of the matter was closed.see poindexter nash,cir.may.
ii.discussion 
on this appeal,poindexter argues principally that his application was a proper petition under because under he can not obtain an adequate remedy for his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and violations of apprendi and the iccpr,and because his claim is one of actual innocence with respect to career offender status.we reject his contentions.
a.the general scope of 
section provides generally that the federal courts have the power to grant writs of habeas corpus,see a,in behalf of,inter alios,prisoners who are in custody in violation of the constitution or laws or treaties of the united states,id.c.section provides in part that a federal prisoner may seek 
release upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the united states,or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence,or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law,or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.
despite their overlapping language and the generality of,the two sections have been construed as address ing different types of claims.chambers united states,cir.
under,a prisoner may challenge the execution of his sentence,id.at emphasis in original,such as calculations by the bureau of prisons of the credit to be given for other periods of detention,or decisions to deny parole,see id.at,or conditions of confinement,see,jiminian nash,cir kingsley bureau of prisons,cir.section,on the other hand,is the proper vehicle when the federal prisoner seeks to challenge the legality of the imposition of a sentence by a court.chambers united states,at emphasis in original.as a general rule,when collaterally attacking a sentence on the ground that he was convicted in violation of the constitution or federal law,a federal prisoner must use.triestman united states,cir see also jiminian nash,at is generally the proper vehicle for a federal prisoner challenge to his conviction and sentence.
roccisano menifee,cir.in sum,where a petitioner challenges the constitutionality of the imposition of his sentence rather than the execution of his sentence,his petition should be construed as a motion for relief under.hom sui ching united states,cir see,roccisano menifee,at corrao united states,cir chambers united states,at.
none of the claims asserted by poindexter challenged the execution of his sentence.he alleged only that errors occurred in the events that preceded his sentencing,to wit the failure of trial counsel to advise him to plead guilty the finding of drug quantity by the court,rather than a jury,for purposes of sentencing and the finding that his record qualified him to be sentenced as a career offender.plainly,these claims fall within the scope of a motion and outside the normal scope of a petition.
limited availability of for claims 
in some very limited circumstances,claims that fall within the substantive scope of may properly be made in a petition filed under.see,jiminian nash,at triestman united states,at.section itself provides,in pertinent part,that 
a n application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section,shall not be entertained if it appears that the court which sentenced him has denied him relief,unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.
emphasis added.where relief through is unavailable as a procedural matter,and the failure to allow for collateral review would raise serious constitutional questions,jiminian nash,at quoting triestman united states,at,we have interpreted exception for inadequate or ineffective remedy as making an exception to the general rule that a federal prisoner must use instead of seeking a writ of habeas corpus under,triestman united states,at.
in order to fit within this exception authorizing a petition under for a claim that is within the substantive scope of,it is insufficient simply that relief under is unavailable because,for example,a prior motion under has been made and a successive motion under that section is disallowed by the court of appeals under the gatekeeping provisions of and,see,roccisano menifee,at jiminian nash,at,or because relief is unavailable because the supreme court has not made a new rule of constitutional law retroactive to cases on collateral review,see love menifee.lexis,at cir.june,no serious constitutional question raised by unavailability of retroactive relief on an apprendi claim.the application not only must show that relief is procedurally unavailable under,but also must assert a claim of actual innocence that a is prov able on the existing record,and b could not have effectively been raised at an earlier time.triestman united states,at.poindexter meets only the unavailability element of this test.
the present unavailability of relief under 
it is clear that a motion is now unavailable to poindexter.he made a motion unsuccessfully in.after the transfer of his present application to this court,he did not,despite notice from this court,pursue a request for authorization to file a second motion.and at oral argument of this appeal,his attorney conceded that there simply are no grounds under which poindexter could qualify for leave to file a second or successive motion an apt concession.permission to file a second or successive motion may properly be granted only as to a claim that relies either on a new rule of constitutional law,made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the supreme court,or on 
newly discovered evidence that,if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole,would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense,
id.emphasis added.none of poindexter present claims meets this test.
his apprendi claim is not one that may be raised in a second or successive motion,because the supreme court has not made apprendi retroactive to cases on collateral review.see,forbes united states,cir per curiam.and although poindexter claims that the iccpr requires that apprendi be applied retroactively,that contention is meritless for at least two reasons.article,on which he relies,states that i f,subsequent to the commission of the offense,provision is made by law for the imposition of a lighter penalty,the offender shall benefit thereby.at.but apprendi does not lessen the penalty for any offense it merely specifies that the factual prerequisites for imposition of a sentence that exceeds the statutory maximum must be alleged in the indictment and found by the jury.hence,the covenant does not apply.further,even if apprendi were deemed to be a law within the scope of article,the covenant would afford no basis for relief,for articles through of the covenant a re not,see.daily ed,and could not therefore give rise to privately enforceable rights under united states law.de la rosa united states,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d see also wesson united states penitentiary,cir per curiam habeas relief not available for alleged violation of covenant provisions as to which congress has not allowed private enforcement,cert.denied,d.
nor does poindexter claim meet the requirements of and for leave to file a second or successive motion,for the controlling constitutional principles are not new,the factual predicates do not appear to be newly discovered,and poindexter presents no facts that could have led to a finding that he was not guilty of his present narcotics offenses.his contention is that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to inform him a of the government filing of an information pursuant to to subject him to increased penalties by reason of his prior convictions,and b of the existence of a plea offer,and in failing to advise him to accept the plea offer.poindexter could have asserted this claim in his first motion,for the record indicates that he was aware of all of the facts underlying this claim before the end of his trial,see massaro united states,d an claim may be brought in a collateral proceeding under,whether or not the petitioner could have raised the claim on direct appeal.the petition stated that a t trial,poindexter attorney stated that he had not discussed with poindexter the information petition at,and that the government withdrew the plea offer on the record on the third day of trial id.thus,poindexter apparently knew the relevant facts at trial,and he obviously knew throughout that his attorney did not advise him to plead guilty.accordingly,poindexter claim could have been made in his first motion.
in any event,poindexter claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was not based on any viable assertion that he is innocent of the instant offenses.although his petition asserted that he was actually innocent of violating the provisions of b a because no single cocaine transaction was in excess of five kilograms of cocaine petition at,he makes no claim that he did not distribute cocaine in violation of a,one of the two offenses of which he was convicted.nor does he claim that he did not engage in conspiracy to distribute cocaine in violation of,his
