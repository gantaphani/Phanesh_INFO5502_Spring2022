reginald gracie appeals his sentence,arguing that the district court should have sentenced him for accepting an illegal gratuity rather than for demanding a bribe.we affirm.
background 
reginald gracie,was a pharmacist.in,he became director of operations for the pin rx,a pharmacy that was wholly owned and operated by the penobscot indian nation and which did a substantial amount of questionable business filling prescriptions for online pharmacies.when pin rx pharmacist in charge resigned from that role over concerns that these transactions threatened her license,gracie took over that position.thereafter,gracie admits that he began accepting payments from internet pharmacy sites for whose customers pin rx filled orders.
gracie was eventually indicted on charges relating to these payments.on february,gracie pled guilty to three counts two counts not at issue here,and count,which charged him with soliciting and accepting kickbacks in violation of a b.specifically,count alleged that gracie corruptly solicit ed,demand ed,accept ed and agree d to accept a thing of value,namely deposited into his personal bank account from representatives of company f intending to be influenced and rewarded in connection with the filling of drug orders by pin rx for the customers of company f,which transactions were valued at or more.
at sentencing,the parties disputed which guideline the district court should use to determine gracie base offense level.the dispute arose because the guidelines implicitly presume that section a b criminalizes both the receipt of bribes and the receipt of gratuities.the guidelines index manifests this presumption by directing a court sentencing for a violation of section a b to two different guidelines section offering,giving,soliciting,or receiving a bribe and section offering,giving,soliciting,or receiving a gratuity.sentencing guidelines manual.the sentencing guidelines manual provides that when several guidelines are listed in the index for a given statute or subsection,the sentencing court must determine which of the referenced guideline sections is most appropriate for the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted.
by selecting section,for bribery,as the most appropriate guideline,the district court calculated a base offense level three points higher than would have been the case had the court selected section as the most appropriate guideline.compare a,with id.a.employing that base offense level,the district court sentenced gracie to months imprisonment on count.having preserved his right to appeal any sentence in excess of eighteen months of imprisonment,gracie appealed.he contends that the district court erred in selecting the bribery guideline.for the following reasons,we disagree.
ii.standard of review 
although we had previously treated a district court choice of guideline as predominantly a question of fact to be reviewed for clear error,united states mariano,cir,we recently clarified that w e review the district court choice of guidelines de novo,and its attendant factual determinations for clear error.united states almeida,cir accord united states ihenacho,cir.
iii.analysis 
gracie pled to soliciting and receiving a bribe,not a gratuity.
when the district court sentenced gracie,it was possible to construe a b as making it unlawful to solicit or to accept either bribes or gratuities see united states ganim,cir describing section a b as prohibiting the acceptance of both bribes and gratuities united states zimmermann,cir same mariano,at noting that section a seem ed to virtually mirror the language of b,which prohibits bribing federal officials.a decision subsequent to gracie sentencing and appeal,discussed infra,has clarified that section a b does not apply to gratuities.see united states fernandez,cir.in evaluating gracie claims,however,we first consider whether his actions,at the time of sentencing,could reasonably be interpreted as accepting either a gratuity or a bribe.
the essential distinction between a bribe and a gratuity is that a bribe requires a quid pro quo,the exchange of something of value for influence over some official conduct of the recipient.see mariano,at.the indicted offense to which gracie pled guilty plainly charged a quid pro quo.gracie was indicted for corruptly solicit ing,demand ing,accept ing and agree ing to accept payments totaling intending to be influenced in connection with the filling of drug orders when a person with the power to do or not do something demands a payment from the beneficiary of the exercise of that power as a condition for continuing to do so,the payment is not gratuitous.united states alfisi,cir noting,in a case under,that even if payments were to assure that an inspector carried out his duties accurately,they were nonetheless bribes.
the circumlocutious manner in which gracie recharacterizes his conduct reinforces the conclusion that the indictment charges the solicitation and receipt of bribes.gracie argues that he took payments as a reward for staying in his position and continuing to risk his license in a questionable business.this description is revealing for its omission of the actual charge that gracie demand ed and accept ed the payment.we infer from such strained avoidance that gracie recognizes his argument as an equally strained interpretation of the facts.it is also revealing for its concession that he demanded and took the funds not for a past event,but for continuing to do what the payee desired stay on the job and risk his license by filling online drug orders.if a bus driver demands a tip from his passengers for continuing to drive the bus,the resulting payments are hardly gratuitous.so,too,if gracie demanded payments from an online prescription drug seller for,as he argues,continuing to perform his job of filling drug orders,the resulting payments were the seller this exchanged for gracie that.
taking a slightly different tack,gracie strings together the following argument the background notes to sections and discuss only those bribe and gratuity recipients who are public officials gracie is not a public official guidelines section distinguishes bribes from gratuities in the context of employee welfare benefit plans and labor unions without reference to public officials,defining bribes as payments for official action,and gratuities as everything else gracie decision to continue working was not an official action,so under section,the payment would be a gratuity therefore the court should have applied section.
gracie does not argue that the district court should have actually sentenced him under section nor does he claim that because his scheme involved no public officials,both sections and which appear under the heading offenses involving public officials and violations of federal election campaign laws were inapposite in any event,the guidelines themselves are specific.they cover both situations where the defendant was a public official and otherwise.see a,a.and there is no dispute that gracie was not sentenced as a public official.see a,a.rather,his argument boils down to the claim that because the background notes to sections and do fully capture his conduct,the district court should have imported definitions of bribe and gratuity from a different guidelines section to select the most appropriate guideline for his charge.
we have previously cautioned against mixing and matching guidelines for different crimes,as each set of guidelines tends to function as a unit with its own tradeoffs and specifications.united states brennick,cir see also,cmt.there was no need for the district court to do so here.although sections and do not define bribe and gratuity as explicitly as section does,the distinction has been well defined in the case law.see mariano,at discussing section a see also united states sun diamond growers of,construing.there was no need to look to section,which applies to significantly different statutes,to discern the difference.
even if we followed gracie lead,however,he is again defeated by the indictment.gracie was charged with taking money while acting as the and director of operations of pin rx,intending
