joey chibuko appeals his judgment of conviction and sentence following trial in the united states district court for the district of connecticut bryant,on nine counts of various fraud crimes,including three counts of aggravated identity theft.each count arose from chibuko impersonation of the same individual.the district court ordered that chibuko terms of imprisonment for all three of his crimes run consecutively with each other even though two of those crimes may fall within guidelines application note b ii,which describes when the sentences for crimes should generally run concurrently with each other.since the district court did not mention or otherwise indicate that it considered this guideline,we remand for additional sentencing proceedings as discussed in our conclusion infra.
background 
defendant appellant joey chibuko is a nigerian national.in,he obtained a tourist visa in lagos,nigeria,using false information and traveled to california.within two weeks of arriving,he applied for a social security number and later fraudulently obtained several california driver licenses.in december,after his tourist visa expired,chibuko married an american citizen and in the following year applied for legal residence,again using false information.chibuko was granted conditional residence that expired in.
in october,chibuko was arrested in oakland,california,for credit card theft and fraud.by the time charges were filed against him,however,chibuko had already fled to massachusetts.chibuko then used a fraudulently obtained california identity card and social security card to assume the identity of ray awommack.as awommack,chibuko obtained a job at the greater lynn mental health and retardation association,an operator of group homes for developmentally disabled adults.from july through october,chibuko worked weekend shifts at one of its facilities.while working at the home,chibuko stole the birth certificate of steven buckley,one of the group home residents.
by,chibuko had relocated to connecticut,where he used buckley birth certificate and social security number to apply for a passport.beginning around the same time,chibuko applied for employment under buckley name at two human services agencies,obtained a driver license,mortgages,credit cards,and bank accounts in buckley name,and even used buckley identity to vote in the election.meanwhile,the real steven buckley began receiving notices from collection agencies.
in september,chibuko was arrested for his fraudulent passport application.the following month,a federal grand jury indicted him for the passport fraud and eight other fraud counts.counts four,six,and nine of the indictment charged chibuko with aggravated identity theft under,which makes it unlawful to knowingly use a means of identification of another person while committing any of a list of enumerated felonies.counts four and nine were based on chibuko answers in an i form in connection with his two employment applications,and count six was based on chibuko voter registration application.the case went to trial on may,and on may,the jury convicted chibuko on all nine counts.
throughout trial and sentencing,chibuko steadfastly claimed to be steven buckley.he professed that buckley birthday is his also and that his parents have the same names as buckley and are from the same town.he told a story that includes being taken to nigeria at age three following the death of his mother,where he was raised by his maternal aunt and uncle,patty and joseph chibuko.while growing up,he adopted the name joey chibuko,because,as he put it,it sounded more local.
the district court sentenced chibuko to an effective sentence of months in prison including three consecutive month terms for his crimes.chibuko,by counsel,appeals only his sentence.pro se,he brings various challenges to his conviction.
discussion 
most criminal statutes provide a range of possible sentences.section does not.the sentence is two years imprisonment.no more.no less.a.the court may not reduce the sentence for the defendant other crimes to compensate for the additional two years imposed by nor may the court allow a sentence to run concurrently with a sentence for any other crime.id.at b.if a defendant is convicted of more than one offense under,the only sentencing decision the court makes is whether the sentences for multiple offenses will run concurrently with each other.in making this decision,however,the court must exercise its discretion in accordance with any applicable guidelines and policy statements issued by the sentencing commission.b.
the guideline directly relevant to such a determination sets out a nonexhaustive list of at least three factors that the court should consider in determining whether prison terms for multiple counts should run concurrently with,or consecutively to,each other.guidelines application note b.the first and third factors are,respectively,t he nature and seriousness of the underlying offenses,id.application note b i,and w hether the purposes of sentencing set forth in a are better achieved by imposing a concurrent or a consecutive sentence for multiple counts of,id.application note b iii.the second factor set out in application note b to is groupability generally,multiple counts of should run concurrently with one another in cases in which the underlying offenses are groupable under.id.application note b ii emphasis added.section b provides that 
a ll counts involving substantially the same harm shall be grouped together into a single group.counts involve substantially the same harm within the meaning of this rule when counts involve the same victim and two or more acts or transactions connected by a common criminal objective or constituting part of a common scheme or plan.
guidelines b.however,the commentary on b states that t his provision does not authorize the grouping of offenses that can not be considered to represent essentially one composite harm id.application note.
under the guidelines,offenses themselves are not groupable.see guidelines b section offenses are excluded from application of because the guideline sentence for each offense is determined only by the relevant statute,which mandates a sentence for each count.guidelines application note.in deciding whether to run multiple sentences concurrently,however,a court must consider whether the underlying offenses the crimes during which a false identity was used were groupable.as indicated above,sentences for multiple offenses g enerally should be concurrent with each other where the underlying offenses are groupable.guidelines application note b ii.
chibuko did not object in the district court on the ground that the court failed to consider the underlying offenses groupability.we thus review only for plain error.see.b.
in sentencing chibuko to three consecutive prison terms for his three offenses,the district court was aware that it had the authority to run chibuko sentences concurrently or consecutively in concluding that the sentences should be consecutive rather than concurrent,however,the court made no reference to guidelines no reference to application note b and,no reference to groupability.although the court went on to consider a factors as was required by application note b iii its statements did not indicate that the court was considering those factors in connection with the issue of consecutiveness versus concurrence.
at sentencing,a district court need not list every possibly relevant guideline in a robotic incantation.united states cavera,cir en banc quotation marks omitted.but,neither can a court ignore factors congress has instructed it to consider.thus,the amount of explanation required by a district court for its sentencing decision will vary with the circumstances.id.if the facts and the parties arguments suggest that a guidelines factor such as groupability is relevant,there should be some indication in the record that the court considered it.some cases will require an extended discussion of a given factor.other cases may require only a brief mention or even need none at all.see id.in a case where the charges clearly arise from unrelated conduct,or where some other factor c
