this case is a cautionary tale for criminal defense counsel as to the need to observe the time limits for taking appeals set forth in the federal rules of appellate procedure and the restrictions on reconsideration of sentences set forth in the federal rules of criminal procedure.two basic lessons emerge from our consideration of the interplay between the two sets of rules.first,motions for reconsideration of sentence,unmoored in the rules,do not extend the time for an appeal.the era when this court accepted such an approach in united states morillo,cir,ended in with the amendments to the federal rules of appellate procedure,which specifically rejected morillo.see fed.b advisory committee note amendments.second,congressional enactments have deprived the district courts of their authority to modify sentences at a defendant behest unless they have before them a motion properly brought under.a and act on it within days of the original sentence.see c.
neither lesson was heeded here.defendant failure to file a timely notice of appeal from his original sentence dooms his appeal.
on april,defendant hector manuel gonzalez rodriguez pled guilty to aggravated felonious sexual assault in state court in new hampshire.as a result of this conviction,he was required under the sex offender registration and notification act sorna,title i,stat.codified at u,to register as a sex offender.failure to register pursuant to sorna is a federal crime.see a.
gonzalez rodriguez engaged in a number of other criminal offenses in new hampshire which led to convictions after his guilty plea,and he had active arrest warrants outstanding in.in december,defendant moved from new hampshire to puerto rico.he did not notify puerto rican authorities of his establishing residence there,as required under sorna.on april,he was charged in a indictment alleging that he had failed to register in puerto rico as a sex offender in violation of a.gonzalez rodriguez pled guilty to that charge on august,pursuant to a plea agreement 
the district court held defendant sentencing hearing on february.after hearing arguments from counsel,the district court orally sentenced gonzalez rodriguez to months imprisonment and years of supervised release.the court imposed several special conditions on the term of supervised release,including conditions which require gonzalez rodriguez to avoid contact with minors after completing its recitation of the conditions of supervised release,the district court advised gonzalez rodriguez that he had days from the entry of judgment to file a notice of appeal.
defense counsel kept arguing over the terms of the sentence,despite the fact that the court had already orally imposed the sentence.she asserted that the conditions imposed by the court were unduly onerous because gonzalez rodriguez conviction was for failure to register as a sex offender rather than for a new sex offense counsel contended that there was no basis upon which the court could conclude that defendant was a danger to juveniles and hence no justification for the special conditions.the district judge responded,
what i going to do is give you days to submit a motion stating the legal grounds as to which there should be entertained such a discrepancy and treatment of the law sic,and you have my commitment that i look into it and do exactly the same type of research.
defense counsel then raised additional arguments,and the district court asked that those arguments be included in the motion as well.the court did not alter its statement that any appeal had to be filed within days of entry of judgment.
the court entered final judgment on february,entirely consistent with its oral judgment.defendant took no appeal from entry of that judgment within days.
on march,days after judgment was entered,defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of sentence,in which he argued that his sentence was excessive and greater than necessary to comply with the purposes set forth in and that the district court had imposed unwarranted and unconstitutional conditions on his supervised release.the district court did not act on the motion before the day after judgment was entered.it eventually denied the motion,but not until january.the text order stated simply that t he conditions imposed are reasonably related to defendant s conviction and prior record.defendant filed a notice of appeal on february,purporting to appeal from both the judgment and the denial of his motion for reconsideration.no prior appeal had been taken.
defendant opening brief on appeal argues only that the district court imposed unreasonable conditions on his supervised release.the brief fails in its obligation to first address the existence of appellate jurisdiction,merely asserting that the appeal was timely.see calder√≥n serra wilmington trust,cir t he party invoking the jurisdiction of a federal court carries the burden of proving its existence.alteration in original quoting murphy united states,cir.the government brief,filed on january,directly challenged jurisdiction.yet defendant ignored that challenge and failed to file a reply.
this court then ordered defendant to file a reply brief on the question of jurisdiction.in the reply brief,defendant acknowledges that the appeal failed to comply with the requirements of fed.b,but argues that his motion for reconsideration should make his appeal timely.we reject this argument.we do not reach the merits of defendant claim as to his supervised release conditions because defendant failed to file a notice of appeal from the february,judgment within the time limit set by fed.b.
the basic rule regarding time limits for criminal appeals is that a defendant notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within days after the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed.fed.b a.compliance with the time limits set forth in fed.b is mandatory.united states rapoport,cir indeed,fed.b explicitly prohibits a court of appeals from enlarging the time permitted for filing a notice of appeal.id.
fed.b a restricts to only three the types of motions that can suspend the day period set forth in rule b a a motion for judgment of acquittal under,a motion for a new trial under,and a motion for arrest of judgment under.the advisory notes to fed.b make clear that these are the only motions that suspend the time to appeal in criminal cases.see fed.b advisory committee note amendments 
here,final judgment was entered on february,and defendant did not file his notice of appeal until nearly a year later,on february,defendant concedes that his motion for reconsideration is not one of the motions listed in fed.b a.defendant appeal of the judgment of conviction was untimely.
defendant invites us to construe his notice of appeal as an appeal from the district court january,order denying his motion for reconsideration.even if his appeal is untimely as to his original sentence,defendant argues that it is not untimely as to the denial of his motion for reconsideration.defendant is wrong for several reasons.
this court has recently emphasized that t here is simply no such thing as a motion to reconsider an otherwise final sentence united states ortiz,cir second alteration in original quoting united states dotz,cir.in appeals unrelated to sentencing,motions to reconsider,recognized at common law may be valid and may extend time limits,at least when filed by the government.see,united states ibarra,d.as explained in ibarra and like cases,that is because there is no final judgment until the court rules on the reconsideration motion.see id.at.
but as to sentencing,congress has eliminated the practice of allowing motions for reconsideration.as well explained in united states townsend,cir,that resulted from the passage of the sentencing reform act of,which encompasses c.id.at.as we have said,under the current statutory scheme,o nce a district court imposes a term of imprisonment,it may modify that term only to the extent authorized by c.united states griffin,cir.that statute in turn provides,in relevant part,that a court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except that the court may modify an imposed ter
