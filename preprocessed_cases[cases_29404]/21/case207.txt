this sentencing appeal hinges on two claims of error.one is hopeless,but the other requires us to answer a question about whether an additional downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,see ussg b,sometimes may be available without a government motion.concluding that the answer to this question is affirmative,we remand for resentencing.
because this appeal follows a guilty plea,we glean the relevant facts from the colloquy,the unchallenged portions of the presentence investigation report psi report,and the transcript of the disposition hearing.see united states vargas,cir united states dietz,cir.in april of,immigration and customs enforcement ice agents were hot on the heels of a ring.as part of this investigation,an undercover agent whom we shall call x began negotiating a drug smuggle with members of the ring.on april,one of the suspects,eliezer delgado ramos delgado,met with x to coordinate the venture.julio meléndez rivera attended this meeting.
the hatched plot contemplated that x would rendezvous with a vessel at sea,receive approximately kilograms of cocaine,bring the contraband ashore in puerto rico,and place it in a van that would subsequently be driven away by the drug ring.on may,x effected the transfer at sea,and federal agents seized the cocaine before it reached the shore.
blissfully unaware that the drugs had been intercepted,the appellant and delgado gave x the keys to the van in which the cocaine was to be loaded.the next day,federal agents and other law enforcement officers conducted a controlled delivery they loaded the van with ersatz cocaine and left the van at the agreed location.the appellant drove away in the van and was promptly apprehended.
in due season,a federal grand jury sitting in the district of puerto rico returned an indictment.pertinently,it charged the appellant with conspiracy to import over five kilograms of cocaine into the united states count,see,and conspiracy to distribute over five kilograms of cocaine count,see id.a.after some preliminary skirmishing,the appellant entered a straight guilty plea.the probation office then prepared the psi report,which recommended a guideline sentencing range of months.
prior to the disposition hearing,the appellant filed a sentencing memorandum urging a downward adjustment for what he deemed his mitigating role in the offense see ussg b.the sentencing memorandum further urged a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility rather than the adjustment recommended in the psi report.see id.b.
the sentencing court convened the disposition hearing on august.the court eschewed any mitigating role adjustment,concluding that the appellant part in the conspiracy was not minor.at the same time,it granted a reduction for acceptance of responsibility but rejected the appellant importunings for an additional adjustment,stating i do think i can grant it.i do have the discretion to do so unless the government files a motion.the court proceeded to impose a term of immurement months.this timely appeal ensued.
the appellant first claim of error is easily dispatched.it rests on the notion that,on the facts,the sentencing court should have classified the appellant as merely a bit player in the conspiracy and discounted his offense level accordingly.that notion is fatuous.
the sentencing guidelines authorize a reduction in a defendant offense level upon a finding that the defendant was a minor participant in the relevant criminal activity.id.b.to qualify for this adjustment,a defendant must show that he is both less culpable than most of his cohorts in the particular criminal endeavor and less culpable than the of those who have committed similar crimes.see united states ocasio,cir.a defendant bears the burden of proving his entitlement to a minor participant reduction by a preponderance of the evidence.see united states quiñones medina,cir.
a determination of a defendant role in the offense is invariably and,thus,appellate review of such a determination is respectful.see united states santos,cir.consequently,we review a district court resolution of the facts relative to a minor role adjustment for clear error quiñones medina,at.given this deferential standard of review,battles over a defendant role in the offense will almost always be won or lost in the district court.united states graciani,cir.
in this instance,the sentencing court concluded that the appellant had not demonstrated by preponderant evidence that he was a minor participant in the venture.to support its conclusion,the court emphasized that the appellant had been present when the plot was hatched that he and delgado delivered the van in which the drugs were to be transported and that,after the van was loaded with what the appellant thought were drugs,he drove it away.the appellant does not dispute the accuracy of any of these facts.
the appellant labors nevertheless to portray himself as an expendable cog in the venture by labeling delgado as the decisionmaker.this sets up a false dichotomy a defendant need not be the key figure in a conspiracy in order to be denied a mitigating adjustment.see,united states garcía ortiz,cir united states mateo espejo,cir.what counts is that the appellant was present for the planning of the scheme and deeply involved in its execution.there is,therefore,no good reason to believe that he was less culpable than the of those who have committed similar crimes.indeed,we have routinely upheld the denial of a mitigating role adjustment in cases for defendants who have had even less involvement than the appellant.see,vargas,at affirming denial of adjustment where defendant sole involvement in conspiracy was driving delivery truck containing single shipment of cocaine united states ortiz santiago,cir affirming denial of adjustment where defendant performed only menial tasks such as unloading drugs and standing watch.
that ends this aspect of the matter.mindful of the deferential lens through which we must review determinations,we can not say that the sentencing court committed any error,clear or otherwise,in rejecting the appellant bid for such an adjustment 
this brings us to the appellant claim that the sentencing court erred in holding that it lacked discretion to grant an additional adjustment for acceptance of responsibility absent a government motion.the question presented is legal in nature and engenders de novo review.see quiñones medina,at.
we set the stage.the sentencing guidelines create a system for treating acceptance of responsibility.the first tier comprises a basic reduction in the offense level when the court determines that a defendant has accepted responsibility for the offense of conviction.see ussg a.if the defendant receives this adjustment and if his offense level,calculated without reference to the adjustment,is or more,the second tier comes into play.that tier makes available a further adjustment upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty,thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently.id.b.
here,the court awarded the discount provided in section a.the appellant,whose offense level calculated without reference to the section a reduction was,then sought the additional reduction under section b.when the government refused to move for this additional reduction,the appellant claimed that the government was improperly withholding the motion because it wanted to punish him for spurning a plea agreement.the district court did not resolve this claim,concluding instead that a government motion was a sine qua non to a section b reduction.
the present problem,of course,arises out of the language of section b,which is prefaced with the phrase upon motion of the government.at the time that the appellant was sentenced,the november edition of the guidelines pertained.the guideline commentary stated that b ecause the government is in the best position to determine whether the defendant has assisted a
