prenka ivezaj,nardino colotti,alex rudaj,angelo dipietro,nikola dedaj,and ljusa nuculovic collectively appellants or defendants appeal from judgments of conviction entered in the united states district court for the southern district of new york cote,on charges arising from their involvement in a racketeering enterprise.we affirm the convictions for the reasons stated in this opinion and in a companion summary order.
background 
the indictment charged,and the trial evidence,considered in the light most favorable to the government,established that the appellants were members of the rudaj organization the organization,a violent albanian racketeering organization based in new york city and westchester county.the government alleged that the organization sought to challenge,through violence and intimidation,the primacy of the new york city area traditional organized crime families.gambling was a particularly active area of competition.after operating illegal gambling businesses in the bronx and westchester county,the rudaj organization forcibly took over several illegal gambling clubs in astoria,queens and required other bars and restaurants to install and use its gambling machines.in addition to gambling,the organization engaged in a variety of other illegal conduct,including extortion,loansharking,and bank fraud.
these activities generated an indictment initially containing counts,fifteen of which were ultimately presented to the jury.we address here only those relevant to our opinion.count one charged all of the appellants with substantive racketeering,and count two charged them with racketeering conspiracy.see c,d.to establish the pattern of racketeering activity charged in count one,the government alleged that the defendants engaged in a series of predicate acts,many of which were also charged as separate counts.of these,racketeering acts four and five are at the center of our analysis.racketeering act four alleged that rudaj,dedaj,ivezaj,nuculovic,and dipietro attempted to extort,conspired to extort,and extorted control of an illegal gambling operation from fotios dimopoulos and antonios balampanis.racketeering act five charged rudaj,colotti,dedaj,ivezaj,nucolovic,and dipietro with extorting and conspiring to extort the owners of a gambling business,known as soccer fever,in violation of new york extortion laws.see penal law.all defendants were also charged in count thirteen with using and carrying firearms in aid of racketeering.see c a ii.
the government evidence included the testimony of investigating officers,various cooperating witnesses and victims,consensual tape recordings,recorded conversations from title iii interceptions,as well as physical evidence seized during various searches.at the conclusion of the trial,the district court dismissed several of the counts.the defendants were then convicted on all but one of the remaining counts but not all of the predicate racketeering acts and were sentenced to substantial prison terms.
the defendants appeal on various grounds.we decide here that control over illegal intangible a gambling property that can be delivered under new york extortion statute.we also conclude that balampanis was a proper victim of an inchoate extortion offense under new york law that count one qualified as a crime of violence under c and that the district court did not err in applying a role enhancement to ivezaj sentence.additionally,we decide that the admission of evidence seized from rudaj home,if error at all,was harmless.accordingly,we affirm the judgments.
discussion 
whether illegal intangible goods qualify as property under new york extortion law 
defendants challenge their convictions on racketeering acts four and five,which alleged violations of new york extortion laws their main contention is that the alleged acts are legally insufficient to sustain a conviction because control over illegal gambling does not constitute property under new york extortion law and,even if it did,no property was delivered as is required by the statute.we review de novo the grant or denial of a rule motion for judgment of acquittal.united states eppolito,cir united states florez,cir.
as proof of racketeering act four,the government established that the organization,through violence and intimidation,wrested control of certain illegal gambling operations in astoria from the lucchese crime family.in june of,members of the rudaj organization seriously assaulted antonios balampanis,a close companion of fotios dimopoulos,a lucchese family associate who supervised their astoria operations.dimopoulos later told balampanis that his beating had been intended as a message for dimopoulos,and dimopoulos never returned to gambling clubs in astoria following the assault.
racketeering act five related to the rudaj organization operation of barbut,a lucrative gambling activity in astoria.in early august,a gambino associate,tommy napoli,opened a gambling club known as soccer fever that directly competed with barbut and was operated by mikhail hirakis.on the club first night,soccer fever brought in approximately.the next night,approximately fifteen members of the organization,including the six defendants,stormed the club with guns on the instruction of rudaj and broke up the game.they intended to assault napoli,but when they were unable to locate him,they assaulted hirakis instead.rudaj intimidated the club patrons i do want to see nobody here.if i see you one more time,i swear to god i beat you one by one.i eat you up it closed.that was the end of soccer fever,and the organization subsequently extended its control of illegal gambling in astoria.
under new york law,a person obtains property by extortion when he compels or induces another person to deliver such property to himself or to a third person by means of instilling in him a fear that,if the property is not so delivered,the actor or another will c ause physical injury to some person in the future penal law e.property is defined as any personal property or any article,substance or thing of value which is provided for a charge or compensation.penal law.
the district court instructed the jury that t he term property includes not only money and other physical or tangible things,but also any valuable right considered as a source or element of wealth.moreover,t he pursuit of a business,including the solicitation of customers necessary to the conduct of the business,is considered property,as are the proceeds of a business.further,the court charged that i t does not matter if the victim initial acquisition or possession of tangible property was illegal,or if the business in which the victim is engaged is illegal.illegally obtained assets and businesses conducted in violation of the law can constitute property.
while acknowledging that an intangible good may constitute property under new york law,defendants challenge this instruction on the ground that control over illegal gambling does not constitute property because a legal right to the alleged property is required before it can qualify as property under new york law.they contend that because the luccheses and the various victims had no legal right to operate an illegal gambling business,racketeering acts four and five did not sufficiently allege extortion.
we agree with the district court that an illegal gambling business can constitute property under new york law.the statute broadly defines property as any personal property,real property substance or thing of value which is provided for a charge or compensation.penal law.illegal intangible property,such as that contemplated here,fits within this expansive definition control over illegal gambling is a thing of value which is provided for compensation.
this understanding is consistent with the new york courts recognition that intangible property as well as illegal tangible property are covered by the statute.for example,in people garland,the new york court of appeals held that intangible that case,a tenant right to occupy an constitute property,noting that an interest need not be transferable to constitute property under penal law.see also people spatarella,property includes intangible goods,because s urely the extortionist demand for the business itself,or a part of it,is,if anything,more egregious than the demand simply for money people dixson,misc d.under new york law,illegal tangible goods can also constitute property.see people hardwick,that it was unlawful for the victims to possess the narcotics is no defense to the defendant unlawful taking of them.people izzo,misc d,ownership is a broad concept.even a person who has himself stolen property has a right of possession superior to that of a third person who wrongfully takes it from him see generally people ex rel.short warden of city prison,p roperty is intended to embrace every species of valuable right and interest,and whatever tends in any degree,no matter how small,to deprive one of that right,or interest,deprives him of his property.given such an expansive definition of property,and the absence of any legality requirement in the statute,we see no indication that the new york legislature intended that illegal intangible assets could not be the subject of extortion.
our jurisprudence interpreting the hobbs act also supports our analysis here.the hobbs act was modeled on the new york extortion statute,and new york courts have often looked to hobbs act jurisprudence for guidance.see,people capparelli,misc d,citing cases for the proposition that new york appellate courts frequently refer to federal cases interpreting the hobbs act see also scheidler org.for women,d congress used two sources of law as models in formulating the hobbs act the penal code of new york and the field code,a model penal code.in united states gotti,cir,we reviewed our hobbs act precedents following the supreme court decision in scheidler,and we reaffirmed that intangible property rights can qualify as extortable property under the hobbs act at.moreover,we held that such rights can qualify as extortable property under the hobbs act regardless of whether its exercise,transfer,or sale would be legal.id.at.importantly,we did not see any basis for imposing a legality requirement on the extortion of both tangible and intangible property.id.at.
defendants argue that even if control over an illegal gambling business could be extorted under new york law,defendants did not obtain this property because it was never delivered to them.see penal law e.we find this interpretation imaginative but overly literal and,in any event,not supported by the law.under new york law,an intangible property by definition can not be delivered in the traditional be extorted.see garland,at,spatarella,at,property under the extortion statute includes intangible rights.for similar reasons,we reject defendants argument that they could not have transferred or delivered control over a criminal business in any sense that the law protects.again,it is established under new york law that illegal goods,such as drugs or drug proceeds,which are not capable of lawful transfer,fall under the extortion statute.see hardwick,at.
ii.whether balampanis is a victim of inchoate extortion offenses under new york law 
the defendants also argue that w hatever the reason for balampanis beating,he could not be the actual or intended victim of an inchoate extortion offense.new york law requires that the victim of a substantive extortion offense be an owner of the extorted property.defendants focus on the use of the word owner in the statute,which provides that w hen property is taken,obtained or withheld by one person from another person,an owner thereof means any person who has a right to possession thereof superior to that of the taker,obtainer or withholder.penal law.they contend that the government proof and the court charge were insufficient because the victim of extortionate conduct must own or control the property extorted,and balampanis did neither.
the district court rejected the defendants arguments.on this count,in response to a jury request on this issue the court instructed the jury as follows 
the court racketeering act four charges three crimes.to find that the crime of extortion was committed,you must find that at least foti dimopoulos was a victim of the extortion.
with respect to the crimes of attempted extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion,you must find that at least one of the two identified victims in racketeering act four,foti dimopoulos and tony balampanis,was an intended victim of those crimes.
you may also consider or lump together the evidence regarding both identified victims to decide whether the government has proven any one of these three charges extortion,attempted extortion or conspiracy to commit extortion.remember in this context that it is a crime to use force or violence against one person to obtain property from another with that second person consent by instilling fear in that second person,as i have explained in my charge.
given the tripartite nature of racketeering act alleged that several of the defendants engaged in extortion conspiracy,substantive extortion,and attempted extortion and that any one of which constitutes the commission of racketeering act four we find no error in the court instructions.the district judge properly charged that balampanis could be a victim for the attempt and conspiracy offenses.the fact that balampanis was not actually the owner does not matter for these offenses rather,the key inquiry for the jury in an attempted extortion charge is whether the defendants thought he was.see people davis,f actual impossibility will not provide a defense to a prosecution for attempted intentional acts people gardner,factual impossibility is no defense to attempt because attempt depends upon the mind and intent of the wrongdoer,not on the effect or result upon the person sought to be coerced penal law if the conduct in which a person engages otherwise constitutes an attempt to commit a crime,it is no defense that the crime charged to have been attempted was factually or legally impossible of commission.the same is true for conspiracy only the defendants state of mind is relevant.see people russell,impossibility is not a defense to conspiracy.
because there was ample evidence that the defendants believed balampanis,a close associate of dimopoulos,helped control illegal gambling in matter whether he did or conclude that the district court did not err in denying the defendants rule motion and charging the jury that balampanis could be a victim of the attempt and conspiracy charges.
iii.defendants c convictions 
next,defendants challenge their firearms convictions.under c a,any person who,during and in relation to any crime of violence for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the united states,uses or carries a firearm,or who,in furtherance of any such crime,possesses a firearm is guilty of a federal crime.count thirteen charged the defendants with violating this provision,specifically naming count one,the substantive racketeering charge,as the predicate crime of violence.
defendants raise two challenges to their c conviction.first,they challenge the district court ruling that count one qualifies as a crime of violence.the district court held that the convictions fell within c,because count one specifically charged violent predicate racketeering acts,even though a conviction under is not necessarily a conviction for a crime of violence.
a crime of violence is an offense that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another or by its nature,involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.c a,c b.when determining whether an offense is a crime of violence under the statute,we employ a categorical approach,in which we focus on the intrinsic nature of the offense rather than on the circumstances of a particular crime.united states acosta,cir.in acosta,we concluded that a conspiracy to injure,oppress,threaten,or intimidate any person in connection with exercising their constitutional rights under was a crime of violence.we reasoned that s ince applying physical force is perhaps the most obvious way to injure,threaten,or intimidate,a
