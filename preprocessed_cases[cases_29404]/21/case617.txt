factual background 
a.the arrest and search 
the facts essential to deciding this appeal are largely not in dispute.in late donald whitney met on several occasions with a drug purchaser to discuss the sale of ecstasy tablets.unbeknownst to whitney,the buyer was an undercover agent of the drug enforcement agency dea.in connection with each sale,agents saw whitney enter a at middle street in leominster,determined to be rheault then proceed to meet the undercover agent to consummate the sale.on one occasion,whitney mentioned that his supplier lived there.on another,agents saw rheault circling the location in his car where the drug deal was taking place inside.agents also observed rheault watching a sale from a distance.
dea agents arrested whitney on february.he quickly agreed to cooperate with them.following the agents instructions,whitney called rheault several times to arrange a purchase of ecstacy pills.here the versions of events diverge slightly.at his hearing,rheault denied that he agreed to this sale.the government claims to the contrary,and further states that rheault told whitney that he could not deliver the drugs until the following morning.regardless,the agents did not want to delay rheault arrest.accordingly,after procuring an arrest warrant they set off to apprehend him,forewarned by whitney that rheault carried a handgun with a laser sight.
upon their arrival at middle street,agents tried to lure rheault outside by having his car towed.that proved ineffective,so agents entered the building by a back stairway to rheault apartment.one of rheault two roommates,alex archambault,opened the apartment door and was greeted by agents with drawn weapons.after restraining archambault,determining that rheault was not in the apartment,and hearing sounds from above,the agents asked for and received archambault key to a door that led to a different stairway.agents went up to a landing,where they found rheault attempting to hide behind a bookcase and took him into custody.in a disabled washing machine about seven feet from rheault hiding spot,agents discovered a pistol with a laser sight,a bag containing ecstasy pills,ecstasy in powder form,cocaine and lsd.
b.the apartment 
because the layout of middle street is crucial to our inquiry,we recount the physical characteristics of the premises,based on testimony presented at the suppression hearing.
as previously noted,middle street was a building.there was one apartment on each floor,and rheault lived in the apartment.the front door of the was left to a landing that contained the mailboxes for the three apartments.from this landing,two doors were accessible.one door was to the apartment on the first floor the other led to an interior stairway shared by the second and third floor apartments the front stairway.this interior stairway door had a lock accessed from the outside by a skeleton key,and a deadbolt lock that could only be accessed from the inside,in other words,only by tenants or other people already within the apartments on the second or third floor.there was conflicting testimony as to whether this deadbolt was usually locked.the landlord testified that the deadbolt was not supposed to be locked,while rheault roommate,archambault,testified that it was almost always locked both rheault apprehension and the discovery of the gun and drugs in the washing machine took place on the third floor landing of the front stairway.
the more accessible stairway was in the rear of the building.it served all three apartments and was not locked from the street.while tenants were permitted to use both stairways,the testimony suggested that tenants on the second and third floor relied almost exclusively on the rear stairway,as did delivery persons and guests.the two stairways were not connected.thus,to get from the back stairway to the front stairway,it was necessary to go through the second or apartment,as the officers did when they sought to arrest rheault.
the landlord testified that he occasionally used the front stairway to allow,for example,cable television personnel access to the basement.he also testified that tenants were not permitted to use the front stairway and landings for storage,as such use would create a fire hazard instead,each apartment had its own storage area,which was large enough for a washing machine or bookshelf.on occasion,he had asked tenants to remove stored items from the front stairway landings.
the landlord testified that,although he had asked the tenants to remove the washing machine from the landing about a month prior to rheault arrest,they had not done so.moreover,additional items had been placed there,including tables,chairs,a damaged couch,an unhinged door and a desk.true to the maxim that one man trash is another treasure,archambault testified that he took the desk from the landing down to his own room in the second floor apartment.archambault also testified that he understood that the front stairway and landings were to be kept clear.the landing area,and the washing machine that was located in it,are the focus of our inquiry.
ii.legal discussion 
a.the motion to suppress 
rheault filed a motion to suppress the gun,and later amended the motion to include the drugs.the gist of the motion was that the arresting officers had no legitimate basis to search the area where they arrested rheault the government objection did not reach rheault substantive points,but instead argued that the evidentiary haul was lawful because rheault had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the contraband location in a lengthy oral ruling,the district court denied rheault motion.
we review the district court denial of a motion to suppress for clear error as to questions of fact we apply de novo review as to the application of law to those facts and to conclusions of law.united states boskic,cir,at.rheault has the burden of establishing that his own fourth amendment rights were violated by the challenged search or seizure.rakas at.united states mancini,cir.his threshold burden is to prove that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched or the thing seized.united states thornley,cir citing united states hershenow,cir.the supreme court has set out a test for analyzing the expectation question first,whether the movant has exhibited an actual,subjective,expectation of privacy and second,whether such subjective expectation is one that society is prepared to recognize as objectively reasonable.smith maryland,d.
the government argues that rheault satisfied neither part of the test.as to rheault subjective expectation of privacy,a matter on which the district court did not rule,we disagree with the government.the government premises its argument on the fact that rheault failed to testify that he had an actual expectation of privacy in the landing or washing machine.while this is an accurate accounting of rheault hearing testimony,we do not attach the same legal significance to the failure that the government does.the relevant question is whether rheault was seek ing to preserve as private the evidence at issue.katz united states,d.we have little doubt that rheault satisfies this criterion.indeed,we have held that a defendant meets the subjective expectation test where his purpose in placing a box of contraband documents in a particular location was to hide them and their incriminating contents after a grand jury subpoena issued.thornley,at see also
