peter gomes fontes fontes challenges his sentence for drug trafficking crimes on the ground that the district court finding that the government engaged in sentencing factor manipulation entitles him to a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum.specifically,fontes assails the district court ultimate conclusion that his predisposition to commit the crimes for which he was convicted prevented the government misconduct from being extreme and outrageous enough to warrant a sentence below the mandatory minimum.discerning no reason to disturb the district court considered resolution of this inquiry,we affirm fontes sentence.
on march,fontes pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute grams or more of crack cocaine in violation of,a,and b a,and one count of distribution and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine in violation of a and b a,based on his sale of grams of crack to a friend and drug informant on january.during his plea colloquy,fontes admitted that his offenses involved the quantity and type of cocaine alleged in the indictment at least grams,or approximately two ounces,of crack.nevertheless,relying on united states montoya,cir,fontes sought a downward departure from the applicable guidelines sentencing range a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum on the theory that government agents had engaged in sentencing factor manipulation by instructing the informant to purchase two ounces of crack cocaine,which carries a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of ten years,rather than the same quantity of powder cocaine,which carries no statutory mandatory minimum sentence and results in a lower guidelines sentencing range.see b a imposing statutory mandatory minimum sentence for violation involving grams or more of a mixture or substance which contains cocaine base,but no mandatory minimum sentence for a violation involving less than grams of cocaine powder drug quantity table.
after an evidentiary hearing on august and august,during which the informant and an fbi special agent testified,the district court found that the government had engaged in sentencing factor manipulation by ordering the informant to purchase crack cocaine with the intent of securing a higher sentence.however,the court concluded that,in light of fontes predisposition to sell crack,the government conduct was not extreme and outrageous,and the court therefore could not impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum.see montoya,at court may impose sentence below statutory mandatory minimum for sentencing manipulation amounting to extraordinary misconduct.the district court declined to consider whether the government misconduct nevertheless warranted a downward departure from the applicable guidelines sentencing range of months of imprisonment see id.at entertaining possibility that a district court may order a discretionary downward departure from the guideline range on something less than extraordinary misconduct.instead,predicting that the supreme court would soon declare the federal sentencing guidelines unconstitutional the court imposed a sentence of months of the statutory mandatory minimum of months but below the applicable guidelines sentencing it considered to be fair and just.the court also imposed a term of supervised release and a special assessment of.
fontes timely appealed,contesting the court ultimate conclusion that the government sentencing factor manipulation was not extreme and outrageous enough to justify a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum.see a defendant may appeal sentence on ground that it was imposed in violation of law 
we recount the facts as set forth in uncontested portions of the investigation report and the transcripts of the sentencing hearing.united states lagasse,cir.in august and september,the fbi debriefed a potential informant facing state drug charges who agreed to collect evidence against his drug associates,including fontes,whom the informant had known for more than five years.at the evidentiary hearing,the informant testified that he began selling drugs in or and that he told fbi agents during interviews that he and fontes sold each other powder cocaine on occasion.
on october,the government authorized the informant to make a controlled purchase of more than four ounces of powder cocaine from fontes for in government funds.due to technical and other unexpected difficulties,however,the fbi was unable to maintain surveillance of the informant or to record the transaction.according to the fbi agent,the government decided not to prosecute fontes for the offense because the informant account of the transaction constituted the only evidence of the circumstances of the sale 
fbi agents subsequently learned,by listening to recorded conversations between the informant and others,that some of fontes drug associates dealt cocaine in the form of crack.the informant testified that when the agents asked him to explain code words or slang used during these recorded conversations,he told them they were references to crack cocaine.in his testimony,the agent explained that the informant did tell us that any of the individuals had sold crack.it was something that we learned during the course of the investigation.the other defendants were talking about it.and,we knew those people to be associates of fontes.as the agent put it,it became clear to us that this group dealt in crack cocaine.
fbi agents then instructed the informant to make a second controlled purchase of drugs from fontes,this time in the form of crack,rather than powder cocaine.in the informant words,the agents told him,if he comes with the crack,buy it,if he does,do buy it.the agent testified that he directed the informant to purchase two ounces of crack,which the informant testified was a commonly sold quantity.at this point in the investigation,the agent testified,i had no specific information whether or not fontes would sell that product,meaning crack cocaine.i had no information whether he would or would not.the agent explained,i just simply thought he might be amenable to doing it since two of his associates were.
on december,fontes and the informant met at a pizza restaurant to negotiate a price for the second drug transaction.although the informant wore a wire to record the conversation,the tape did not clearly reveal whether the informant specified to fontes that he wished to purchase crack rather than powder cocaine.the informant testified,however,that he told the agents he had negotiated a deal with fontes to purchase two ounces of crack.the agent testified that the informant also reported that fontes had shown him a gun during their meeting.on january,the informant spoke to fontes in a recorded phone call to confirm the quantity of drugs and to make arrangements for the sale the next day.again,the recording revealed no specific reference to crack cocaine.
on january,the informant picked up fontes in a car rigged with hidden audio and video recording equipment.at the sentencing hearing,the government published excerpts from the informant recording and asked the informant to describe the events captured on the tape.the government later submitted a transcript of the audio recording to the district court at the court request.the transcript reveals that when fontes entered the car,he told the informant that he had just provided a of cocaine powder to someone else and that he had cooked the powder into crack for that person.during the evidentiary hearing,the informant explained that certain code words or slang,chef used during his conversation with fontes were references to crack or the act of cooking powder cocaine into crack.according to the informant,fontes then told him that they had to drive to another town to pick up the drugs the informant had ordered,since fontes had already distributed ounces of his supply.when fontes and the informant arrived at their destination outside an apartment building,a third person got in the car and handed fontes a bag while the informant drove around the block.after dropping off the third person at the apartment building,the informant paid fontes in government funds,and fontes gave him the bag.
the informant quickly realized that the bag contained powder,not crack,cocaine.according to the transcript of the taped conversation,he protested,i wanted it cooked,the customer wanted it cooked.fontes responded,you wanted it chef and asked the informant,you do know how to chef the informant replied,nah,i do have time,too.fontes then told the informant,hold up,i probably get a trade,and made a cell phone call.instead of a trade,fontes arranged to drop off the powder back at the apartment building,where someone would cook it into crack.
according to the transcript,fontes then said that if he had known at the outset that the informant wanted to purchase crack instead of powder cocaine,i would have had it chef.when the informant countered that he had told fontes his customer wanted crack,fontes replied,yo,but i figured you,you could chef it yourself finally,fontes lamented that he had had a of crack available when the informant picked him up i had a heezy a on me too,man,chef after dropping the powder cocaine off with the same third person at the apartment building,fontes and the informant drove around for about an hour before returning to the apartment building to pick up the cocaine,now cooked into crack,which weighed grams.
during the evidentiary hearing,the fbi agent explained that the agents instructed the informant to purchase two ounces of crack in part because the government lacked the funds to make a second controlled purchase of powder cocaine in a quantity large enough to dispel suspicion,given the informant purchasing history with fontes.by contrast,the agent explained,in my mind,the informant did deal in crack cocaine with fontes previously.there was no history of large quantities and so,this was something that was new to us in this investigation.the agent further elaborated 
at that point,we decided that it was cost effective to purchase crack.being aware of the sentencing guidelines,being aware of the fact that the previous deal was for an eighth kilo of cocaine,which cost a lot of money,and so,what we were trying to do was to make one transaction,one additional transaction,get good evidence that would stand to indict and convict fontes,and that what we did.
when the court asked the agent,what do you mean by being aware of the sentencing guidelines the agent replied 
i aware of the fact that there are guidelines that determine what a sentence is for a particular drug transaction,depending on what type of drug you are selling or purchasing,there are different sentences that are associated with the weights.so,in this case,there different guidelines for cocaine,as opposed to crack cocaine,powder versus crack.
the court then asked,so,you trying to get a higher sentence the agent replied,that a part of it.
after the witnesses concluded their testimony on august,the court heard oral argument.given the informant history of purchasing only powder cocaine from fontes and the agents lack of information about whether fontes actually distributed crack,fontes maintained that the government decision to instruct the informant to purchase crack instead of powder cocaine in order to procure a higher sentence amounted to sentencing factor manipulation,even if fontes later turned out to have some predisposition to sell crack.the government countered that the agents legitimately sought to test whether fontes,like his associates,would sell crack cocaine,even if they had no advance knowledge that fontes was predisposed to sell cocaine in that form.
after argument,the court concluded i do think given the fact of the predisposition of fontes to sell crack that i can say the government engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct.but i think it extremely troubling.i think it wrong and troubling for the government to try and quadruple the defendant sentence the court continued i do think that a legitimate law enforcement goal.and,i am taking it into account in where i going to sentence him.but i do think it extreme and outrageous because of the very strong evidence of predisposition to sell.that tape is devastating.nevertheless,the court found that the fbi agent basically admitted that they were trying to get a higher sentence.
the court then imposed a sentence of months of imprisonment,which it found to be fair and just.the court explained,t hat takes into account the mandatory minimum,which i do think i can go below because i do think it extreme and outrageous conduct.on the other hand,because i find it so troubling,i am not going up as high as requested by the government.addressing fontes directly,the court then gave its rationale for imposing a sentence six months higher than the statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment o ne of the reasons the fbi was so out to get you,if you will,is because you had a gun at the pizza restaurant where fontes and the informant met on december.you used guns.it was the first time,it was the second or third time that you used it i am worried that you are going to be a recidivist.
finally,the court noted that if the guidelines were upheld as constitutional,the applicable gsr would be based on a total offense level of and a criminal history category of v,resulting in a sentencing range of months of imprisonment.the court indicated that if the case were remanded for sentencing pursuant to the guidelines,it would consider a downward departure from that range based on the government misconduct,but in no event would it impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum because i ca say with that level of predisposition that it extreme and outrageous.the court nevertheless admonished i think when you quadruple someone sentence based on the situation where his track record with this particular informant was all powder and he thought it was powder,i think you are talking your best friend into selling crack,the whole thing is troubling.
in its statement of reasons issued on august,the court reiterated its factual findings and legal conclusions 
based on the fbi agent testimony,i find that the primary motivating factor for the decision by the fbi agent to order the informant to buy ounces of crack rather than powder,as in the earlier transaction of october,was to procure the highest possible penalty there was no investigative purpose to ordering crack,finding the source of the drugs or scope of the conspiracy 
on the other side of the ledger,as the videotaped conversation in the car demonstrated,the defendant had a predisposition to sell crack and had sold it before.however,the fbi did not know about any prior sales of crack by the defendant,or that the defendant had a reputation of selling crack.it only knew some of his friends sold crack 
on balance,i conclude that the defendant has not proven extreme and outrageous conduct,largely because of the defendant predisposition

sentencing factor manipulation takes place where government agents have improperly enlarged the scope or scale of a crime.montoya,at.such claims may arise where the government employs undercover agents in sting operations.united states barbour,cir.we have recognized the court power to impose a sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum as an equitable remedy for sentencing factor manipulation by the government.united states capelton,cir.because,however,b y definition,there is an element of manipulation in any sting operation,united states connell,cir,we have stressed that this form of relief for sentencing factor manipulation is reserved for only the extreme and unusual case,montoya,at.
the defendant bears the burden of establishing sentencing factor manipulation by a preponderance of the evidence.united states gibbens,cir.the district court found that burden met when it determined that the fbi agent basically admitted that the agents were trying to get a higher sentence,and that this purpose was not a legitimate law enforcement goal.
a determination as to whether improper manipulation exists is ordinarily a factbound determination subject to review.id.at.having withdrawn its appeal,the government does not challenge the court factual determination that the government harbored an improper motive of expos
