the adam walsh child protection and safety act of adam walsh act,tit.iii,stat,codified at,allows the federal government to seek civil commitment of sexually dangerous persons already in the custody of the bureau of prisons bop.once ordered so committed by a federal court,the person is confined to a treatment facility until its director or a court finds that the person is no longer sexually dangerous to others,or will not be dangerous if released under a prescribed treatment regimen.id.h,e.
joel wetmore,nearing the end of a federal criminal sentence,was the subject of such a civil commitment order and he now appeals.wetmore,years old,was born and raised in houlton,maine he graduated from high school there in and over the next years held a variety of jobs,mostly in maine but also including a stint in texas.he eventually settled in bangor,maine,where he resided until october.over the course of his life,wetmore has served several prison terms for crimes 
a first conviction in at age,under maine law,for unlawful sexual actions with a minor,specifically,fondling the genitals of a year old boy,resulting in a day suspended sentence and six months probation 
a second conviction in at age,under maine law,for gross sexual misconduct,specifically,for repeatedly molesting over a period an year old boy,resulting in an year sentence of which nine years were served,with an additional four years subsequently imposed after his probation was revoked because of the offense that led to his third conviction and 
a third conviction in at age,under federal law,for possessing over images of child pornography,leading to an month sentence.
wetmore had a bop projected release date from his federal sentence on november,but,on november,the federal government filed a notice commencing the effort to have him certified by a court as a sexually dangerous person and to commit him civilly under the adam walsh act.under the terms of the statute,the court may commit an individual who is in the custody of the bureau of prisons if the government can prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is a sexually dangerous person,u.a d,defined as someone 
who has engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation and who suffers from a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder as a result of which he would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released.
the district court held a bench trial beginning in late and ending in the court heard expert testimony from its appointed psychological examiner,robert prentky,as well as from the government retained expert psychologist,amy phenix.other witnesses included government officials,prison inmates,wetmore mother and brother,and wetmore himself.the testimony covered wetmore life history,including his sexual experiences and activities.the details are elaborated in the district court thorough,page decision.united states wetmore,d.
in the decision,the district court ruled that the government had met its burden of proof,determined that wetmore met the conditions for certification as a sexually dangerous person,and ordered him civilly committed.wetmore now seeks review in this court,first raising a threshold issue,whether he was legitimately in bop custody when the notice was filed he then argues that in any event the district court erred in finding that he suffered from the requisite mental disorder and that he satisfied the statutory dangerousness test.
the threshold issue presents a legal question.the adam walsh act permits the government to civilly commit sexually dangerous persons who are in the custody of the bureau of prisons.a.at the time the government began the civil commitment proceeding on november,wetmore was held in custody under the authority of bop based on his federal child pornography conviction with a projected release date of november.there is no indication that wetmore had earlier disputed the november date while in prison.
in,shortly before his commitment hearing,wetmore argued that the proceedings should be dismissed he claimed that on november,when the government initiated the commitment process,he had not been in the lawful custody of bop because his projected release date if now should have been earlier than november.expressing some doubt as to whether this mattered,the district court considered the premise and concluded that wetmore had been in the lawful custody of bop when the government sought his commitment.
the statute itself says nothing about lawful custody,but mere physical control could hardly suffice in all instances imagine that wetmore had been acquitted at trial of child pornography charges but mistakenly listed as convicted,held in prison by bop based on this mistake and then sought to be certified during this period.so,at the very least,some colorable legal authority must exist for the detention and the courts normally so assume,united states joshua,cir fact of bop physical custody alone not sufficient united states hernandez arenado,cir same.
but it is a different question how far wetmore can belatedly challenge alleged sentencing or computational errors at the commitment stage and which errors might matter.the answer is not supplied merely by the word custody a chameleon term,ramsey brennan,cir as applied to a variety of situations likely never considered by congress.we already have held that,in an adam walsh proceeding,to mandate release of a potentially dangerous individual due to a de minimis mistake in the timing of initiating the commitment process would be manifestly inconsistent with the overall structure of the act.united states shields,cir,cert.denied,d.
de minimis mistakes merely illustrate a larger tension.the mechanics of determining a release date are more complicated than might be supposed.the federal judge ordinarily imposes a term of months,months and,if another sentence is already being served by the defendant,chooses whether and to what extent the new federal sentence will run concurrently or consecutively to the existing sentence.supp.iv.the defendant may then seek direct appellate review of this sentence.id.see also gall united states,d.but often there remain,as here,complicated adjustments that determine the prisoner precise release date,depending on events that already occurred,time spent in custody awaiting trial or will occur later,good conduct time 
these calculations are ordinarily made administratively by the attorney general through the bureau of prisons,kayfez gasele,cir,resulting in a posted projected release date,sometimes falling much earlier than the stated sentence of months might suggest.but these sometimes abstruse calculations,illustrated by wetmore own case,may involve debatable legal and factual issues.the convicted defendant can contest the projected date through an administrative proceeding,and,if dissatisfied,can ultimately obtain judicial review,see also reno koray,d romandine united states,cir.
given the adam walsh act incontestible aim to detain individuals still sexually dangerous upon release,comstock.at,the government argues that computational attacks on the lawfulness of his detention should be limited to habeas proceedings or tempered by other exhaustion requirements.accommodation of new statutes to existing administrative schemes is the ordinary work of courts where not squarely addressed by congress,but this is the wrong case for broad rules.as the district court ruled,wetmore was still serving his proper federal sentence when the commitment proceeding began.
wetmore contrary arguments stem from a complicated chronology 
on october,he was arrested by hampden,maine,police after a year old male reported that wetmore had performed a sexual act on him a second juvenile male reported that wetmore had child pornography on his computer.
on february,his state court parole was revoked and the court imposed the additional four year state sentence already mentioned.
on april,he was indicted on the federal child pornography charges,and entered his guilty plea on july.
on october,he received his month federal sentence,to be served concurrently with the state sentence he was then serving.
wetmore projected release date on his federal sentence was november.on november,the government filed its certification request.
wetmore first attempt to show unlawful detention is easily rebuffed.under federal law,a defendant may receive credit against his federal sentence for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences.the provision,b,reads 
a defendant shall be given credit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any time he has spent in official detention prior to the date the sentence commences 
as a result of the offense for which the sentence was imposed or 
as a result of any other charge for which the defendant was arrested after the commission of the offense for which the sentence was imposed 
that has not been credited against another sentence.
the bureau of prisons gave wetmore days of credit toward his federal sentence for his time in custody between his state arrest and the revocation of his state probation this credit,wetmore says,was calculated as though his state probation was revoked on february,when in reality it was revoked on february.there is some support for this claim and,on this premise,wetmore was owed days credit,making his proper release date one day earlier namely,on november,the day the federal certification was filed sometime late in the afternoon.
wetmore did not raise this argument in the district court,so it is reviewable only for plain error,smith kmart,cir,and a error would work no miscarriage of justice,united states olano,d.moreover,a preserved error would have shown at most the discrepancy of a day or less an interval even shorter than the one we found in shields to be no cognizable infringement of the statute custody requirement.at.
anyway,even accepting wetmore premise that he was due for release on november,the last day of a sentence is part of that sentence,a wetmore was still serving his sentence in bop custody on november when the government filed its request and so the request was timely on its face and wetmore claim appears to fail without any help from shields or the limits imposed by the plain error doctrine.if it was unlawful for bop to detain wetmore until pm on november,wetmore has yet to explain why.
wetmore second theory of why his custody as of november,was unlawful is more complicated and involves a substantially longer period one reason why initiating commitment proceedings a few days earlier or the shields rule itself might not always solve the problem of belated attacks on a sentence calculation.wetmore says that he was owed credit on his federal sentence for all or part of the time he spent in custody between february,when his state probation was revoked and he began serving his new state sentence and october,when his federal sentence was imposed.
the district judge who sentenced wetmore for his offense said that the federal sentence was to run concurrently with his state sentence so,wetmore says,his federal sentence should therefore run from the earlier date that his state sentence began.but concurrency,in this context,typically means that the federal sentence runs alongside the state sentence from the date that the federal sentence commences.see cmt.nn,using the manual employed in wetmore sentencing.accordingly,the bop treated wetmore federal sentence as commencing on the date it was imposed,october.thereafter,wetmore federal sentence ran simultaneously with his state sentence,and there is no evidence of any intent on the part of the sentencing judge to the start of wetmore federal sentence in such a way that he would also receive credit for the time he had already served on his state sentence.united states labeille soto,cir asserting that sentencing judges lack authority to the start of the sentences they impose.
under subsection b quoted above,credit against wetmore federal sentence could be given for his time in detention prior to the commencement of the sentence as a result of any other charge for which he was arrested after the commission of the offense for which the federal sentence was imposed,the sentence falling into this category.but that credit is only available if the detention time has not been credited against another sentence.here,wetmore time in detention between the beginning of his state sentence and the start of his federal sentence was credited against his state sentence.as explained earlier,wetmore also received credit against his federal sentence for the time he spent in detention between his arrest and the imposition of his state sentence.
the principle against giving double credit also disposes of wetmore separate claim that he should have been given credit against his federal sentence for the time he spent in the custody of marshals between february,and october,to attend federal court proceedings while serving his state sentence.during these periods,wetmore was on loan by the state but still serving his state sentence and this time was credited to his state sentence and can not also be used to reduce further his federal sentence.
finally,wetmore invokes an application note in the sentencing guidelines which does contrary to usual concurrency practice allow the district judge to give a defendant the functional equivalent of credit for a separate state sentence already served before a federal sentence begins.the note,cmt,so allows in cases where the conduct underlying the state sentence is the same as that for which the federal sentence is imposed,or if the underlying conduct has been used to adjust upward the federal sentence for example,under the relevant conduct guideline.lopez terrell,cir,cert.denied,d.
while section b primarily deals with establishing concurrent sentences which is what wetmore received,the application note in question also provides that when a judge imposes a sentence pursuant to b,she should adjust the sentence for any period of imprisonment already served as a result of the conduct taken into account in determining the guideline range for the instant offense if the court determines that period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the bureau of prisons.cmt.emphasis added.
wetmore is not entitled to a at this stage but anyway the district court that sentenced him made no mistake.wetmore state sentence stemmed from a state probation violation,and in such cases the defendant does not receive any adjustment to his federal sentence,see id.b cmt.moreover,the revocation of wetmore state probation was apparently due to his prohibited contact with a minor,not because of his possession of child pornography and there is no indication that the prohibited contact played any role in wetmore federal sentence.
this brings us to the merits which are far more straightforward,raising primarily factual issues,apart from one issue already disposed of in united states carta,cir.the adam walsh act,as already noted,requires findings that wetmore previously engaged or attempted to engage in sexually violent conduct or child molestation currently suffers from a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder and,finally,that as a result of his current mental condition he would have serious difficulty in refraining from sexually violent conduct or child molestation if released.a.
the first requirement here,prior child molestation was established by certified court records admitted by stipulation.wetmore concedes this and instead argues that the other two elements mental state and dangerousness were not established.these must be found by clear and convincing evidence,d but the district court factual evaluation can be overturned only for clear error,carta,at.
we start with the determination,on which both experts agreed,that wetmore does suffer from a serious mental illness,abnormality,or disorder.a.they based their evaluations not merely on prior convictions but on an evaluation as well of wetmore admitted sexual conduct and attitudes,including many other instances of child molestation,over a long period and a degree of sexual preoccupation and activity borne out by the record and by wetmore own admissions.
