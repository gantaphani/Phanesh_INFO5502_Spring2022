bruce daye appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of vermont murtha,sentencing him to months imprisonment upon his guilty plea to one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g.on appeal,daye does not challenge his conviction.rather,he asserts that the district court incorrectly determined that he was subject to the mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment imposed on armed career criminals by e and to the related offense level enhancement set forth in.more specifically,he contends that the district court erred in concluding that his prior convictions for sexually assaulting children in violation of.stat.ann.tit,since amended and for escape were convictions for violent felon ies as defined in e b.for the reasons that follow,we remand to the district court for consideration of whether,following the supreme court decision in chambers united states,d,daye conviction for escape is a conviction for a violent felony and,if necessary,whether the crimes underlying two of daye three sexual assault convictions were committed on occasions different from one another,e.
background 
on march,daye was stopped for speeding in montpelier,vermont by deputy sheriff jeffrey severidt of the washington county sheriff department.severidt called in daye identifying information,learned that daye was subject to an outstanding warrant,and placed him under arrest.he then proceeded to search daye vehicle,recovering a loaded handgun.daye subsequently confessed that he had intended to kill his and then commit suicide,noting that he had been speeding in order to catch her as she went to work.
a federal grand jury indicted daye in january on two counts one each for the handgun and the associated ammunition of possessing a firearm or ammunition after having been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year of imprisonment in violation of g.he eventually pled guilty to one of these counts.
following daye guilty plea,the district court held a sentencing hearing.the presentence report psr described daye extensive criminal history.prior to the current incident,daye had been convicted of at least sixteen felonies and fourteen misdemeanors.among the felonies were two convictions for the sexual assault of a child in violation of.stat.ann.tit,since amended in lamoille county,vermont,one conviction for violation of the same statute in chittenden county,vermont,and one conviction for escape,likely in violation of.stat.ann.tit,the lamoille county convictions arose from an incident in which daye took four boys blackberry picking.as described in the psr as well as charging documents associated with these crimes,daye,while on this trip,molested each of the four boys and compelled two of them,one at most nine years old and the other twelve,to participate in anal sex with him.a police affidavit relating to the chittenden county conviction states that daye had engaged in oral sex with and digital penetration of the anus of a boy 
at the sentencing hearing,the district court determined that daye convictions for the sexual assault of a child and escape qualified as convictions for violent felonies as defined in e b.with regard to the sexual assault convictions,the district court concluded that,pursuant to the supreme court decision in shepard united states,d,it could consider the details of daye particular crimes as described in certain judicial documents and that,regardless of whether a generic conviction pursuant to.stat.ann.tit,since amended would qualify as a conviction for a violent felony,the actual crimes committed by daye did so qualify in light of the youth of his victims.it then found that daye had been convicted of at least three previous violent felonies committed on occasions different from one another.e.in so doing,it appeared to rely,as recommended by the psr,upon the escape conviction,the chittenden county conviction,and either of the two lamoille county convictions drawing upon this finding,it also determined that daye was subject to both the offense level enhancement for armed career criminals pursuant to,which increased the preliminary guidelines sentencing recommendation to a range of to months imprisonment,and a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of months imprisonment pursuant to e,thereby creating an effective guidelines range of to months imprisonment,see c.the district court then sentenced him principally to imprisonment for months.
discussion 
the issues advanced on appeal by daye are whether the district court correctly determined that daye prior convictions for sexually assaulting children and for escape were convictions for violent felon ies,as defined in e b.we review de novo the district court conclusion that a prior offense is a violent felony.see united states lynch,cir.
the armed career criminal act acca establishes a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years imprisonment for a defendant who is convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of g while having three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,or both,committed on occasions different from one another.e.in addition,the guidelines impose a substantial offense level enhancement upon any defendant who qualifies for a mandatory minimum sentence under e.see.for purposes of the acca,a violent felony is 
any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,or any act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or carrying of a firearm,knife,or destructive device that would be punishable by imprisonment for such term if committed by an adult,that 
i has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or 
ii is burglary,arson,or extortion,involves use of explosives,or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
e b.to determine whether a prior offense is a violent felony,we use a categorical approach,in which we look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.taylor united states,d accord lynch,at.w e consider whether the elements of the offense are of the type that would justify its treatment as a violent felony,without inquiring into the specific conduct of this particular offender.james united states,d see also nijhawan holder,d in taylor and james we held that acca language read naturally uses the word felony to refer to a generic crime as generally committed.
sexual assaults 
at the time of his sentencing,daye had three prior convictions for sexual assault of a child in violation of vermont law.the statute under which he was convicted,captioned sexual assault,provided,in pertinent part,that 
a person who engages in a sexual act with another person and 
the other person is under the age of,except where the persons are married to each other and the sexual act is consensual 
shall be imprisoned for not more than years,or fined not more than,or both.
stat.ann.tit,since amended the term sexual act was further defined to mean conduct consisting of contact between the penis and the vulva,the penis and the anus,the mouth and the penis,the mouth and the vulva,or any intrusion,however slight,by any part of a person body or any object into the genital or anal opening of another.stat.ann.tit,
engaging in a sexual act with a child under sixteen does not constitute burglary,arson,extortion,or a crime involv ing use of explosives,e b ii,and the government does not argue that vermont statute has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,id.e b i.rather,the government contends that engaging in a sexual act with a child in violation of former involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another pursuant to e b ii,commonly described as the acca residual clause,see,chambers.at.
prior to the supreme court decision in begay united states,d,our inquiry into whether a proposed predicate conviction fell within the residual clause turned solely on whether the potential risk of physical injury posed by the crime at issue was comparable to that posed by the residual clause exemplar crimes such as burglary,arson,and extortion.james,at.this inquiry did not require that every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury.id.at.instead,the relevant consideration was whether the offense is of a type that,by its nature,presents such a,stated somewhat differently,whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense,in the ordinary case,presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.id.emphasis added.the infliction of a sexual act upon a child by an adult clearly qualifies c rimes involving indecent sexual contact with a child typically occur in close quarters,and are generally perpetrated by an adult upon a victim who is not only smaller,weaker,and less experienced,but is also generally susceptible to acceding to the coercive power of adult authority figures.united states cadieux,cir quoting united states sherwood,cir see also united states mincks,cir whether physical injury is intended when an adult engages in sexual intercourse or sodomy with a minor,physical injury is a serious potential risk arising from either of the assaults,and is logically foreseeable.physical injury is both a serious and foreseeable risk in the ordinary course of such encounters.
we recognize that some of our sister circuits have suggested that where,as here,a statute encompasses not only forcible assault but also sexual contact to which a child professes to consent,even if not legally able to do so,the crime thereby defined creates a serious risk of physical injury only when the victim is particularly young.see,united states sawyers,cir holding that violations of statutory rape statutes that include more mature victims and do not contain aggravating factors do not qualify as violent felonies,absent more specific information as to the age of the victim united states thomas,cir concluding that the government had neglected to present evidence to establish a serious risk of injury to a child of sixteen,but noting that sexual contact does present such a risk to a child of thirteen.vermont statute,however,applies only to children and young the version applicable here,to those fifteen years old and younger.see.stat.ann.tit,since amended.even assuming,as these cases implicitly do,that only injury arising from the sexual act itself may be considered when determining whether the commission of the crime will typically involve a serious risk of physical injury,young teens such as those within the compass of vermont statute not infrequently face such risk from even purportedly consensual contact.see united states sacko,cir summarizing evidence indicating that twelve to percent of girls are not yet fully developed,and therefore face risk of physical injury from intercourse,as well as increased risk of contracting various diseases see also united states shannon,cir en banc noting risks of injury to girls from intercourse.
more importantly,the potential risks of serious physical injury flowing from violation of vermont sexual assault statute are not limited to the direct physical consequences of sexual contact.we must also consider the risk of injury traceable to the fact that the violation of statutes criminalizing sexual contact with victims who,for reasons of physical or emotional immaturity,are deemed legally unable to consent inherently involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used in the course of committing the offense.chery ashcroft,cir see also james,at.classifying attempted burglary as a violent felony primarily because of the risk of injury arising from the possibility of a confrontation between the burglar and a third party.when an adult inflicts a sexual act upon a child,the nature of the conduct and the child relative physical weakness give rise to a substantial likelihood that the adult may employ force to coerce the child accession,thereby creating a serious risk that physical injury will result.see dos santos gonzales,cir b ecause a child has very few,if any,resources to deter the use of physical force by an adult intent on touching the child,there is a significant likelihood that physical force may be used to perpetrate the crime.second alteration in original quoting chery,at see also united states eastin,cir even if the sexual act with a child were consensual,such conduct between individuals of differing physical and emotional maturity carries a substantial risk that physical force may be used,causing injury to the child.we therefore have no difficulty in concluding that a sexual act inflicted upon a child by an adult ordinarily creates a serious potential risk of physical harm to the child.
but this does not end the matter.the supreme court decision in begay refined the analytical framework employed to determine whether a prior conviction constitutes an acca predicate,indicating that a particular crime does not necessarily constitute a violent felony simply because it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another comparable to that posed by the exemplar crimes in e b ii.see begay.at.rather,the crime must also be roughly similar,in kind as well as in degree of risk posed,to the listed crimes,specifically burglary,arson,extortion,and crimes involving the use of explosives.id.at.applying this standard,the supreme court concluded that driving under the influence of alcohol is not a violent felony because it differs from the listed crimes in that it does not typically involve purposeful,violent,and aggressive conduct that makes more likely that an offender,later possessing a gun,will use that gun deliberately to harm a victim.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.the court noted that statutes that prohibit drunk driving,like crimes that impose strict liability,allow conviction for conduct that need not be purposeful or deliberate.id.at see also chambers.at holding that failure to report for incarceration does not constitute a violent felony because the crime amounts to a form of inaction,a far cry from the purposeful,violent,and aggressive conduct potentially at issue when an offender commits one of the expressly listed crimes internal quotation marks omitted.
this court has not previously considered whether a conviction for violating any of the various state laws prohibiting sexual assault on a child constitutes a violent felony for the purpose of e b ii.we have repeatedly addressed the question,however,whether engaging in sexual contact with a minor qualifies as a crime of violence pursuant to b,which in relevant part defines the phrase to include felonies that,by their nature,involve a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.in chery ashcroft,this court concluded that a conviction for engaging in sexual intercourse with a child who is at least thirteen but under the age of sixteen while being at least two years older than the child is a conviction for a crime of violence.see at.in so doing,it distinguished jobson ashcroft,cir,and dalton ashcroft,cir,in which this court determined,respectively,that reckless manslaughter and driving while intoxicated are not crimes of violence because they do not involve intentional and affirmative conduct,substantially decreasing the risk that force would be applied intentionally when committing those crimes.the chery court indicated that,in contrast,sexual intercourse with a minor requires affirmative conduct by the defendant namely,sexual intercourse with a protected individual that uniformly occurs in circumstances presenting the risk that force will intentionally be applied.at.subsequently,in leocal ashcroft,the supreme court in effect adopted the reasoning of dalton as to driving under the influence of alcohol,concluding that driving while intoxicated does not qualify as a crime of violence pursuant to b as that crime involves merely accidental or negligent conduct,while the language of b suggests that it encompasses a category of violent,active crimes requiring a higher mens rea than mere negligence.see,d.thereafter,this court reaffirmed its reasoning in chery,concluding that,like engaging in sexual intercourse with a minor,having contact with the intimate parts of a child under the age of sixteen is a crime of violence as it involves affirmative conduct in the form of the deliberate touching of the child intimate parts.dos santos,at.this type of conduct creates a risk,not generally present during the commission of a drunk driving offense,that the perpetrator will intentionally use force.see id.
we find this analysis quite persuasive and applicable by analogy to the case at bar the statute under which daye was convicted.stat.ann.tit,since amended,admittedly imposed strict liability with regard to the age of the victim.see state searles,noting that statutory rape has traditionally been considered a strict liability offense and concluding that knowledge of the age of the victim was not an element of the statutory offense.by its terms,however,involves deliberate and affirmative,an intentional sexual act with a person who is,in fact,under the age of to satisfy begay observation that violent felonies for purposes of e b ii residual clause typically involve purposeful conduct.moreover,as discussed above and in chery and dos santos,crimes involving sexual contact between adults and children create a substantial likelihood of forceful,violent,and aggressive behavior on the part of the perpetrator because a child has essentially no ability to deter an adult from using such force to coerce the child into a sexual act.see dos santos,at see also cadieux,at eastin,at.such likely use of force not only creates a risk of injury to the victim,but also establishes that the perpetrator will commonly act in a purposeful,violent,and aggressive manner.at a minimum,we have no doubt that a typical instance of this crime will involve conduct that is at least as intentionally aggressive and violent as a typical instance of burglary.see united states almenas,cir.both crimes may often involve,but do not necessarily require,the intentional use of force.indeed,given the peculiar susceptibility of minors to coercion by adults into sexual acts,we think it more likely that violent and aggressive force will actually be employed in the course of committing the crime at issue here than in the course of committing an ordinary burglary.see tennessee garner,d citing statistical evidence to the effect that burglaries only rarely involve physical violence.
these conclusions are sufficient to establish that the crime at issue is a violent felony.begay does not require that every instance of a particular crime involve purposeful,violent,and aggressive conduct.instead,all that is required is that a crime,in a fashion similar to burglary,arson,extortion,or crimes involving the use of explosives,typically involve s purposeful,violent,and aggressive conduct.begay.at emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted chambers.at noting that the conduct at issue with regard to a conviction for failure to report for incarceration is a far cry from the purposeful,violent,and aggressive conduct potentially at issue when an offender commits the expressly listed crimes emphasis added internal quotation marks omitted.indeed,the very crimes expressly named in e b ii are not always purposeful,violent,and aggressive.see begay.at scalia,concurring noting that crimes involving the use of explosives may be committed recklessly or even negligently united states williams,cir burglary,for instance,can be described as purposeful but not,at least in most instances,as purposefully violent or necessarily aggressive.wayne lafave,substantive criminal law ed indicating that arson traditionally could be committed not only purposefully,but also wantonly by,for example,starting a fire where the act create s a very high risk of burning the dwelling house of another and the actor knew of that risk but nonetheless engaged in the act.but see begay.at noting that the word use most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct as support for the proposition that the exemplar crimes involving the use of involve purposeful conduct alteration in original internal quotation marks omitted.as a result,we conclude that engaging in a sexual act with a minor in violation of.stat.ann.tit,since amended satisfies the standard articulated in begay and is therefore a violent felony under the residual clause of e b.
neither the fourth circuit decision in united states thornton,cir,nor the tenth circuit decision in united states dennis,cir,both decided,are contrary to the result reached here.in thornton,the fourth circuit determined that the virginia crime of carnal knowledge of a minor,which prohibits carnally know ing,without the use of force,a child of thirteen or fourteen years of age,was not a violent felony for purposes of e b ii.see at see also ann.but as that court noted,the virginia statute at issue has as an element the lack of the use of force,eliminating the possibility that the typical instance of the crime would be violent or aggressive,even though deliberate.see thornton,at.similarly,in dennis,the wyoming indecent liberties statute criminalized conduct involving substantially older victims and included conduct,such as the provision of pornography to a minor,that is less likely to present a serious risk of physical harm than is actually engaging in sexual contact.see at holding that a conviction for knowingly taking immodest,immoral,or indecent liberties with a person under the age of eighteen,who may legally consent to sexual activity,as opposed to a more serious conviction for sexual intercourse with a person under the age of sixteen,who may not legally consent to sexual activity,does not involve a serious potential risk of physical injury to the minor.the present case is more akin to williams,another case,in which the first circuit concluded that a conviction pursuant to a for knowingly transporting a minor with intent that the minor engage in prostitution constitutes a violent felony,both because illicit sexual activity between an adult and a minor at least a minor below a certain age poses a significant risk that force will be used in the consummation of the crime and because an offender behavior in exposing children to such encounters,even if not itself directly violent,is nevertheless purposeful,violent,and aggressive under the reasoning of begay.see at,
as a final matter,daye contends that the acca residual clause applies only to property crimes,not to crimes against the person such as sexual assault.in support of this argument,he notes the supreme court statement in begay that,in enacting the most recent version of e b,congress sought to expand th e definition of the term violent felony to include both crimes against the person clause i and certain physically risky crimes against property clause ii.at see also id.noting that the applicable house report described clause ii as including state and federal felonies against property such as burglary,arson,extortion,use of explosives and similar crimes as predicate offenses emphasis omitted quoting,at.
we find this argument unpersuasive.despite the language cited by daye,the supreme court did not rely in begay on the distinction between property crimes and crimes against the person.instead,as noted above,the court focused upon whether the crime at issue typically involves purposeful,aggressive,and violent conduct.see id.at.the distinction proposed by daye also is not mandated by the language of e b,which makes no mention of it.although clause i of e b requires a crime to ha ve as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,it encompasses not only pure crimes against the person,but also offenses such as robbery that,while typically considered to be property crimes,require at least the threatened use of force against another.see lafave,supra,robbery requires that the taking be done by means of violence or intimidation.at the same time,the exemplar crimes listed in clause ii are not necessarily limited to property crimes.crimes involving the use of explosives,for example,do not necessarily require use against property rather than use a
