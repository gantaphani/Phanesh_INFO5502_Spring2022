this appeal arises from a sentence imposed by the united states district court for the southern district of new york colleen mcmahon,judge after the supreme court june,decision in blakely washington,d,which raised doubt as to the constitutionality of the sentencing guidelines,but prior to our august,decision in united states mincey,cir,vacated sub nom.ferrell united states,d,which directed district courts within the circuit to continue applying the sentencing guidelines in a mandatory fashion pending the supreme court resolution of united states booker,d.we consider here whether the district court practice of sentencing defendant john fuller in the alternative that is,stating that the district court would impose the same sentence regardless of whether the sentencing guidelines were binding or the period after blakely but before booker was error in light of the subsequent teachings of the supreme court and our related jurisprudence,and if so,whether such error is harmless.
with the benefit of hindsight,we hold that the district court erred when sentencing fuller fuller preserved the error by raising a sixth amendment objection prior to his sentencing and the district court error was not harmless.accordingly,we remand the cause to the district court with instructions to vacate fuller sentence and resentence him in conformity with our opinion in united states fagans,cir.
furthermore,inasmuch as the district court upward departure calculation was based upon the court analogy between defendant bartering of drugs in exchange for firearms and the sentencing enhancement prescribed by section b of the sentencing guidelines,we conclude that the extent of the district court departure was not an abuse of discretion.we also hold that the district court provided an adequate,statement explaining its upward departure,as required by c.finally,we hold that,in light of f and f,the district court failure to explain the basis for its departure in the written judgment does not provide a separate basis for remand in the circumstances presented.
background 
john fuller pleaded guilty on may,to bail jumping,in violation of a on may,following a jury trial,fuller was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm,in violation of g on december,in satisfaction of both convictions,the district court sentenced fuller principally to months imprisonment in part based on multiple upward departures pursuant to the sentencing guidelines sentencing guidelines or guidelines,which the district court then reasonably understood to be binding.
fuller appealed his judgment of conviction,arguing,inter alia,that the district court erred in its application of the sentencing guidelines.after affirming fuller conviction,we vacated his sentence on grounds not pertinent to the instant appeal and remanded the cause to the district court for resentencing.united states fuller,cir.
on july,in the immediate aftermath of the supreme court decision in blakely washington,d which held unconstitutional the state of washington sentencing before the supreme court decision in united states booker,d,judge mcmahon filed an opinion in united states einstman,d,in which she concluded that the sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional and that judges must return to indeterminate sentencing,in which they consider all relevant factors and sentence the defendant anywhere between the statutory minimum if there be one and the statutory maximum id.at.accordingly,at fuller resentencing hearing on august,the district court announced two sentences in the alternative the first sentence assumed that the sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional and therefore,and the second sentence adhered to the sentencing guidelines as if they were constitutional and,hence,binding.judge mcmahon stated on the record i am going to violate my usual rule and i am going to impose both types of sentences.so that the circuit is aware,that is what i decided to do.tr.of sentencing hr g,at.
assuming first that the sentencing guidelines were,the district court sentenced fuller principally to months imprisonment,which consisted of a term for the firearm offense and a term for the offense assuming alternatively that the guidelines were mandatory,the district court imposed an identical sentence,arriving at months of imprisonment after applying several enhancements and upward departures,including a upward departure pursuant to on the ground that fuller had bartered drugs in exchange for firearms.id.at.
at his sentencing hearing,fuller counsel raised an objection pursuant to apprendi new jersey,d,referring to the supreme court statement that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.id.at.fuller counsel also objected on the ground that sentencing in the alternative is illegal in and of itself.tr.of sentencing hr g,at.
discussion 
fuller raises three interrelated claims on appeal.first,he asserts that notwithstanding the district court issuance of an alternative sentence,the district court sentence did not conform to the requirements of united states booker,d.supplemental letter br.of may,at.fuller further argues that because he properly preserved an objection to this error and because this error was not harmless,we should vacate the district court sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with our opinion in united states fagans,cir.see supplemental letter br.of may,at.
second,fuller requests,for the purpose of guiding such a remand,that we reject as unreasonable the upward departure that the district court applied on the basis of what it found to be clear and convincing evidence that fuller had bartered drugs in exchange for firearms.id.at.
third and finally,fuller asserts that the district court erred in failing to provide an adequate on the record at sentencing and in its written order of the upward departures that it applied in arriving at fuller sentence.see appellant br.at.
booker error 
in united states booker,d,the supreme court held that the mandatory nature of the sentencing guidelines violated the sixth amendment.id.at.in its remedy opinion in booker,the court concluded that the guidelines are now advisory,id.at,and that the proper standard of review for sentences is reasonableness,see id.at.in united states crosby,cir,we explained that sentences,regardless of their length,would not be found reasonable if a sentencing judge committed a procedural error by selecting a sentence in violation of applicable law and that error is not harmless and is properly preserved.id.at.regarding the first prong of our a district court committed procedural held that a sentencing judge would commit a statutory error in violation of section a if the judge failed to consider the applicable guidelines range as well as other factors listed in section a,and instead simply selected what the judge deemed an appropriate sentence without such required consideration.crosby,at emphasis added.
the government asserts that because the district court correctly anticipated booker holding that the guidelines were advisory,and imposed a discretionary,sentence,the district court committed no error at sentencing.appellee supplemental letter br.of may,at.we disagree.when considering the possibility of guidelines,the district court stated 
m y position on the guidelines is that either they exist in their entirety or they do exist at all in which case,we revert to a sentencing scheme under which a judge,in her discretion,can sentence the defendant anywhere between the statutory minimum,if there be one,for the crime and the statutory maximum defined in the traditional way.
tr.of sentencing hr g,at.this prediction of the sentencing landscape turned out to be incorrect and inconsistent with our later conclusion in crosby that it would be a mistake to think that,after,district judges may return to the sentencing regime that existed before and exercise unfettered discretion to select any sentence within the applicable statutory maximum and minimum.crosby,at.because the district court imposed its alternative sentence on the assumption that the guidelines do exist at all and thereby acted on a proverbial blank slate without explicitly considering all the factors listed in a,including the guidelines,see a a,as required by crosby,see at hold,once again with the benefit of hindsight,that the district court erred in formulating fuller sentence.
by raising a blakely objection to the compulsory application of the sentencing guidelines prior to sentencing,fuller preserved the error accordingly,the procedure for applying analysis that we set forth in crosby is inapplicable.fagans,at.instead,the issue upon review of the preserved error is whether we should affirm,if the government has shown the error to be harmless,or remand for resentencing,if such a showing has not been made.united states lake,cir.
in crosby,we specifically considered and rejected the possibility,albeit in considered dicta,that sentencing in the alternative prior to booker would be harmless error,concluding that even if a judge,prior to booker,indicated an alternative sentence that would have been imposed if compliance with the guidelines were not required,that alternative sentence is not necessarily the same one that the judge would have imposed in compliance with the duty to consider all of the factors listed in section a.crosby,at.we added that such an alternative sentence is not necessarily the same one that the judge would have imposed after presentation by the government of aggravating circumstances or by the defendant of mitigating circumstances that existed at the time but were not available for consideration under the mandatory guidelines regime.id.we now adopt these conclusions and hold that the district court method of sentencing in the the time of the supreme court landmark decisions in blakely and booker,and before our august,decision in united states mincey,cir directing district courts to continue applying,in mandatory fashion,the sentencing guidelines pending resolution of booker was not harmless error 
the government contends that,in light of judge mcmahon opinion in united states einstman,d,any error was harmless because t he parties knew or should have known in advance of sentencing that the district court believed the guidelines were no longer mandatory,and thus that there were no aggravating or mitigating circumstances that were not available for consideration.appellee supplemental letter br.of may,at.the mere publication of a district judge views in connection with another case did not,however,provide fuller with sufficient opportunity to present arguments tailored specifically to the sentencing landscape.nor can we say with any confidence what considerations counsel for both sides might have brought to the sentencing judge attention had they known that they could,as a matter of law,urge the judge to impose a sentence.crosby,at.
although we commend the care with which the district court resentenced fuller in august amidst uncertainty concerning the status of the sentencing guidelines,for the reasons stated above,we remand to the district court for resentencing in accordance with united states fagans,cir.
ii.reasonableness of the district court upward departure 
because a requires a district court to consider,inter alia,the applicable guidelines range when formulating a sentence,we have noted that when we remand for resentencing,it will often be preferable to adjudicate an outstanding calculation issue promptly so that subsequent sentencing proceedings will occur in light of a correct calculation.fagans,at see also united states canova,cir because the reasonableness of a sentence,even under the discretionary regime recognized in booker,depends in part on a district court consideration of the sentencing guidelines,a significant error in the calculation or construction of the guidelines may preclude affirmance.recognizing the value of reviewing a contested departure,even,see united states selioutsky,cir,and mindful that both parties have requested that we do so in this case,see supplemental letter br.of may,at appellee supplemental letter br.of may,at,we consider here whether the district court,in calculating the applicable guidelines sentence,erred in applying a upward departure for fuller bartering of drugs in exchange for firearms 
following booker,on sentencing appeals,we review a district court factual determinations for clear error,its legal conclusions de novo and its exercises of discretion with respect to departures for abuse of discretion.see selioutsky,at see also united states weisser,cir when reviewing a district court application of the guidelines in the era,we examine questions of law de novo and issues of fact for clear error.united states garcia,cir acknowledging that a clear error standard of review continues to apply to appellate challenges to judicial at sentencing after booker.a district court decision to depart pursuant to providing that a court may depart is discretionary,see selioutsky,at,and we therefore review the departure at issue here for abuse of discretion.
because a n error in determining the applicable guideline range or the availability of departure authority would be the type of procedural error that could render a sentence unreasonable under booker,selioutsky,at,we decline to forego such review on the theory that the district court would have imposed the same sentence as a sentence under the regime,in which event any error in using departure authority to select the sentence that was imposed would be harmless,id.at 
a district court abuses its discretion when its decision rests on an error of law such as application of the wrong legal principle or a clearly erroneous factual finding,or its not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual be located within the range of permissible decisions.zervos verizon,cir footnotes omitted.
where,as here,a defendant has failed to object to an alleged sentencing impropriety on the record in the district court,we review for plain error,requiring the defendant to establish error,that is plain,and that affects substantial rights.united states dos reis,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted alterations in original see also united states molina,cir recognizing that failure to preserve an objection under c gives rise to plain error review but see united states lewis,cir conducting plain error review where defendant failed to raise an c objection at sentencing,but commenting that whether plain error review is required in such circumstances is unclear.an error is plain if it is clear or obvious at the time of appellate consideration.united states thomas,cir en banc.
fuller does not challenge the district court finding that he bartered drugs for firearms,nor does he dispute that such a finding represented an appropriate basis for an upward departure pursuant to rather,fuller contends that the extent of the district court raised the applicable guidelines range from months to an abuse of discretion because the district court failed to provide any valid penalogical explanation for its departure calculation.br.at.according to fuller,the district court based that calculation solely on its intention to end up at the same place where it ended up before.id.at quoting tr.of sentencing hr g,at.
on appeal,the government asserts that the district court upward departure was based upon the court analogy between fuller conduct and the conduct described in b see appellees br.at,possess ion or transfer of any firearm or ammunition with knowledge,intent,or reason to believe that it would be used or possessed in connection with another felony offense.b.indeed,the government repeatedly urged the district in its submissions and during fuller sentencing adopt a departure on this basis.see gov t resentencing,at asserting that section b of the guidelines provides a helpful measure of the seriousness of the combination of gun crimes with other felonies tr.of sentencing hr g,at recommending to the court that in determining the magnitude of an upward departure one helpful guide post would be the enhancement which is contained in section of the sentencing guidelines.
