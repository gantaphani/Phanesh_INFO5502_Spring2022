amy is now in her twenties,and the pornographic images her uncle took of her continue to be traded on the internet.some individuals including lundquist have been convicted of possessing images of her.the questions presented are whether lundquist may be ordered to make restitution to amy and,if so,in what amount.
the district court suddaby,concluded that lundquist proximately caused of amy losses,but decided he should be held jointly and severally liable,along with all others convicted of possessing amy images,for her total losses of.we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding of proximate cause and that the district court reasonably estimated the share of amy losses to be attributed to lundquist as her total loss divided by the number of persons convicted of possessing her images at the time of the restitution request.the district court abused its discretion,however,by including in its calculations losses that lundquist could not have proximately caused and by holding lundquist jointly and severally liable for harm caused by defendants who were not before the court.accordingly,we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for recalculation of the amount of restitution.
statement of the case 
a.the.eundquist possession of child pornography 
on march,law enforcement found lundquist in possession of child pornography and arrested him.he later admitted that he had downloaded the pornography from the internet on or around february.on december,he pled guilty to a indictment charging him with receiving and possessing child pornography,in violation of a a and a b.the district court sentenced him principally to months in prison.among the images of child pornography in his possession was an image of amy.
amy images 
as noted above,amy was sexually abused by her uncle when she was four years old.he photographed his abuse of her and disseminated those images on the internet.in the late,law enforcement was able to track these images back to her uncle and prosecute him for these crimes.he was convicted of related charges in both federal and state court.
amy began undergoing psychological treatment for symptoms resulting from her uncle abuse in,at age nine.at the time,amy responded so well to treatment that her therapist declared that she was back to normal within a year and her treatment was discontinued.joyanna silberg,report of psychological consultation,hereinafter report.in,however,expert psychologist joyanna silberg,concluded that the earlier prognosis was overly optimistic because amy symptoms had during her adolescence and her history had conform ed to the expected trajectory of victims like herself who experience early sexual abuse.id.at.
among other factors causing the of her symptoms,in,when she was seventeen,amy received her first notice that another person had been found in possession of the images that her uncle had created and disseminated on the internet.since,amy has received hundreds of similar notices during a psychological evaluation conducted in,amy told silberg that she felt as if each discovery of another defendant that has traded her image her again.id.at.in her report,silberg explained why amy felt this way 
r ecovery from stress requires foremost a sense of safety that the trauma is over and that the past will not be replayed in the present.yet,a victim of child pornography whose pictures remain present on the internet can never really have that sense of safety,or separation of the past and present.the past,in fact continues to be repeated in the present over and over again 
specifically,amy awareness of these pictures,and knowledge of new defendants being arrested become ongoing triggers to her.

after consulting with an attorney,amy began to seek restitution from persons convicted of possessing her images,pursuant to the mandatory restitution provision in the violence against women act of.amy submitted her first request for restitution in and has since submitted requests in more than cases.see united states lundquist,d,
amy learns about lundquist 
after law enforcement agents arrested lundquist on march,they submitted the pornography found in his possession to the child victim identification program of the national center for missing exploited children ncmec for comparison with known child victims from other criminal investigations the ncmec identified amy in one of the images in lundquist government then notified amy of the pending proceedings against lundquist so she could assert her rights 
between the dates of lundquist arrest and his guilty plea,amy visited silberg twice for psychological.on august,amy met with silberg to determine whether she was still suffering from the symptoms documented in the report.after this consultation,silberg concluded in a report dated october,
it is clear that many of the symptoms that amy evidenced in the initial evaluation in remain,and some have worsened 
she continues to have symptoms,such as being triggered by the basement door at her uncle house 
amy continues to struggle with making academic and vocational progress,is paralyzed by shame and struggles with feelings of victimization,and had begun to recapitulate this.despite feelings of guilt and shame she is unable to halt these processes.
joyanna silberg,update on psychological consultation,hereinafter report.
amy returned to silberg for a second on december.during this interview,silberg and amy discussed amy reasons for seeking restitution from defendants convicted of possessing her images.amy explained that she believes that it is important for those people who are continuing to victimize her to pay in some way,so that they have some knowledge of the harm they are causing.joyanna silberg,update on psychological consultation,hereinafter report.during that same session,amy also briefly discussed her incarcerated uncle and her fear that he will be released from prison soon as one of the things holding her back in her life.id.based on this evaluation,silberg concluded 
amy inability to move forward is inhibited by a sense of pervasive fear.she describes fear of her uncle as well as the pervasive fear of multitudes of men out there who could recognize her from a picture and have already abused her in their fantasies 
it is clear that amy continues to suffer from the ongoing effects of her victimization from child abuse and from the continued use of her image by child pornography viewers,traders,and abusers.
proceedings below 
on april,amy attorney submitted,on her behalf,a request for restitution from lundquist.attached to the letter request were amy victim impact statement,silberg,and reports,and a expert economic report prepared by stan smith,which calculated amy lost future income,the cost of her future treatment,and the value of her decreased enjoyment of life the smith report.
the government presented amy restitution request to the district court in its sentencing memorandum.in addition to amy materials,the government enclosed the ncmec identification report and a table of other defendants convicted of possessing amy images.at the june,sentencing hearing,the district court indicated its intent to order restitution in the amount of.this amount was based on the restitution order issued in a recent case involving another defendant who had been convicted of possessing amy images.see united states aumais,cr,wl,report and recommendation adopted by,wl,aff in part and rev in part,cir.the district court deferred decision on the issue of restitution,however,to allow the government to consult with amy and to await this court decision in aumais.
after the sentencing hearing,the government submitted a letter confirming that amy was willing to accept the proposed amount of restitution,but lundquist submitted letters renewing both his objection to any order of restitution and his request for a hearing.lundquist argued that he was not a proximate cause of amy losses he should be able to depose amy or alternatively learn her identity so he could investigate her claims the district court committed mathematical errors in its calculations during the sentencing hearing and the district court should not rely on any of the factual findings made in aumais.soon after these letters were submitted to the district court,this court reversed the order of restitution in aumais.see aumais.
in a memorandum decision and order filed december,the district court denied lundquist request for a hearing and ordered him to make restitution,on a joint and several basis,in the amount of.united states lundquist,d.the district court concluded that lundquist had proximately caused amy losses because lundquist possessed her image between february and march,and during that time amy has sustained,and continues to sustain,significant psychological damage as a result of her knowledge that unidentified individuals have downloaded pornographic images of her from the internet.id.at.although the court did not believe it was necessary that amy know of lundquist possession of her image,it nonetheless found that she had such knowledge because the government notified her of the ncmec identification and,soon afterwards,amy visited silberg twice to obtain new expert reports,which she then used in her restitution request.see id.at.
in calculating the amount of loss,the district court concluded that all of the losses under consideration were due to the victim caused by learning about people downloading her images from the internet.see id.at n.the court reasoned that amy was deemed to be back to normal in and the only reason that her symptoms later was because she began to receive notifications about new possessors of her images.see id.to the extent it was necessary to quantify lundquist personal share of amy losses,the court estimated that lundquist proximately caused one,or percent,of her total losses because defendants had been convicted of possessing amy images as of the date of the government restitution request.id.at.after finding that nearly all of amy claimed losses were reasonable the court calculated lundquist personal share as.id.at but because it construed h as authorizing joint and several liability in this instance,the district court ordered that lundquist be held jointly and severally liable for the full amount of.see id.at

discussion 
applicable law 
we review an order of restitution for abuse of discretion and will reverse only if the challenged ruling rests on an error of law,a clearly erroneous finding of fact,or otherwise can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.aumais,at quoting united states pearson,cir.under this standard,we will review the factual findings underlying the district court finding of proximate cause for clear error,but we review de novo the district court application of th e facts to draw conclusions of law,including a finding of liability.id.at quoting travellers int l,trans world airlines,cir.
mandatory restitution under section 
originally enacted as part of the violence against women act of,tit.iv,stat,requires courts to order restitution for any offense under this chapter,including the crimes of receiving and possessing child pornography.a,b see also id.a a,a b.the offender must make restitution for the full amount of the victim losses.id.b.as used in the statute,victim means the individual harmed as a result of a commission of a crime under this chapter.id.c.in aumais,we held that the children depicted in child pornography generally and amy specifically are victims within the meaning of this section.aumais,at 
the full amount of the victim losses is defined as 
any costs incurred by the victim for 
a medical services relating to physical,psychiatric,or psychological care 
b physical and occupational therapy or rehabilitation 
c necessary transportation,temporary housing,and child care expenses 
d lost income 
e attorneys fees,as well as other costs incurred and 
f any other losses suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offense.
id.b.we have held that the victim losses must be proximately caused by the defendant offense even if they fall within one of the enumerated categories in subparagraphs a through e because proximate cause is a deeply rooted principle in both tort and criminal law that congress did not abrogate when it drafted.aumais,at citing united states monzel,for this standard to be met,there must be some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.id.quoting hemi,llc city of new york,d.
to the extent there is a ny dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution,it shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence,with the government bearing the burden of proof.e see id.b an order of restitution under this section shall be issued and enforced in accordance with section in the same manner as an order under section.the district court need not hold a evidentiary hearing on these issues,but it must offer each defendant an adequate opportunity to present his position.united states sabhnani,cir internal quotation marks omitted quoting united states maurer,cir per curiam.even if the district court holds an evidentiary hearing,however,n o victim shall be required to participate in any phase of a restitution order.g.
in setting the amount of restitution,the court need only make a reasonable estimate of the victim loss.see pearson,at.we will uphold an award of restitution under section if the district court is able to estimate,based upon facts in the record,the amount of a victim loss with some reasonable certainty.id.quoting united states doe,cir see also united states burgess,cir t he district court is not required to justify any award with absolute precision monzel,at noting that,under section,some degree of approximation is acceptable and mathematical precision is not required quotation omitted.
section h also authorizes the district court to impose joint and several liability in certain circumstances 
if the court finds more than defendant has contributed to the loss of a victim,the court may make each defendant liable for payment of the full amount of restitution or may apportion liability among the defendants to reflect the level of contribution to the victim loss and economic circumstances of each defendant.
in aumais,it was unnecessary for the court to address the issue of joint and several liability because there was no evidence that the defendant in that case had proximately caused any of amy losses.see aumais,at.nevertheless,the court suggested that holding a criminal defendant jointly and severally liabile with others who were not before the sentencing court would be problematic and inconsistent with the text of section h,which implies that joint and several liability may be imposed only when a single district judge is dealing with multiple defendants in a single case or indictment.id.at.
the evidence of proximate cause in aumais 
in aumais,defendant gerald aumais had pled guilty to transporting and possessing child pornography,including images of amy,and the district court ordered him to make restitution to amy,pursuant to section.see aumais,at.we reversed because p roximate cause demands some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged and there was no evidence that such a relationship existed between aumais possession and amy losses.see id.at citation omitted.
the district court had relied on amy victim impact statement and the testimony of silberg,see id.at,but amy statement was prepared and silberg evaluations took place before aumais was arrested on november.id.at.this evidence suffered from several deficiencies it did not show that amy had direct contact with aumais or that she even knew of his existence the victim impact statement did not mention aumais and silberg could not speak to the impact on amy caused by this defendant because her evaluations were all performed before aumais arrest.id.accordingly,there was a complete absence of evidence linking aumais possession to any loss suffered by amy.id.at.
we did not decide the circumstances in which a victim of child pornography can recover restitution,or the type of proof that would suffice to show causation.we did quote with approval a portion of the ninth circuit decision in united states kennedy,cir 
the government evidence showed only that the defendant participated in the audience of persons who viewed the images of amy.while this may be sufficient to establish that the defendant actions were one cause of the generalized harm amy suffered due to the circulation of her images on the internet,it is not sufficient to show that they were a proximate cause of any particular losses.
aumais,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted quoting kennedy,at.we carefully noted,however,that our opinion does not categorically foreclose payment of restitution to victims of child pornography from a defendant who possesses their pornographic images.id.at.indeed,we acknowledged that the evidence of harm suffered by amy was credible and.see id.we only narrowly held that where the victim impact statement and the psychological evaluation were drafted before the defendant was even arrested or might as well have been the victim loss was not proximately caused by a defendant possession of the victim image.id.
in aumais and kennedy,both courts were concerned that the record did not include any evidence that the defendant conduct contributed to the victim claimed losses at all.kennedy,at emphasis added see aumais,at.in both cases,the government relied on essentially the same evidence victim impact statements and psychological evaluations demonstrating that the victim generally suffered harm from her awareness that unidentified persons were able to look at images of her childhood abuse.see,aumais,at kennedy,at.in neither case did the government present evidence that the victim continued to suffer this harm after the defendant possession of her images,at a time when the victim would have learned and in fact did learn about the specific defendant offense.thus,in both cases,the government proved only that the victims suffered harm from their general fear that others were likely in possession of their images harm that would have existed whether or not the specific defendants had ever actually possessed the victims images.see united states fast,cir explaining that defendant could not have caused and thus could not be liable for losses before the date he possessed images of the victim united states gamble,cir as a logical matter,a defendant generally can not cause harm prior to the date of his offense.
the ninth circuit decision in kennedy does suggest,in a portion not cited in aumais,that the government must prove that the defendant directly caused some discrete,measurable aggravation of the injury.see kennedy,at t he district court inability to calculate the loss attributable to kennedy offense is due to the government failure to introduce evidence of such a loss such as evidence that kennedy conduct led to amy and vicky needing additional therapy sessions or missing days at work.we decline to follow this dicta,for several reasons.
first,a recent ninth circuit per curiam opinion appears to cast doubt on this aspect of kennedy.see in re amy,cir per curiam.in that case,the district court concluded that amy and another victim evidence did not satisfy the standard established in kennedy,but the ninth circuit issued a writ of mandamus ordering the lower court to award restitution because there was sufficient evidence to establish a causal connection between defendant offense and petitioners losses.id.although the restitution requests are sealed,the publicly available briefs submitted to the ninth circuit suggest that the victims did not present particularized evidence of the sort described in kennedy indeed,the evidence in that case appears to be no different than the evidence now before us.see petition for a writ of mandamus at,in re amy,cir,ecf see also response by the united states at,in re amy,cir,ecf advocating for the same method of calculating restitution used in this case.in sum,the ninth circuit has found evidence sufficient to support an award of restitution.to the extent that kennedy imposes a stricter requirement for proof of causation,we decline to adopt that approach.
second,while nearly every circuit has recognized a proximate cause requirement in section,see supra note,most of these courts have also acknowledged the inherent difficulty of applying that concept in this context.accordingly,none has required,as a matter of law,more particularized proof than what has been presented in this case 
finally,a legal rule demanding more particularized proof would be inconsistent with the principles underlying the concept of proximate cause,which congress did not abrogate when it drafted.aumais,at.proximate cause refers generally to the concept that i njuries have countless causes,but because not all should give rise to legal liability,the law will decline to trace a series of events beyond a certain point.csx,mcbride,d quoting palsgraf long island,andrews,dissenting.at bottom,the notion of proximate cause reflects ideas of what justice demands,or of what is administratively possible and convenient.aumais,at quoting holmes sec.investor prot,d.
of course,what justice demands is heavily dependent on the circumstances.hence,there can be no bright line demarcating a legally sufficient proximate cause from one that is too remote.people roberts,cal th,d,cal.accordingly,we decline to adopt a rule mandating the type of proof victims of child pornography must present before they can obtain restitution.it is sufficient if the evidence shows that there is more likely than not some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.aumais,at quotation omitted see also e any dispute shall be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence.
application 
first,we consider whether aumais precludes a finding of proximate cause in this case and conclude it does not.next,we determine that the government evidence reasonably supports a finding of proximate cause.we then conclude that the district court method of estimating the amount of restitution was reasonable,although we also conclude that the district court erred in including damages for harm that lundquist could not have caused.finally,we hold that the district court erred by holding lundquist jointly and severally liable for amy total losses.
aumais does not preclude restitution 
lundquist argues primarily that aumais forecloses a finding of proximate cause as a matter of law in this case.he points out that amy victim impact statement and the report are the same documents submitted in aumais,and that neither the nor the report identifies lundquist specifically as a cause of amy harm.thus,according to lundquist,both the victim impact statement and the psychological evaluation s were drafted before the defendant was even arrested or might as well have been and thus can not support a finding of proximate cause as a matter of law.aumais,at emphasis added.
we conclude that lundquist takes the phrase or might as well have been in aumais out of context.as lundquist acknowledges,silberg testimony in aumais was based on the report,which was prepared on november,a few days after aumais arrest on november.but the report was based on evaluations conducted on june,july,and november,days and even months before aumais arrest.see aumais,at report at.in context,then,the phrase or might as well have been undoubtedly refers to reports like the one in aumais that are technically prepared after the defendant arrest,but which could not possibly contain any information concerning the victim condition as a result of the defendant possession.these types of reports can not speak to the impact on the victim caused by this defendant.id.at accord united states mcgarity,cir citing aumais,at holding proximate cause can not be based on testimony of psychological expert who had not evaluated amy after the defendant arrest.
here,in contrast,the new psychological reports were prepared on october,and january,and were based on evaluations conducted on august and december,respectively.hence,both new reports were prepared and based on evaluations conducted months after lundquist arrest on march.although the reports do not mention lundquist specifically,they show that amy continued to suffer harm as a result of learning about new possessors of images of her abuse during the time period when she would have learned about lundquist.accordingly,the new reports could potentially speak to the impact on amy caused by this defendant.aumais,at.
additionally,the district court in aumais found that amy did not even know of aumais existence.see id.at.here,in contrast,the district court found that amy learned about lundquist possession of her image,and we conclude that this finding was not clearly erroneous.although the record is unclear as to precisely when amy received the notification,the district court noted that the government had a duty to notify amy and,between the dates of lundquist arrest and his guilty plea,amy visited silberg twice for to determine to what extent she was continuing to be psychologically due to her knowledge that individuals were exchanging and viewing pornographic photographs of her on the internet.lundquist,d at.during one of these evaluations,amy disclosed that she was personally involved in seeking restitution from these individuals.the two evaluations provided the basis for the and reports,which amy then used to support her request for restitution from lundquist.this sequence of events supports the reasonable inference that amy went for the at least in part because she had learned about lundquist and intended to seek restitution from him 
accordingly,this case is distinguishable from aumais because the government has presented evidence that amy continued to suffer harm after lundquist arrest as a result of learning about individuals like lundquist who had come into possession of images of her abuse and lundquist was one of the possessors that amy learned about during that time.these facts support an inference that the harm documented in the and reports was caused at least in part by learning about lundquist offense.hence,the record before the district court was sufficient to support a finding that lundquist conduct was a proximate cause of some of amy harm.see united states mcdaniel,cir.
we acknowledge that it may appear anomalous to tie a defendant liability for restitution directly and often solely to action taken by the government.a victim of a child pornography crime ordinarily learns of a defendant offense and thereby can make a showing of proximate cause only after receiving notice from the government the government role in the chain of causation,however,is an unavoidable,practical consequence of congress decision that child pornography victims must be given notice of the crime committed against them and an opportunity to assert their rights.we conclude that this role does not provide a basis for denying restitution to a victim harmed by a defendant actions.
there is no doubt that victims of child pornography suffer harm from the circulation of their images,see new york ferber,d t he harm to the child is exacerbated by the circulation of these images.aumais,at,and it is also indisputable that congress mandated restitution for victims of these offenses,see a.while it is clear that congress did not mean for section to serve as strict liability against any defendant possessing such admittedly repugnant images or videos,mcgarity,at,the requirement of proximate cause strikes a balance,limiting the defendant liability to those losses that can be proved to have some direct relation to his offense.aumais,at quotation omitted.perhaps it is not ideal,but using the victim knowledge of the defendant conduct is an administratively possible and convenient manner of proving this relationship,which is all that proximate cause requires here.id.quoting holmes,at.even though the government ordinarily helps to create this evidentiary link between the defendant crime and the victim harm,the defendant conduct remains the proximate cause of the victim resulting harm because one of the foreseeable risks of possessing child pornography is that the victim may eventually learn about the crime in some manner.see dobbs,supra,i f the intervening cause itself is part of the risk negligently created by the defendant,or if it is reasonably foreseeable at the time of the defendant negligent conduct,the defendant is not relieved of liability merely because some other person or force triggered the injury.
specific evidence of proximate cause 
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that lundquist proximately caused some portion of amy losses.the original report explains that notifications about new possessors like lundquist are ongoing triggers for amy,which cause her problems in the areas of m ood regulation,cognitive distortions,feelings of shame,and guilt,alcohol abuse,dissociation,academic progress,interpersonal relationships,and vocational success.report at.the report confirms that after lundquist arrest,many of the symptoms that amy evidenced in the report remain,and some have worsened.report at.the report specifies that her poor interpersonal choices are seen as direct effects of the previous and ongoing abuse of amy on the internet and as a child her inability to set or fulfill career goals is exacerbated by her awareness of this pervasiveness of her image on the internet which makes her fearful of interacting with many people outside the comfort of her familiar surroundings and her inability to move forward is also inhibited by a sense of pervasive fear of her uncle as well as the pervasive fear of multitudes of men out there who could recognize her from a picture and have already abused her in their fantasies.report at.
in short,i t is clear that amy continues to suffer from the ongoing effects of her victimization from child abuse and the continued use of her image by child pornography viewers.id.because the sequence of events following lundquist arrest supports the reasonable inference that amy learned about lundquist before visiting silberg for the,the district court reasonably determined that lundquist caused part of the harm described in the and reports and thus was more likely than not a proximate cause of some of amy losses.moreover,lundquist submitted a letter in connection with sentencing,in which he admitted having reviewed the victim impact statements of the children depicted in the images in his possession and acknowledged that he had made them my vict i ms by my actions,that they relive it.accordingly,lundquist has admitted that his actions harmed amy.although such evidence is not necessary to show proximate cause,it provides additional support for the district court finding in this instance.
lundquist argues that the district court abused its discretion by making its findings without holding an evidentiary hearing.we disagree.it was well within the district court discretion to decline to hold a evidentiary hearing because lundquist had an adequate opportunity to present his position.sabhnani,at quotation omitted.lundquist had ample opportunity to raise objections to amy supporting materials,but failed to do so.instead,he made primarily legal arguments that did not require a hearing to resolve.the only evidentiary relief that lundquist sought was the opportunity to depose amy or learn her true identity,but n o victim shall be required to participate in any phase of a restitution order.g.accordingly,the district court did not abuse its discretion by relying only on the parties submissions.
the amount of restitution 
while the record supports a finding that lundquist proximately caused some of amy harm,we recognize that trying to determine which specific losses are attributable to him is an arduous task.as discussed above,we reject any suggestion in kennedy that amy must show specific losses caused by her knowledge of lundquist,such as additional therapy sessions or miss ed days at work.kennedy,at.such an approach misconstrues the nature of amy psychological injury an o
