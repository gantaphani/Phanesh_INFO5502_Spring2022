this sentencing appeal requires us to address,in part,the interaction between the related sentence and relevant conduct provisions in the united states sentencing guidelines guidelines,both of which may limit the impact of a defendant prior criminal record on the calculation of his criminal history category for an instant offense.
on december,a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment charging robert cyr and numerous other with conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute.although the indictment included a host of additional charges against cyr alone,the defendant pled guilty to only the drug conspiracy count count one,and to conspiracy to launder money count,pursuant to a plea agreement reached on february.on october,the district court sentenced cyr to concurrent prison terms of months on count one and months on count,to be followed by five years of supervised release.
cyr raises two challenges to his sentence on appeal.first,he argues that the district court erred in computing his base offense level using the drug quantity set forth in the report psr,rather than the lower amount agreed to by the government and memorialized in the plea agreement.second,the defendant claims that the district court erred in concluding that two prior state convictions for distributing xanax merited three criminal history points under the guidelines for purposes of calculating the defendant criminal history category.
we find no merit in cyr first claim of error.we further conclude that while the district court erroneously characterized the defendant prior state convictions for distribution of heroin as unrelated to his prior state convictions for distribution of xanax,its calculation of cyr criminal history category was nonetheless correct.
in late fall of,the drug enforcement administration dea launched an investigation of heroin trafficking in lawrence,massachusetts.the investigation uncovered a drug ring run by john damien,a former substance abuse counselor.cyr first purchased heroin from damien in,and was arrested twice in while working as his distributor.on each occasion,the defendant was in possession of both heroin and xanax.after the first arrest,in july,cyr was convicted on one count of possession with intent to distribute heroin and one count of possession with intent to distribute xanax the july convictions.for both offenses he received a suspended sentence of nineteen months imprisonment and was ordered to serve eighteen months probation.after the second arrest in october,cyr was again convicted of the same two offenses the october convictions.this time,cyr was sentenced to two years of imprisonment,with days served and the balance suspended.the court also sentenced the defendant to a period of probation ending february.
cyr was released from prison on february.while still on probation,the defendant rejoined damien heroin organization and became his right hand man.in this supervisory role,he was entrusted with such responsibilities as weighing and packaging the heroin,operating a stash house,laundering the drug proceeds,and running the drug organization while damien was away on vacation.apprehended again in may,cyr agreed to plead guilty to the drug conspiracy and money laundering counts in the superseding indictment.under the terms of the plea agreement,the parties agree d to take the position that defendant is responsible for not less than three and not more that ten kilograms of heroin during the period of the conspiracy.the plea agreement also memorialized a stipulation between cyr and the government regarding his july and october drug convictions the parties agree that defendant convictions in the cases are part of the res gestae of this case pursuant to,application note.
the psr prepared for cyr sentencing took a contrary position with respect to both drug quantity and criminal history.in determining the drug amount attributable to cyr,the psr noted that damien had admitted responsibility for kilograms of heroin in his own plea agreement with the government.reiterating that cyr had acted as damien right hand man over the course of the conspiracy,the psr reasoned that the amount of heroin possessed and distributed by john damien was reasonably foreseeable to defendant cyr.the psr also disregarded the parties stipulation covering cyr july and october drug convictions,finding that t he career offender provisions of are applicable in this case because the defendant has two prior convictions of either a crime of violence,or an applicable controlled substance violation.
the district court sentencing determination incorporated elements of both the plea agreement and the psr.initially,the court agreed with the probation office that cyr was responsible for a drug quantity in the kilogram category.however,the court declined to classify cyr july and october heroin convictions as predicate offenses for purposes of applying the career offender guideline,reasoning that the psr explicitly treats the prior offenses as part of cyr participation in the damien conspiracy.having determined that cyr did not qualify as a career offender,the court severed the heroin convictions from the xanax convictions,and ruled that only the former could be considered uncountable relevant conduct for purposes of applying.see supra note.the court viewed the xanax convictions as independent offenses unrelated to the drug conspiracy charge,and accordingly assigned cyr three criminal history points for the xanax convictions as a result,cyr received a total of six criminal history points,placing him in criminal history category iii.on appeal,he argues that the court should only have given him three criminal history points,and correspondingly assigned him to criminal history category ii.
drug quantity 
in challenging the district court decision to attribute to him a drug quantity of kilograms,cyr claims that the district court erred by relying on portions of the psr objected to by the defense without compelling the government to proffer additional evidence to bolster the disputed material.cyr emphasizes that the government stipulated to a drug quantity of kilograms,and joined the defendant objection to the psr higher drug quantity determination.
generally,a psr bears sufficient indicia of reliability to permit the district court to rely on it at sentencing.united states taylor,cir.the defendant is free to challenge any assertions in the psr with countervailing evidence or proffers,in which case the district court is obliged to resolve any genuine and material dispute on the merits.but if the defendant objections to the psr are merely rhetorical and unsupported by countervailing proof,the district court is entitled to rely on the facts in the psr.see united states grant,cir a lthough defendant objected to certain facts in the psr he did not provide the sentencing court with evidence to rebut the factual assertions consequently,the court was justified in relying on the contested facts.
the district court drug quantity determination was grounded in a substantial body of probative evidence gleaned both from the psr and the plea agreement.as the court noted,the defendant conceded in the plea agreement that his managerial role in the conspiracy warranted a sentencing increase pursuant to c.having acknowledged a supervisory role,it was reasonable for the district court to attribute to him the quantity of drugs that damien,the ringleader of the conspiracy,admitted to trafficking in his own plea agreement.as the court observed 
damien,the leader of the conspiracy,acknowledged in his own plea agreement that he should be held responsible for to kilograms.damien acknowledgment is not binding on cyr,of course,but it is evidence that tends to corroborate the estimates that are based on cyr own statements.further corroboration comes from another conspirator,jose cordero,who estimated that damien purchased more than kilograms from one particular supplier.there is no information in the statement of relevant offense conduct that tends to minimize what was foreseeable to cyr 
perhaps the most damning evidence of drug quantity was the defendant own admissions.cyr plea agreement
