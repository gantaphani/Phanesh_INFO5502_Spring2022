jerome hudson pled guilty,without a plea agreement,to possession of ammunition by a felon.see g.based upon his criminal history he was sentenced as an armed career criminal.see e.on appeal,he claims error in his designation as an armed career criminal and also in the calculation of his guideline sentencing range gsr.we affirm hudson classification as an armed career criminal.in light of the government concession of error in the calculation of hudson gsr,we vacate his sentence and remand.
at in the morning on january,officers in lewiston,maine responded to a reported shooting near an apartment complex.their investigation quickly identified hudson who had fled the scene as the perpetrator.the police learned through witnesses that an altercation had occurred between hudson and the father of hudson girlfriend children.that argument escalated until hudson fired a number of shots at the other man at point blank range.all of this took place as a number of children began to come out of their homes to catch the school bus the police retrieved four spent shell casings from the scene and made contact with hudson girlfriend at the apartment that he and she shared.with her consent,the police searched the home and located an open safe containing rounds of ammunition,one loose round of caliber ammunition,and two loose rounds of winchester ammunition.officers found hudson hiding in a stairwell a short distance away,and upon being apprehended he stated you guys have my ammo and that all you getting,you wo find my gun.hudson would later admit to firing the shots,but claimed that he did so as a warning because the other man was reaching for something in his waistband.
ii.procedural history 
on april,a federal grand jury indicted hudson for possession of ammunition by a felon.the indictment included notice that the government intended to classify hudson as an armed career criminal,specifying five separate prior massachusetts convictions see e.prior to his october,sentencing,hudson objected to a recommendation in the psr that he be designated as an armed career criminal.at sentencing,the court identified three of the five enumerated offenses as qualifying convictions for violent crime under the armed career criminal act acca,e,and the sentencing judge imposed a month incarcerative term followed by years of supervised release.
one of the three predicate convictions on which the district court relied was a conviction for larceny from a person,see.laws ch.but that offense had qualified as a predicate under the residual clause of the acca,a provision subsequently invalidated by the supreme court.see johnson united states johnson ii,d holding the residual clause of the acca unconstitutionally vague.the government does not argue that the larceny conviction would otherwise qualify as a predicate offense,but rather seeks to substitute in its place a different massachusetts conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon adw.in this timely appeal,hudson argues that both his adw conviction and a prior conviction for possession of drugs with intent to distribute them do not qualify as predicate offenses under the acca 
iii.analysis 
the acca requires the imposition of more severe sentences on repeat offenders when they are convicted of certain new crimes.see.in this case,if hudson has three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense,or both,then a mandatory year prison sentence and other sentencing enhancements follow.id.e.whether a prior conviction qualifies as a serious drug offense or a violent felony under the acca is a question of law,and where,as here,the question is preserved,we undertake a de novo review.see united states holloway,cir united states mckenney,cir.
possession with intent to distribute 
the acca defines a serious drug offense as 
a n offense under state law,involving manufacturing,distributing,or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute,a controlled substance for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.
e a ii.hudson challenges the district court finding that a massachusetts conviction for possession with intent to distribute a class b substance qualifies as a serious drug offense.
in arguing that this conviction does not qualify,hudson focuses on the bifurcated nature of the sentences provided for in the state statute.see.laws ch,a.that statute,like many other felony statutes in massachusetts,provides for concurrent jurisdiction in the district and superior courts.at the discretion of the district attorney,a defendant such as hudson charged with possession with intent to distribute a class b substance may be prosecuted in either venue.if the defendant case remains in the district court,then the maximum term of incarceration is two and years in the house of corrections indictment and prosecution in the superior court subjects a defendant to a maximum of ten years in state prison.see id.because he was prosecuted in the district court,hudson argues that he was not subject to a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more,as required by the acca.that claim,however,is foreclosed by circuit precedent.in united states moore,we held that conviction under.laws ch,a qualifies as a serious drug offense irrespective of which massachusetts court entered the conviction,cir 
when a claim runs headlong into circuit precedent,our law of the circuit doctrine must be confronted.that doctrine dictates that i n a circuit newly constituted panels ordinarily are constrained by prior panel decisions directly or even closely on point.holloway,at quoting united states guzman,cir.absent special circumstances,we are duty bound to follow our prior holding.see united states chhien,cir listing exceptions.
hudson offers no new or previously unaddressed reason to deviate from our prior holdings on the issue.he argues only that the supreme court decision in united states rodriguez,d,represents a shift in authority that requires us to revisit moore.this argument is not a novel one we have already held that there is nothing in the supreme court intervening decision in united states rodriguez to require us to revisit our holding in moore.united states weekes,cir citation omitted.accordingly,a massachusetts conviction for possession with intent to distribute a class b substance continues to qualify as a serious drug offense under the acca.
assault with a dangerous weapon 
the government maintains that hudson prior felony conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon.laws ch,b,also qualifies as a predicate violent felony under the acca.see e b.although the acca residual clause is no longer effective,the government argues that a massachusetts adw conviction fits within the acca force clause also referred to as the elements clause.
the force clause requires that a qualifying conviction stem from a crime punishable by more than one year in prison that has as an element the use,attempted use,or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.id.the supreme court defines the phrase physical force within the context of the force clause to mean s violent force that is,force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.johnson united states johnson i,d.
in determining whether a prior state conviction qualifies as a violent felony under the acca,we apply the categorical approach,looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses,and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.taylor united states,d.we thus may consider only the offense legal definition,foregoing any inquiry into how the defendant may have committed the offense.holloway,at citing begay united states,d 
massachusetts law provides that w hoever,by means of a dangerous weapon,commits an assault upon another shall be punished.laws ch,b.and we have held that a massachusetts adw conviction qualifies as a predicate offense under the force clause of the acca.see united states am,cir.as noted earlier,however,intervening authority,such as a supreme court decision,can undermine a once holding.hudson argues that intervening authority renders am unpersuasive and urges us to undertake a new categorical anal
