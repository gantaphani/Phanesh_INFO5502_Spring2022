defendant ana torres stands convicted of theft of government property arising from the fraud she carried out to obtain subsidized housing benefits in new york city.she appeals from a march,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york colleen mcmahon,judge,ordering her,first,to pay in restitution to the new york city housing authority,and second,to forfeit to the united states.the sum that is the subject of each order represents rental subsidies that were paid for torres benefit as a result of her deliberate of her household income on applications for subsidized housing in new york city over a period of more than four years.
torres does not contest the restitution order.as to forfeiture,however,she argues that the district court order was not authorized by law.there is no dispute that the government may seek forfeiture as a penalty for the crime of which she was convicted.torres challenge rests instead on the observation that the united states department of housing and urban development hud paid the subsidies of which torres defrauded it directly to nycha her landlord and not to torres.therefore,she contends,she never obtained the subsidies within the meaning of the applicable forfeiture statute,as is required to constitute forfeitable proceeds of her offense.rather,she retained money as a result of her fraud,and received only the inchoate and benefit of residing in subsidized housing at reduced cost.
for the reasons set forth below,we disagree.we conclude that the that torres saved by duping nycha and hud constituted property that was obtained by torres indirectly as a result of her offense,and may also be fairly characterized as proceeds traceable to or net gain realized from her offense.each phrase provides an adequate premise under for the government forfeiture complaint and the court forfeiture award.
moreover,there was nothing improper about the government decision to seek the imposition of forfeiture and restitution in this case.restitution and forfeiture are authorized by different statutes and serve different purposes one of remediating a loss,the other of disgorging a gain.their concurrent imposition has been judicially examined and upheld on numerous occasions in our circuit and elsewhere.and,the related orders here contemplate payments to different payees,one municipal and one federal.thus,no legal bar prevented the government application for both,and with such applications before it,the district court was bound to grant those applications.further,once torres begins making the required payments,an equitable remedy may be available to her.finally,where restitution and forfeiture are both authorized by law,the decision to pursue both concurrently is committed to the government,not to the courts.
we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court in toto.
background 
ana torres was charged by information with one count of theft of government property in violation of,and four counts of making false statements to the government in violation of.the charges derived from allegations that,over a period,torres submitted false affidavits understating her household earnings level in a successful effort to obtain rental subsidy benefits for her housing 
in september,torres pleaded guilty before a magistrate judge to a single count of theft of government property,and one month later,the district court accepted her plea.in her plea colloquy,torres admitted the charges and acknowledged that,from october through,she had paid less in rent for her subsidized apartment than would have been required of her had she accurately reported her income and that of others living in the household.
the pre sentence report psr stated,and torres did not dispute,that the sum she was excused from paying to nycha during that time period because of her fraud was the psr further informed the district court,also without dispute by torres,that in torres had moved to an apartment in rhode island,where she conducted a parallel fraud causing hud a loss of despite her residence elsewhere,torres reported to nycha that she was living in the new york apartment,and,on her income affidavits,torres understated both her own income and the income attributable to her children.she also failed to report that another adult was living in the new york apartment and earning income.
the income information served as nycha basis for calculating the amount of rent that torres,as tenant of record,would be required to pay for the new york city apartment.subsidies from hud covered the difference between what torres ostensibly could afford and the total rent charged by nycha.
after the district court accepted torres guilty plea the government applied for a forfeiture order in the amount of under c and a c.the former statute permits the government to request forfeiture in any criminal case in which either civil or criminal forfeiture is authorized for the charged offense the latter statute authorizes civil forfeiture for any offense constituting specified unlawful activity as defined by c,which includes the offense of torres conviction theft of government property in violation of.
under,any property that constitutes or is derived from the proceeds traceable to the offense is subject to forfeiture.a c.section a a defines proceeds for purposes of torres crime as property of any kind obtained directly or indirectly,as the result of the commission of the offense giving rise to forfeiture,and any property traceable thereto,and is not limited to the net gain or profit realized from the offense.a a.
the district court sentenced torres to a term of three years probation and restitution to nycha as described above.it also granted the requested forfeiture order,requiring torres to pay to the united states attorney office.torres opposed the forfeiture order,arguing that did not apply to any funds held by her because she had not obtained funds as a result of her offense rather,she had received only the intangible benefit of the right to live in subsidized housing.the court rejected torres challenge,reasoning that,by fraudulently applying for and receiving the rental subsidies,torres had obtained these funds she had been able to keep and use as she chose that she would otherwise have had to pay in rent 
torres appeals the forfeiture order to this court,largely reprising the arguments she presented in the district court.she does not directly challenge the legality of the district court concurrent application of the restitution and forfeiture statutes,but because she contends that their simultaneous imposition is unusual in practice and harsh in result,we consider whether any legal doctrine bars forfeiture when imposed in addition to restitution in the circumstances presented here.
discussion 
interpreting section 
as set forth above,of title,entitled civil forfeiture,makes subject to forfeiture any property,real or personal,which constitutes or is derived from proceeds traceable to any offense constituting specified unlawful activity as defined in section c of this title.a c.no one disputes that specified unlawful activity includes the crime of torres conviction,theft of government property under.we therefore begin our analysis by looking to the definition of proceeds provided in to determine whether torres held any property that constitutes or is derived from such proceeds.
in cases involving unlawful activities such as those torres pursued,proceeds means property of any kind obtained directly or indirectly,as the result of the commission of the offense giving rise to forfeiture,and any property traceable thereto,and is not limited to the net gain or profit realized from the offense.a a emphasis supplied the statute thus broadly treats as proceeds,in torres case,any property that was obtained directly or indirectly as a result of the commission of the theft of government property.id.it captures property traceable to that theft.id.and it covers the net gain or profit realized from the offense.id.
torres contends that she did not obtain any property through her theft because she never had possession or control over the subsidy funds,which were paid to nycha on her behalf.she argues that,at most,she derived the benefit of living in an apartment at a rate,but that benefit does not constitute property,and although money changed hands on her behalf,those funds were never sufficiently in her control to be subject to forfeiture now.
it is true that the unadorned word obtain is defined as to succeed in gaining possession of procure or acquire.american heritage dictionary coll.ed.when applied to a item such as an automobile,for example,its meaning may be very concrete and bounded.but in assessing whether torres obtained fungible proceeds subject to forfeiture under,we may not read the word in isolation we must consider it in light of its modifiers and the language of the rest of the statute.the meaning of a word or phrase can not be determined in isolation,but must be drawn from the context in which it is used.in re prop.damage,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the rest of the text of a a informs us that property subject to forfeiture may have been obtained by the defendant directly or indirectly to render it forfeitable under the statute.the subsection further reaches and is not limited to net gain or profit,and property traceable to the property that was obtained by the defendant as a result of the offense.this language evinces an intent to reach all manner of property in the defendant possession and fairly considered as derived from the crime of conviction.stated otherwise,so long as there is a causal nexus between the wrongdoer possession of the property and her crime,the property may be said to have been obtained by her indirectly as a result of her offense.
that the property may have been obtained indirectly and need only be traceable to or constitute the net gain from the crime suggests congress desire to encompass not only the very property that was unlawfully obtained.rather,the forfeiture statute envisions and tolerates some attenuation of the chain of events between the crime and the related property or gain it makes subject to forfeiture.
in addition,our case law eliminates any doubt about whether cash is among the types of property subject to forfeiture under this subsection.see united states kalish,cir upholding forfeiture order of million in cash united states uddin,cir finding forfeitable a sum of cash diverted from food stamp program.these holdings reflect a judicial view that in,congress intended to authorize disgorgement of gain,wherever gain fairly traceable to a wrong may be found.such gain is property obtained indirectly as a result of the commission of an offense,as well as net gain derived from such an offense.and when the property subject to a forfeiture order under is in the custody or possession of the defendant,and not a third party,concerns about traceability and nexus vanish.
we find unpersuasive torres argument that she did not obtain proceeds,but only retained or maintained funds,which,accordingly,were not subject to forfeiture.in support of this position,she points to the definition of proceeds used in the statute,c.there,as a constituent element of the substantive offense,proceeds is defined as any property derived from or obtained or retained,directly or indirectly,through some form of unlawful activity,including the gross receipts of such activity.id.emphasis supplied.torres places significant weight on this statute use of the word retained,in contrast to use only of obtained,arguing that this demonstrates that congress knew how to distinguish between property obtained and property retained,and that the omission of the word retained in precludes the interpretation we adopt here.making a similar point,torres contrasts with the forfeiture provision of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et,which requires forfeiture of any interest the defendant has acquired or maintained in violation of rico.id.at a emphasis supplied.
congress use of other formulations in other statutes not enacted in coordination with hardly compels us,however,to ignore the context and import of the language that it did use in we do not accept that the omission of retained or maintained from evinces a congressional intent not to reach property that is nonetheless traceable to and constitutes the net gain of the defendant fraud congress inclusion of the broadening and attenuating language just quoted,as well as its use of the modifier indirectly,easily offset the absence of the words retained and maintained from the statute.no more is required to support forfeiture under.
in a related but somewhat different vein,torres argues that the only benefit she received from her offense was the inchoate right to live in an apartment or let someone else live there at a reduced rent.this intangible benefit,she urges,did not constitute proceeds or property,and her related monetary savings should not be subject to forfeiture.in support,she cites united states hemingway,cr,a similar case in which the district court denied without written opinion the government request for a forfeiture order.at sentencing in hemingway,the court echoed torres position that the defendant had obtained only the intangible benefit of paying a rent,and no forfeitable asset was under the defendant control.
we disagree with an analysis that seeks to characterize torres unlawful gain as inchoate and therefore not subject to forfeiture.torres is not a circumstance in which the property interest of which the government seeks forfeiture is so intangible and unquantifiable that it could not fairly be considered proceeds subject to forfeiture.she took the right to live in subsidized property at a rate lower than others were required to pay,and in circumstances where the government did in fact pay the margin for her.hers is thus unlike the benefit derived by the defendant in united states genova,cir,which she also cites as authority.in genova,the court determined that the political capital obtained by the defendant from his scheme was not forfeitable even in principle because the defendant did not receive a penny and the amount lost from the scheme did not create a corresponding asset in his hands available for forfeiture.id.the property interest here,in contrast,is found in a discrete sum of money saved by torres,exactly corresponding to the reduction she was granted on her rent,and available for her use as a direct result of her fraud 
finally,torres cites our recent decision in united states contorinis,cir,in support of her additional argument that,because the payments that were the fruit of her wrong went directly to nycha from hud,she holds no proceeds subject to forfeiture.in contorinis,our court vacated a district court order requiring the defendant,who had been convicted of securities fraud,to forfeit million in profits that his fraudulent trading earned for the investment fund that employed him.the vacatur rested on the custody of the illegal profits in the hands of an innocent third party his employer.those funds,we held,were insufficiently subject to contorinis dominion and control to be forfeitable by contorinis.id.at.
our decision in contorinis,however,applied a different law to distinguishable facts.as a threshold matter,we applied a statutory definition of proceeds other than the definition governing torres case id.at applying a b.unlike the definition of proceeds applicable here,the definition at issue in contorinis does not contain the obtained indirectly,traceable thereto,or not limited to net gain or profit language that we find decisive here.and even were we to put aside these differences in statutory language,contorinis would not require vacatur here.in contorinis,we reasoned that,to be subject to forfeiture,the property must have,at some point,been under the defendant control or the control of his.id.at.because the profits subject to the challenged forfeiture order were earned by and paid to the employer fund,not contorinis,and because contorinis did not control disbursements of the fund profits,those total profits did not represent his own unlawful gain.we made clear,however,that contorinis own portion of those proceeds could eventually be subject to forfeiture,despite its payment first to an innocent p
