this sentencing appeal concerns the procedural issue of the standard of review for decisions applying the sentencing guidelines to this case a decision applying the guidelines grouping the substantive issue of whether two episodes of unlawful sexual activity by a prison guard with an inmate,occurring on separate days,should be included in a single group.these issues arise on an appeal by ricardo vasquez,formerly a federal prison guard,from the november,judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut alvin thompson,district judge.the judgment sentenced vasquez principally to months imprisonment after his plea of guilty to several counts charging sexual abuse of prisoners at the federal correctional institution at danbury,connecticut and one count of making a false statement.
although opinions from this circuit have used various formulations to describe the standard of review of decisions applying the guidelines to the facts of a case,we conclude,in light of buford united states,d,that the statutory requirement of due deference to the district court application of the guidelines to the facts,e supp.ii,requires us to select either de novo review or clearly erroneous review depending on the primary nature of the application determination at issue.we further conclude that de novo review is appropriate in the circumstances of this case and,applying that standard,that the district court decision not to group the sexual offenses against the same inmate that occurred on different days was correct.we therefore affirm.
background 
vasquez,while serving as a guard at,engaged in sexual activity with four female prisoners.he had sexual intercourse with one inmate on one occasion with a second inmate he had sexual intercourse on two consecutive days with a third inmate he had sexual intercourse on one occasion and a few days later caused her to perform fellatio on him and with a fourth inmate he engaged in repeated sexual touchings.the episode with the first inmate,each of the two episodes with the second inmate,and each of the two episodes with the third inmate were the subject of five separate counts of violating b,which is captioned sexual abuse of a minor or ward.the several episodes with the fourth inmate were the subject of one count of violating a,which is captioned abusive sexual contact.during the trial,vasquez pled guilty to the five counts of violating section b,the one count of violating section a,and one count of making a false statement in violating of a.
the guidelines calculation concerned only the section a count and the five section b counts because the section a offense is a class b misdemeanor maximum sentence of six months,see a,which is not subject to the guidelines,see.the presentence report psr recommended the base offense level of for the false statement count,see a,and the base offense level of for each of the five section b counts,see id.a.
then,pursuant to the grouping rules,id,the psr recommended that the section count and each of the five section b counts should be a separate group,see id,for a total of six groups.the psr further recommended a total offense level of,calculated by starting with,the highest offense level for any one of the six groups,see id,and adding one level for each of the five other groups,all of which were counted as a unit because they were equally serious and within four levels of the count with the highest offense level,see id.a.
the defendant contended that the two section b counts for sexual misconduct with the second inmate should have been included in one group,rather than two,and made the same argument with respect to the two section b counts for sexual misconduct with the third inmate.the district court rejected these claims,ruling that each episode of sexual misconduct with respect to the same victim on separate days was a separate harm for purposes of grouping.
the total offense level of yielded a sentencing range of months.the district court selected a punishment of months,and implemented the punishment by imposing months on the false statement count,which carried a maximum,months concurrently on each of the section b counts,which carried a maximum,and six months concurrently on the section a count,which carried a maximum.see id.c.
discussion 
we consider first the appropriate approach to selecting a standard of review,then the standard of review applicable to the determination on this appeal,and then the merits of the appellant claim of improper grouping.
selecting the standard of review 
it is well settled that upon review of a guidelines sentence the interpretation of a sentencing guideline is a question of law,subject to de novo review,see,united states napoli,cir,and that a sentencing judge finding of fact may not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous,see,united states woodard,cir.some uncertainty is encountered,however,in considering issues that are not easily categorized as issues of either fact or law.the most common problem concerns review of a sentencing judge application of a guideline to the facts.sometimes,what appears to be an application of a guideline is really an interpretation,as when a sentencing judge says,i think that guideline x means y,and i will therefore apply that meaning to facts a,b,and difficulties arise when the sentencing judge is not so precise and simply says,based on my interpretation of guideline x and the facts of this case,as i find them to be,i conclude that the guideline applies or is inapplicable.
congress endeavored to prescribe the standard of review for decisions applying the guidelines the court of appeals shall give due deference to the district court application of the guidelines to the facts.e.the supreme court has instructed that t he deference that is due depends on the nature of the question presented.koon united states,d ruling that abuse of discretion was proper standard for reviewing decision to depart from applicable sentencing range.that instruction is clear enough when the nature of the question is an issue of law,to which de novo review applies,and when the nature of the question is factual,to which the clearly erroneous standard applies,but the instruction does not provide guidance when the issue is whether the sentencing judge has properly applied a guideline to the facts.
our court has used five different formulations in articulating the standard of review of an application of a guideline to the facts.
a de novo.in a long series of decisions we have said that we review a district court interpretation and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo,united states santiago,cir luis santiago emphasis added.see,united states smythe,cir same united states maaraki,cir same united states szur,cir same.with one exception all of our decisions stating the de novo standard can be traced back through a series of citations to a decision that did not state a de novo standard,but instead merely set forth the statutory standard of giving due deference to the district court application of the guidelines to the facts,e.see united states deutsch,cir.the chain of citations back to deutsch is set out in the margin 
b abuse of discretion.another line of decisions states that the standard is abuse of discretion.this standard was recently stated in united states ravelo,cir we review the application of the guidelines to the district court findings for abuse of discretion unless the application presents a purely legal question,in which case we employ a de novo standard of review.and in united states coriaty,cir w e will not overturn the court application of the guidelines to the facts before it unless we conclude that there has been an abuse of discretion.ravelo and coriaty cite united states deming,cir same,which cites united states,cir same,which cites united states santiago,cir alvin santiago same.alvin santiago provides no citation for its statement of an abuse of discretion standard 
c clearly erroneous.one decision stated the standard to be clearly erroneous review.see united states lanese,cir the determination of the application of a sentencing guideline is a question of fact,entitled to the clearly erroneous standard of review.
d due deference.several decisions have stated the standard simply by using the due deference language of the statute,without further explication.see,united states lenoci,cir united states huerta,cir united states reis,cir.
e either de novo or clearly erroneous.in another line of decisions,the statutory due deference standard has been amplified by explaining that the standard of review should be either de novo or clearly erroneous,depending on the nature of the application determination being reviewed the de novo standard is used where the district court application of a guideline approaches a purely legal question,see deming,at united states medina,cir united states brumby,cir,and the clearly erroneous standard is used where the district court determination resembles a finding of fact,united states james,cir united states vazzano,cir see also united states stroud,cir applying de novo standard where the issue turns primarily on the legal interpretation of a guideline term.we will refer to this approach as the approach to selecting an appropriate standard of review.
the other circuits have also used a variety of formulations to express the standard of review of a decision applying a sentencing guideline to the facts.see,united states mariano,cir we have interpreted section e as requiring,in most instances,that the court of appeals review a trial court application of a sentencing guideline to the facts for clear error.united states morrison,cir questions of law,however,such as the appropriate application of this guideline to a particular set of facts,are subject to de novo review.united states stokley,cir on mixed questions of fact and law,there is no standard but rather a sliding scale depending on the mix of the mixed question.
at oral argument,the government advocated a distinct level of review for decisions applying a fourth standard somewhere between de novo and clearly erroneous yet different from abuse of discretion.the defendant urges us to apply a de novo standard.
in trying to identify the meaning of due deference in section e,we start,of course,with the statute itself.the due deference provision was added in to the sentencing reform act of sra,title ii,ch.ii,stat,by section a of the abuse act of adaa,stat,the adaa also renumbered former subsection d as subsection e,see,a.the text of the due deference provision creates the ambiguity we have documented in the range of appellate opinions construing it,and we therefore look for any clues in the legislative history.
unfortunately,we have not located any authoritative legislative history of the due deference provision.the provision originated in a draft bill presented by the department of justice at a hearing of the senate judiciary committee on october.see sentencing commission guidelines,hearing before the committee on the judiciary,united states senate,serial no,cong,sess,statement of william weld,criminal division.the due deference provision was incorporated into,sess,which was passed by the senate on october,cong.rec.daily ed,apparently in an attempt to precede the november,effective date of the guidelines.however,the appellate review section of,including the due deference provision,was dropped in a conference,see cong.rec.daily ed,and was not included in the enacted bill,stat.
in the next session of the congress,the due deference provision was contained in section of title iii of the proposed minor and technical criminal law amendments act of,sess.we have located no committee report on this act.in explaining the act to the senate,senator byrd introduced a analysis,which states that section provides that a district court resolution of a mixed question of law and fact is entitled to due deference.cong.rec.daily ed.june.although the analysis does not explain what was meant by due deference,it makes clear that an intermediate standard,between de novo and clearly erroneous review was expected 
it is logical to establish different standards of appellate review for questions of law,questions of fact,and mixed questions of law and fact.consider,for example,the case of a defendant who struck his victim,causing a laceration.the district court finding that ten stitches were required to close the victim wound is a purely factual determination that would not be disturbed by the court of appeals unless it were clearly erroneous.
the district court finding that a serious bodily injury results in a four level increase in the defendant offense level under the guidelines is a purely legal determination which,if incorrect,would be corrected by the court of appeals if it results in an inapplicable sentencing guideline range.
mixed questions of law and fact should be subject to an intermediate standard of review.thus,the district court determination that ten stitches constitutes serious bodily injury under the particular circumstances of this case would be entitled to due deference from the court of appeals.
the due deference provision also appeared in section a of the omnibus act of,sess,considered by the house later in.when this act was considered in the house,a analysis was presented,apparently by congressman conyers,which differs slightly from the analysis presented to the senate.the analysis of section a indicates not only that the due deference standard is between de novo and clearly erroneous review,but also suggests that the standard is a continuum of degrees of review 
when an aggrieved party appeals a sentence alleging a misapplication of the guidelines,that the sentence is the result of an incorrect application of the guidelines,the standard the court of appeals is to apply when reviewing that sentence depends on the nature of the alleged misapplication of the guidelines.the appellate court must accept a district court finding of fact unless the finding is clearly erroneous.the court of appeals will scrutinize more closely a district court determination of a legal question,applying a de novo standard.
not every alleged misapplication of the guidelines will involve a finding of fact,however.application of the guidelines involves a number of subjective determinations.for example,section of the sentencing guidelines requires the district court to increase a defendant offense level by levels if the defendant knew or should have known that the victim of the offense was unusually vulnerable due to age,or physical or mental condition.although there may be a factual element to making such a determination,such as the victim exact age or what if any physical ailment the victim had,the overall determination is not an objective finding of fact.making the subjective determination required by section whether the victim was unusually vulnerable,unlike resolving purely factural sic questions,is not uniquely within the district court expertise.the clearly erroneous standard,therefore,would be inappropriate.
on the other hand,because a determination under section of the sentencing guidelines depends heavily on the unique factual pattern of the case,that determination can not be considered simply a legal question.section recognizes the importance of the district court role in fact determinations by instructing the court of appeals to give due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.the de novo standard,therefore,is also inappropriate.
section a amends d to require the court of appeals to give due deference to the district court application of the guidelines to the facts.this standard is intended to give the court of appeals flexibility in reviewing an application of a guideline standard that involves some subjectivity.the deference due a district court determination will depend upon the relationship of the facts found to the guideline standard being applied.if the particular determination involved closely resembles a finding of fact,the court of appeals would apply a clearly erroneous test.as the determination approaches a purely legal determination,however,the court of appeals would review the determination more closely.
cong.rec.daily ed,footnotes omitted emphases added alteration in original.
initially,we note our uncertainty as to what these excerpts from the two analyses mean.they purport to identify an intermediate standard of review without describing it or relating it to any particular level of scrutiny,such as abuse of discretion.the second analysis recommends a clearly erroneous standard for determinations that are not exactly issues of fact but only resemble such issues.as to determinations that are not exactly issues of law but only approach such issues,it recommends review more closely than the clearly erroneous standard.we also note that these analyses are not authored by either the relevant house or senate committee,but appear to be staff analyses that,while sometimes helpful,especially when appended to the report of the pertinent committee,do not necessarily represent the collective view of the congress that ultimately enacted the due deference provision as section a of the adaa.
we deem the explanations in these analyses too metaphysical to be useful.a sentencing judge application of a guideline might involve primarily a determination of an issue of fact or primarily a determination of an issue of law,but we see little utility in inquiring whether the determination resembles an issue of fact or approaches an issue of law,and even less utility in calibrating review standards so finely that review of a determination that approaches an issue of law will be done more closely than review under the clearly erroneous standard.fortunately the supreme court has provided us with a sounder basis for understanding the meaning of due deference in section e.
the supreme court has thus far considered the due deference language of section e on only two occasions.in the court first encounter with section e in koon,as we have already noted,the court merely instructed that the deference that is due to a district court application of a guideline to the facts depends on the nature of the question presented.koon,at.the question presented in koon concerned a departure,a discretionary determination peculiar to the sentencing guidelines and not an example of the recurring issue of applying a guideline to facts.the court concluded,not surprisingly,that the appropriate standard of review of a discretionary departure determination at that time was abuse of discretion.see id.at.
the court second consideration of section e is far more pertinent to our pending appeal.in buford united states,d,the ultimate issue was whether the defendant was subject to the enhanced punishment that the guidelines specify for a career offender,see,a classification applicable to a defendant with two or more convictions for violent or felonies,id.a.the guidelines specify that related felony convictions count as one for purposes of the career offender guideline.see id.c incorporating related test of subsection a.application note to subsection further specifies that convictions are related if they were consolidated for sentencing.id.the seventh circuit,in which buford arose,had previously ruled that prior convictions not formally consolidated for sentencing are nonetheless to be considered related for purposes of subsection c if they have been functionally consolidated,united states joseph,cir.the precise issue in buford was whether two prior convictions were functionally consolidated under the seventh circuit gloss on application note.the district court had ruled that they were.see buford,at.
viewing this issue as an example of the sort of question to which section e requires due deference to the district court application of a guideline to the facts,buford,at,the supreme court ruled that the seventh circuit was right to review this trial court decision deferentially rather than de novo,id.at.although the quoted words and the balance of the court opinion make clear that the proper standard is not the de novo standard,the opinion does not explicitly state what is meant by deferential review.nevertheless,there can be no doubt that the court meant deferential review to be review under the clearly erroneous standard.
first,the court explained that it had granted review in buford because of the different approaches the courts of appeals had taken to the proper standard for reviewing a determination of whether convictions were related and described the two approaches as review for clear error and review de novo.buford,at.collecting courts of appeals cases.second,and more significantly,the decision of the seventh circuit,which the supreme court affirmed,had applied the clearly erroneous standard,see buford,at t he district court conclusion that buford state cases were not functionally consolidated for sentencing can not be called clearly erroneous.
in affirming the use of the clearly erroneous standard to the determination of relatedness in buford,however,the supreme court made it clear that it was not endorsing that standard for review of all determinations applying a guideline to facts.after noting that the facts concerning relatedness were not disputed and that the issue was,in a sense,legal,justice breyer,writing for a unanimous court,provided this critical explanation 
the legal question at issue is a minor,detailed,interstitial question of sentencing law,buried in a judicial interpretation of an application note to a sentencing guideline.that question is not a generally recurring,purely legal matter,such as interpreting a set of legal words,say,those of an individual guideline,in order to determine their basic intent.nor is that question readily resolved by reference to general legal principles and standards alone.rather,the question at issue grows out of,and is bounded by,detailed factual circumstances.
buford,at.emphasis added.
this passage confirms the correctness of our use of an approach to the standard of review of application determinations,as exemplified in our prior decisions in deming,medina,brumby james,vazzano,and stroud.although one of these decisions cited the analysis of the adaa presented to the house,see stroud,at,all of them wisely avoided the vagaries of the staff analyses and ended up,in a straightforward manner,interpreting due deference to mean de novo review of determinations that primarily involve issues of law and to mean clearly erroneous review of determinations that primarily involve issues of fact.buford refines this approach by making clear that even a nominally legal issue might be so bounded by,detailed factual circumstances,at,as to warrant clearly erroneous review.
the approach to review of guideline application determinations calls to mind the thoughtful analysis of former judge william norris,explicating for the in banc ninth circuit the appropriate standard of review for determination of a mixed question of fact and law see united states mcconney,cir in banc.recognizing that a mixed question of fact and law concerns the application of a legal standard to facts,see id.at citing swint,d,judge norris outlined the following approach 
if application of the rule of law to the facts requires an inquiry that is essentially factual,at.that is founded on the application of the tribunal experience with the mainsprings of human conduct,commissioner duberstein,d the concerns of judicial administration will favor the district court,and the district court determination should be classified as one of fact reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard.if,on the other hand,the question requires us to consider legal concepts in the mix of fact and law and to exercise judgment about the values that animate legal principles,then the concerns of judicial administration will favor the appellate court,and the question should be classified as one of law and reviewed de novo.
id.at.judge norris added that usually the application of law to fact will require the consideration of legal concepts and involve the exercise of judgment about the values underlying legal principles.id.
the application of a sentencing guideline to facts is a classic illustration of the mixed question of fact and law,or more precisely an instance of the general task of applying a rule of law to facts.the ninth circuit approach to that general task foreshadowed the supreme court similar approach in buford to the more particularize
