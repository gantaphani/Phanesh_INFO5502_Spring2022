saul dos reis appeals from a sentence entered in the united states district court for the district of connecticut underhill.
dos reis pled guilty to two counts of interstate travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity,in violation of b.pursuant to the united states sentencing guidelines,the court upwardly departed and sentenced dos reis to consecutive terms of and months imprisonment,representing the statutory maximum on both counts,for a total term of months imprisonment.
on appeal,dos reis argues that the district court erred in departing upwardly and sentencing him to the statutory maximum on count i based on conduct alleged in count ii and the extent of the departure impermissibly the victim age,and,alternatively,was unreasonable.
we conclude that the district court did not commit plain error by upwardly departing and imposing the statutory maximum on count because we review this challenge only for plain error,we address,but do not resolve,the unsettled issue of whether total punishment under d which allows consecutive sentencing in multiple count cases includes an upward departure based on conduct relating to only one count of conviction.although dos reis sentence is more than triple the upper limit of the guidelines range of months,we hold that the district court did not double count and that the extent of the departure was not unreasonable.
thus,we affirm the sentence in all respects.
background 
in,dos reis met jane doe in an internet chat room.dos reis wrote that he was,when in fact he was.after several weeks of communication,dos reis traveled from his workplace in portchester,new york,to jane doe home in prospect,connecticut,where they engaged in consensual sexual intercourse.after this encounter,they met twice more to engage in sexual intercourse.
in,dos reis met christina over the internet in a similar fashion.christina was years and months old,but she said she was.dos reis was now years old and married,yet he told christina that he was.within one week of meeting over the internet,they met in person at a shopping mall in danbury,connecticut,and rented a motel room,where they engaged in sexual intercourse.
when they met again at the mall the following week,dos reis drove christina to a nearby parking lot where they engaged in sexual intercourse in his car.christina died during intercourse.forensic analysis showed ligature marks on her neck.
at sentencing,dos reis claimed that christina asked to be strangled,ostensibly to create an asphyxia high.in his sentencing memorandum,dos reis claimed that christina herself tied a seatbelt around her neck and asked him to tighten it to produce the desired effect.finding that the seatbelt hurt and worried that it might leave a mark,she then showed him how to grip her neck and how to squeeze and loosen his grip.dos reis proceeded to use his hands on her neck to create the supposedly desired asphyxia.when christina appeared to be in trouble,dos reis asserts that he thought she was kidding around.christina,however,soon became unresponsive.dos reis unsuccessfully attempted resuscitation,tasting blood in her mouth.
the events following her death are undisputed.dos reis left christina body in a stream and discarded her personal belongings in a gas station dumpster.the next day,in an effort to concoct an alibi,dos reis sent a to christina,asking her about a date that she supposedly had with another man the previous night.
procedural history 
dos reis was charged in both state and federal court for the crimes associated with christina death as well as his sexual encounters with jane doe.in state court,dos reis pled guilty to statutory rape and entered an alford plea to a charge of manslaughter in connection with the crimes he committed against christina.a year later,dos reis was sentenced in the connecticut superior court to years imprisonment.
in federal court,dos reis pled guilty to two counts of interstate travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity,in violation of b.count i alleged his sexual abuse of jane doe in count ii concerned his sexual abuse of christina in.
the presentence report psr separated the two counts into two groups under because they involved separate victims.the offense level for each group was determined to be predicated on a base offense level of under a plus an additional levels for misrepresentation of identity and an additional levels for using the internet.next,the combined adjusted offense level was set at based on calculating units from separating the groups and adding levels to the group with the highest offense level under.from a combined adjusted offense level of,the psr recommended a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.accordingly,the single,combined offense level totaled,resulting in a sentencing range of months imprisonment.
prior to his federal sentencing,the government sought a denial of the reduction for acceptance of responsibility an upward criminal history departure and an upward offense level departure based on christina death.dos reis,in turn,requested an offense level reduction for his acceptance of responsibility,and he opposed both of the government motions for upward departures.
at sentencing,the court granted a reduction for dos reis acceptance of responsibility and adopted the psr suggested combined offense level of and sentencing range of months.
citing,the court also granted the government motion for an upward departure based on christina death.the court found that dos reis knowingly risked christina death because s trangling is an inherently dangerous activity.noting that it would have been impossible for dos reis not to know that he was risking either death or serious physical harm to christina at the time that he applied that pressure to her neck,the court stated that w hether or not,therefore,it was an accident does matter.the court then analogized the crime to felony murder under,concluding that t here no dispute whatsoever that the death occurred during the commission of the offense at issue,that is sexual abuse.
in considering the extent of the departure,the court reasoned that christina young age not only makes the conduct more reprehensible but also increases the risk of death or serious harm from the conduct of choking or applying pressure to the neck.the court also noted that dos reis disposal of the body and fabrication of an alibi were factors that suggest a serious offense and suggest a more severe increase under the violations of.
the court upwardly departed to offense level to the offense level of felony murder under would have warranted a term of life imprisonment.however,the court noted that it was not permissible to depart that far because the statutory maximum for the offenses limited the extent of departure to years.citing,which governs sentences imposed in cases involving multiple counts,the court imposed consecutive sentences of and months imprisonment on counts i and ii,respectively,the statutory maximum on each count 
in its written judgment,the court did not list any factors in support of its upward departure.upon motion by the government,however,the court amended its judgment and listed the following reasons the offense level substantially understated the seriousness of the crime christina death was knowingly risked and merited a substantial increase under and dos reis conduct was analogous to felony murder.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
dos reis does not contest the district court decision to depart upwardly under.he does,however,challenge the procedure used to calculate the total sentence and the magnitude of the upward departure.dos reis argues that the district court erred in departing upwardly and in sentencing him to the statutory maximum on count i based on conduct occurring in connection with count ii and the extent of the departure impermissibly the victim age,and,alternatively,was unreasonable.we address each contention in turn.
statutory maximum sentence on count i 
the district court upwardly departed on count i involving jane doe from the combined guidelines sentencing range of months imprisonment based on christina death,as alleged in count ii.to come as close as possible to a sente
