background 
we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.united states díaz,cir.according to trial testimony,reyes operated a drug trafficking organization from through.reyes had an agreement with josé alberto martínez to sell cocaine and heroin at various drug points in southern puerto rico,including santa isabel,coamo,el pastillo,and salinas.one of reyes employees,carlos rubert,controlled the organization daily operations.
the government presented testimony that reyes was motivated to murder martínez in the summer of out of fear that martínez might murder him or that martínez nephews might take over reyes drug points if was infected with the hiv died.reyes and rubert met with daniel danny el gordo sánchez and josé josé el mellao medina approximately three times to plan martínez murder.in exchange for killing martínez,reyes and rubert agreed to give medina kilogram of heroin and to pay the four individuals a total of.
on june,sánchez and medina,along with two recruits roberto blackie báez and josé hershey rivera,drove to martínez santa isabel home.medina and rivera changed into black uniforms resembling the puerto rico police department saturation unit uniform and entered martínez house through a door in the garage,claiming they were police officers.after entering,medina and rivera fired handguns at martínez times,striking him twelve times.martínez died in a hospital at approximately on june.
on the afternoon of martínez death,rubert contacted sánchez on reyes behalf he requested a meeting between reyes,rubert,sánchez,and medina.at the meeting,the appellant gave medina the promised heroin and gave cash to medina and sánchez.reyes promised to give them the balance later.
after martínez death,reyes assumed control of martínez heroin drug points,and in,he gave martínez cocaine drug points to rubert.reyes continued to operate the heroin drug points until his arrest,selling between and bags of heroin per week at each drug point.

ii.analysis 
motion to dismiss 
reyes asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss.prior to trial,reyes moved to dismiss the indictment he contended that josé galiani testified falsely before the grand jury when stating that reyes had admitted to killing martínez and that the prosecutor should have known the testimony was false.consequently,reyes argued,the indictment was the product of perjured testimony.
reyes argument relies primarily on galiani testimonial reference to an inaudible audio recording.galiani stated he had made an of reyes admitting to galiani his involvement in martínez killing.although the defense repeatedly requested the tape in discovery,the government never produced an audible copy.this led reyes to conclude that either galiani lied about the tape or the prosecution improperly elicited testimony about the tape because it should have known the tape was inaudible.in response to reyes motion to dismiss,the prosecution stated that the tape had audibility problems and was sent to be enhanced after the indictment return.although the tape recording remained difficult to understand even after the enhancement,reyes was permitted to listen to and review the tape.
we review the district court refusal to dismiss the indictment for abuse of discretion.united states maceo,cir.we review any challenges based on prosecutorial misconduct before the grand jury under a standard.bank of nova scotia united states,d.under the standard,we will reverse only if it is established that the violation substantially influenced the grand jury decision to indict,or if there is grave doubt that the decision to indict was free from the substantial influence of such violations.id.at quoting united states mechanik,d united states,cir stating that e rrors before the grand jury warrant dismissal of an indictment only if such errors prejudiced the defendants quotation marks and citation omitted.
all but the most serious errors before the grand jury are rendered harmless by a conviction at trial.mechanik,at.only a defect so fundamental that it causes the grand jury no longer to be a grand jury,or the indictment no longer to be an indictment,gives rise to the constitutional right not to be tried.midland asphalt united states,d.
we adjudge the alleged error before the grand jury harmless.here,a petit jury convicted reyes after a trial.the petit jury verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt demonstrates a fortiori that there was probable cause to charge the defendant with the offenses for which he was convicted.united states,cir quoting mechanik,at.
reyes has failed to establish galiani testimony to the grand jury was actually false or that the government was aware it was false.the fact that the government failed to produce an audible recording was not proof that galiani committed perjury before the grand jury and that the prosecutor was aware that it was perjured testimony.the tape was produced,but remained inaudible in part after enhancement.without more,we can not find that there was prosecutorial misconduct that biased the grand jury in performing its function.see maceo,at.
further,the district court alleged failure to dismiss following galiani grand jury testimony did not prejudice reyes because the grand jury heard other substantial evidence of reyes involvement in drug trafficking and martínez murder.see maceo,at affirming the district court decision not to dismiss an indictment without deciding whether the grand jury witness challenged statement constituted perjury because there was other competent and material evidence to sustain the charge issued.sánchez and rubert testified to reyes involvement in drug trafficking.sergeant reinaldo rosado testified as to rubert admission that reyes was involved in drug trafficking and the death of martínez,and he testified as to reyes admission that he was involved in drug trafficking.the prosecutor also presented an exculpatory statement made by reyes to sergeant rosado in which reyes said he was not involved in martínez murder.
reyes contends that the testimony of the other government witnesses was insufficient to support the indictment because the testimony was inconsistent regarding the details of reyes participation in martínez death.for example,reyes contends that sánchez testimony contradicted that of rubert and rivera regarding the number of meetings and the way the payments were to be made for the murder,and that rivera and rubert contradicted testimony they had given previously concerning details of the murder contract.
reyes alleged errors are rendered harmless because 
a n indictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand jury,if valid on its face,is enough to call for trial of the charge on its merits.a court should not inquire into the sufficiency of the evidence before the indicting grand jury,because the grand jury proceeding is merely a preliminary phase and all constitutional protections are afforded at trial.
