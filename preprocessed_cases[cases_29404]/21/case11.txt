petitioner robers was convicted of a federal crime for submitting fraudulent mortgage loan applications to two banks.on appeal,he argued that the district court had miscalculated his restitution obligation under the mandatory victims restitution act of,a provision of which requires property crime offenders to pay an amount equal to the value of the property less the value as of the date the property is returned of any part of the property that is returned,b b.the district court had ordered robers to pay the difference between the amount lent to him and the amount the banks received in selling the houses that had served as collateral for the loans.robers claimed that the district court should have instead reduced the restitution amount by the value of the houses on the date the banks took title to them since that was when part of the property was returned.the seventh circuit rejected robers argument.
held the phrase any part of the property returned refers to the property the banks lost,namely,the money they lent to robers,and not to the collateral the banks received,namely,the houses.read naturally,the words the property,which appear seven times in b,refer to the property that was lost as a result of the crime,here,the money.because g enerally,identical words used in different parts of the same statute are presumed to have the same meaning,merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith dabit,quoting ibp,alvarez,the property returned must also be the property lost as a result of the crime.any awkwardness or redundancy that comes from substituting an amount of money for the words the property is the linguistic price paid for having a single statutory provision that covers different kinds of property.since valuing money is easier than valuing other types of property,the natural reading also facilitates the statute administration.
robers contrary arguments are unconvincing.first,other provisions of the statute,see,f,a,seem to give courts adequate authority to avoid robers false dichotomy of having to choose between refusing to award restitution and requiring the offender to pay the full amount lent where a victim has not sold the collateral by the time of sentencing.second,for purposes of the statute requirement,see a,e,normal market fluctuations do not break the causal chain between the offender fraud and the losses incurred by the victim.third,even assuming that the return of collateral compensates lenders for their losses under state mortgage law,the issue here is whether the statutory provision,which does not purport to track state mortgage law,requires that collateral received be valued at the time the victim received it.finally,the rule of lenity does not apply here.see muscarello united states.

benjamin robers,petitioner united states 
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
the mandatory victims restitution act of requires certain offenders to restore property lost by their victims as a result of the crime.a provision in the statue says that,when return of the property lost by the victim is impossible,impracticable,or inadequate,the offender must pay the victim an amount equal to the value of the property less the value as of the date the property is returned of any part of the property that is returned.b b.the question before us is whether any part of the property is returned when a victim takes title to collateral securing a loan that an offender fraudulently obtained from the victim.
we hold that it is not.in our view,the statutory phrase any part of the property refers only to the specific property lost by a victim,which,in the case of a fraudulently obtained loan,is the money lent.therefore,no part of the property is returned to the victim until the collateral is sold and the victim receives money from the sale.the import of our holding is that a sentencing court must reduce the restitution amount by the amount of money the victim received in selling the collateral,not the value of the collateral when the victim received it.
the relevant facts,as simplified,are the following in petitioner benjamin robers,acting as a straw buyer,submitted fraudulent loan applications to two banks.the banks lent robers about for the purchase of two houses,upon which the banks took mortgages.when robers failed to make loan payments,the banks foreclosed on the mortgages.in they took title to the two houses.in they sold one house for about.and in they sold the other house for about.the sales took place in a falling real estate market.
in robers was convicted in federal court of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.see.he was sentenced to three years of probation.and the court ordered him to pay restitution of about,roughly the the banks lent to robers less the the banks received from the sale of the two houses minus certain expenses incurred in selling them.
on appeal robers argued that the sentencing court had miscalculated his restitution obligation.in his view,part of the property was returned to the banks when they took title to the houses.and,since the statute says that returned property shall be valued as of the date the property is returned,the sentencing court should have reduced the restitution amount by more than was what the banks received from the sale of the houses,but since the banks sold the houses in a falling real estate market,the houses had been worth more when the banks took title to them.
the court of appeals rejected robers argument.and,because different circuits have come to different conclusions about this kind of matter,we granted robers petition for certiorari.compare,at case below restitution obligation reduced by money received from sale of collateral,with united states yeung,restitution obligation reduced by value of collateral at time lender took title.
in our view,the phrase any part of the property returned refers to the property the banks lost,namely,the money they lent to robers,and not to the collateral the banks received,namely,the two houses.for one thing,that is what the statute says.the phrase is part of a long sentence that reads as follows 
b the order of restitution shall require that the defendant 
in the case of an offense resulting in damage to or loss or destruction of property of a victim of the offense 
a return the property to the owner of the property or 
b if return of the property under subparagraph a is impossible,impracticable,or inadequate,pay an amount equal to 
i the greater of 
i the value of the property on the date of the damage,loss,or destruction or 
ii the value of the property on the date of sentencing,less 
ii the value as of the date the property is returned of any part of the property that is returned emphasis added.
the words the property appear seven times in this sentence.if read naturally,they refer to the property that was damage d,los t,or destr oyed as a result of the crime.b.generally,identical words used in different parts of the same statute are presumed to have the same meaning.merrill lynch,pierce,fenner smith dabit,quoting ibp,alvarez.and,if the property that was damage d,los t,or destr oyed was the money,then the property returned must also be the money.money being fungible,however,see,ransom fia card services,slip,at sabri united states,the property returned need not be the very same bills or checks.
we concede that substituting an amount of money,say,for the words the property will sometimes seem awkward or unnecessary as,for example 
i f return of is impossible,pay an amount equal to the greater of the value of on the date of the loss or the value of on the date of sentencing b b.
but any such awkwardness or re
